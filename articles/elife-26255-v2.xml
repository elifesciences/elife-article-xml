Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data, and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%) and other significant locus effects (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26255.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microorganisms live in most parts of our body, including the inside of our nose. Most of the microbes are harmless and can even be beneficial to our health. However, some microbes can cause diseases – although they often go unnoticed, as our immune system can remove them before we show any symptoms. For example, the bacterium <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> can cause diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis, but generally, it lives harmlessly in the nose, and is particularly common in children and the elderly.</p><p>The longer the bacteria live in the nose before being killed by the immune system, the more likely they are to be transmitted to another person. The amount of time it takes for the immune system to clear the bacteria depends on various factors, such as the age of the person or the bacterium’s defense mechanism and its genetic material. A particularly important aspect is to what subtype, also known as serotype, a bacterium belongs to, which is characterized by differences in the structure of the sugar coating that surrounds the microbe. However, until now, it was not known how much each of these factors contributes.</p><p>Now, Lees et al. have developed a mathematical model to calculate how long the bacteria are carried in the nose before they are cleared away, and compared it with the genomic data of the bacteria. For this, over 14,000 nose swabs from almost 600 children were collected over a two-year period. In their model, Lees et al. calculated that the bacteria’s genetics explained over 60% of the variability in survival time. They also found that the serotype was the most important individual factor that influenced how long a bacterium could survive. The age of the child was less important and only accounted for 5%. In addition, Lees et al. also found that when viruses infected some <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, the bacteria died sooner.</p><p>A next step will be to confirm the effect of a viral infection on the bacteria’s survival time in a controlled model system, and also replicate the findings in separate population study.Understanding how long people can carry bacteria and transmit them to others may help to develop new vaccination or treatment strategies to control infections. Moreover, the discovery that viruses can negatively affect how long a bacterium lives, could motivate studies to investigate these findings further.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic></kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>carriage duration</kwd><kwd>epidemiology</kwd><kwd>heritability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lees</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name><name><surname>Parkhill</surname><given-names>Julian</given-names></name><name><surname>Bentley</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1365620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lees</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104169/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Croucher</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104169/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Croucher</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>083735/Z/07/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequence changes in the pneumococcal genome explain most of the variability in duration of asymptomatic carriage with serotype, antibiotic resistance and prophage accounting for the largest effects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a human pathogen that can cause diseases such as pneumonia, otitis media and meningitis. Pneumococcal disease burden is highest in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Brien et al., 2009</xref>). For disease to be caused pneumococci must first transmit to the host, colonise the nasopharynx and finally cross into a normally sterile site. The pneumococcus spends most of the transmission cycle in the nasopharynx, and so understanding and predicting the amount of time spent in this niche is critical for understanding this bacterium's epidemiology, and therefore controlling transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullahi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melegaro et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The nasopharynx is a complex niche in which each pneumococcal genotype must tackle a wide range of factors including host immune defence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCool et al., 2002</xref>), other bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pericone et al., 2000</xref>), and other pneumococcal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auranen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobey and Lipsitch, 2012</xref>) in order to maintain the genotype's population. The average nasopharyngeal duration period is therefore affected by a large number of factors, which may, themselves, interact.</p><p>One factor that is known to strongly associate with carriage duration is serotype: as capsular polysaccharides are important in bacterial physiology and determining host immune response, different serotypes have different clearance and acquisition rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullahi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Högberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Melegaro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turner et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, a range of other proteins have been identified as critical to the colonisation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kadioglu et al., 2008</xref>), some of which exhibit similar levels of diversity to the capsule polysaccharide synthesis locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iannelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jedrzejas et al., 2001</xref>). However, the overall and relative contributions of these sequence variations to carriage rate have not yet been characterised. In addition variation of pathogen protein sequence, accessory genes and interaction effects between genetic elements may also have as yet unknown effects on carriage duration.</p><p>Changes in average carriage duration have been shown to be linked with recombination rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaguza et al., 2016</xref>), which has been found to correlate with antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanage et al., 2009</xref>) and invasive potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaguza et al., 2016</xref>). The carriage duration by different serotypes is widely used in models of pneumococcal epidemiology, and consequently is important in evaluating the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melegaro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weinberger et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, modelling work has proposed that if alleles exist which alter carriage duration, these explain the long standing puzzle of how antibiotic-resistant and sensitive strains stably coexist in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lehtinen et al., 2017</xref>). Measurement of carriage duration and the analysis of its variance beyond the resolution of serotype will have important consequences for these models.</p><p>We sought to determine the overall importance of the pathogen genotype in carriage duration in a human population, and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration. By combining epidemiological modelling of longitudinal swab data with and genome wide association study methods on the connected sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we made heritability estimates for carriage duration. We further partitioned the heritability into contributions from lineage and locus effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Earle et al., 2016</xref>) to quantify the variation caused by each individual factor.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26255.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Swabbing and sequencing study design.</title><p>We start with serotype swab data on 598 children from two cohorts, taken every month after birth for two years.

We matched carriage episodes with resistance and genomic data for 2157 episodes to draw conclusions on the basis of variation in this epidemiological parameter.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26255-fig1-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ascertainment of carriage episode duration using epidemiological modelling</title><p>We first estimated carriage duration from longitudinal swab data available for the study population. For 598 unvaccinated children up to 24 swabs taken over a two year period were available, an extension on the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turner et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2013a</xref>). We only considered swabs from infants in the study, as mothers did not have sufficient sampling resolution relative to their average length of carriage to determine carriage duration. Furthermore, the immune response of mothers to bacterial pathogens is different to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maródi, 2006</xref>), leading to shorter carriage durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gritzfeld et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To estimate carriage duration from the longitudinal swab data we constructed a set of hidden Markov models (HMMs) with hidden states corresponding to whether a child was carrying a serotype at a given time point, and observed states corresponding to whether a positive swab was observed for this serotype at this time point.</p><p>The most general model for the swab data would be a vector with an entry of 0 or 1 for every possible serotype (of 56 observed in the population), corresponding to whether each serotype was observed in the swab at each time point. However, the number of parameters to estimate in this model (with over 6 million states) is much larger than the number of data points (around 14000), and in particular some serotypes have very few positive observations. Instead, we modelled each serotype separately.</p><p>The models fitted, and their permitted transitions and emissions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In model one, observation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> emits state 2 if positively swabbed for the serotype, and state 1 otherwise. The unobserved states correspond to the child ‘carrying’ and being ‘clear’ of the serotype respectively. We assume swabs have a specificity of one, so do not show positive culture when the child is clear of the carried serotype; we therefore set the coefficient for the chance of observing positive culture when no bacteria are present to zero (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mn>21</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the emission matrix). Model two adds a third state of ‘multiple carriage’ which is occupied when the serotype and at least one other are being carried. Both models were compared with a version which allows the parameters to covary with whether the child has carried pneumococcus previously. Model three accounts for this explicitly by having separate states and emissions based on whether carriage has previously been observed.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26255.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hidden Markov models of swab time series, and their goodness-of-fit.</title><p>We fitted three different models to the processed time-series data with states, allowed transitions and emissions as shown. We refitted each model allowing the transitions probabilities to covary with the age of the child and whether the child had carried pneumococcus previously. For the converged model the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is shown for the original fit, and when including these covariates (AICcovar).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26255-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>We applied all the models to 19F carriage episodes, as these had the most data available, and calculated the Akaike information criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akaike, 1974</xref>) for each model that converged. Only the simplest model (model one) converged, as judged by having a positive-definite Hessian and a converged BOBYQA run. The more complex models had lower log-likelihoods: as extensions of the simpler model they should have higher log-likelihoods, so this results was not consistent with model convergence. We tried fitting models two and three using a fixed false positive values slightly greater than zero, this lead to better log-likelihoods, but the models still didn’t converge. This failure of the more complex models is probably because most children in the study immediately enter the carrying state, and episodes of dual carriage (when split up by serotype) are rare. Therefore there were not enough events between these carriage states to estimate to the transition and emission intensities, without sensitivity to initial conditions during the fitting.</p><p>We then fitted the best performing model in this test for all serotypes separately. 6A and 6C were treated as a single serotype, as they were not always distinguished in the course of the study. The models for 19F, 23F, 6A/C, 6B, 14 and non-typable (NT) converged, but other serotypes did not have enough observations to successfully fit the parameters of the model. For these less prevalent serotypes we used the transition and emission parameters from the 19F model fitted with the correct observations when reconstructing the most likely route taken through the hidden states. Results were inspected to ensure this did not cause systematic overestimation when compared with previous studies.</p><p>We found that the fit for NT swabs produced results which overestimated carriage duration when compared to previously reported estimates. The best fit to the model overestimated the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mn>21</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> parameter, which measures the false negative rate of swabbing, in favour of reduced transition intensities. We therefore fitted the model again, fixing this rate at 0.12. We based this figure on non-typable <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> abundance as defined by 16S survey sequencing. At 1% proportional abundance in the sample, 12% came out as culture negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26255.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Success of culturing unencapsulated <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>.</p><p>Based on having &gt;1% abundance of 16S reads showing the bacteria as being present, 44/361 true positive swabs were not successfully cultured.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Abundance</th><th>Culture positive</th><th>Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&gt;1%</td><td>Cultured</td><td>361</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;1%</td><td>Not cultured</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;1%</td><td>Cultured</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>&lt;1%</td><td>Not cultured</td><td>54</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>From all the swab data, we estimated that there were a total of 4382 carriage episodes (7.3 per child), of which 2254 had a complete set of AMR data available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). After removing ten outlier observations from swabs taken accidentally during disease, we were able to match 2157 sequenced genomes with a carriage duration. Duration was positively skewed due to some observations of very long carriage times.

In the context of genome wide association studies (GWAS) in bacteria strong linkage-disequilibrium (LD) is present across the entire genome, making it difficult to pinpoint variants associated with carriage duration and not just present in the background of longer or shorter carried lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Shapiro, 2015</xref>).

If these factors are associated with carriage duration, large sets of variants which define long-carried and short-carried lineages will be correlated with carriage duration in a naive association test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Shapiro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Read and Massey, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A distinction has therefore been made between variants which evolve convergently and affect a phenotype independently of lineage – termed locus effects – to those which are collinear with a genotype which is associated with the phenotype, termed lineage effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Earle et al., 2016</xref>). Locus effects may be associated with a change in carriage duration due to convergent evolution (which may occur through recombination between lineages). In such regions, the causal loci and corresponding phenotypic effects are easier to identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Power et al., 2017</xref>). Linear mixed models can be used to find these variants which are associated with a bacterial phenotype independent of lineage; discovery of homoplasic and polygenic variation associated with the phenotype across the entire tree is well powered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Earle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the high heritability suggests many pathogen variants do affect carriage duration, it does not give information on how many of these will be locus or lineage effects. We mapped carriage duration onto the phylogeny, reconstructing the ancestral state at each node.

We also included resistance to six antibiotics, the causal element to some of which are known to be associated with specific lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lees et al., 2016</xref>).

Conversely, some bacterial genetic variation has been shown to be able to affect colonisation independent of serotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We therefore wished to test whether the detected effect of serotype and resistance on carriage duration was entirely mediated through their covariance with lineage, or whether they are independently associated with carriage duration. We first looked for differences in duration over three recent capsule gain/loss events; if there is an effect of serotype independent of genetic background, these would be predicted have the largest difference between serotypes while controlling for the relatedness of isolates. No significant difference in duration was seen between isolates with or without capsule within the same lineage (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.39</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>However, as these events were limited in number, assumed genetic independence within the clade and occurred only in part of the population, we also performed the same regression as above while also including lineage (defined by discrete population clusters) as a predictor. This therefore allows serotypes which appear in different population clusters to distinguish whether lineage or serotype had a greater effect on carriage duration. The covariance test found that 19F, erythromycin resistance and being non-typable had significant effects on the model (in that order). As these terms enter the model before any lineage specific effect, this suggested these serotypes and resistances are associated with variation in carriage duration independent of background genotype</p><p>This lasso-based analysis may be vulnerable to confounding from unmeasured variables which may be associated with the explanatory variables (serotype and resistance). To fully account for the effect of the bacterial genome rather than relying on discrete clusters as covariates in the regression, we performed regression of these lineage effects under an LMM where the relatedness between strains was instead included as a random effect. The predictors had the same order of significance, but only serotype 19F reached genome-wide significance (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>3.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><p>Together, this suggests that the main lineage effect on carriage duration is the serotype, but only some serotypes (19F) have an association independent of genetic background. We also found that erythromycin resistance may be significantly associated with an increased carriage duration. While being a relatively uncommon treatment in this setting (3% of treatments captured), we did not find that other antibiotics were associated. This may be because erythromycin resistance would be expected to cause an almost four order magnitude increase in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), whereas other resistance acquisitions have a much smaller effect.</p><p>Additionally, we calculated the mean sojourn times (average length of time children are expected to remain in the carrying state of the model with the given serotype) and mean number of carriage episodes from the fit to the HMM for commonly carried serotypes (), which gave results similar to the regression performed above. These estimates are comparable to the previous analysis on a subset of these samples.

Colonisation by other serotypes seem to cause slightly shorter carriage episodes, though the relative rarity of these events naturally limits the confidence in this inference.

The calculated mean carriage duration of NT pneumococci is similar to the minimum resolution we were able to measure by the study design, which suggests carriage episodes may actually be shorter than one month. Unfortunately the only existing study with higher resolution did not check for colonisation by NT pneumococci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullahi et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>These estimates are similar to previous longitudinal studies in different populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Högberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Melegaro et al., 2007</xref>), though against the Kilifi study our estimates are systematically larger. This may be due to the lower resolution swabbing we performed, or may be because the previous study was unable to resolve multiple carriage (11% of positive swabs). While our heritability estimates are specific to this population due to differences in host, vaccine deployment and transmission dynamics, the similarity of the estimates of serotype effect to those from different study populations suggests our results may be somewhat generalisable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Additional loci identified by genome-wide association</title><p>To search for locus effects as discussed above, we applied an LMM to all the common SNPs and k-mers in the dataset.

only genome-wide significant SNP hits are synonymous changes (MAF = 1%) in the replication module of the prophage in the ATCC 700669 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croucher et al., 2009</xref>), a highly variable component of the pneumococcal genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croucher et al., 2014a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The LD structure suggested there were two separate significant signals found in this region. We therefore performed another GWAS conditioning on the top hit to test if there was a second independent signal, but found that the second hit in this region was no longer significant (position 1526024; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf46"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). The current data is therefore consistent with only a single significant hit to prophage.</p><p>The most significant k-mer hits were also located in phage sequence (MAF 2%) and were associated with a reduced duration of carriage. As these mobile genetic elements are less weakly population stratified than other regions of the genome, they are easier to find as locus effects. The LD in this region is less than in the rest of the genome, as prophage sequence is highly variable within <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croucher et al., 2014a</xref>). Multiple independent phage variants may therefore affect carriage duration, which will increase their significance using a LMM.

By using the presence of phage as a trait under the same linear mixed model, we however found no evidence of association when correcting for population structure (p=0.35). These results are therefore evidence that infection with a specific phage sequence is associated with a slight decrease in carriage duration. A similar result has previously been found in a genome-wide screen in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, where a specific phage sequence was found to affect the virulence and epidemiology of strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bille et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bille et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, previous in vivo tests have shown phage elements to cause a fitness decrease of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> during carriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeBardeleben et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The genetic polymorphisms in the prophage associated with changes in carriage duration, found in 2% of viral sequences, are found within coding sequences inside the phage replication module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romero et al., 2009</xref>). It is unlikely the specific variants of these proteins cause a significant difference in cell phenotype, because they are only highly expressed after the prophage is activated, and cell lysis is typically imminent. One explanation for these results is that a subpopulation of prophage do not cause a significant decrease in their host bacterium's carriage duration, which could be due to beneficial ‘cargo’ genes. Yet previous surveys of pneumococcal prophage have found little evidence of these elements carrying such sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croucher et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romero et al., 2009</xref>). One phage protein that has been found to alter the bacterial phenotype is PblB, a phage structural protein that can also mediate bacterial adhesion to human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loeffler and Fischetti, 2006</xref>). However, <italic>pblB</italic> is within the morphology module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romero et al., 2009</xref>) and as an adhesin might be expected to increase carriage duration. Hence the detected association is unlikely to represent expression of viral machinery or cargo genes in the host cell while the prophage is dormant.</p><p>Alternatively, the association with only a subset of prophage may be the consequence of sampling. Using a monthly swabbing approach, it was only possible to robustly infer changes in the carriage duration of genotypes that colonise hosts for long periods. Therefore any prophage locus that enhances a virus’ ability to infect long carriage duration pneumococci may have an elevated correlation with the variation in the observed phenotype. As phage commonly exhibit high levels of strain specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duplessis and Moineau, 2001</xref>), this is a plausible mechanism, although the role of the replication module in such host preference is unclear.</p><p>An additional mechanism by which prophage can affect host phenotype is by inserting into, and thereby disrupting, functional genes. Pneumococcal prophage frequently insert into <italic>comYC</italic>, thereby preventing the host cell undergoing transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croucher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Croucher et al., 2014b</xref>). Using previous categorisation of the <italic>comYC</italic> gene in this collection into intact versus interrupted or missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Croucher et al., 2016</xref>), we found that having an intact <italic>comYC</italic> gene (23% of isolates) was significantly associated with an increased carriage duration using the LMM (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.29</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.4</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>44</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). The effect size is similar to the associated phage k-mers, but has at a higher allele frequency (hence the increased significance of the result). An interpretation consistent with these findings would be that the effect of phage k-mers is actually through interrupting <italic>comYC</italic>. The k-mers themselves were spread out to lower frequencies due to their sequence variability, and no references used allowed mapping to find the <italic>comYC</italic> interruption directly.</p><p>Signals at the suggestive level include <italic>pbp1a</italic> and <italic>pbp2b</italic>, which suggest as above that penicillin resistance may slightly increase carriage duration, but there are not enough samples in this analysis to confirm or refute this. Other signals near genes at a suggestive level included SNPs in <italic>trcF</italic> (transcription coupled DNA repair), <italic>padR</italic> (repressor of phenolic acid stress response), <italic>pepS</italic> (aminopeptidase), <italic>aroA</italic> (aromatic amino acid synthesis), <italic>fms</italic> (peptide deformylase) and a thioesterase superfamily protein. K-mers from erythromycin resistance genes (<italic>ermB</italic>, <italic>mel</italic>, <italic>mef</italic>) were expected to reach significance from the above analysis, but did not: it has however previously been shown that the power to detect these elements in a larger sample set taken from the same population is limited due to the multiple resistance mechanisms and stratification of resistance with lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lees et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The test statistic from fast-lmm roughly followed the null-hypothesis, with the exception of the significant phage k-mers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However there is limited power to detect effects associated with both the lineage and phenotype. This effect has been previously noted, and while LMMs have improved power for detecting locus specific effects they lose power when detecting associated variants which segregate with background genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Earle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To search for candidate regions which may be independently associated with both a lineage and increased carriage duration, we ran an association test using a set number of fixed effects as the population structure correction. This is expected to have higher power than an LMM for true associated variants on ancestral branches, but will also increase the number of false positives (variants co-occurring on these branches which do not directly affect the carriage duration themselves). We also tested SNPs for their association with those principal components which were themselves significantly associated with carriage duration, and therefore may be driving the lineage associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Earle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The most highly associated SNPs were in all three <italic>pbp</italic> regions associated with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam resistance, the capsule locus, <italic>recA</italic> (DNA repair and homologous recombination), <italic>bgaA</italic> (beta-galactosidase), <italic>phoH</italic>-like protein (phosphate starvation-inducible protein), <italic>ftsZ</italic> (cell division protein) and <italic>groEL</italic> (chaperonin). As 19F, the serotype most associated with carriage duration, is predominantly the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-lactam resistant PMEN14 lineage the <italic>pbp</italic> association may be driven through strong LD between with this serotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the analysis of SNPs which may be driving significant lineage associations – this also suggested <italic>dnaB</italic> (DNA replication) may be associated with altered carriage duration.

Additionally we found k-mers in the bacteriocin <italic>blpZ</italic> and immunity protein <italic>pncM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogaardt et al., 2015</xref>) to be associated with variability in carriage duration. This could be evidence that intra-strain competition occurs within host via this mechanism, consistent with previous in vitro mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawid et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It is not possible to determine whether variation in these genes is associated with a change in carriage duration or if the variation is present in longer carried, generally more prevalent lineages.

Together, they explained 0.046 of variation in carriage duration. As found previously, increasing child age contributes to a decrease in the duration of carriage episodes. From a mean of 68 days long, we calculated a drop of 19 days after a year, and 32 days after two years. Extrapolating, this causes carriage episodes longer than two days to cease by age 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Previous carriage of any serotype was estimated to cause an increase in the duration of future carriage episodes, though previous studies have found no overall effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weinberger et al., 2008</xref>). It has previously been shown that prior exposure to non-typables in this cohort make colonisation by another non-typable occur later, and for a shorter time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Turner et al., 2012</xref>).

The implication of phage as having a significant effect on carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage, even during carriage episodes in this dataset.</p><p>Investigating a mechanism for the prophage association, we found that having an intact <italic>comYC</italic> gene, which is frequently interrupted by prophage causing loss of function of the competence system, was associated with increased carriage duration. While the competence system is observed to remain intact over the evolutionary history of the species, these disruptive mutations spread irreversibly through the population as competent bacteria can acquire the mutation, and non-competent bacteria can no longer reverse it through recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Croucher et al., 2014b</xref>). Selection must therefore maintain the function at this locus over short timescales, and an increased carriage duration may be evidence of this. We therefore hypothesise that the associated prophage sequences may affect carriage duration through disruption of the competence system, without which deleterious mutations will accumulate in the population due to Muller's ratchet.</p><p>The results presented here have important implications for the modelling of pneumococcal transmission and their response to perturbation of the population by vaccine. Importantly, our analysis of heritability shows that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with recent theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lehtinen et al., 2017</xref>). Here we have shown that these alleles do exist in a natural population, and also identified candidates for the loci which fulfil this role. Together these studies suggest that variants exist in the pneumococcal genome which alter carriage duration, which in turn is linked to antibiotic resistance.</p><p>We were not able to fully explain the basis for heritability of carriage duration for a number of reasons. The close association of the phenotype with lineage limited our power to fine-map lineage associated variants other than capsule type which may affect carriage duration. Meta-analysis with more large studies with higher resolution may help to resolve these issues: we are conducting a similar study in Cape Town, South Africa which will combine sequence data with two-weekly swabs and will be compared to these results in future. Additional environmental factors that explain some of the remainder of the variance may include the variation of the host immune response and interaction with other infections or co-colonisation. In particular, co-infection with influenza A was not recorded but is known to affect population dynamics within the nasopharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kono et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This is a phenotype which would have been difficult to assay by traditional methods such as in an animal model due to the cohort size needed and the length of time experiments would need to be run for. By instead using genome-wide association study methods we have been able to quantitatively investigate a complex phenotype in a natural population. We believe that the analysis of heritability and variance explained in a phenotype of interest, as presented here, will be an important part analysis of complex bacterial traits in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection</title><p>The study population was a subset of infants from the Maela longitudinal birth cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turner et al., 2013a</xref>), and was split into two cohorts.

To perform conditional analysis we used the pattern of the most significant SNP as a fixed-effect, removed it from the test and kinship estimation, and re-ran the mixed model on all other sites.</p><p>For k-mers we counted 5254876 phylogenetically independent sites, giving a genome wide significance cutoff of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>9.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>9</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. We used blastn (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001598">SCR_001598</ext-link>) with default settings to map the significant k-mers to seven reference genomes (ATCC 700669, INV104B, OXC141, SPNA45, Taiwan19F, TIGR4 and NT_110_58), and the possible Tn<italic>916</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croucher et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To search for variants with some level of lineage independence we used SEER (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015499">SCR_015499</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lees et al., 2016</xref>). To correct for population structure we used the patristic distances from the phylogenetic tree as the kinship matrix, which we then projected into 30 dimensions using metric multidimensional scaling. The coordinates of the samples in this space were used as covariates in SEER’s linear regression. We performed association tests on SNPs and k-mers with MAF &gt; 1% using multiple linear regression, and report the top hits with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>14</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genome-wide identification of lineage and locus specific variation associated with pneumococcal carriage duration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Daniel Wilson.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is an interesting and novel analysis of an impressive data set. The study sheds light on an important problem in clinical microbiology, the genetic determinants of carriage duration in pneumococcus, and the work should thus appeal to modelers in bacterial genomics and epidemiology. The reviewers find the conclusions fairly convincing and note that the association between carriage duration and the presence of prophage is an especially intriguing result that could inspire future investigations.</p><p>The reviewers note, however, the statistical challenges inherent in this type of study. They provide several suggestions for how the statistics could be improved or clarified to carefully delineate the support for different conclusions. An overriding concern is that the limitations of the statistics, and especially the inability of associations to demonstrate causality, be accurately communicated. The reviewers also recommend discussing the potential biology of the phage association in more depth.</p><p>Essential revisions and major points:</p><p>1) Exploring the inclusion of some components (e.g. serotype, resistance, lineage), but not all components of genetic variation (i.e. the rest of the genome) on phenotype using a Lasso is fairly ad hoc, making it difficult to have confidence in the conclusions. Besides the uncertainty in distinguishing the effects of these loci from others not included, there is also the problem that unmeasured, heritable confounders may influence results, because population stratification may not be adequately controlled. Lasso can make arbitrary choices between approximately equally good variables even if all loci were included, making it good for predicting phenotype, but bad for identifying candidate causal loci. It would be appropriate to mention that in the Lasso analysis, there is less robustness to potential confounding with unmeasured variables that may be associated with the significant regressors. Inferences of causality (e.g. subsection “Serotype and drug resistance explain part of the narrow-sense heritability”, seventh paragraph) are therefore likely to be overstated. For more robust inference, I would suggest testing the significance of these explanatory variables over and above what is explained by, e.g. the top 30 PCs or (better) in a lineage mixed model. If these analyses do not support the same conclusions, that is important to highlight.</p><p>2) The authors need to be more careful/speculative in their description of their findings, especially in the Abstract. For example, with respect to the role of host factors, this was far from exhaustive in this study, and there are many more host features, that were the data available could have accounted for more of the phenotype variation, so I believe it is more accurate to state &quot;We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas <italic>the</italic> host traits <italic>considered here</italic> accounted for less than 5%.&quot; (Clearly, the inclusion of epidemiological metadata, if any are available, would enrich the story.)</p><p>The second statement in the Abstract that is overstated is 'A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as significantly decreasing carriage duration independent of serotype.' Whereas without any evidence of causation, I believe they can only state that they have &quot;identified prophage sequences that significantly associated with decreasing carriage duration independent of serotype.&quot; The same idea holds for the association of erithromycin resistance and carriage – the causality is not straightforward.

Besides the uncertainty in distinguishing the effects of these loci from others not included, there is also the problem that unmeasured, heritable confounders may influence results, because population stratification may not be adequately controlled. Lasso can make arbitrary choices between approximately equally good variables even if all loci were included, making it good for predicting phenotype, but bad for identifying candidate causal loci. It would be appropriate to mention that in the Lasso analysis, there is less robustness to potential confounding with unmeasured variables that may be associated with the significant regressors. Inferences of causality (e.g. subsection “Serotype and drug resistance explain part of the narrow-sense heritability”, seventh paragraph) are therefore likely to be overstated. For more robust inference, I would suggest testing the significance of these explanatory variables over and above what is explained by, e.g. the top 30 PCs or (better) in a lineage mixed model. If these analyses do not support the same conclusions, that is important to highlight.</italic></p><p>We agree that the lasso is generally better for prediction rather than inference due to only selecting one of two equally good predictors to keep in the model at each stage. We considered applying the bootstrapped lasso (Bach 2008; arXiv:0804.1302), but had too few observations given the number of predictors. The covariance test for the lasso which we used instead has been shown to be more useful for inference (as cited), and we think still useful for finding potential lineage effects (which are collinear with the genetic background). To ensure robust analysis here, we also used a variance components analysis to test the variance explained and significance of all serotypes and resistances together.</p><p>However, we agree that the limitations of the lasso apply to the analysis mentioned in the subsection “Serotype and drug resistance explain part of the narrow-sense heritability” where we have attempted to find whether serotype and resistance have an effect independent of genetic background. As suggested, we have performed a more robust analysis with a linear mixed model, and found that only 19F was associated independent of background. We have highlighted these differences, and mentioned the drawbacks of the lasso approach in this section as suggested. Additionally, as part of our response to major point 2), we have also been more careful in describing association/causation in this section.</p><p><italic>2) The authors need to be more careful/speculative in their description of their findings, especially in the Abstract. For example, with respect to the role of host factors, this was far from exhaustive in this study, and there are many more host features, that were the data available could have accounted for more of the phenotype variation, so I believe it is more accurate to state &quot;We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here accounted for less than 5%.&quot; (Clearly, the inclusion of epidemiological metadata, if any are available, would enrich the story.)</italic></p><p><italic>The second statement in the Abstract that is overstated is 'A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as significantly decreasing carriage duration independent of serotype.' Whereas without any evidence of causation, I believe they can only state that they have &quot;identified prophage sequences that significantly associated with decreasing carriage duration independent of serotype.&quot; The same idea holds for the association of erithromycin resistance and carriage – the causality is not straightforward. Under the theory of Lehtinen et al. (2017), long durations drive resistance due to the sensitivity of strains with long carriage durations to the fitness effects of antibiotic use, not the other way around.</italic></p><p>We have revised the writing of the findings to ensure causality is not implied where we do not have evidence for it, and have been careful to describe associations appropriately. We have made the suggested changes to the Abstract, and similar changes to describing the effect of erythromycin resistance and the section testing for effects of capsule versus genetic background (as mentioned in the response to major point 1).</p><p><italic>3) The association of the polymorphic phage with carriage is intriguing and deserves more treatment.

An interesting new finding we report is that interruption of <italic>comYC</italic> by prophage is highly associated with reduced carriage duration, which may explain the association of phage sequence with carriage duration. We have added more detail on this result in the Discussion section.</p><p>These additions answer all the questions posed here, with two exceptions. Partitioning phages in the database based on predicted phenotypic impact: unfortunately, this is not possible, as we do not have the carriage duration for prophage in this database. We have not reported mean carriage duration with and without the phage in the same way as serotype: as only a subset of carriage episodes are swabbed this would lead to an estimate which was biased upwards. We however now include effect sizes and minor allele frequencies, and interpret these in the context of the <italic>comYC</italic> association.</p><p>Sadly, we do not have access to the clinical strains to perform an assay to validate the finding, but we are planning analysis of a similar study to be performed in Cape Town as noted, which should help validate these results in future (though two years of longitudinal sampling to determine carriage durations will be required).</p></body></sub-article></article>
