cells through germline-encoded activation and inhibitory receptors enabling effective immunity against viruses and cancer. The Ly49 receptor family in the mouse and killer immunoglobin-like receptor family in humans play a central role in NK cell immunity through recognition of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and related molecules. Functionally, these receptor families are involved in the licensing and rejection of MHC-I-deficient cells through missing-self. The Ly49 family is highly polymorphic, making it challenging to detail the contributions of individual Ly49 receptors to NK cell function. Herein, we showed mice lacking expression of all Ly49s were unable to reject missing-self target cells in vivo, were defective in NK cell licensing, and displayed lower KLRG1 on the surface of NK cells. Expression of Ly49A alone on an H-2D<sup>d</sup> background restored missing-self target cell rejection, NK cell licensing, and NK cell KLRG1 expression. Thus, a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells and mediate missing-self in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Immune cells help to protect the body from infections and cancer. One way that they do this is by recognising and destroying harmful cells. Natural killer cells (known as NK cells) can tell whether cells are healthy or harmful based on the molecules that are present on their surface. For example, molecules known as MHC Class I are commonly found on healthy cells whereas cancer cells and those infected with viruses can lose these molecules from their surface.</p><p>NK cells use inhibitory receptors to recognise MHC Class I molecules. If they do not detect this molecule on the surface of a cell, the NK cell can become activated and kill the unhealthy cell. In mice, a group of receptors known as the Ly49 family are thought to be responsible for this process. However, Ly49 receptors are complex and their individual roles in NK cells remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate, Piersma et al. developed mice without any of the Ly49 receptors. A single receptor was then re-introduced to identify its individual role. These experiments showed that the Ly49 receptor family is required for NK cells to detect a lack of MHC Class I molecules on cells. The receptors also allow NK cells to express certain receptors and to be fully functional. Introducing an individual Ly49 receptor was sufficient to restore these abilities, suggesting that a single receptor can mediate these processes.</p><p>The findings of Piersma et al. provide a deeper understanding of how NK cell inhibitory receptors work in mice. Further investigation of the equivalent receptors in humans may aid understanding of the mechanisms involved in recognising harmful changes to cells. In the future, this information may help to improve cancer and anti-viral treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natural killer cell</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>immune receptor</kwd><kwd>cellular immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI129545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Wayne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mouse model offers definitive evidence that a single inhibitory receptor family governs the critical natural killer cell functions of licensing and missing-self.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that can mediate effective immunity against viruses and cancer through direct lysis and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huntington et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Piersma and Brizić, 2022</xref>). NK cells recognize their target cells through integration of signals by germline-encoded activation and inhibitory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Long et al., 2013</xref>). These inhibitory receptors include members of the Ly49 family in the mouse that are encoded by the <italic>Klra</italic> gene family and killer immunoglobin-like receptor (KIR) family in humans and they prevent killing of healthy cells through recognition of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colonna and Samaridis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlhofer et al., 1992</xref>). Host cells may lose surface MHC-I expression in response to virus infection or malignant transformation. As a result, these cells become invisible to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but simultaneously become targets for NK cells through ‘missing-self’ recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kärre et al., 1986</xref>).</p><p>The inhibitory Ly49 molecules appear to be responsible for missing-self recognition in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babić et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bélanger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gamache et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parikh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, it has been sometimes challenging to draw definitive conclusions because the Ly49 family is highly polymorphic and differs between mouse strains. Moreover, multiple inhibitory Ly49 receptors within a single host can recognize a given MHC-I molecule while others apparently have no ligands and instead recognize other MHC-I alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schenkel et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, the Ly49s for non-host MHC-I alleles are still expressed. For example, in the C57BL/6 background, Ly49C and Ly49I can recognize H-2<sup>b</sup> MHC-I molecules that include H-2K<sup>b</sup> and H-2D<sup>b</sup>, while Ly49A and Ly49G cannot recognize H-2<sup>b</sup> molecules and instead they recognize H-2<sup>d</sup> alleles. Still these Ly49s are expressed in C57BL/6 mice, so their individual contributions to missing-self rejection are unclear. Ly49A has also been implicated in recognition of the non-classical MHC-I molecule H2-M3, which is upregulated in response to exposure to N-formylated peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 1999</xref>). Importantly, the specificities of several Ly49s have been clearly established while others remain to be confirmed. For example, the binding of Ly49A to H-2D<sup>d</sup> has been confirmed by crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tormo et al., 1999</xref>), and validated by mutational analysis of both Ly49A and H-2D<sup>d</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). By contrast, the MHC-I specificities of other Ly49s have been primarily studied with MHC tetramers containing human β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (B2m), which is not recognized by Ly49A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitsuki et al., 2004</xref>), on cells overexpressing Ly49s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanke et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the contributions of individual Ly49 receptors to NK cell effector function are confounded by the expression of multiple receptors, some of which may be irrelevant to a given self-MHC haplotype, and multiple Ly49 molecules whose specificities are less well defined.</p><p>In addition to effector function in missing-self, Ly49 receptors that recognize their cognate MHC-I ligands are involved in the licensing or education of NK cells to acquire functional competence. NK cell licensing is characterized by potent effector functions including IFNγ production and degranulation in response to activation receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elliott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Like missing-self recognition, inhibitory Ly49s require SHP-1 for NK cell licensing, which interacts with the ITIM-motif encoded in the cytosolic tail of inhibitory Ly49s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Viant et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, lower expression of SHP-1, particularly within the immunological synapse, is associated with licensed NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmied et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, inhibitory Ly49s have a second function that licenses NK cells to self-MHC-I, thereby generating functionally competent NK cells, but it has not been possible to exclude contributions from other co-expressed Ly49s.</p><p>The complex nature of the Ly49 family confounds our fundamental understanding of these receptors, particularly regarding their function in vivo. To better understand Ly49 function in vivo, several groups made mutant mouse lines with altered expression of the <italic>Klra</italic> locus. This was pioneered by the Makrigiannis group, which targeted the promotor of <italic>Klra15</italic> encoding Ly49O in 129 ES cells and resulting mice were subsequently backcrossed to C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bélanger et al., 2012</xref>). These mice were defective in the rejection of MHC-I-deficient target cells in vivo and exhibited reduced tumor control as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tu et al., 2014</xref>). However, there was limited surface expression of NKG2A as well as Ly49s so these target defects were not solely dependent on the absence of Ly49s. Moreover, these mice likely carried 129 alleles of other genes in the NK gene complex (NKC) that are expressed on NK cells, display allelic polymorphisms and are genetically linked to <italic>Klra</italic> locus that encode the Ly49s. Following the development of mouse CRISPR engineering, the Dong group deleted the entire 1.4 Mb <italic>Klra</italic> locus in the C57BL/6 NKC and showed that Ly49-deficient mice were unable to reject MHC-I-deficient cells in vivo at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Besides loss of Ly49 receptor expression, surface expression of other receptors, including KLRG1, NKG2A, NKG2D, and CD94, was also reduced in these mice. Around the same time, we generated a mouse that contains a 66 kb and 149 kb deletion in the C57BL/6 <italic>Klra</italic> locus, resulting in the loss of four Ly49 molecules, including Ly49A and Ly49G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parikh et al., 2020</xref>). The resulting ΔLy49-1 mice were also deficient in H2D<sup>d</sup>-restricted control of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), which was rescued by knock-in of Ly49A into the <italic>Ncr1</italic> locus. Thus, available genetic evidence suggests inhibitory Ly49 receptors are essential for licensing and missing-self recognition.</p><p>The current data, however, do not take into account that individual Ly49s are stochastically expressed on NK cells, and multiple receptors are simultaneously expressed on individual NK cells, resulting in a diverse Ly49 repertoire of potential specificities on overlapping subsets of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorfman and Raulet, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kubota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). As a result, not all NK cells express a specific Ly49 receptor and most NK cells express multiple Ly49 molecules, making it difficult to study the biology of a specific Ly49 receptor without genetic approaches. However, <italic>Klra</italic> genes encoding the Ly49 receptor family are highly related and clustered together, resulting in a high concentration of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Makrigiannis et al., 2005</xref>), complicating the capacity to target individual <italic>Klra</italic> genes for definitive analysis. Moreover, in ΔLy49-1 mice, which had an intact <italic>Klra4</italic> coding sequence encoding Ly49D, the percentage of NK cells expressing Ly49D was markedly reduced, even though Ly49D was otherwise expressed at normal levels, suggesting a regulatory locus control region within the deleted fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parikh et al., 2020</xref>). Such data raise the possibility that the large genetic deletions of the Ly49 locus may affect other NK cell receptors in the NKC that contribute to NK cell function. Thus, expression of individual Ly49 receptors without confounding effects of other Ly49s and potentially other NKC genes is needed to validate the conclusions from the study of mice lacking Ly49 expression.</p><p>Here, we studied the role of an individual Ly49 receptor in NK cell function. To this end, we deleted all NK cell <italic>Klra</italic> genes encoding the Ly49 receptor family using CRISPR/Cas9 and confirmed the role of the Ly49 family in missing self and licensing. Subsequently, we expressed Ly49A in isolation under control of the <italic>Ncr1</italic> locus in Ly49-deficient mice on an H-2D<sup>d</sup> background to show that a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor expressed by all NK cells is sufficient for licensing and mediating missing-self in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NK cells from CRISPR-generated mice lacking all NK cell-related Ly49 molecules display reduced KLRG1 expression</title><p>To investigate the role of individual Ly49 molecules, we generated a mouse that lacked all expressed Ly49 receptors.

The resulting mouse contained a fusion between <italic>Klra9</italic> and <italic>Klra17</italic> with a deletion of the start codon and insertion of a fusion sequence that did contain a potential start site for a putative five amino acid polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed that the 3′ deletion reported in the ΔLy49-1 mouse was unaffected, resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon after nine amino acids in the fused <italic>Klra7/1</italic> gene.

The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) for Ly49I was reduced by 26% in Ly49I<sup>+</sup> NK cells in heterozygous Ly49KO mice, while the other Ly49s did not display significant differences in MFI.

However, this defect was completely restored in the Ly49KO/Ly49A KI D8-KODO mice, demonstrating that a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to mediate missing-self rejection of cells lacking its MHC class I ligand.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several mice with genetic modifications in the Ly49 complex have been developed to study the role of Ly49 receptors but they have limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bélanger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gamache et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parikh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). A complicating factor in these studies is that multiple Ly49s, often with incompletely understood specificities, may be involved in target cell recognition. Here, we studied a mouse where a single Ly49 was under control of the <italic>Ncr1</italic> locus, which is expressed on all NK cells on the background of a complete Ly49 KO. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bélanger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parikh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), Ly49-deficient NK cells were deficient in licensing and missing-self rejection, both on a H-2<sup>b</sup> background and in the presence of a single classical MHC-I allele, H-2D<sup>d</sup>. While our results did not interrogate licensing by inhibitory receptors outside of the Ly49 receptor family, such as has been reported for NKG2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anfossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), they do demonstrate that expression of Ly49A without other Ly49 family members can mediate NK cell licensing. Moreover, we found that Ly49 receptors are required and sufficient for missing-self rejection under steady-state conditions. However, these observations do not rule out the involvement of other inhibitory receptors under specific inflammatory conditions. For example, NKG2A contributes to the rejection of missing-self targets in poly(I:C)-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, expression of the inhibitory Ly49A in isolation did not alter NK cell numbers or maturation, indicating that the Ly49s do not affect these parameters of NK cells. Yet the NK cells were fully licensed in terms of IFNγ production and degranulation in vitro and efficiently rejected MHC-I-deficient target cells in vivo. Thus, a single Ly49 receptor is capable of conferring the licensed phenotype and missing-self rejection in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>We observed that rejection of H-2K<sup>b</sup>-deficient targets was more potent than H-2D<sup>b</sup>-deficient target splenocytes, comparable to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansson et al., 2005</xref>). These data indicate that H-2K<sup>b</sup> is more efficiently recognized by Ly49s compared to H-2D<sup>b</sup>. This is further supported by early studies using Ly49 transfectants binding to Con A blasts showing that Ly49C and Ly49I can bind to H-2D<sup>b</sup>-deficient but not H-2K<sup>b</sup>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanke et al., 1999</xref>), despite the caveat of testing binding to cells overexpressing Ly49s in these studies. Our studies indicate that the efficiency of Ly49-dependent missing-self rejection depends on the characteristics of specific MHC-I alleles recognized by cognate Ly49 receptors in vivo.</p><p>KLRG1 is an inhibitory receptor that recognizes E-, N-, and R- cadherins to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 2006</xref>). KLRG1 is expressed on a subset of mature NK cells and can be upregulated in response to proliferation in a host with lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), we observed decreased KLRG1 expression in Ly49-deficient NK cells. The <italic>Klra</italic> gene family as well as <italic>Klrg1</italic> is located within the NKC on chromosome 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yokoyama and Plougastel, 2003</xref>), thus an effect of regulatory elements deleted in Ly49KO mice cannot be excluded. This is further emphasized by studies of our ΔLy49-1 mouse, which expresses Ly49D on fewer NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parikh et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>Klra4</italic> gene appears intact and Ly49D<sup>+</sup> NK cells expressed Ly49D at normal levels, suggesting the absence of a regulatory element in the deleted regions. Here, we showed the expression of only Ly49A, encoded in the <italic>Ncr1</italic> locus located on chromosome 7, in Ly49KO mice on an H-2D<sup>d</sup> background restored KLRG1 expression in NK cells from different tissues, indicating that inhibitory Ly49 receptors rather than regulatory elements influence KLRG1 expression. Moreover, NK cell KLRG1 expression is modulated by MHC-I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corral et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, KLRG1 expression may be modulated as a consequence of NK cell licensing through inhibitory Ly49 receptors.</p><p>The Ly49 family is stochastically expressed in NK cells, resulting in an NK cell repertoire with different combinations of Ly49 receptors on individual NK cells. Not all Ly49 alleles are equally expressed, which has been suggested to be dependent on allelic exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Held et al., 1995</xref>). Epigenetic control, including DNA-methylation, histone modification, and regulatory elements, has been linked to Ly49 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kissiov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCullen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rouhi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saleh et al., 2004</xref>). We observed that in Ly49KO heterozygous mice the percentage of Ly49<sup>+</sup> NK cells was reduced for each Ly49 molecule, yet the expression level measured by MFI was not affected except for Ly49I, indicating that loss of one allele does not affect Ly49 surface levels. Nonetheless, alternate mechanisms may control Ly49 expression as was observed for Ly49I. Expression of <italic>Klra1</italic> encoding Ly49A within the <italic>Ncr1</italic> locus resulted in ubiquitous Ly49A expression in NK cells, albeit at lower levels compared to Ly49A<sup>+</sup> D8-KODO NK cells. Despite the lower expression levels of Ly49A, Ly49A KI NK cells were fully licensed and efficiently eliminated MHC-I-deficient target cells, suggesting that minor alterations in expression levels of various Ly49s on individual NK cells may not affect NK cell functions. In conclusion, these data show that the expression of a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is necessary and sufficient to license NK cells and mediate missing self-rejection under steady-state conditions in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 (stock# 556) mice were purchased from Charles Rivers laboratories, B2m-deficient (stock# 2087) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories, H-2K<sup>b</sup> × H-2D<sup>b</sup> double-deficient (stock# 4215; KODO) mice were purchased from Taconic Farms.

This manuscript shows that a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells and eliminate MHC-I-deficient target cells in mice. In short, they refined the mouse model ∆Ly49-1 (Parikh et al., 2020) into the Ly49KO model in which all Ly49 genes are disrupted. Using this model, they confirmed that NK cells from Ly49KO mice cannot be licensed, produce lower levels of IFN-gamma, and cannot reject MHC-I-deficient cells. To study the effect of a single Ly49 receptor in the function of NK cells, the authors backcrossed Ly49KO mice to H-2Dd transgenic KODO (D8-KODO) Ly49A knock-in mice in which a single inhibitory Ly49A receptor that recognizes H-2Dd ligands is expressed. By doing so, they demonstrate that a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor expressed by all NK cells is sufficient for licensing and missing-self killing.</p><p>While the results of the study are largely consistent with the conclusions, it is important to address some discrepancies. For instance, in the title of Figure 1, the authors state that NK cells in Ly49KO mice compared to WT mice have a less mature phenotype , which is not consistent with the corresponding text in the Results section (lines 170-171) that states there is no difference in maturation. These differences are not evident in Figure 1, panel D. It is crucial to acknowledge these inconsistencies to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the research findings.</p><p>In the legend of Figure 2. the text related to panel C indicates the use of dyes to label the splenocytes, and CFSE, CTV, and CTFR were mentioned. However, only CTV and CTFR are shown on the plots and mentioned in the corresponding text in the Results section. Similarly, in the legend of Figure 4, which is related to panel C, the authors write that splenocytes were differentially labeled with CFSE and CTV as indicated; however, in Figure 4, C and the Results section text, there is no mention of CFSE.</p><p>The authors should clarify why they assume that KLRG1 expression is influenced by the expression of inhibitory Ly49 receptors and not by manipulations on chromosome 6, where the genes for both KLRG1 and Ly49 receptors are located. However, a better explanation for the possible influence of other inhibitory NK cell receptors still needs to be included. In the study by Zhang et al. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13032-5 the authors showed the synergized regulation of NK cell education by the NKG2A receptor and the specific Ly49 family members. Although in this study, Piersma and colleagues show the control of MHC-I deficient cells by Ly49A+ NKG2A-NK cells in Figure 4., this receptor is not mentioned in the Results or in the Discussion section, so its role in this story needs to be clarified. Therefore, the reader would benefit from more information regarding NKG2A receptor and NKG2A+/- populations in their results.</p><p>Comments on revisions: The authors have successfully answered all my questions and edited the manuscript accordingly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100218.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Piersma et al. successfully generated a mouse model with all Ly49 genes knocked out, resulting in the complete absence of Ly49 receptor expression on the cell surface. The absence of Ly49 expression led to the loss of NK cell education/licensing and consequently, a failure in responsiveness against missing-self target cells. The authors demonstrate the restoration of NK cell licensing by knocking in a single Ly49 gene, Ly49A, in a mouse expressing the H-2Dd ligand for this receptor, which is a novel and important finding.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors established a novel mouse model enabling them to have a clean and thorough study on the function of Ly49 on NK cell licensing.

This is achieved using a mouse strain lacking all of the Ly49 receptors expressed by NK cells and inserting the Ly49a gene into the Ncr1 locus, leading to expression on the majority of NK cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The mouse model used represents a precise deletion of all NK-expressed genes within the Ly49 cluster. The re-introduction of the Ly49a gene into the Ncr1 locus allows expression by most NK cells. Convincing effects of Ly49a expression on in vitro activation and in vivo killing assay are shown.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The choice of Ly49a provides a clear picture of H-2D<sup>d</sup> recognition by this Ly49. It would be valuable to perform additional studies investigating Ly49c and Ly49i receptors for H-2b. This is of interest because there are reports indicating that Ly49c may not be a functional receptor in B6 mice due to strong cis interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it will be important to extend our findings to H-2b haplotypes with individual cognate Ly49 receptors (Ly49C and Ly49I). While these experiments are subject of our ongoing studies, they are beyond the scope of the current manuscript considering the significant time, effort and cost to generate these new Ly49C and Ly49I knockin mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work generates an excellent mouse model for the study of NK cell licensing by inhibitory Ly49s that will be useful for the community. It provides a platform whereby the functional activity of a single Ly49 can be assessed.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Piersma et al. continue to work on deciphering the role and function of Ly49 NK cell receptors. This manuscript shows that a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells and eliminate MHC-I-deficient target cells in mice. In short, they refined the mouse model ∆Ly49-1 (Parikh et al., 2020) into the Ly49KO model in which all Ly49 genes are disrupted. Using this model, they confirmed that NK cells from Ly49KO mice cannot be licensed, produce lower levels of IFN-gamma, and cannot reject MHC-I-deficient cells. To study the effect of a single Ly49 receptor in the function of NK cells, the authors backcrossed Ly49KO mice to H-2D<sup>d</sup> transgenic KODO (D8-KODO) Ly49A knock-in mice in which a single inhibitory Ly49A receptor that recognizes H-2D<sup>d</sup> ligands is expressed. By doing so, they demonstrate that a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor expressed by all NK cells is sufficient for licensing and missing-self killing.</p><p>While the results of the study are largely consistent with the conclusions, it is important to address some discrepancies. For instance, in the title of Figure 1, the authors state that NK cells in Ly49KO mice compared to WT mice have a less mature phenotype , which is not consistent with the corresponding text in the Results section (lines 170-171) that states there is no difference in maturation. These differences are not evident in Figure 1, panel D. It is crucial to acknowledge these inconsistencies to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the research findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have corrected the figure legend title to: “Mice generated to lack all NK-related Ly49 molecules using CRISPR have NK cells that display alterations in select surface molecules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the legend of Figure 2. the text related to panel C indicates the use of dyes to label the splenocytes, and CFSE, CTV, and CTFR were mentioned. However, only CTV and CTFR are shown on the plots and mentioned in the corresponding text in the Results section. Similarly, in the legend of Figure 4, which is related to panel C, the authors write that splenocytes were differentially labeled with CFSE and CTV as indicated; however, in Figure 4, C and the Results section text, there is no mention of CFSE.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point out these inconsistencies. We did label target cells with CFSE to distinguish them from host cells, to clarify we have done the following:</p><p>We have removed CFSE from figure legends of Figure 2 and 4.</p><p>We included the following on CFSE labeling in the Materials and Methods section: “Target splenocytes were additionally labeled with CFSE to identify transferred target splenocytes from host cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should clarify why they assume that KLRG1 expression is influenced by the expression of inhibitory Ly49 receptors and not by manipulations on chromosome 6, where the genes for both KLRG1 and Ly49 receptors are located.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect on KLRG1 expression in phenocopied in the Ly49A KI mice (on a Ly49 KO background). The Ly49A KI allele is encoded by the Ncr1 locus, which is located on chromosome 7 and not by chromosome 6 where KLRG1 is located, thus excluding involvement of cis-regulatory elements encoded by the <italic>Ly49</italic> locus on chromosome 6.</p><p>We have clarified this in the discussion section (lines 350-358):</p><p>“The <italic>Ly49</italic> gene family as well as <italic>Klrg1</italic> is located within the NKC on chromosome 6 (Yokoyama and Plougastel, 2003) …. expression of only Ly49A, encoded in the <italic>Ncr1</italic> locus located on chromosome 7, in Ly49KO mice on a H-2D<sup>d</sup> background restored KLRG1 expression”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, a better explanation for the possible influence of other inhibitory NK cell receptors still needs to be included. In the study by Zhang et al. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13032-5 the authors showed the synergized regulation of NK cell education by the NKG2A receptor and the specific Ly49 family members. Although in this study, Piersma and colleagues show the control of MHC-I deficient cells by Ly49A+ NKG2A-NK cells in Figure 4., this receptor is not mentioned in the Results or in the Discussion section, so its role in this story needs to be clarified. Therefore, the reader would benefit from more information regarding NKG2A receptor and NKG2A+/- populations in their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to describe our results in the context of other inhibitory receptors. To clarify the role of NKG2A and potentially other inhibitory receptors we have made the following improvements to our manuscript:</p><p>We discuss the role of NKG2A in the discussion section, which now include (lines 259-266):</p><p>“While our results did not interrogate licensing by inhibitory receptors outside of the Ly49 receptor family, such as has been reported for NKG2A (Anfossi et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2019), they do demonstrate that expression of Ly49A without other Ly49 family members can mediate NK cell licensing. Moreover, we found that Ly49 receptors are required and sufficient for missing-self rejection under steady-state conditions. However, these observations do not rule out involvement of other inhibitory receptors under specific inflammatory conditions. For example, NKG2A contributes to rejection of missing-self targets in poly(I:C)-treated mice (Zhang et al., 2019).”</p><p>We also added the following to the result section (lines 179-182):</p><p>NKG2A has been implicated in NK cell licensing by the non-classical MHC-I molecule Qa1 (Anfossi et al., 2006), to eliminate potential confounding effects by this interaction, effector functions of NKG2A- NK cells were evaluated as described before (Bern et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Piersma et al. successfully generated a mouse model with all Ly49n et al., 2017 genes knocked out, resulting in the complete absence of Ly49 receptor expression on the cell surface. The absence of Ly49 expression led to the loss of NK cell education/licensing and consequently, a failure in responsiveness against missing-self target cells. The experimental work and findings are partially overlapping with the previous work by Zhang et al. (2019), who also performed knockout of the entire Ly49 locus in mice and demonstrated that loss of NK responsiveness was due to the removal of inhibitory, and not activating Ly49 genes. The authors demonstrate the restoration of NK cell licensing by knocking in a single Ly49 gene, Ly49A, in a mouse expressing the H-2D<sup>d</sup> ligand for this receptor, which is a novel and important finding.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors established a novel mouse model enabling them to have a clean and thorough study on the function of Ly49 on NK cell licensing. Also, by knocking in a single Ly49, they were able to investigate the function of a given Ly49 receptor excluding the &quot;contamination&quot; of co-expression of any other Ly49 genes. Their idea and method were novel though the mouse model was somehow genetically similar to a previous study. The experiment design and data interpretation were logically clear and the evidence was solid.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The paper is very poorly written and confusing. The authors should be more accurate in the usage of terminology, provide more details on experimental procedures, and revise much of the text to improve clarity and coherence. A thorough revision aiming to clarify the paper would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that the manuscript was confusing to the reviewer. We have made thorough revisions to the different sections, which we hope will improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>We have made changes to all sections of the manuscript, including the title. These revisions include improved clarity on description of NK cell licensing and consistent usage throughout the manuscript, per the reviewer recommendations. We hope that all our improvements help the clarity of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I was confused by lines 262-270 in the discussion. The data from Hanke et al. is presented as contradictory to the observation that Ly49s bind more efficiently to H2-Kb than -Db, but they showed that Ly49c/i did not bind Kb-deficient cells, supporting the preferred binding to Kb.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this issue and the paragraph now reads: “This is further supported by early studies using Ly49 transfectants binding to Con A blasts showing that Ly49C and Ly49I can bind to H-2D<sup>b</sup>-deficient but not H-2K<sup>b</sup>-deficient cells (Hanke et al., 1999), despite the caveat of testing binding to cells overexpressing Ly49s in these studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors' conclusion that one type of inhibitory Ly49 receptor expressed on NK cells is sufficient for successful licensing and rejection of missing self-cells is a significant step forward. However, it would be beneficial to complement this with additional data. For instance, exploring the role of a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor responsible for licensing in a mouse model with a different haplotype (e.g. Ly49C or Ly49I on H-2b MHC I haplotype in C57BL/6J mice) could provide valuable insights and open new avenues for research in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it will be important to extend our findings to additional MHC-I haplotypes with single cognate Ly49 receptors. While these experiments are subject of our ongoing studies, they are beyond the scope of the current manuscript considering the significant effort, time, and cost to generate these new Ly49C and Ly49I knockin mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Specific issues that should be addressed are as follows:</p><p>(1) The title of the paper: &quot;Expression of a single inhibitory Ly49 receptor is sufficient to license NK cells for effector functions&quot; is ambiguous. When I first read the title, I thought the authors meant that only a single Ly49 molecule on the NK cell surface was necessary to induce licensing. It might be better to replace &quot;single inhibitory receptor&quot; with &quot;single member of Ly49 receptor family&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to: “Expression of a single inhibitory member of the Ly49 receptor family is sufficient to license NK cells for effector functions”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the abstract, introduction, and results, the authors distinguish &quot;licensing&quot; and &quot;rejection of missing-self targets&quot; as two distinct phenomena. An example includes Abstract, lines 51-53: &quot;Herein, we showed mice lacking expression of all Ly49s were unable to reject missing-self target cells in vivo, were defective in NK cell licensing, and displayed lower KLRG1 on the surface of NK cells&quot;. Similarly, the title of the second subsection of the Results states: &quot;Ly49-deficient NK cells are defective in licensing and rejection of cognate MHC-I deficient target cells&quot; (line 176). In these instances, it seems that by &quot;licensing&quot;, they mean only response to plate-bound anti-NK1.1 stimulation and not a response to missing-self targets. Alternatively, in the first paragraph of the Discussion, it sounds as if licensing includes both anti-NK1.1 and missing-self responses (lines 258-260): &quot;...NK cells were fully licensed in terms of their functional phenotype, including the capacity to be activated by an activation receptor in vitro and efficient rejection of MHC-I deficient target cells in vivo&quot;. Please define the terms and use the terms consistently throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We were the first to describe the term licensing and have defined this as acquisition of NK cell functional competence by self-MHC molecules (Kim et al., 2005), which is characterized by increased NK cell effector functions to activating signals. Thus, licensed NK cells are prevented from attacking normal MHC-I<sup>+</sup> cells by the same self-MHC-I-specific receptor that conferred licensing, while unlicensed NK cells without appropriate Ly49 receptors are functionally incompetent.</p><p>To clarify we made changes throughout the manuscript including the following:</p><p>Lines 91-101:</p><p>“In addition to effector function in missing-self, Ly49 receptors that recognize their cognate MHC-I ligands are involved in licensing or education of NK cells to acquire functional competence. NK cell licensing is characterized by potent effector functions including IFNγ production and degranulation in response to activation receptor stimulation (Elliott et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2005). Like missing-self recognition, inhibitory Ly49s require SHP-1 for NK cell licensing which interacts with the ITIM-motif encoded in the cytosolic tail of inhibitory Ly49s (Bern et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2005; Viant et al., 2014). Moreover, lower expression of SHP-1, particularly within the immunological synapse, is associated with licensed NK cells (Schmied et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021). Thus, inhibitory Ly49s have a second function that licenses NK cells to self-MHC-I thereby generating functionally competent NK cells but it has not been possible to exclude contributions from other co-expressed Ly49s.”</p><p>Lines 268-271 (previously 258-260):</p><p>“Yet the NK cells were fully licensed in terms of IFNγ production and degranulation in vitro and efficiently rejected MHC-I deficient target cells in vivo.
