Recently, genetic screening identified heterozygous <italic>KCNMA1</italic> variants in a subset of patients with debilitating paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, presenting with or without epilepsy (PNKD3). However, the relevance of <italic>KCNMA1</italic> mutations and the basis for clinical heterogeneity in PNKD3 has not been established. Here, we evaluate the relative severity of three <italic>KCNMA1</italic> patient variants in BK channels, neurons, and mice. In heterologous cells, BK<sup>N999S</sup> and BK<sup>D434G</sup> channels displayed gain-of-function (GOF) properties, whereas BK<sup>H444Q</sup> channels showed loss-of-function (LOF) properties. The relative degree of channel activity was BK<sup>N999S</sup> &gt; BK<sup>D434G</sup>&gt;WT &gt; BK<sup>H444Q</sup>. BK currents and action potential firing were increased, and seizure thresholds decreased, in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/WT</sup> transgenic mice but not <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/WT</sup> mice. In a novel behavioral test for paroxysmal dyskinesia, the more severely affected <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice became immobile after stress. This was abrogated by acute dextroamphetamine treatment, consistent with PNKD3-affected individuals. Homozygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice showed similar immobility, but in contrast, homozygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> mice displayed hyperkinetic behavior. These data establish the relative pathogenic potential of patient alleles as N999S&gt;D434G&gt;H444Q and validate <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice as a model for PNKD3 with increased seizure propensity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>So far, only 70 patients around the world have been diagnosed with a newly identified rare syndrome known as <italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy. The condition is characterised by seizures and abnormal movements which include frequent ‘drop attacks’, a sudden and debilitating loss of muscle control that causes patients to fall without warning.</p><p>The disease is associated with mutations in the gene for KCNMA1, a member of a class of proteins important for controlling nerve cell activity and brain function. However, due to the limited number of people affected by the condition, it is difficult to link a particular mutation to the observed symptoms; the basis for the drop attacks therefore remains unknown. Park et al. set out to ‘model’ <italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy in the laboratory, in order to determine which mutations in the <italic>KCNMA1</italic> gene caused these symptoms.</p><p>Three groups of mice were each genetically engineered to carry either one of the two most common mutations in the gene for KCNMA1, or a very rare mutation associated with the movement symptoms. Behavioural experiments and studies of nerve cell activity revealed that the mice carrying mutations that made the KCNMA1 protein more active developed seizures more easily and became immobilized, showing the mouse version of drop attacks. Giving these mice the drug dextroamphetamine, which works in some human patients, stopped the immobilizing attacks altogether.</p><p>These results show for the first time which specific genetic changes cause the main symptoms of <italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy. Park et al. hope that this knowledge will deepen our understanding of this disease and help develop better treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium-activated potassium channel</kwd><kwd>paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>KCNMA1</kwd><kwd>BK channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHLBI HL102758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meredith</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS T32-GM008181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matychak</surname><given-names>Katia K</given-names></name><name><surname>Meredith</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The American Physiological Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ryuji Ueno Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meredith</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIAMS T32-AR007592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Su Mi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NINDS NS114122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crino</surname><given-names>Peter B</given-names></name><name><surname>Iffland</surname><given-names>Philip H</given-names><suffix>II</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1UL1TR003098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meredith</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Among three new models for <italic>KCNMA1</italic> channelopathy, the most severe gain-of-function variant (<italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup>) displays a particular type of immobilizing paroxysmal dyskinesia observed in patients, including amphetamine responsiveness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy encompasses an array of neurological symptoms associated with clinical detection of a <italic>KCNMA1</italic> variant. Affected individuals typically present with epilepsy and/or dyskinesia, but also have other disorders including ataxia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and brain and structural abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>).

Since most variants arise de novo in a single heterozygous proband, whether ‘<italic>KCNMA1</italic> channelopathy’ is a bona fide monogenic disorder, or results from intergenic and developmental interactions, is not well understood.

With respect to action potentials, modulation of repolarization and the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in repetitive firing occurs with both BK channel inhibition (slower repolarization and reduced AHP amplitude) and activation (faster repolarization and increased AHP amplitude) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Montgomery and Meredith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shao et al., 1999</xref>).

However, this reduction was not as large as the difference between <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice and their respective controls. Total EEG power from <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/WT</sup> mice was not different from WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii</xref>). Therefore, the D434G variant also increased the propensity for seizure in the transgenic model, consistent with its ability to alter neuronal excitability, but was less severe than the N999S variant. The phenotype assessed here for <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/WT</sup> is also less severe than reported in a knock-in mouse model with the D434G mutation introduced in the context of a Cre/lox cassette. Those mice showed spontaneous spike-wave discharges in both the heterozygous and homozygous configuration with complete penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>), a phenotype that appears more severe than reported in the D434G pedigree, in which only half experience seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although no patients have a homozygous D434G genotype, a limited number of <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice were available for EEG analysis. We tested whether <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice, producing only mutant BK channel homotetramers, had a more severe phenotype.

For H444Q, this data suggests the lack of change in dentate granule neuron BK currents and excitability may be consistent with other areas of the brain, producing no change in seizure propensity indicative of widespread hyperexcitability. Overall, alterations in BK current and firing detected concurrently with lowered seizure threshold suggests that the GOF variants N999S and D434G have the potential to contribute to seizure risk by changing neuronal activity in a mouse model.

PNKD3 episodes are not initiated by movement or exertion (non-kinesigenic), but rather by negative and positive triggers such as strong emotion (stress and excitement), cold, fatigue, or alcohol. The events are not associated with epileptiform activity on EEG and are generally unresponsive to anti-seizure medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>). PNKD3 is associated with substantial morbidity due to its high frequency, with hundreds of episodes per day. All three variants tested in this study are associated with PNKD, with 75% of individuals harboring N999S and D434G carrying the diagnosis but also observed at lower incidence with LOF variants or VUS (variant of uncertain significance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>There are currently no standardized behavioral assays for either PNKD3 or non-<italic>KCNMA1</italic>-associated PNKD.

Besides stress, PNKD3 episodes can be triggered by positive emotions or excitement, similar to cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dauvilliers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelley, 2001</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sun et al., 2019a</xref>). Related to the reward and arousal effects in mice, cataplexy can be provoked in narcoleptic orexin-deficient (<italic>Hcrt</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup>) mice by wheel running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">España et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahoney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Novak et al., 2012</xref>). We also assessed this positive trigger to determine if voluntary wheel running could produce a PNKD-like behavior in the setting of a more complex motor task. In this assay, <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice covered a shorter distance compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Ai</xref>). The reduction in running distance was not due to a decrease in the maximum speed the mice could achieve, but instead occurred as a result of increased gaps in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Aii–iv</xref>). These gaps could be consistent with, but not exclusively attributable to, cessation of running during a PNKD-like immobility. However, we cannot rule out the reduced distance as a result of a baseline dyskinesia or muscle weakness, since <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice also show decreased time to fall in the rotarod and hanging wire assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>).</p><p>PNKD3 is also exhibited in individuals harboring heterozygous D434G variants and is provoked by additional triggers besides stress, such as alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2005</xref>). However, without diagnostic standardization, it is not clear whether this constitutes a different type of PNKD episode in individuals harboring D434G compared to N999S. In the stress assay, <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/WT</sup> mice and WT littermates had similar immobility lasting 53±9 and 63±6 s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, in homozygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice, immobility time was similar to N999S heterozygotes (101±11 s). Thus, stress-induced dyskinesia is present in the D434G mouse model. It remains possible that alcohol would also be capable of triggering these episodes, but it is difficult to assess given the bi-directional motor effects of alcohol in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones and Mormède, 2000</xref>). <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice have aspects of reduced motor coordination on the rotarod and running wheels but are not hypokinetic under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, homozygous LOF manipulations showed a different directionality in stress-triggered dyskinetic behavior, with less immobility after restraint than either WT or heterozygous littermates. No phenotypic differences were detected in heterozygous mice of either line. However, immobility in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> mice was reduced to 16±6 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> mice, it was reduced to 27±7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Three <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> mice also showed hyperactive circling and rapid limb movements notable to the blinded observer, and one had notable tremor during the brief non-active periods. <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> mice had reduced latencies to fall from the hanging wire under basal conditions, but only <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> mice are profoundly impaired on the rotarod and running wheels due to ataxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). The reduced motor performance in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> mice stands in contrast to the reduction in immobility observed after stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). These data reveal that the H444Q variant and <italic>KCNMA1</italic> null genotypes are not associated with PNKD immobility under the same triggers that provoke GOF variants. The results raise the possibility that stress-induced dyskinesia manifestation is influenced by mutation type, with GOF producing hypokinetic and LOF producing hyperkinetic responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have characterized the channel properties, neuronal activity, neurobehavioral phenotypes, and relative severity of three <italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy variants under equivalent conditions. Pathogenic potential was established using four criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">MacArthur et al., 2014</xref>): (1) low variant frequency in the human population, classifying as a mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>), (2) variant alters BK channel gating properties, (3) variant alters neuronal BK currents and firing, since the channelopathy is a neurological disorder, and (4) variant produces phenotypes similar to the central patient diagnoses— seizure susceptibility and PNKD. The findings support the conclusion that <italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy, although symptomatically heterogenous and comprised predominantly of de novo variants, has the potential to be categorized as a monogenic disorder. The results substantiate hyperexcitability, increased seizure propensity, and PNKD as collective phenotypes replicated in two hypermorphic GOF <italic>KCNMA1</italic> alleles. Moreover, our data for N999S and D434G corroborate mounting evidence, both in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kratschmer et al., 2021</xref>), that PNKD can be considered the most consistent symptom for <italic>KCNMA1</italic> GOF channelopathy.</p><p>N999S produced the strongest GOF effect on BK channel properties under these study conditions. Although N999S is the most commonly reported <italic>KCNMA1</italic> variant, direct evidence that it caused channelopathy was lacking because it arose de novo in all known cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>). In mice, our data validate its dominant inheritance and pathogenic potential as a GOF mutation able to increase BK current and neuronal activity in the heterozygous configuration in mice. Neurobehavioral validation further identified increased PTZ-induced seizure propensity and stress-triggered dyskinesia episodes resembling PNKD-like immobility, broadly consistent with the phenotypic occurrence in patients. The lethality of homozygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/N999S</sup> (and hemizygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/Δ</sup>) genotypes, which have not been found in any patient, underscore the severity of this variant. It is not known which cell type the lethality stems from, but N999S channels can produce both increased peak action potential-evoked and subthreshold BK current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moldenhauer et al., 2020b</xref>). Thus it is possible that N999S could increase firing in some cells, exemplified by the effect in dentate granule neurons, or prevent firing, depending on the cellular context.</p><p>D434G, a less severe GOF mutation than N999S at the BK channel level, had dominant inheritance for a subset of traits in our model, partially paralleling the familial pedigree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2005</xref>). The increased BK current, excitability, and PTZ-induced seizure propensity in the heterozygous configuration validated D434G pathogenicity. However, homozygosity was required to produce the PNKD-like immobility attacks, ranking D434G less pathogenic than N999S. While <italic>Kcnma1</italic> <sup>D434G/D434G</sup> mice would produce obligate homotetrameric mutant BK channels, additional work is needed to understand whether the decreased severity in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/WT</sup> mice is indicative of heterotetrameric (WT:D434G) BK channel formation. Interestingly, three other D434G models have been reported, with some phenotypic variation. BAC-loxP-D434G mice exhibited GTC seizures in the absence of motor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ling et al., 2016</xref>). Another Cre/lox-D434G mouse line was comparatively more severe with complete penetrance of absence seizures and dyskinesia in the heterozygous configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). This variability, observed in both mouse models and incomplete penetrance in patients, raises the possibility that additional genetic or environmental factors can influence symptomatic severity. Nevertheless, an analogous mutation in flies also alters neuronal activity and baseline motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kratschmer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The LOF variant, H444Q, demonstrated limited pathogenicity by decreasing BK channel activity but was not validated as a hypomorphic or haploinsufficient allele in neurons or mice. Homozygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> mice showed a neurobehavioral phenotype distinct from PNKD: stress-induced hyperkinetic motor responses similar to <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> null mice. Given multiple genetic findings and symptomatic ambiguity in the patient carrying this variant, the different dyskinetic responses compared to the two GOF models may suggest a basis to improve the diagnostic investigations for this and other <italic>KCNMA1</italic> variants classified as LOF or VUS. At present, there are no patients with homozygous <italic>KCNMA1</italic> alleles validated as functionally null for channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>), but the ataxia, tremor, decreased strength, and hyperactivity in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>‒/‒</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Imlach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Meredith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meredith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sausbier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Typlt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) are symptoms observed at lower incidence among patients. Lastly, our experimental conditions failed to corroborate the influence of LOF alleles on seizure propensity predicted from several animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ermolinsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuebler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pacheco Otalora et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sheehan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shruti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>KCNMA1</italic> LOF channelopathy has also been proposed to carry a broader set of non-overlapping features associated with a subset of de novo LOF variants, referred to as Liang-Wang syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2019</xref>). However, none of the observable patient correlates were present in the LOF H444Q model studied here.

The allelic series established from N999S, D434G, and H444Q BK channels in vitro is outwardly congruent with the relative severity in mice. Such allelic series have been pivotal in understanding other complex channelopathies, especially those delineating distinct disorders within the same gene association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Noebels, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pietrobon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zwingman et al., 2001</xref>). However, it is not yet clear whether all <italic>KCNMA1</italic> variants discovered in the setting of neurological diagnoses carry the same pathogenic potential. Because this <italic>KCNMA1</italic> allelic series was derived from a limited set of conditions, designations of phenotypic severity could be further influenced by additional factors.</p><p>At the DNA level, it is likely that all three variant-containing alleles are expressed because the homozygous phenotypes are dissimilar to <italic>Kcnma1<sup>‒/‒</sup>: Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/N999S</sup> and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> have unique phenotypes not found in <italic>Kcnma1<sup>‒/‒</sup></italic> (lethality and stress-induced immobility, respectively), and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup> had fewer and less severe phenotypes than <italic>Kcnma1<sup>‒/‒</sup></italic> (e.g., rotarod). However, the phenotypic severity for the human variants could be mitigated by their context within the mouse gene, which was not humanized through additional rounds of gene editing. Mouse and human BK channels differ at eight constitutive coding residues and have minor differences in BK current properties in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai, 2015</xref>). D434G produces a larger GOF effect on the G-V relationship in the context of a human BK channel compared to mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, as the least potent variant, it is possible that H444Q has a further reduced effect on BK channel properties in mouse, potentially contributing to the lack of BK current differences.</p><p>At the channel level, unresolved questions concerning functional mechanisms and subunit composition illustrate the influence of additional factors besides variant genotype on the phenotypic severity. For example, BK current levels were relatively similar between <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/WT</sup> in one type of neuron (dentate granule), yet these two heterozygous genotypes exhibited differences in excitability. Instead, homozygous <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> firing curves were more comparable to <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup>. Underlying this, the ratio of expression from WT and mutant alleles, stoichiometry and properties of heterotetrameric channels, alternative splice variation, and the composition of α:β:Ca<sub>V</sub> macrocomplexes in the loci responsible for neuropathology in heterozygous transgenic mice all still remain to be resolved. Additional experiments to probe the voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent bases for N999S and D434G gating defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diez-Sampedro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moldenhauer et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), and the manifestation in the presence of the highly expressed β4 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkefeld and Fakler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), may also further explain these relative differences in BK currents and pathogenicity. Interestingly, no <italic>KCNMB4</italic> variants associated with seizure have been described yet, even as the number of seizure-associated BKα variants has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>). This could suggest that loss of β4 regulation would have more severe consequences.</p><p>At the neurobehavioral level, increased dentate granule cell excitability may contribute directly or indirectly to the reduced seizure thresholds, but other areas of the brain are additionally involved in the generalized PTZ-evoked seizures. The BK channel inhibitor paxilline can block chemoconvulsant-induced seizures, associated with changes in cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sheehan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shruti et al., 2008</xref>). These data suggest additional neurons to investigate for links between GOF BK channels and hyperexcitability. It is also not clear yet how PNKD-like symptomology is produced. BK channels regulate excitability in several motor-associated regions including the cerebellum, striatum, neuromuscular junction, and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sausbier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tricarico et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vatanpour and Harvey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Cre/lox-D434G and <italic>PRRT2</italic> mice show changes in cerebellar excitability and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calame et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>) but do not show hypokinetic PNKD described in this study. In other PNKD animal models, as in patients, the brain mechanisms are not well understood. Some PNKDs respond to anti-epileptic medications, a few respond to deep-brain stimulation, but most necessitate trigger avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Manso-Calderón, 2019</xref>). In PNKD3, stimulants (lisdexamfetamine and dextroamphetamine) are highly effective in reducing attacks described as both dystonic and hypotonic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), but neither drug has a direct effect on BK<sup>WT</sup> channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) or BK<sup>N999S</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) in heterologous cells, leaving the target for their actions on PNKD3 an open question. The significant reduction in stress-induced immobility with d-amp treatment in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> mice substantiates the utility of this model in future studies dissecting the cell and circuit basis for the PNKD3. Clinical observations and d-amp responsiveness in patients predict a central neurological dysfunction in producing the debilitating hypokinetic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Keros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), but whether other factors such as altered neuromuscular transmission or episodic muscle hypotonia make some contribution during attacks remains to be systematically tested.</p><p>Changes in BK channel function and/or <italic>KCNMA1</italic> expression are associated with a growing number of neurodevelopmental disorders including epilepsy, dyskinesia, autism, Angelman’s syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and brain and skeletal malformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deng and Klyachko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kessi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kshatri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laumonnier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">N’Gouemo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sun et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sun et al., 2019b</xref>). Neuropathology in these disorders is associated with changes in BK channel activity in both directions. Yet it has been challenging to distill <italic>KCNMA1</italic>-linked channelopathy into a cohesive GOF versus LOF symptomology because the existing patient data lack genetic pedigrees and diagnostic cross-comparability. Looking ahead, the phenotypic penetrance and heterogeneity investigated here validate only a few of the 40+ patient-associated <italic>KCNMA1</italic> variants, but it will not be possible to make transgenic models for every case. There is less symptomatic consistency among non-GOF alleles (LOF or VUS), identifying this as a potentially fruitful area for future investigations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK<sup>N999S</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MG279689 with rs886039469</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK channel expression construct in pcDNA3.1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK<sup>D434G</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MG279689 with rs137853333</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK channel expression construct in pcDNA3.1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK<sup>H444Q</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MG279689 with c.1332C&gt;G, p.H444Q</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK channel expression construct in pcDNA3.1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK<sup>WT</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genbank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">hBK<sub>QEERL</sub><break/>MG279689</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BK channel expression construct in pcDNA3.1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-11268</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DMEM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gibco, Life Technologies Corp</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #11995-065</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fetal bovine serum</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #4135</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Penicillin/streptomycin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mediatech Inc</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #30-002 Cl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">L-glutamine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mediatech Inc</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #25-005 Cl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Trans-IT LT1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mirius Biological</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Poly-L-lysine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #P4832</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dextroamphetamine sulfate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #1180004</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kcnma1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene Bank;

Mice were acclimated to the testing environment in their normal housing cages for 1 hr prior to testing. Mice were trialed three times a day for 7 consecutive days under video capture. Body weight was measured on days 1 and 7. After placement on the rotarod (IITC Life Science Inc, Rat Mouse Rotarod), mice were acclimated on the apparatus for 30 s prior to first trial. During the acclimation, mice were allowed to fall off up to two times. Rod acceleration was 4–40 rpm over 5 min for each trial. Mice were given a 2 min inter-trial interval. ‘Fall’ was called when the mice fell off from the rod or made a 360 degree revolution around the rod. Three trials per day were averaged for each mouse.</p><p>Hypotonia and PNKD-like paroxysms would be expected to produce extremely short latencies to fall, since a single major loss of tone would be catastrophic for coordination. Alternately, baseline coordination could be impaired in the absence of immobility. Among the individual mice, there was no explicit evidence for individual trials with extremely short fall latencies that would be consistent with the triggering of sudden hypotonic events. However, partial loss of tone might be compensated for by the high level of attention induced in this assay. Compared to the voluntary running wheel activity, successful navigation of the rod’s surface and rotation requires a higher degree of attention to motor coordination than the wider home cage wheel. Thus, mice fall off the rotarod at lower speeds than the maximum speeds achieved on the voluntary running wheel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Hanging wire</title><p>Acute muscle strength was tested by hanging mice using their limbs.

Trial duration maximum was 120 s. A 10 s inter-trial interval was given after falling.

The statistical test used for each dataset is indicated in the figure legend, and p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. p-Values in figure legends are reported for post hoc tests when the main effect was p&lt;0.05, or reported for the main effect, if p&gt;0.05. Groups with three or fewer data points were not included in statistical analysis, as noted in legends. For parametric data, two-tailed, unpaired t-tests were performed with Welch’s correction for unequal variance. For multiple comparisons, one-way ANOVAs were performed with Welch’s correction followed by Dunnett’s T3 post hoc test. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed with Geisser-Greenhouse correction followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons (comparisons between genotypes across voltages). Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons were used for non-parametric data.</p><p>In gene microarray studies, differential mRNA transcript expression was determined at a 2-fold change cutoff, with p&gt;0.05 and false discovery rate, FDR = 0.99 using an ANOVA with an eBayes test was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) (Applied Biosystems Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) Software v4.0.1).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, established the transgenic lines, performed HEK cell recordings, and neuronal recordings., Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>performed locomotor assays, data analysis, and animal husbandry., Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, performed EEG recordings., Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, performed HEK cell recordings with d-amp and lis, animal husbandry, and provided electrophysiology analytical methodology., Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, assisted with EEG recordings and animal husbandry, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>established the transgenic lines and performed animal husbandry, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>performed open field assays and Ethovision analysis., Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, provided EEG recording set ups., Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>provided KCNMA1 sequences, patient data, designed the transgenic models, and provide analytical methods in electrophysiology and motor function., Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the University of Maryland School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #1120011).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-77953-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Locomotor wheel activity script.</title><p>Python code to calculate wheel speed and the number and duration of activity gaps.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-77953-code1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated and analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript, or provided as source data files.

excitability and translational biologists and physicians eager for robust animal models for disorders involving mutations in the KCNMA gene, such as paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia PNKD3. Here, phenotypes of mouse models of three of the more common patient disease-related mutations in KCNMA are evaluated for similarities to patient phenotypes. This work establishes that BK channel mutations linked to human neurological disease can, on their own, cause similar pathology in mice, and it also begins to provide neurological bases for the associated behavioral deficits. Importantly, one of the mutant alleles expressed in mice most closely phenocopies the patient phenotype, which is rescued with a new treatment for PNKD3 in KCNMA1-N999S patients, further validating it as an important animal model for studies seeking therapeutic treatments for the resulting debilitating disease moving forward.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77953.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01r9z8p25</institution-id><institution>University of La Laguna</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Giraldez</surname><given-names>Teresa</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01r9z8p25</institution-id><institution>University of La Laguna</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.15.478992">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.478992v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Teresa Giraldez as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that these results are interesting and compelling. However, reviewers also raised several concerns about the interpretation of the data that should be addressed by the authors. Essential revisions should include:</p><p>1) The gene dosage effect is not fully supported or discussed. Related to this, the assumption that in transgenic neurons all channels are heteromers, or to what extent this is the case, is not sufficiently discussed.</p><p>2) Nature of the native BK currents in transgenic neurons: what is the influence of different splicing variants, or regulatory subunits? Related to this question, two reviewers point out the apparent lack of effect of the mutations on Vhalf values in transgenic neurons, which should be also addressed.</p><p>3) Further discussion is needed about how increased BK current would enhance neuronal excitability and how this might it lead to the PKND phenotype.</p><p>4) Further discussion is needed to explain why the H444Q transgenic neurons produce WT-like currents and no alterations in excitability. As mentioned by one reviewer, could the LOF allele be associated with an upregulation of the WT allele in neurons, resulting in the normal phenotype?</p><p>5) Although the study seems rigorous, in some cases the sample sizes were rather low (e.g., Figure 4A-B, data H444Q/H444Q). In such cases, the number of experiments should be increased, or alternatively not shown.</p><p>6) Text should be revised according to all comments raised by the reviewers and listed in the individual reviews below.</p><p>Because the individual reviews include several important points they are included here for your reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is well written and structured. Data are solid and well presented. Some comments are detailed below.</p><p>P8, line 165: &quot;…gene expression was analysed from hippocampus and cerebellum of Kcnma1-N999S/WT and WT littermates. No significant differences were found in the levels…&quot; Does this refer to expression of Kcnma1 WT, mutant, or both? What is the conclusion of this experiment?</p><p>What are the expression levels of WT vs mutants? Do the proportions change when mutants and WT are co-expressed in HEK cells?</p><p>In experiments from Figure 2 and in general, in all data from heterozygous animal models, it appears that the authors are assuming that the currents correspond to mutant/WT heteromers. But this is not necessarily the case. This aspect should be better discussed. This is especially relevant in the case of the H444Q mutant (see below).</p><p>Figure 2C: H444Q/WT neurons produce similar currents than WT. Have the authors tested if H444Q mutants are being expressed in these neurons? Could these currents be produced just by WT? (non-significant differences are found in all other studied functional features, in Figure 3 and 4) Have the authors tested co-expression of H444Q/WT combinations in HEK cells?</p><p>What are the values for the BK G-V shifts observed in neurons from N999S/WT, D434G/WT and D434G/D434G mice?</p><p>Figure 4: The low number of experiments with homozygous D434G or H444Q is so low that as the authors remark it is impossible to obtain any conclusion. Is there any reason for this low number of experiments? If no more data are available, what is the purpose of showing inconclusive results here?</p><p>Figure 5A show data corresponding to control vs stress conditions for WT vs N999S mice. Panels C-E show data corresponding to stress conditions for the other mutants. How is the comparison of D434G and H444Q mice with and without stress conditions? In other words, do these mutants show any significant difference in mobility in basal conditions when compared to the WT?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) lines 184-195, Figure 2: The GOF mutants show an increase in the size of neuronal BK currents, but there is no apparent shift in the voltage-activation range for the mutants compared to WT, as one might expect based on the HEK recordings. So one wonders if the neuronal BK currents have been well-isolated, or if the presence of the BK-beta4 subunit in DG neurons decreases the shift that one might expect for the mutant currents. In either case, this should at least be addressed with some discussion.</p><p>2) lines 257-260 &quot;Analysis of waveforms from the 200 pA step corroborate BK channels regulate multiple phases of the action potential, but suggested the basis for increased firing in Kcnma1N999S/WT and Kcnma1D434G/D434G neurons was a faster AHP decay rate (Figure 3‒figure supplement 2), which would facilitate more rapid initiation of the next action potential.&quot;</p><p>As an explanation for the relation between the effects of these mutations on BK currents and their consequences on AP firing, this seems a bit counterintuitive. Figure 1 (panels C and G) shows that in HEK cells, N999S and D434G deactivate more slowly than WT. So wouldn't one expect these effects to lead to a slower AHP decay rate at negative voltage compared to WT? Also, is it known whether these mutations lead to different effects on BK gating kinetics when co-expressed with the beta4 subunit, or whether they may have different effects on action potential shape or AHP in other neurons? ? This may be worth a little more discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few other questions arose that could be interesting if addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>1. For example, what is the role of mutant muscle BK currents in disease phenotype?</p><p>2. Is there a possibility that the differences among GOF mutant phenotypes could be attributable to the splice variant context in different brain regions? Is this worth discussing?</p><p>3. Future studies might test whether the LOF allele is associated with an upregulation of the WT allele in neurons, resulting in the normal phenotype and possibly pointing to mechanisms accessible to rescue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77953.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that these results are interesting and compelling.

New data showing that dextroamphetamine can rescue the PNKDimmobility in <italic>Kcnma1<sup>N999S/WT</sup></italic> mice (new data in Figure 5C) provides the speculation for a potential CNS basis.

Do the proportions change when mutants and WT are co-expressed in HEK cells?</p></disp-quote><p>See the previous response clarifying that WT versus N999S expression levels cannot be obtained from the commercially-available microarray probe set we used. The levels were not assessed for the other mouse lines.</p><p>If changes in transcript levels did occur, we think they would be more likely to occur with the strongest mutation affecting channel properties (N999S). For N999S, the lack of change in total <italic>Kcnma1</italic> levels in two mouse brain regions does not provide an immediate reason to invoke changes in the ratio. We also don’t have reason to think that the CRISPR-introduced single base changes alter allelic expression ratios, now added as an additional comment on whether expression might affect the BK current levels observed in the study (lines 213-216).</p><p>We have limited data from co-expressed WT/N999S and WT/H444Q channels in HEK cells (see answers to the related question below also). The results are what would be expected: coexpressed channels have intermediate phenotypes for V<sub>1/2</sub>. However, looking more closely at individual values reveals bimodal distributions in both cases. Additional work would be required to determine whether this distribution is produced from WT, WT:mut, and Mut-only channels.</p><p>However, HEK cells are not an adequately quantitative system to address the issues of the ratio of WT and mutant allele expression. If the WT and mutant plasmids were transfected in a 1:1 ratio, mimicking a de novo heterozygous allele configuration, the plasmid promotor regions still lack genomic regulatory control sequences. Moreover, in a recent study addressing a similar issue, the effect of co-expressing WT BK channels and G375R mutant channels was assessed on stoichiometry (Geng et al., BioRxiv 2021), added to lines 223-225. In that study, 85% of the channels had at least 1 mutant subunit, with 12% containing all mutant or 3% all WT subunits. Yet knowing this from heterologous cells still leaves completely open how different neuronal types would manifest the same experiment, given the elaboration of ion channel trafficking and subcellular localization mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In experiments from Figure 2 and in general, in all data from heterozygous animal models, it appears that the authors are assuming that the currents correspond to mutant/WT heteromers.

The paragraph also incorporates additional aspects of the functional effects on BK currents raised in other questions below and from the other reviewers. Another new paragraph in the Discussion places the lack of understanding in this area in the context of how to think about phenotypic severity (lines 658-674).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C: H444Q/WT neurons produce similar currents than WT. Have the authors tested if H444Q mutants are being expressed in these neurons? Could these currents be produced just by WT?

Co-expressed WT/H444Q channels have intermediate phenotypes for V<sub>1/2</sub>. We also have a limited number of recordings ± β4. This data suggests that BK<sup>WT+H444Q</sup>, either with or without β4, is not distinguishable from BK<sup>WT</sup>+β4 in HEK cell recordings. New additions to the manuscript provide more discussion on the potential for β4 to be a key player in mitigating differences in Kcnma1<sup>H444Q/WT</sup> BK current properties, given its high levels in dentate granule neurons (see also lines 229-231). Future studies dissecting the expression, subunits, and localization for variant-containing channels could reveal a more detailed level of mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the values for the BK G-V shifts observed in neurons from N999S/WT, D434G/WT and D434G/D434G mice?</p></disp-quote><p>The apparent voltage-dependence calculated from fits of the average I/I<sub>max</sub> were not different for any of the transgenic conditions tested.

Added to the Results (lines 210-231), specifically:</p><p>“Several factors that could mitigate differences in V<sub>1/2</sub> are undefined, including the α</p><p>(WT:mutant) and β subunit stoichiometry, splice variant background, and intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>. Limited data is available addressing some of these. Co-expression of WT and mutant (GOF) BK channel cDNAs supports the assumption that heterotetramers are the predominant channel type produced by 1:1 transcript ratios in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> (Geng et al., 2021). A few studies have shown that N999S and D434G confer similar ∆V<sub>1/2</sub> onto different splice variants (Figure 1C-G; Li et al., 2018; Moldenhauer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2009) and maintain left-shifted V<sub>1/2</sub> values compared to WT in the presence of the β4 subunit (Berkefeld and Fakler, 2013; Li et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2009). Yet with D434G, less of a difference ± β4 is found above 10 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Wang et al., 2009), which could be significant in granule neurons given the widespread abundance of β4.”</p><p>Added to the Discussion (lines 658-674):</p><p>“At the channel level, unresolved questions concerning functional mechanisms and subunit composition illustrate the influence of additional factors besides variant genotype on the phenotypic severity. For example, BK current levels were relatively similar between Kcnma1<sup>N999S/WT</sup> and Kcnma1<sup>D434G/WT</sup> in one type of neuron (dentate granule), yet these two heterozygous genotypes exhibited differences in excitability. Instead, homozygous Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup> firing curves were more comparable to Kcnma1<sup>N999S/WT</sup>. Underlying this, the ratio of expression from WT and mutant alleles, stoichiometry and properties of heterotetrameric channels, alternative splice variation, and the composition of α:β:CaV macrocomplexes in the loci responsible for neuropathology in heterozygous transgenic mice all still remain to be resolved. Additional experiments to probe the voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent bases for N999S and D434G gating defects (Diez-Sampedro et al., 2006; Du et al., 2005; Li et al., 2018; Moldenhauer et al., 2020; Yang, 2010), and the manifestation in the presence of the highly-expressed β4 subunit (Wang et al., 2009; Berkefeld and Fakler, 2013; Wang et al., 2016), may further explain these relative differences in BK currents and pathogenicity. Interestingly, no KCNMB4 variants associated with seizure have been described yet, even as the number of seizure-associated BKα variants has increased (Bailey et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2021). This could suggest that loss of β4 regulation could have more severe consequences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The low number of experiments with homozygous D434G or H444Q is so low that as the authors remark it is impossible to obtain any conclusion. Is there any reason for this low number of experiments? If no more data are available, what is the purpose of showing inconclusive results here?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Kcnma1<sup>H444Q/H444Q</sup></italic> data were inadvertently included in Figure 4Aiii and Biii. There was no conclusion in the text from this data, and it was not included in statistical analysis. The figure and figure legend have been corrected.</p><p>The <italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup></italic> data have also been removed from the figure itself, addressing a concern of reviewer #3 as well. The individual measurements themselves have been transferred to the Results text (lines 385-387). We think the <italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup></italic> seizure threshold and power values merit inclusion as individual measurements in order to make direct comparisons with other independent D434G studies. Because the three measurements in our dataset were consistent, a trend toward the shortest seizure latencies is suggested. This provides a basis for comparison to an independently generated D434G mouse model (Dong et al., 2022). We hope removal from the figure still allows for cross-comparability with other datasets, without overemphasizing a conclusion based on a dataset comprised of 3 measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5A show data corresponding to control vs stress conditions for WT vs N999S mice. Panels C-E show data corresponding to stress conditions for the other mutants. How is the comparison of D434G and H444Q mice with and without stress conditions? In other words, do these mutants show any significant difference in mobility in basal conditions when compared to the WT?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the experiments without restraint stress and with restraint stress are conducted on separate cohorts, we did not have enough <italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup></italic> and <italic>Kcnma1<sup>H444Q/ H444Q</sup></italic> animals to perform this control for every mouse line. However, the construct validity for the PNKD assay is further supported by new data in panel 5C. The new data show that restraint stress conducted with a modification to the original methodology (using a plexiglass restraint, after injecting the mice, and analyzed by two independent experimenters using separate manual and automated analysis methods) still cannot induce significant immobility in any WT animals.</p><p>To answer the second question, Figure 6 supplements 1 and 2 contain experiments addressing baseline mobility differences for D434G and H444Q mice. These data show some aspects of reduced motor coordination (6-1Ci and 6-2Bi <italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup></italic> and 6-2Aii <italic>Kcnma1<sup>H444Q/ H444Q</sup></italic>). However, these baseline defects are not likely to affect the immobility observed in the stress-induced dyskinesia assay, which is conducted in a beaker (10 cm diameter). Details for the baseline motor phenotypes were added to lines 553-554 (<italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup></italic>) and to lines 561-566 (<italic>Kcnma1<sup>H444Q/ H444Q</sup></italic> and <italic>Kcnma1<sup>—/—</sup></italic>). We have also performed gait analysis under basal conditions using CatWalk (data not shown). Based all these assays, we do not think there are any confounding ataxic or hypotonic phenotypes in any of the variant-containing transgenic lines that would caveat the interpretations for the stress-induced dyskinesia assay in the beaker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) lines 184-195, Figure 2: The GOF mutants show an increase in the size of neuronal BK currents, but there is no apparent shift in the voltage-activation range for the mutants compared to WT, as one might expect based on the HEK recordings. So one wonders if the neuronal BK currents have been well-isolated, or if the presence of the BK-beta4 subunit in DG neurons decreases the shift that one might expect for the mutant currents. In either case, this should at least be addressed with some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In the whole-cell slice recording context, our conclusions are limited to comparisons between BK current levels. The biophysical properties and their underlying mechanisms are more advanced topic that requires a different study design. It is correct that the apparent voltage dependence derived from fits of the average I/I<sub>max</sub> are not different for any of the transgenic conditions tested (see response to Reviewer #1). To address this, a new paragraph identifying the potential influence of α (WT:mutant) stoichiometry, β subunits, splice variant background, and intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> has been added at the end of the section reporting the neuronal BK current levels (lines 210-231). There is not enough cross-comparable data in the literature (collected under conditions relevant to those employed in this study) to speculate which mechanism may contribute the most to the lack of difference observed in V<sub>1/2</sub> values, but we agree that the possibility that the highly expressed β4 subunit would mitigate some of these differences should be added into the discussion. These ideas are also brought back into the summaries on channel and neuronal factors that contribute to phenotypic variability in the re-organized Discussion (lines 658-674).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) lines 257-260 &quot;Analysis of waveforms from the 200 pA step corroborate BK channels regulate multiple phases of the action potential, but suggested the basis for increased firing in Kcnma1N999S/WT and Kcnma1D434G/D434G neurons was a faster AHP decay rate (Figure 3‒figure supplement 2), which would facilitate more rapid initiation of the next action potential.&quot;</p><p>As an explanation for the relation between the effects of these mutations on BK currents and their consequences on AP firing, this seems a bit counterintuitive. Figure 1 (panels C and G) shows that in HEK cells, N999S and D434G deactivate more slowly than WT. So wouldn't one expect these effects to lead to a slower AHP decay rate at negative voltage compared to WT? Also, is it known whether these mutations lead to different effects on BK gating kinetics when co-expressed with the beta4 subunit, or whether they may have different effects on action potential shape or AHP in other neurons? ? This may be worth a little more discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Without knowledge of the additional factors discussed in prior questions (heterotetramer formation, β subunits, etc), the data from this study are insufficient to make straight-forward correlations concerning BK channel and action potential properties. Our study design was limited to the characterizing the action potential waveforms during increased firing. To address the concern and perceived relationship between the properties linked to homotetrameric mutant BK channels and the transgenic neuronal action potentials, we added a new paragraph at the end of the Results section reporting action potential effects (lines 294-304). The paragraph more clearly states that mechanism by which GOF BK channels facilitate AHP decay is not revealed in this study. Though the N999S and D434G variants both slow deactivation in heterologous cells, the deactivation rate remains to be defined in <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>N999S/WT</sup> and <italic>Kcnma1</italic><sup>D434G/D434G</sup> neurons under repetitive firing conditions. Additional recordings under clamped Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly measuring deactivation in <italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/WT</sup></italic>, <italic>Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup></italic>, <italic>Kcnma1<sup>N999S/WT</sup></italic>, and the respective control dentate granule neurons would be necessary. However, the slowed deactivation of mutant channels versus the accelerated AHP decay is an interesting paradox that can be informed by some prior studies with deletion of the β4 subunit. Loss of β4 produces increased BK channel open probability, fast gating, and is associated with similar changes in the action potential. These details are elaborated in the new paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A few other questions arose that could be interesting if addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>1. For example, what is the role of mutant muscle BK currents in disease phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and salient question, and one where we don’t have definitive data from patients that inform our thinking. One patient harboring the N999S variant exhibited hypotonia at birth, but underwent EMG and NCV testing as a child, which were both normal. So far, I am aware of only this single patient (who also harbors additional genetic findings) who has undergone this testing. New genotype-phenotype observations from the growing patient population will hopefully shed further light on this issue.</p><p>At the level of the BK channel, strong GOF mutations such as N999S show significant subthreshold current using a CNS action potential stimulus in 10 µM intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> (and to a much lesser extent with D434G; Moldenhauer et al., 2019). This raises the possibility that GOF mutations could hyperpolarize skeletal muscle to decrease contraction, contributing to hypotonia. We previously opened the possibility that hypotonia could manifest in several of the motor assays we conducted, such as open field (which is normal, lines 518; Figure 6B), running wheel activity (which shows increased gaps, but no change in peak speed, lines 520-521; Figure 6Ai-Aiv), rotarod and hanging wire (which were both abnormal; line 540-541; Figure 6C-D). Thus hypotonia cannot be definitively ruled out.</p><p>Underscoring the complexity of this question, both these GOF lines and Kcnma1<sup>—/—</sup> (LOF) show behavioral indicators of muscle weakness (Figure 6C, Figure 6—figure supplement 2A), which in the case of Kcnma1<sup>—/—</sup> is associated with decreased NMJ transmission (Wang et al., 2020). Whether this also occurs in Kcnma1<sup>N999S/WT</sup> and Kcnma1<sup>D434G/D434G</sup> is best answered by recording NMJ transmission and muscle V<sub>m</sub>/contraction directly in a future study.</p><p>D-amp rescue of the stress-induced dyskinesia also indirectly suggests hypotonia is not a major contributor to the immobility, as it would not be d-amp responsive at the low dose used in the study. This is summarized as a future direction in the expanded neurobehavioral Discussion paragraph:</p><p>“Clinical observations and d-amp responsiveness in patients predict a central neurological dysfunction in producing the debilitating hypokinetic state (Keros et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2020), but whether other factors such altered neuromuscular transmission or episodic muscle hypotonia make some contribution during attacks remains to be systematically tested.” (Lines 696-697).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is there a possibility that the differences among GOF mutant phenotypes could be attributable to the splice variant context in different brain regions? Is this worth discussing?</p></disp-quote><p>Splice variation in the brain has the potential to alter neuronal BK current properties from those predicted in heterologous cells, lines 221-222. In addition, more details of mechanisms that would contribute to differences in phenotypic severity were added to the Discussion. Already mentioned in this section was the differing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage dependent mechanisms between N999S and D434G, but splice variation is now added in this paragraph as well (line 665).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Future studies might test whether the LOF allele is associated with an upregulation of the WT allele in neurons, resulting in the normal phenotype and possibly pointing to mechanisms accessible to rescue.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the lack of phenotype in H444Q mice is due to the smaller effect on channel properties, as well as the possibility of contribution from other mutations that explain the severity of the patient phenotype. Although we don’t think the single nucleotide modifications for any of the variants are likely to change WT allele expression (line 215-216), it remains a formal possibility, given the lack of biophysical data from neuronal recordings to rule it in or out through electrophysiology. There are a few examples of heterozygous phenotypes in the <italic>Kcnma1<sup>—/+</sup></italic> (aka Slo het) mice, so this suggests there are at least some cases where loss of the 2<sup>nd</sup> <italic>Kcnma1</italic> allele is compensated (presumably that would occur from the WT allele), but it hasn’t been studied directly. As suggested in the question, such a compensatory mechanism could be important for rescuing LOF-related pathophysiology. Delivery of WT BK channel cDNAs has already been tested in human patients with urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction (Melman et al., 2005 and 2006), suggesting the potential success for such a treatment in other paradigms such as congenital mutations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
