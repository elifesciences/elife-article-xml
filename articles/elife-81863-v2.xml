that synaptic dynamics from excitatory to inhibitory neuron types are often dependent on the target cell type. However, these target cell-specific properties have not been well investigated in human cortex, where there are major technical challenges in reliably obtaining healthy tissue, conducting multiple patch-clamp recordings on inhibitory cell types, and identifying those cell types. Here, we take advantage of newly developed methods for human neurosurgical tissue analysis with multiple patch-clamp recordings, <italic>post-hoc</italic> fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), machine learning-based cell type classification and prospective GABAergic AAV-based labeling to investigate synaptic properties between pyramidal neurons and PVALB- vs. SST-positive interneurons. We find that there are robust molecular differences in synapse-associated genes between these neuron types, and that individual presynaptic pyramidal neurons evoke postsynaptic responses with heterogeneous synaptic dynamics in different postsynaptic cell types. Using molecular identification with FISH and classifiers based on transcriptomically identified PVALB neurons analyzed by Patch-seq, we find that PVALB neurons typically show depressing synaptic characteristics, whereas other interneuron types including SST-positive neurons show facilitating characteristics. Together, these data support the existence of target cell-specific synaptic properties in human cortex that are similar to rodent, thereby indicating evolutionary conservation of local circuit connectivity motifs from excitatory to inhibitory neurons and their synaptic dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>synaptic connection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BRAIN Initiative RF1MH114126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lein</surname><given-names>Ed</given-names></name><name><surname>Levi</surname><given-names>Boaz P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Jonathan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological study in human brain slices reveals that short-term synaptic plasticity from presynaptic pyramidal neuron to postsynaptic interneuron connections are target-cell specific based on their subclass interneuron identity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synaptic transmission is a fundamental means to convey information between neurons and can be modulated by many factors including the intrinsic membrane properties of pre- and postsynaptic cell types, their connection probability, location of synapses, and synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) with timescales from milliseconds to minutes. Diverse forms of STP exist that involve differences in presynaptic release probability of neurotransmitters, calcium accumulation in presynaptic terminals, and retrograde signaling from postsynaptic dendrites with rapid timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>). Importantly, the properties of individual synapses from a given neuron are often determined by the identity of the postsynaptic neurons. Target cell-specific short-term synaptic dynamics from excitatory to inhibitory neuron connections have been identified in many brain regions including neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blackman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Rodent studies from multiple brain regions have begun to elucidate differential synaptic properties between specific neuron types, as well as their underlying postsynaptic molecular mechanisms. For example, specific postsynaptic molecules controlling presynaptic transmitter release have been identified, including <italic>Elfn1</italic> (extracellular leucine rich repeat and fibronectin Type III domain containing 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sylwestrak and Ghosh, 2012</xref>), N-cadherin and β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vitureira et al., 2011</xref>), PSD-95-neuroligin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Futai et al., 2007</xref>) in hippocampus, and <italic>Munc13-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustin et al., 2001</xref>) in cerebellum. In cerebral cortex, excitatory to morphologically defined multipolar basket cell synapses show a high initial release probability and synaptic depression. The GABAergic inhibitory interneuron basket cells are known to express the gene parvalbumin (PVALB); therefore, we will use the term PVALB interneurons to describe them, and use typical convention to refer to expression of the parvalbumin gene as <italic>PVALB</italic> for mRNA and PVALB for protein in human, and <italic>Pvalb</italic> for mRNA and PVALB for protein in rodent. In contrast, excitatory to morphologically defined bi-tufted (or low threshold activated, somatostatin-positive or SST interneurons) cell synapses show low initial release probabilities and synaptic facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koester and Johnston, 2005</xref>). This specialized short-term facilitation in SST interneurons is known to be mediated by <italic>Elfn1</italic> expression in postsynaptic dendritic shafts of SST cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sylwestrak and Ghosh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stachniak et al., 2019</xref>), but not in PVALB neurons. This molecular mechanism was originally discovered in the hippocampus but was extended to the cerebral cortex showing that <italic>Elfn1</italic> in postsynaptic SST neurons interacts with presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and kainate receptors in a layer-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stachniak et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Addressing whether similar synaptic properties and molecular mechanisms are conserved in human cortex has been extremely challenging due to limitations in tissue access and available methods. Advances in single cell transcriptomics have demonstrated a highly complex cellular architecture in the mouse and human cortex, with 45 types of inhibitory interneurons reported that can be discriminated using genome-wide gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>). These neuron types are organized hierarchically, with levels referred to as class, subclass, and type. PVALB and SST neurons correspond to major divisions among GABAergic interneurons at the subclass level, along with LAMP5 and VIP subclasses. Comparative transcriptomic analyses show a generally conserved cell type organization from mouse to human, but with many changes in cellular gene expression that suggest differences in cellular physiology, anatomy, and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>). Whether these species differences lead to functional differences has been a topic of great debate, as it is well known that the same functional readouts, such as synaptic connectivity and dynamics, could be achieved through distinct molecular mechanisms across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goaillard and Marder, 2021</xref>). Recent work has shown that electrophysiological properties and local synaptic connectivity can be studied in acute human neocortical slices derived from surgical resections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boldog et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Planert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Campagnola et al., 2021</xref>). These studies have demonstrated many conserved features, but also a variety of human specializations compared to rodents including faster recovery from synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</xref>) and greater numbers of functional release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szegedi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, conservation of cellular properties between human and model organisms is often seen but cannot be assumed, and it is important to directly compare these properties to understand how well other organisms effectively model the human condition.</p><p>The current study aimed to determine whether the target cell-dependent synaptic properties between excitatory pyramidal neurons and PVALB interneurons vs. SST or other non-PVALB interneurons seen in rodent are conserved in human. We leveraged a number of technological advances to address this question, including (1) multiple patch-clamp recordings to analyze intrinsic membrane properties and local synaptic connectivity and STP, (2) <italic>post-hoc</italic> multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization (mFISH) to reveal molecular properties of synaptically connected neurons, (3) a human slice culture approach with cell class-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to prospectively label GABAergic interneurons with fluorescent reporter genes, and (4) a machine-learning-based classifier to predict interneuron subclass identity based on a training set of human Patch-seq data that characterized cellular morphology and electrophysiological response properties in transcriptomically identified neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). We find that STP in human cortex is target cell-specific.

This classification is consistent with a large literature describing stereotyped anatomy, physiology, and connectivity, for instance for the major subclasses of cortical GABAergic neurons (e.g. PVALB, SST, and VIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Paul, 2019</xref>). Importantly, transcriptomic analysis of the GABAergic subclasses in mouse cortex shows they are well differentiated from one another by genes involved in synaptic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a molecular substrate for their distinctive features of functional synaptic communication.</p><p>A comparison of the conservation and divergence of cell subclass markers was performed previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>, analyzing markers of each cortical GABAergic interneuron subclass versus all other GABAergic interneuron subclasses combined. This showed that a core set of markers was robustly specific and conserved, although surprisingly most subclass-selective markers were not. In this study we reanalyzed these data to specifically looked genes that differentiated PVALB versus SST neurons in both mouse and human cortex, as a potential substrate for conserved functional properties. We identified 72 PVALB- and 75 SST-enriched genes whose expression patterns were conserved in both human medial temporal gyrus (MTG) and mouse primary visual cortex (VISp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These patterns were similar in primary motor cortex (M1 in human, MOp in mouse), consistent with reports of similar transcriptomic GABAergic neuron type properties across mouse cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Next, to understand what the function of this gene set was, we performed Gene ontology (GO) analysis to reveal molecular pathways enriched in PVALB or SST subclasses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, top 10 categories by p-value). GO analysis can reveal if a gene set contains higher than expected number of genes associated with a cellular function or a subcellular compartment. The most significantly enriched GO terms were for synapse related categories, with postsynaptic membrane Gene Ontology term GO:0045211 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gene_ontology/GO">http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gene_ontology/GO</ext-link>:0045211) being enriched in both PVALB and SST neurons. This suggests that many of the conserved genes that discriminate between PVALB and SST subclass cells are involved in regulating synaptic connectivity and their functional properties. Among these, the <italic>Elfn1</italic> gene, described to mediate selective short-term facilitation in SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sylwestrak and Ghosh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stachniak et al., 2019</xref>), is enriched in GABAergic interneurons compared to excitatory neurons, and in SST and all other GABAergic subclasses except PVALB interneurons, we found that this pattern is conserved across both species and cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

As expected, <italic>SLC17A7</italic> and <italic>GAD1</italic> expression was mutually exclusive in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively, and only GAD1<sup>+</sup> cells were found in layer 1. <italic>SLC17A7</italic> and <italic>GAD1</italic> mRNA staining was comparable between patched and neighboring non-patched neurons after long whole-cell recordings (around 30–75 min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c, i and j</xref>). We were also able to resolve <italic>SLC17A7</italic> and <italic>GAD1</italic> mRNA staining through the depth of the slice, and did not observe changes of averaged fluorescent intensities in individual neurons by depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1j and k</xref>). In an acute slice, no noticeable change was observed between patched and non-patched SLC17A7<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> cells, but a single patched GAD1 + cell showed lower HCR signal than neighboring GAD1 + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Alternatively, in a cultured slice, expression of <italic>PVALB</italic> was reduced in patched cells relative to unpatched neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). The ability to stain for marker genes across multiple rounds allowed probing for an increased number of genes, and re-probing for genes that produced low signal from the first round such as <italic>VIP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c–d</xref> cell 3). One challenge to this approach is that human brain tissue often exhibits dense lipofuscin around some somatic structures that is highly autofluorescent and causes challenges with detecting fluorescent signals in mFISH. Lipofuscin is a cellular metabolic byproduct that accumulates with age in lysosomes, and is also known as age pigment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boellaard and Schlote, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j–l</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>), that persists after tissue clearing with 8% SDS and throughout the mFISH staining procedure. However, it was possible to distinguish the distribution of amplified mRNA fluorescent dots from lipofuscin autofluorescence by imaging across multiple fluorescent channels, as lipofuscin produced fluorescence in all channels (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>). <italic>PVALB</italic> labeling could be detected, but the staining was often very weak. We observed this with several patched <italic>PVALB</italic>-positive cells, where <italic>PVALB</italic> mRNA abundance was at lower levels than adjacent unpatched PVALB + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>). Whether this reflects real differences in mRNA abundance between cells, or loss of mRNA during multiple patch-clamp recording is unclear.</p><p>To efficiently target GABAergic interneurons for multiple patch-clamp recordings, we also performed rapid viral genetic labeling of cortical GABAergic interneurons in human organotypic slice cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>; see Methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mich et al., 2021</xref>). We used an adeno-associated virus (AAV), with capsid PHP.eB that drives SYFP2 reporter expression under the control of an optimized version of a previously described forebrain GABAergic neuron enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stühmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mich et al., 2021</xref>). This AAV-DLX2.0-SYFP2 virus was directly applied to the slice surface at a concentration of 1-5e<sup>10</sup> vg/slice. This virus produced rapid reporter expression, often visible within 2 days, and allowed us to execute physiology experiments as early as 2.5 days in vitro (DIV) after viral administration. We performed targeted multiple patch-clamp recordings of labeled neurons in addition to pyramidal shaped neurons in human cortical slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). During the recordings, we observed some differences between multiple patch-clamp recordings in viral labeled slice culture and acute slice preparation. First, giga-ohm seals were more readily obtained between patch pipette and cell membrane in neurons from ex vivo cultured slices compared to acute slices. Second, the somatic structure of unlabeled neurons was more difficult to resolve in slice culture with minimal positive pressure on the patch pipette, making patching unlabeled neurons more challenging. Third, we compared the expression of several marker genes in patched or neighboring unpatched cells and saw only dim expression of <italic>PVALB</italic>, while other genes showed similar expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This finding is consistent with <italic>PVALB</italic> being difficult to resolve by mFISH after patching. Nonetheless, the ability to exclusively target genetically labeled GABAergic neuronal subclasses in the human neocortex greatly improved the efficiency of targeted recording experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Diverse synaptic dynamics from excitatory to inhibitory neurons</title><p>To analyze excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) dynamics, we stimulated presynaptic neurons with spike trains of 8 pulses at 20 and 50 Hz (see Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Campagnola et al., 2021</xref>). Recovery from synaptic depression was measured by probing with an additional four pulses after variable inter-spike intervals (62.5ms, 125ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1 s, 2 s and 4 s) following induction by the 8 pulses spike train at 50 Hz in each 15 s interstimulus interval. In our multiple patch-clamp recordings, up to 8 neurons were targeted to patch simultaneously including both pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Therefore, we were able to include many recordings in our analysis such as two presynaptic pyramidal neurons and one connected postsynaptic interneuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>), or one pyramidal neuron and two connected postsynaptic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>, when two pyramidal neurons were connected to the same postsynaptic inhibitory neuron, they typically showed similar kinetics of short-term synaptic plasticity that was either depressing or facilitating depending on the postsynaptic neuron.

To quantify synaptic dynamics, initial EPSP amplitudes in each pair of excitatory to inhibitory neuron connections were normalized and displayed as heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–h</xref>). Rates of postsynaptic facilitation and depression are usually presynaptic stimulus frequency dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>).

These results show that amounts of depression are dependent on presynaptic stimulus frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). To further explore the potential relationship between synapse types and their properties of short-term plasticity, we first defined synapses as facilitating or depressing based on the ratio of EPSP amplitude between the 1st and 2nd pulse (1:2 ratio; as known as paired-pulse ratio, or PPR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). Since PPR does not capture the full range of dynamics, we also defined additional metrics such as a 1:8 pulse ratio and a 1:6–8 pulse ratio defined by ratio between first and average of 6th to 8th pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Varela et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsodyks and Markram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>). Using PPR, averaged EPSP kinetics of depressing and facilitating synapses in terms of their rise time and decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>) were not statistically different (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the depressing synapses had higher EPSP amplitudes than facilitating synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>, left panel; Linear regression between PPR and EPSP amplitude, R-squared=0.079452, p=0.0074488), and this difference was not accounted for by disease indication or slice preparation method (p=0.00029819 for depression/facilitation, p=0.7852 for epilepsy/tumor, p=0.2766 for acute/culture, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). When we parameterized the degree of facilitation/depression (i.e. PPR) and recovery rate in early time periods within 250ms, there was a significant correlation between these parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) that showed distinct synaptic recovery dynamics between the two synapse types. Their recovery responses (i.e. 9th pulse at various time intervals) were also not accounted for by disease indication (p=0.4781) or slice preparation method (p=0.7816, two-way ANOVA with repeated measures as different recovery time periods). Similarly, normalized synaptic dynamics (i.e. normalized responses from first to 8th pulses at both 20 Hz and 50 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>) were not impacted by disease state of the donor, or slice preparation method with two-way ANOVA with repeated measures (both p&gt;0.05). However, when normalized pulse responses were individually compared, some of them were separated from acute to slice culture preparations (2nd to 6th pulse responses show p&lt;0.05 with false discovery rate (FDR) corrected Wilcoxon rank sum test, at 50 Hz, left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>), although we did not observe different dynamics responses related to disease indication (p&gt;0.05 with FDR corrected Wilcoxon rank sum test). Indeed, more facilitating synapses were detected in slice cultures than in acute slices. Based on the train-induced STP (1:6–8 ratio), about 30% of recordings (n=17) in slice cultures (total n=56) showed facilitation, compared to only 12% of recordings (n=4) in acute slices (total n=33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f and h</xref>). This difference could either reflect an acute <italic>vs</italic>. slice culture difference, or more likely a selection bias for interneuron subtype sampling between slice preparation methods (see Discussion). To address the potential changes of short-term synaptic dynamics by increasing spontaneous synaptic activity that has been previously observed during slice culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Napoli and Obeid, 2016</xref>), we analyzed the PPR change as a function of days in slice culture and did not observe a significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>These observed differences in pyramidal to interneuron synaptic properties could relate to target cell identity.

With this classification of postsynaptic interneurons measured in multiple patch-clamp recordings, we looked at the relationship between synaptic features and their PVALB probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). As expected, cells with a high likelihood of being <italic>PVALB</italic>-positive tended to show synaptic depression as shown by the correlation between paired pulse ratios and PVALB probability using 50 Hz pulse trains.

In addition, we looked at the relationship between EPSP amplitudes and paired pulse ratios within each type (i.e. PVALB vs non-PVALB) to see whether EPSP amplitudes have separable effects on short-term dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The outcome shows that there is correlation between EPSP amplitudes and paired pulse ratios especially in non-PVALB type, indicating that EPSP amplitudes and short-term dynamics may be related in a subclass cell-type specific manner.

The current study establishes that this principle is also true in human cortex. Using multiple patch-clamp recordings in human neurosurgically resected cortical tissues, we find that individual pyramidal neurons show heterogeneous synaptic properties to multiple postsynaptic GABAergic neurons, and that those properties are defined by postsynaptic neuron identity. As in mouse, <italic>Pvalb</italic>-positive fast-spiking interneurons tended to show synaptic depression, whereas <italic>Sst</italic>-positive (or more generally, <italic>Pvalb</italic>-negative) interneurons tended to show synaptic facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Toledo-Rodriguez et al., 2005</xref>). Given the conserved intrinsic properties of human and rodent PVALB neurons (i.e. fast spiking) and their target-specific depressing synaptic dynamics, <italic>PVALB</italic>-positive basket-like cells in human cortex are very likely to have similar functional roles in cortical circuits. These roles likely include mediation of excitation-inhibition balance, gain control, and generation/synchronization of fast oscillation (e.g. ‘gamma’ frequency range, 20–80 Hz) by communicating with reciprocally connected neighboring excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>). Non-PVALB interneurons, including <italic>SST</italic>-stained neurons by <italic>post-hoc</italic> HCR, instead showed rather small initial EPSP responses and tended to have short-term synaptic facilitation. These properties are comparable to previous studies in rodent <italic>Sst</italic>-positive ‘Martinotti’ cells, which are known to target pyramidal neuron apical dendritic tufts and mediate lateral disynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berger et al., 2009</xref>). Putative ‘Martinotti’ cells in human cortex also contribute to lateral disynaptic inhibition between two neighboring pyramidal neurons <italic>via</italic> receiving delayed facilitating synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Obermayer et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, both the target cell-dependent principles and the specific properties of synaptic plasticity in PVALB versus other interneuron types appear to be strongly conserved, suggesting similar roles in functional cortical circuitry across species.</p><p>Transcriptomic analyses of interneuron subclass-selective gene expression suggest that synaptic properties may vary by interneuron subclass. Many synaptic genes are differentially expressed between PVALB and SST subclasses, and prior transcriptomic studies have suggested that such genes are particularly important for cell identity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huang and Paul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). While currently challenging to interpret at a gene-to-synaptic function level, since so many synapse-associated genes vary by cell subclass, eventually these molecular data could provide a mechanistic substrate for cell-type-specific functional properties and allow prediction of both conserved and divergent properties. For example, as mentioned above <italic>Elfn1</italic> has been shown to control short-term facilitation in SST interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sylwestrak and Ghosh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Wit and Ghosh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stachniak et al., 2019</xref>). We find that <italic>ELFN1</italic> is expressed in all interneuron subclasses except PVALB neurons, and this pattern is conserved from mouse to human, suggesting a similar role in non-<italic>PVALB</italic> expressing interneurons from mouse to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jorstad et al., 2022</xref>). Many other synapse-associated genes show differential expression across interneuron subclasses but with divergent expression across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>). While the functional significance of such differences remains to be demonstrated since there may also be multiple ways to achieve similar functional properties with different gene patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goaillard and Marder, 2021</xref>), several studies of human cortical tissues have shown functional differences between human and mouse. These include differences in excitatory neuron recovery from synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</xref>), higher presynaptic release probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</xref>), more docked vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szegedi et al., 2016</xref>), and polysynaptic network activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szegedi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Campagnola et al., 2021</xref>), as well as diverse forms of synaptic plasticity among specific interneuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szegedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mansvelder et al., 2019</xref>). It seems likely that these functional synaptic species differences will ultimately be related to species variation in gene expression.</p><p>On the other hand, it is possible that physiological and synaptic properties may not be as discriminatory for cell specification as genes are, and that limited range and redundancy across types for these features. Patch-seq studies in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>), monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>), and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2022</xref>) suggest that there is a strong correlation of intrinsic and morphological features to highly granular transcriptomically defined cell types that would be averaged together at the ‘subclass’ level presented here. This may or may not be true at the level of synaptic physiology, but the tools are now available to begin addressing that question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Strategies for cell type-specific analysis of synaptic connectivity in human tissues</title><p>Directly analyzing synaptic properties of specific connected cell types by multiple patch-clamp recordings in human or other non-genetically tractable model organisms presents a number of challenges. The first challenge is simply access to healthy human tissues for slice physiology experiments. We and others have demonstrated that tissues from human neurosurgical resections are highly robust and can be used both for acute recordings and slice culture experiments over several weeks to months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eugène et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berg et al., 2021</xref>). Another major challenge is efficiently targeting specific cell types. Typically, human tissue slice physiology is performed in unlabeled tissues with cell type targeting based only on their soma and proximal dendritic shapes under the microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szegedi et al., 2016</xref>). We have taken advantage of the longevity of human slices in slice culture to transduce neurons with enhancer-AAVs to allow viral transgenesis and genetic manipulation of cells in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Le Duigou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz et al., 2019</xref>), in the current study to target GABAergic interneurons. Finally, another major challenge is the <italic>post-hoc</italic> identification of recorded neurons in multiple patch-clamp recordings. We demonstrate two effective strategies for cell type identification. The first is a low throughput but high confidence FISH staining of recorded neurons with markers of interneuron subclasses. The second is a quantitative classifier to differentiate interneuron subclass identities based solely on electrophysiology data, using a high confidence Patch-seq dataset that links physiology with transcriptomic identity to build the classifier. Together this array of solutions allowed the conclusions to be drawn about target cell-dependent synaptic properties at the GABAergic subclass level, and these approaches should be possible to apply at a much finer level of cell type resolution in the future.</p><p>A key strategy demonstrated here is to use mFISH with multiple rounds of staining on cleared thick in vitro human slice preparations, preserving tissue integrity and cell morphology, thereby allowing molecular identification of synaptically connected neurons using robust marker genes for neuron subclasses. The use of mFISH provides advantages over traditional immunohistochemical staining, as unambiguous identification of interneuron subclass identity (e.g. PVALB, SST, VIP, LAMP5) has not been reliable with <italic>post-hoc</italic> immunohistochemical staining in both non-human primate and human tissues. For example, PVALB antibodies work well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Szegedi et al., 2017</xref>), but SST and VIP antibodies do not work reliably in human cortical slices in our hands (data not shown; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukacs et al., 2022</xref>). Here, the GABAergic interneuron subclasses PVALB, SST, and VIP were readily resolved using HCR and RNA transcript probes for <italic>PVALB</italic>, <italic>SST</italic>, <italic>VIP,</italic> and <italic>LAMP5</italic>. However, several challenges were identified for future improvement. Although mRNA labeling was robust for abundant genes, less abundant genes were more difficult to detect (including <italic>PVALB</italic> and <italic>VIP</italic>). Autofluorescence from lipofuscin, a common feature of human brain tissue, can complicate analysis and obscure mRNA signal. Improvement of lipofuscin mitigation techniques will facilitate future analysis. In some cases, we did not readily detect expected mRNA transcripts for cells with certain types of electrophysiological features (such as fast-spiking inhibitory neurons that would be expected to express <italic>PVALB</italic>). This could be the true state of the cell, or due to loss of mRNA through the patch pipette or leakage from the cell after pipette withdrawal in addition to HCR-based gene detection and amplification procedures in thick human surgical tissues. Finally, greater cell type resolution will be gained using more highly multiplexed mFISH techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The approach here constitutes a valuable step toward deciphering the correspondence of cell subclasses measured by multiple data modalities, despite the need for further technical refinement.</p><p>The development of AAV vectors for rapid infection and cell-type-specific transgene expression, provides new avenues for targeted analysis in the human brain as well as in non-genetically tractable organisms. This method provides a means to study neuronal and circuit properties in human neocortex and link them to emerging molecular classifications of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>). New enhancer-AAV tools now target wide variety of cortical cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graybuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mich et al., 2021</xref>), and are promising new tools that could be applied to cultured organotypic slices to selectively mark or manipulate the cortical cells and circuits. However, two things that need to be carefully considered: one is potential culture artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suriano et al., 2021</xref>), and the other is potential modification of synaptic properties in virally labeled neurons. Therefore, data obtained from virally transduced neurons in slice cultures ultimately need to be compared to data from both non-transduced neurons in slice cultures and acute slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwarz et al., 2019</xref>). This difference we observed in this study, that is, more facilitating synapses were detected in slice cultures than in acute slices, could either reflect an acute <italic>vs.</italic> slice culture difference. However, we believe it is more likely to reflect a selection bias for PVALB neurons when patching in unlabeled acute slices, and that the AAV-based strategy with a pan-GABAergic enhancer allows a more unbiased sampling of interneuron subclasses whose properties are preserved in culture. In support of this, PPR analysis as a function of days after slice culture shows no relationship to acute versus slice culture preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, we have observed that viral targeting of GABAergic interneurons greatly facilitates sampling of the SST subclass in the human cortex compared to unbiased patch-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2022</xref>), and this selection bias likely explains synapse type sampling differences in cultured slices compared to acute preparations. This ability to sample more representatively across GABAergic neurons is one of the advantages of the slice culture paradigm, and the rapidly increasing availability of new viral genetic tools, especially those validated to work in the context of human organotypic slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mich et al., 2021</xref>), should facilitate studies of human neuronal intrinsic properties and synaptic connectivity at increasing levels of cell-type specificity. Such viral tools also offer potential for cell-type-specific functional manipulation in mature human brain tissues.</p><p>Taken together, this combination of <italic>post-hoc</italic> marker labeling and computational classifier predictions indicate that we can identify postsynaptic cell identity for PVALB versus other, non-PVALB interneuron types in multiple patch-clamp recordings. With these postsynaptic cells identified, this allows a conclusion that synaptic properties between presynaptic human pyramidal neurons and postsynaptic interneurons are target-dependent based on the interneuron subclass identity, with PVALB neurons more likely to show synaptic depression and non-PVALB neurons more likely to show synaptic facilitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transcriptomic analysis</title><p>Previously described single nucleus transcriptomic datasets from human MTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>) and mouse VISp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>) were analyzed to define differentially expressed genes between PVALB and SST neuron types.

Reference cells were targeted in human slice culture with the same enhancer, AAV-DLX2.0-SYFP2 as the primary dataset, gene expression characterized using the patch-seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), and transcriptomic subclasses assigned by mapping to a reference transcriptomic taxonomy from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodge et al., 2019</xref> following the method from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>. However, differences in recording conditions between synaptic physiology and patch-seq protocols (primarily the presence/absence of synaptic blockers) cause shifts in intrinsic properties that preclude the use of all features in this reference dataset. We therefore excluded features for which the protocol accounted for over 5% of variance in an ANOVA of the combined dataset, leaving 24 features but excluding some common discriminating features such as spike width. Using scikit-learn, we trained a classifier pipeline that first normalizes features based on a robust variance (RobustScaler), imputes missing values based on nearest neighbors (KNNImputer), then classifies with linear discriminant analysis. This pipeline achieved 77% accuracy for predicting PVALB/non-PVALB subclasses in the reference dataset using cross-validation. Errors came primarily from a subset of SST cells with intrinsic properties overlapping the PVALB cells. The PVALB prediction probabilities of the classifier were then calibrated on the full reference dataset (CalibratedClassifierCV) before applying to the synaptic physiology dataset to generate both PV probabilities. Cells with a low confidence (PVALB probability between 0.4 and 0.6) were categorized as uncertain, with higher probabilities labeled PVALB and lower labeled non-PVALB. The separation of subclasses and overlap between patch-seq reference and connectivity assayed cells in intrinsic feature space was visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, UMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becht et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Synaptic connectivity and dynamics, intrinsic membrane properties were analyzed with custom-written MATLAB (MathWorks) and Igor (Wavemetrics) software. For statistical significance test, Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare two independent samples. Somatic position of individual neurons in a cluster from electrophysiological recording was imaged with fluorescent dyes (Alexa488 or cascade blue) with upright microscope and saved in ACQ4. Consequently, recorded neurons were identified with biocytin staining image and matched with mFISH/HCR signals taken by inverted confocal microscope.</p><p>To determine whether presynaptic spike generation is intact by a brief somatic current injection, all recorded presynaptic traces were manually checked and quality controlled based on the spike shape. When presynaptic spike shape is intact, postsynaptic response failures were included to average EPSP responses with multiple stimulations. EPSP onset delay was calculated from the peak of presynaptic spikes in current clamp mode to the onset of EPSP response. EPSP onset delay, PSP rise time, PSP decay tau were calculated with some modification of codes from Postsynaptic Potential Detector shared in public (MATLAB Central File Exchange; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19380-postsynaptic-potential-detector">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19380-postsynaptic-potential-detector</ext-link>, 2020).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Thick tissue mFISH sample preparation</title><p>Slices were fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hr at room temperature (RT), washed three times in PBS for 10 min each, then transferred to 70% EtOH at 4 °C for a minimum of 12 hr, and up to 30 days. Slices were then incubated in 8% SDS in PBS at RT for 2 hr with agitation. The solution was exchanged with 2 X sodium chloride sodium citrate (SSC) three times, slices were washed for 1 hr at RT, followed by two additional (1 hr each) washes with fresh 2 X SSC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In situ HCR for thick tissue</title><p>We performed HCR v3.0 using reagents and a modified protocol from Molecular Technologies and Molecular Instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). Slices were incubated in pre-warmed 30% probe hybridization buffer (30% formamide, 5 X sodium chloride sodium citrate (SSC), 9 mM citric acid pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 µg/mL heparin, 1 X Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate) at 37 °C for 5 min, then incubated overnight at 37 °C in hybridization buffer with the first three pairs of probes added at a concentration of 4 nM. The hybridization solution was exchanged 3 times with 30% probe wash buffer (30% formamide, 5 X SSC, 9 mM citric acid pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 µg/mL heparin) and slices were washed for one hour at 37 °C. Probe wash buffer was briefly exchanged with 2 X SSC, then amplification buffer (5 X SSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% dextran sulfate) for 5 min. Even and odd hairpins for each of the three genes were pooled and snap-cooled by heating to 95 °C for 90 s then cooling to RT for 30 min. The hairpins were then added to amplification buffer at a final concentration of 60 nM, and slices were incubated in amplification solution for 4 hr at RT. This was followed by a brief wash with 2 X SSC and a 1 hr, room temperature incubation in 2 X SSC containing 8 µg/µl Brilliant Violet 421TM Streptavidin (BioLegend, Cat. No. 405225) and 0.05% Tween 20. Slices were washed three times for 10 min in 2 X SSC. For each round of imaging, an aliquot of 67% 2,2’-Thiodiethanol (TDE) solution was prepared for use as a clearing and immersion fluid. ≥99% TDE (Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with DI water to create a 67% TDE solution with a refractive index of 1.46, verified by a pocket refractometer (PAL-RI, Atago). Slices were transferred to 67% TDE and allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 hr at room temperature prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Quantification of thick tissue mFISH signals</title><p>Patched cells from acute and cultured tissues were hand segmented volumetrically using QuPath software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bankhead et al., 2017</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/qupath/qupath">https://github.com/qupath/qupath</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018257">SCR_018257</ext-link>). Segmentation was performed on either the SYFP2 labeled cell body (slice culture preparation) or HCR signal (acute slice preparation) in transcript positive cells. Additionally, several nearby cells were also segmented in order to characterize typical expression levels in each probed gene and to compare signal level to patched cells. For each imaged channel, a histogram of non-cellular pixels was used to calculate a background threshold, which was taken to be three times the half width at half maximum above median of the distribution of pixel values. A mask of lipofuscin pixels was constructed by first taking all pixels that exceeded this threshold in all HCR channels. This mask was additionally expanded by morphological dilation with a kernel of radius one pixel, iterated two times. For each segmented cell, this mask was applied to each channel and the remaining intensity above background was integrated and normalized to the cell volume, this is taken as a measure of expression in each channel and reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>Thick tissue images were acquired on an Olympus FV3000 confocal microscope using a 30 X silicon oil objective with the zoom set to 1.5 x. The image montage stacks were acquired through the depth of the tissue at 1.2 µm steps. For figures, maximum intensity projections though the region of interest were generated are shown. Note that some montages exhibit stitching artifacts. Due to the frequent appearance of lipofuscin in aging human tissues, we showed HCR images as multiple overlapping channels since the lipofuscin granules were revealed as spots that are fluorescent in every channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Stripping and subsequent hybridization rounds</title><p>To strip the signal in preparation for subsequent rounds, 67% TDE was exchanged with 2 X SSC three times and samples were washed for 1 hr. 2 X SSC was replaced with 1 X DNase buffer for 5 min and then a 1:50 dilution of DNase I in DNase buffer (DNase I recombinant, RNase-free, Roche, Cat. No. 04716728001), and incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. This solution was replaced with fresh DNase solution before incubating slices overnight at 37 °C. Slices were washed with 65% formamide in 2 X SSC for one hour at 37 °C, then 2 X SSC for 1 hr at RT, before being transferred to 67% TDE for at least 1 hr. After imaging to confirm the signal was gone, the slices were washed in 2 X SSC for 1 hr to remove TDE before proceeding to subsequent hybridization rounds, which followed the protocol described above, except omitting the incubation in streptavidin solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Morphological reconstruction</title><p>Reconstructions of the dendrites and the initial part of the axon (spiny neurons) and/or the full axon (aspiny/sparsely spiny neurons) were generated for a subset of neurons with good-quality electrophysiology and biocytin fills. Reconstructions were generated based on a 3D image stack taken by confocal microscope that was run through a Vaa3D-based image processing and reconstruction pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peng et al., 2010</xref>). The process could include a variable enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio in the image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peng et al., 2014</xref>). Reconstructions were manually corrected and curated using a range of tools (e.g., virtual finger, polyline) in the Mozak extension (Zoran Popovic, Center for Game Science, University of Washington) of Terafly tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bria et al., 2016</xref>) in Vaa3D. Every attempt was made to generate a completely connected neuronal structure while remaining faithful to image data. If axonal processes could not be traced back to the main structure of the neuron, they were left unconnected. As a final step in the manual correction and curation process, an alternative analyst checked for missed branches or inappropriate connections. Once the reconstruction was deemed complete, multiple plugins were used to prepare neurons for morphological analyses.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Target cell-specific synaptic dynamics of excitatory to inhibitory neuron connections in supragranular layers of human neocortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sacha B Nelson (Reviewer #1). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have made many suggestions for how to improve the manuscript to increase its clarity and accessibility. The most critical points concern:</p><p>1) The statistical analyses need to better address the core question: how much of the variance in synaptic properties depends on target identity vs. other factors.</p><p>2) The results chosen for presentation in the figures need to be better motivated, more clearly and accessibly described and the analyses need to be carried out and reported with greater rigor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Because this manuscript reports on a large amount of hard works and very important data and makes an important point for the field, it is worth a bit more work to make the presentation clearer and more incisive in its ability to answer the posed questions.</p><p>The main issue is that it is very difficult to determine from the present analyses and the way these and the data are presented, the degree to which the observed differences in synaptic dynamics reflect postsynaptic identity vs. other factors.</p><p>Conceptually, it would be helpful to clearly state, up front the main variables being assessed: paired pulse depression vs. facilitation and Pvalb-positive vs. Pvalb-negative and then analyze what fraction of the variance in one is accounted by the other. Then one could go on to ask what fraction of the remaining variance is accounted for by other properties such as culture/acute and initial amplitude.</p><p>The remaining suggestions for improvement are organized sequentially according to the manuscript.</p><p>60: Kainite</p><p>The introduction might make the larger point that it is important to separate the biophysical properties which are conserved from those which are specialized for human and rodent since these will provide clues as to their contribution to conserved and specialized systems level functions.</p><p>Also, molecular differences between species may not all be functionally important and the same properties of connectivity and synaptic function might be achieved through distinct molecular mechanisms across species.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>The authors should do a better job of placing these results in the context of the massive amount of prior work on this issue, especially including that cited. The fact that this is reanalysis of existing data sets is stated in the methods, but should be stated in the results or figure legend for clarity. What is new here and what is confirmatory? Was the analysis of these ~75 markers done previously? How do these numbers of conserved markers compare to the number of conserved markers for other cell types?</p><p>The purpose of showing ELFN1 expression is quite clear, but the reason for focusing on the analyses in the rest of the figure could be better motivated/explained. Was the point about conservation of major type markers (Figure 1A) vs. poorer conservation of subtype specific markers (Figure 1-supp) made previously? If so, perhaps it does not not need to be made again. If there is a specific aspect of this point that has not been previously reported that needs to be clearly described.</p><p>Figure 3. The reason for including the phase plane analysis in panel g is unclear. Calling this &quot;Quadruple modality data&quot; is not especially helpful to alert the reader to what is being studied (and in fact it is a distraction to figure out which modalities are being considered separate). Instead it might be better to simply call this: example interneuron-pyramid connections in human cortex, or anatomy, physiology and molecular identification of interneuron-pyramid connections.</p><p>252: &quot;In our MPC recordings, at least three cells were patched simultaneously, and we either simultaneously patched two presynaptic pyramidal neurons and one connected postsynaptic interneuron (Figure 4b,c), or one pyramidal neuron and two connected postsynaptic interneurons&quot; This is confusing because presumably when larger numbers of neurons were patched there were more than two pre or postsynaptic neurons. Please indicate if you mean you are only considering cases in which there were precisely two, or whether you are also including cases if there were two or more (pre or post).</p><p>271: &quot;whereas connected pairs with smaller EPSPs (lower heat map at 50 Hz; Figure 4e,f) tended to have facilitating synapses, suggesting that the large and small EPSP synapses may represent different inhibitory neuron types.&quot; This does not necessarily follow. There may be a spectrum across each type. This should be statistically addressed; either result: amplitude and short-term dynamics both follow type equally, or both type and amplitude have separable effects on short-ter dynamics, would be interesting.</p><p>Differences between acute and cultured slices: do the slice cultures develop any spontaneous activity? Short-term synaptic dynamics are strongly influenced by any ongoing activity.</p><p>294-308. This and the preceding paragraph deal with the question of what accounts for differences in short-term plasticity. The attempt to rule out slice and donor conditions is reasonable, but whether this depends only on subtype is still a question (at this point) and should be presented as such. The conclusion that subtype is the main or sole factor should be stated in the form: Therefore…depressing synapses=PVALB, facilitating = SST should come AFTER an analysis that directly addresses, e.g. using markers or analysis of presynaptic firing etc.</p><p>Figure 4 supp 1: please state frequency of this observation (relative to number of tests).

Even synapses that facilitate strongly during the first two responses can show strong depression later in the train.

A slightly more nuanced way of talking about this would probably be appropriate.</p><p>Figure 4 supp 2.

(1997) or by Tsodyks and Markram (1997). Alternatively, perhaps it would be efficient to combine the data in Figure 4 supp 3 and Figure 4 supp 4-and perhaps only show a couple of comparisons (e.g. tumor-epilepsy and acute-culture).

In addition to the possibility of a slice culture artifact or a bias in interneuron class, there may also be an acute injury artifact that recovers (or leads to cell death) after culturing. These could be addressed by asking (a) whether there is any difference in the incidence of non-Pvalb subtypes in culture vs. acute and (b) whether any other properties of cells or connections varied.</p><p>Discussion: the authors are quite bullish on the possibility of distinguishing many subtypes using the approaches used here to parse Pvalb from others, and are hopeful that these subtypes will correlate with other synaptic properties, but this rings a bit hollow in light of the fact that the electrophysiological classifier did not work as well in human cortex and the in situ results seemed so hard to obtain. In addition, it might be valuable to at least consider the possibility that the main properties of intrinsic and synaptic electrophysiology are specified much more coarsely then the fine gradations of marker expression, which may have other or even no function in the adult circuit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. My biggest concern with the series of big data paper coming out of the Allen Institute as of recently is that they are hard-to-understand descriptive data-dump papers. There's typically a massive amount of often unintelligible data with unclear implications. The authors really need to keep in mind what the point is of their paper is and how precisely the average reader will benefit from them. Just listing a bunch of abbreviations of genes (e.g. Figure 1 FS1) is generally not meaningful and only useful to a few people who are already in the know. All concepts must be properly introduced and clearly defined, otherwise this precious data will likely be somewhat lost on the community and the massive effort of the Allen Inst may be partially wasted. In this regard, I have tried to highlight particularly problematic issues, but I cannot possibly make an exhaustive list. I would recommend that the authors themselves try to identify problematic points and rectify them. Picture that the reader is a junior PhD student – how will they be able to understand the findings?</p><p>2. Brain region is often unclear, both in terms of results presented and literature discussed. For example, L49-62, text speaks of &quot;Rodent studies&quot; without specifying brain region, then proceeds to discuss Elfn1 (L57), which has only really been studied properly with OLM cells of the hippocampus (Ghosh papers cited on L58), but then on L61, it is somehow suggested that this &quot;has also been reported in hippocampal pyramidal neurons&quot;, but that's where they were reported in the first place. This paragraph is so confusing that it is effectively misleading, because it seems to suggest that the literature mostly covers neocortex where the present Kim study was carried out, but that is not really the case. This is just an example, but is a problem that presents itself generally throughout this manuscript.</p><p>3. The paper often presents abbreviations as obvious, without proper definition or further explanation. While Pvalb, Sst, and Vip are reasonably worked-in concepts, I don't think e.g. LAMP5 (e.g. Figure 1d) or SLC17A7 (L442) are. Or SSv4 or Cv3 (Figure 1), or DLX (L203), or &quot;GO: 0045211 term genes&quot; (L133). But even if it were, proper definitions and explanations are necessary throughout. See Point 1 and e.g. Fig1FS1. Also, I thought the new abbreviations (as opposed to the old PV and SOM abbreviations) were Pvalb, not PVALB, Sst, not SST, etc. -- please clarify. The usage in the manuscript of PVALB vs Pvalb is furthermore not consistent (e.g. Figure 1d). We work with SWC files all the time (L1232), but is it useful for the broader readership to drop random abbreviations like that? And so on…</p><p>4. The statistical treatment is questionable at times. Throughout the manuscript, the authors talk about difference that are &quot;significant&quot; (e.g. L108, L176, L276, L287, L289, L291, 401, 414, 418, etc.). However, in science, differences are always significant, because if they're not significant, they're not differences. So no need to state that they're significant -- just state that they're different. On lines 298-308, the authors speak of &quot;trends&quot; that they think they see in the data. Please remove this entire discourse, as it is a misleading practice. Readers do not need to know what trends the authors think they see in their data. Differences are either there (as revealed by proper statistical treatment), or they are not. Recall that trends are real statistical concepts, e.g. you can in grouped data test for the significance of a trend using Cochran-Armitage's Test for Trend, so the authors shouldn't make claims about trends based on just looking at the data. L284-293, when the authors mix-and-match data using the eighth or the ninth pulse, do they properly account for multiple comparisons? Because these are not statistically independent measures, so if the same data set is used for e.g. eighth and ninth pulse, then a post-hoc adjustment must be carried out. Figure 4j, usage of inappropriate or poorly powered stats makes acute and cultured slices appear identical when they are not. Please use goodness-of-fit tests too, because it looks like although the means are indistinguishable by the rank test, the distributions are differently shaped. Numerical statistical methods may also help distinguish these differences. Or linear regression over the DIV using t-test for Pearson's r or non-parametric test for Spearman's rho. There are always differences between acute and cultured systems; the authors may want to make sure their study comes across rigorous in this regard.</p><p>5. Acute slice vs. cultured slice data should be better compared and differences discussed better. It is quite likely that many differences are simply artifacts due to the culturing approach. L279, L281-283: &quot;More facilitating synapses were detected in slice cultures than in acute slices.&quot; and &quot;This difference could either reflect an acute vs. slice culture difference, or more likely a selection bias for interneuron subtype sampling between slice preparation methods as discussed below.&quot; Or strong ones have undergone more presynaptic LTP? Cultured systems are usually spontaneously active, with bouts of high frequency firing. In fact, the difference in slice culture suggests that it is not a cell-type specific finding, but specific to the history of the cell or the synapse.

Then one could go on to ask what fraction of the remaining variance is accounted for by other properties such as culture/acute and initial amplitude.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate for the comments on this point and implementation of additional analysis and newly added figures follows the suggestion. We first show that synaptic dynamics with paired pulse stimuli show both depression and facilitation (Figure 4, and Figure 4 —figure supplements). Then, we used two methods to identify postsynaptic cells as PVALB-positive or PVALB-negative: post-hoc HCR (mFISH) (Figure 5), and a machine learning based classifier (Figure 6, and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). Given the small number of postsynaptic cells that we were able to identify using the HCR staining technique, it was important to use a</p><p>classification-based grouping of PVALB-positive and PVALB-negative postsynaptic cell identities that allowed us to analyze a much larger dataset. These data showed differences in depression versus facilitation between synapses onto the PVALB-positive and -negative postsynaptic cell populations.</p><p>With this, we went on to ask what fraction of the remaining variance is accounted for by other variables. We analyzed the relationship between EPSP amplitudes and paired pulse ratio (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2) in each group and found that there is correlation between them especially in non-PVALB group but not in PVALB group which may indicate this relationship is subclass cell-type specific. We also asked if there was a systematic change in properties over time in culture by addressing the relationship between days after slice culture (DIV) and paired pulse ratio (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3, in addition to Figure 4 —figure supplement 4 for depressing and facilitating synapses). These analyses show that there is no correlation between them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The remaining suggestions for improvement are organized sequentially according to the manuscript.</p><p>60: Kainite</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this error.

Our key motivation behind this study it to better understand how features vary between species.

We also added a statement in the Discussion that effect, that “While the functional significance of such differences remains to be demonstrated since there may also be multiple ways to achieve similar functional properties with different gene patterns of gene expression (Goaillard and Marder, 2021), a number of studies of human cortical tissues have shown functional differences between human and mouse.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1:</p><p>The authors should do a better job of placing these results in the context of the massive amount of prior work on this issue, especially including that cited. The fact that this is reanalysis of existing data sets is stated in the methods, but should be stated in the results or figure legend for clarity. What is new here and what is confirmatory? Was the analysis of these ~75 markers done previously? How do these numbers of conserved markers compare to the number of conserved markers for other cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>This specific comparison of PVALB vs SST directly is new and has not been done before, despite taking advantage of previously published datasets. It is this ability to support many different types of analyses that make the transcriptomic resources so valuable. In this study, we focused on the specific comparison of conserved genes across the species (i.e., mouse to human) that are differentially expressed between PVALB and SST interneuron subclasses (Supplementary Table 1). This specific analysis comparing across brain regions and different species (i.e., mouse visual cortex, VISp; mouse motor cortex, MOp; human primary motor cortex, M1; human middle temporal gyrus, MTG) is novel to our knowledge, and makes an important point about the likely importance of genes with strong conservation across diverse cortical areas and evolutionary time for the function of different neuronal types and their functional connectivity.</p><p>A comparison of the conservation of cell subclass markers was performed previously in Bakken et al. (2021), analyzing markers of each cortical GABAergic interneuron subclass versus all other GABAergic interneuron subclass combined. This showed that a core set of markers was robustly specific and conserved, although surprisingly most subclass-selective markers were not (now mentioned in the Results section). The current study focuses on the specific pairwise comparison of PVALB versus SST marker expression, and we feel a complete pairwise matrix comparison is out of scope for this particular study. Here, we focused on this smaller set of highly conserved markers of PVALB vs. SST that may plausibly underlie conserved structure and function across species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The purpose of showing ELFN1 expression is quite clear, but the reason for focusing on the analyses in the rest of the figure could be better motivated/explained. Was the point about conservation of major type markers (Figure 1A) vs. poorer conservation of subtype specific markers (Figure 1-supp) made previously? If so, perhaps it does not need to be made again. If there is a specific aspect of this point that has not been previously reported that needs to be clearly described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting our lack of clarity here. We have revised our Results section to clearly articulate the motivation behind this analysis. Original Figure 1 panel a,b,c were also rearranged to a,c,b and panel d was removed since it is less relevant for this specific point we were making.</p><p>Although this is a re-analysis of existing datasets, we wanted to better understand the expression of genes that were likely to control synaptic physiology. Since we are evaluating human SST and PVALB subclasses, that is where we focused these analyses. We consider the cross-species comparison of these two subclasses an important starting point for this study. The conserved expression of key physiological regulators of synaptic function (like ELFN1) across species suggests these molecules may be mediating conserved synaptic dynamics properties. Analysis for conserved PVALB and SST marker genes (Supplementary Table 1) were not done before and this suggests that there is a conserved core of genes controlling synaptic functions at the subclass level and accordingly, synaptic functional properties may be conserved across species. However, understanding the conserved and divergent elements of synaptic connectivity of other cell subclasses is beyond the scope of the work we are reporting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3.

Calling this &quot;Quadruple modality data&quot; is not especially helpful to alert the reader to what is being studied (and in fact it is a distraction to figure out which modalities are being considered separate).

We changed the text now to “In our multiple patch-clamp recordings, up to 8 neurons were targeted to patch simultaneously including both pyramidal neurons and interneurons.

There may be a spectrum across each type. This should be statistically addressed; either result: amplitude and short-term dynamics both follow type equally, or both type and amplitude have separable effects on short-ter dynamics, would be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4j (left), it shows that EPSP amplitudes are significantly bigger in the group of depressing synapses (p = 0.012086) compared to the group of facilitating synapses. However, as the reviewer 1 pointed out, these values may be a spectrum across each type and in fact, based on our classifier analysis with intrinsic properties (Figure 6e at 50 Hz), it shows that paired pulse ratio is better metric (p = 0.0092262) compared to EPSP amplitude (p = 0.079456) for PVALB cell type prediction. When we define two types as PVALB (as classifier probability over 0.6; n = 28) and non-PVALB (as classifier probability below 0.4; n = 20), short-term dynamics (i.e., paired pulse ratio) are statistically different in between these types (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.0208) but not in the case of EPSP amplitude (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p = 0.2079). Therefore, we rephrase to say that “This result shows that paired pulse ratio is better metric (p = 0.0092262) to predict PVALB type compared to EPSP amplitude (p = 0.079456).”.</p><p>In addition, we looked at the relationship between amplitude and paired pulse ratio within each type to see whether amplitude have separable effects on short-term dynamics (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2). The outcome shows that there is correlation between amplitude and paired pulse ratio especially in non-PVALB type but not in PVALB type, implicating that EPSP amplitude and short-term dynamics may have a correlation in subclass cell-type specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Differences between acute and cultured slices: do the slice cultures develop any spontaneous activity? Short-term synaptic dynamics are strongly influenced by any ongoing activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t systematically analyze the rate of spontaneous activity in the slice culture preparation, but we don’t typically observe spontaneous activity during these experiments. Consistent with our observed lack of spontaneous activity, a previous study has shown that robust spontaneous network activity emerges over longer periods of time in culture; nearly 40 days for human cultures and 10 days for mouse cultures (Napoli and Obeid, 2016; J of Cellular Biochemistry 117, 559-565). In this study, our human cultured slices were not used beyond 9 days, and we do not know the exact answer since we didn’t systematically measure it.</p><p>However, we have now performed additional analyses to assess the correlation between synaptic dynamics (1:2 paired pulse ratio in both depressing and facilitating synapses) and days of slice cultures (4 to 9 days after culture). We did not observe any correlation in both synapse types (i.e., depressing and facilitating synapses; Figure 4 —figure supplement 4) and subclass types (i.e., PVALB and nonPVALB; Figure 6 —figure supplement 3). Similarly, no correlation was observed with time in culture if we evaluated other metrics of synaptic dynamics such as 1:8 ratio,1-3:6-8 ratio. While these analyses do not directly address the question of changes in spontaneous activity over time in culture, at least, they add to the evidence that our measured synaptic properties are not affected by time in culture up to 9 days whether spontaneous activity changes over that time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>294-308.

Many differences have been described in pyramidal neuron to Pvalb-positive interneuron (depressing) and Sst-positive (facilitating) interneurons (Reyes et al. 1998; Koester and Johnston, 2005). In mouse V1, EPSP rise time and EPSP decay tau is shorter in pyramidal to Pvalb neurons compared to pyramidal to Sst neurons in mouse V1 (Campagnola, Seeman et al., 2022). Perisomatically innervating Pvalb-positive basket cells allow rapid inhibition of neighboring neurons and shut down activity compared to dendritically innervating Sst-positive Martinotti cells (Blackman et al., 2013; Lalanne et al., 2016). Furthermore, frequency dependent lateral inhibition between neighboring pyramidal neurons through facilitating Martinotti cells has been reported in both rodents (Silberberg and Markram, 2007; Berger et al., 2009) and human (Obermayer et al., 2018). Therefore, to directly investigate postsynaptic cell identity at the level of subclasses, we combined multiple patch-clamp recordings with either post-hoc HCR staining, or classifier-based predictions based on intrinsic membrane properties of postsynaptic interneurons in following sections.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 supp 1: please state frequency of this observation (relative to number of tests).

In the Results, we stated as “Since PPR does not capture the full range of dynamics, we also defined additional metrics such as a 1:8 pulse ratio and a 1:6-8 pulse ratio defined by ratio between first and average of sixth to eighth pulses (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1a,b; Varela et al.

We consider the SST, LAMP5, PVALB, and VIP populations of cortical inhibitory cells as subclasses. We now clarified in the Introduction, saying “These neuron types are organized hierarchically, with levels referred to as class, subclass, and type. PVALB and SST neurons correspond to major divisions among GABAergic interneurons at the subclass level, along with LAMP5 and VIP subclasses.”. That is that best resolution we can achieve with our current methods. There are many PVALB (7 types in MTG) or SST (11 types in MTG) cell types but we would require much higher resolution molecular profiling techniques to resolve them. We do not use the term cell subtypes and we have tried to stay consistent and be clear about how we use such terminology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>479 a larger…datasets</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this error. We have made “datasets” singular, and it now says “dataset”. We also now reference Lee et al. 2022 where this dataset is reported as “Since post-hoc HCR on multiple patch-clamp recordings is a low-throughput method, we also took advantage of an existing human single cell Patch-seq dataset to develop a quantitative classifier to predict interneuron subclass identity on our larger multiple patchclamp recording dataset (Lee et al., 2022).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: The authors should use the available data to estimate a false positive and false negative rate for their classifier.</p></disp-quote><p>These performance details have now been added to the text: “A classifier trained on these intrinsic features from Patch-seq neurons predicted PVALB subclass identity with 76% accuracy (cross-validated prediction, with 29% false positive rate, 14% false negative rate).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>522-528. In addition to the possibility of a slice culture artifact or a bias in interneuron class, there may also be an acute injury artifact that recovers (or leads to cell death) after culturing. These could be addressed by asking (a) whether there is any difference in the incidence of non-Pvalb subtypes in culture vs. acute and (b) whether any other properties of cells or connections varied.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments on this issue. For the question of (a), as we described in the RESULTS part, relatively “more facilitating synapses were detected in slice cultures than in acute slices. Based on the traininduced STP (1:6-8 ratio), about 30% of recordings (n = 17) in slice cultures (total n = 56) showed facilitation, compared to only 12% of recordings (n = 4) in acute slices (total n = 33)”. We agree this synapse types are not corresponding to PVALB and non-PVALB subtype. However, in our original manuscript we submitted, we described in the last part of the RESULTS part, “the percentage of neurons predicted to be non-PVALB neurons in acute slice recordings was much lower than in slice culture.”. In addition, as briefly described in the Supplementary Materials of the previous study (Campagnola et al., 2022), we were likely biased to record primarily fast-spiking PVALB neurons (based on targeting a small round shaped soma) in non-fluorescent labeled acute human slices. But viral labeling of GABAergic interneurons in cultured slices might allow us to access relatively less biased sampling of postsynaptic interneurons. This is our speculation based on the experiences. This idea is also consistent with the other recent study (Lee et al., 2022; https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.08.515739v1) the authors showed that slice cultures transduced with the same virus we are using allowed a much higher incidence of sampling SST neurons than patching acute slices without the genetic reporter. However, it is still very hard to quantify cell-type specific injury artifact after culturing, but it is a good point, and we agree that we can’t exclude this possibility, such that SST neurons are likely more damaged during acute slice preparation and recover after culturing.</p><p>For the question of (b), paired pulse ratio as a metric of short-term synaptic plasticity didn’t change significantly along the days of slice culture as shown in newly implemented figures (Depressing and facilitating synapse, Figure 4 —figure supplement 4; PVALB and non-PVALB, Figure 6 —figure supplement 3) supporting the idea that synaptic properties such as facilitation and depression are likely conserved in each subclass group over the slice culture time window. For the change of intrinsic membrane properties are also described in Figure 1 of Lee et al., 2022. For example, action potential width and Sag currents were changed in PVALB WFDC2 neurons from the acute and culture paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: the authors are quite bullish on the possibility of distinguishing many subtypes using the approaches used here to parse Pvalb from others, and are hopeful that these subtypes will correlate with other synaptic properties, but this rings a bit hollow in light of the fact that the electrophysiological classifier did not work as well in human cortex and the in situ results seemed so hard to obtain. In addition, it might be valuable to at least consider the possibility that the main properties of intrinsic and synaptic electrophysiology are specified much more coarsely then the fine gradations of marker expression, which may have other or even no function in the adult circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the comment “the fact that the electrophysiological classifier did not work as well in human cortex” seems to be referring to our original writing in L505 “Notably, we observed that the separation between PVALB-positive and other interneuron types is not as robust in human recordings compared to mouse”. That could depend significantly on sampling, so now we retracted this sentence. However, we think electrophysiological classifier did work relatively well with patch-seq data as shown in Figure 6 d,e.</p><p>We agree that the methods like mFISH that were applied in this study are challenging to execute. With the explosion of spatial transcriptomic methods, an improved and reliable gene detection method that works well in thick slices that have undergone physiological recording should be feasible for future studies. However, we expect this experimental paradigm to continue to generate significant challenges. In our opinion, better profiling techniques and increased throughput will be necessary to understand whether molecularly-defined subclasses and cell types are really predictive intrinsic and synaptic physiology.</p><p>We appreciate the viewpoint raised here based on the data at hand that intrinsic and synaptic properties may not have anything close to the fine specification that is apparent from transcriptomic (or even marker) specifications. While we view this as an open question to some degree, there is evidence of much greater stratification of physiological and morphological features that correlates with transcriptomically-defined cell types at a finer level of granularity than “subtype” such as Pvalb and Sst. Patch-seq efforts in mouse, monkey and human have shown this to be the case, although transcriptomically very similar types tend to have very similar physiology and anatomy. As such, the challenges of the intrinsic properties-based classifier to work here may be partly a result of lumping heterogeneous cell types together. On the other hand, it is also possible if not likely that other cellular phenotypes may simply not be very different across cell types, or sufficient to discriminate between types in the same way. At any rate, it is a question worth pursuing, and the current study begins to move in that direction with methods that in principle can be used to ask these questions at finer levels of cell type granularity. We have added a short paragraph on this topic in the Discussion, now shown in the last paragraph of first section “On the other hand, it is possible that physiological and synaptic properties may not be as discriminatory for cell specification as genes are, and that limited range and redundancy across types for these features. Patch-seq studies in mouse (Gouwen et al., 2019; Gouwen et al., 2020), monkey (Bakken et al., 2021), and human (Berg et al., 2021) suggest that there is a strong correlation of intrinsic and morphological features to highly granular transcriptomically defined cell types that would be averaged together at the “subclass” level presented here. This may or may not be true at the level of synaptic physiology, but the tools are now available to begin addressing that question.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. My biggest concern with the series of big data paper coming out of the Allen Institute as of recently is that they are hard-to-understand descriptive data-dump papers. There's typically a massive amount of often unintelligible data with unclear implications. The authors really need to keep in mind what the point is of their paper is and how precisely the average reader will benefit from them. Just listing a bunch of abbreviations of genes (e.g. Figure 1 FS1) is generally not meaningful and only useful to a few people who are already in the know. All concepts must be properly introduced and clearly defined, otherwise this precious data will likely be somewhat lost on the community and the massive effort of the Allen Inst may be partially wasted. In this regard, I have tried to highlight particularly problematic issues, but I cannot possibly make an exhaustive list. I would recommend that the authors themselves try to identify problematic points and rectify them. Picture that the reader is a junior PhD student – how will they be able to understand the findings?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and current version of manuscript was changed accordingly. We have made a serious effort to make this manuscript and its associated datasets more comprehensible to the average reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Brain region is often unclear, both in terms of results presented and literature discussed. For example, L49-62, text speaks of &quot;Rodent studies&quot; without specifying brain region, then proceeds to discuss Elfn1 (L57), which has only really been studied properly with OLM cells of the hippocampus (Ghosh papers cited on L58), but then on L61, it is somehow suggested that this &quot;has also been reported in hippocampal pyramidal neurons&quot;, but that's where they were reported in the first place. This paragraph is so confusing that it is effectively misleading, because it seems to suggest that the literature mostly covers neocortex where the present Kim study was carried out, but that is not really the case. This is just an example, but is a problem that presents itself generally throughout this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We rearranged this paragraph in the Introduction clearly as suggested as “Rodent studies from multiple brain regions have begun to elucidate differential synaptic properties between specific neuron types, as well as their underlying postsynaptic molecular mechanisms. For example, specific postsynaptic molecules controlling presynaptic transmitter release have been identified, including Elfn1 (extracellular leucine rich repeat and fibronectin Type III domain containing 1) (Sylwestrak and Ghosh, 2012), N-cadherin and β-catenin (Vitureira et al., 2012), PSD-95-neuroligin (Futai et al., 2007) in hippocampus, and Munc13-3 (Augustin et al., 2001) in cerebellum. In cerebral cortex, excitatory to morphologically defined multipolar basket cell synapses show a high initial release probability and synaptic depression. The GABAergic inhibitory interneuron basket cells are known to express the gene parvalbumin (PVALB); therefore, we will use the term PVALB interneurons to describe them, and use typical convention to refer to expression of the parvalbumin gene as PVALB for mRNA and PVALB for protein in human, and Pvalb for mRNA and PVALB for protein in rodent. In contrast, excitatory to morphologically defined bi-tufted (or low threshold activated, somatostatin-positive or SST interneurons) cell synapses show low initial release probabilities and synaptic facilitation (Reyes et al. 1998; Koester and Johnston, 2005). This specialized short-term facilitation in SST interneurons is known to be mediated by Elfn1 expression in postsynaptic dendritic shafts of SST cells (Sylwestrak and Ghosh, 2012; de Wit and Ghosh, 2016; Stachniak et al., 2019), but not in PVALB neurons. This molecular mechanism was originally discovered in the hippocampus but was extended to the cerebral cortex showing that Elfn1 in postsynaptic SST neurons interacts with presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and kainate receptors in a layer-specific manner (Stachniak et al., 2019).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The paper often presents abbreviations as obvious, without proper definition or further explanation. While Pvalb, Sst, and Vip are reasonably worked-in concepts, I don't think e.g. LAMP5 (e.g. Figure 1d) or SLC17A7 (L442) are. Or SSv4 or Cv3 (Figure 1), or DLX (L203), or &quot;GO: 0045211 term genes&quot; (L133). But even if it were, proper definitions and explanations are necessary throughout. See Point 1 and e.g. Fig1FS1. Also, I thought the new abbreviations (as opposed to the old PV and SOM abbreviations) were Pvalb, not PVALB, Sst, not SST, etc. -- please clarify. The usage in the manuscript of PVALB vs Pvalb is furthermore not consistent (e.g. Figure 1d). We work with SWC files all the time (L1232), but is it useful for the broader readership to drop random abbreviations like that?

The statistical treatment is questionable at times. Throughout the manuscript, the authors talk about difference that are &quot;significant&quot; (e.g. L108, L176, L276, L287, L289, L291, 401, 414, 418, etc.). However, in science, differences are always significant, because if they're not significant, they're not differences. So no need to state that they're significant -- just state that they're different. On lines 298-308, the authors speak of &quot;trends&quot; that they think they see in the data. Please remove this entire discourse, as it is a misleading practice. Readers do not need to know what trends the authors think they see in their data. Differences are either there (as revealed by proper statistical treatment), or they are not. Recall that trends are real statistical concepts, e.g. you can in grouped data test for the significance of a trend using Cochran-Armitage's Test for Trend, so the authors shouldn't make claims about trends based on just looking at the data. L284-293, when the authors mix-and-match data using the 8th or the 9th pulse, do they properly account for multiple comparisons? Because these are not statistically independent measures, so if the same data set is used for e.g. 8th and 9th pulse, then a post-hoc adjustment must be carried out. Figure 4j, usage of inappropriate or poorly powered stats makes acute and cultured slices appear identical when they are not. Please use goodness-of-fit tests too, because it looks like although the means are indistinguishable by the rank test, the distributions are differently shaped. Numerical statistical methods may also help distinguish these differences. Or linear regression over the DIV using t-test for Pearson's r or non-parametric test for Spearman's rho. There are always differences between acute and cultured systems; the authors may want to make sure their study comes across rigorous in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed “significantly different” to “different” or “statistically different” throughout the manuscript.</p><p>To quantify the trend whether EPSP amplitude and paired pulse ratio are correlated or not, we performed linear regression between paired pulse ratio and their EPSP amplitude, instead of Cochran-Armitage’s test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

Acute slice vs. cultured slice data should be better compared and differences discussed better. It is quite likely that many differences are simply artifacts due to the culturing approach. L279, L281-283: &quot;More facilitating synapses were detected in slice cultures than in acute slices.&quot; and &quot;This difference could either reflect an acute vs. slice culture difference, or more likely a selection bias for interneuron subtype sampling between slice preparation methods as discussed below.&quot; Or strong ones have undergone more presynaptic LTP? Cultured systems are usually spontaneously active, with bouts of high frequency firing. In fact, the difference in slice culture suggests that it is not a cell-type specific finding, but specific to the history of the cell or the synapse.

Consistent with our observed lack of spontaneous activity, a previous study has shown that robust spontaneous network activity emerges over longer periods of time in culture; nearly 40 days for human cultures and 10 days for mouse cultures (Napoli and Obeid, 2016; J of Cellular Biochemistry 117, 559-565).</p><p>Furthermore, we performed additional analysis for the correlation between synaptic dynamics (1:2 ratio in both depressing and facilitating synapses) along the days of slice cultures (4 to 9 days after culture) and we didn’t see any correlation, i.e., with paired pulse (1:2 ratio), r = 0.148, p = 0.305 for depressing synapses (n = 50 at 50 Hz), r = 0.161, p = 0.327 for facilitating synapses (n = 39 at 50 Hz). Similarly, in case we use different metric of synaptic dynamics such as 1:8 ratio,1-3:6-8 ratio, we didn’t see any correlation of synaptic dynamics metric as a function of progression of slice culture dates. Now we added this analysis in the Figure 4 —figure supplement 4. We performed the same analysis with PVALB and non-PVALB groups as mentioned above (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3) and we didn’t see any correlation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
