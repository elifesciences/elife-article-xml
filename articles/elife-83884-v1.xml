Disruptions in protein folding have been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, while lipid imbalances result in an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sletten et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaurasia and Summers, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avgerinos et al., 2019</xref>). These two distinct metabolic pathways have been extensively studied independently, yet increasing evidence suggests that examining their relationship to one another may provide novel insights into human health. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), diseases known to be associated with increased development of abnormal protein aggregates, also show dysregulation of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yerbury et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alecu and Bennett, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kao et al., 2020</xref>). As such, changes in lipid metabolism are now suspected to contribute to the development of these proteopathies through mechanisms that are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chew et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xicoy et al., 2019</xref>). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major metabolic hub, responsible for the synthesis of secreted and integral proteins, as well as a major portion of a cell’s lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarz and Blower, 2016</xref>). The close relationship between protein and lipid quality control within the ER is highlighted by the Unfolded Protein Response of the ER (UPR<sup>ER</sup>), a system capable of sensing and responding to both protein misfolding and membrane lipid disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metcalf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu and Taubert, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In higher eukaryotes, the UPR<sup>ER</sup> contains three unfolded protein sensors, each with their own independent signaling pathways. While all three sensors are ER-localized transmembrane proteins with a luminal unfolded protein sensing domain, the most conserved of these pathways is the inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (<italic>ire-1</italic>) branch. The IRE-1 luminal domain is bound by the resident ER HSP70 chaperone (<italic>C. elegans</italic> HSP-4) under basal conditions. Upon protein folding stress, the HSP70 chaperone is titrated away to allow for the interaction of the luminal domain with misfolded proteins, leading to oligomerization and activation of IRE-1’s cytosolic RNase domain. Activated IRE-1 then initiates noncanonical splicing of <italic>xbp-1</italic> mRNA from its <italic>xbp-1u</italic> form to its effective <italic>xbp-1s</italic> variant at the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gómez-Puerta et al., 2022</xref>). The XBP-1s transcription factor is then able to upregulate the cell’s UPR<sup>ER</sup> target genes to increase protein folding, protein turnover, and lipid metabolism to help ameliorate the stress. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frakes and Dillin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>All three of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> sensors are also able to sense membrane lipid disequilibrium through domains adjacent to their transmembrane helices. These domains activate the UPR<sup>ER</sup> independent of proteotoxic stress and the luminal sensing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Volmer and Ron, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halbleib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tam et al., 2018</xref>). This is unsurprising considering the ER’s critical role in the synthesis of major lipids including membrane lipids, cholesterol, and neutral lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lodhi and Semenkovich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fagone and Jackowski, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the ER actively regulates the cell’s lipid status through changes to lipid synthesis enzymes, transcriptions factors, and interactions with lipid droplets (LDs), organelles tasked with the storage and gatekeeping of surplus lipid stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimano and Sato, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacquemyn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olzmann and Carvalho, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Utilizing the same stress response sensors for protein and membrane lipid stress suggests an interdependent link between lipid and protein homeostasis within the ER. Ectopic activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> results in changes to lipid metabolism, while changes in sphingolipid, lipid saturation, ceramides, and loss of various lipid enzymes activate the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Volmer and Ron, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Imanikia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniele et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Promlek et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, both lipids and LDs have been shown to contribute to proteostasis. A sterol pathway localized to LDs is required for clearing inclusion bodies and LDs themselves are necessary for transport of damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moldavski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vevea et al., 2015</xref>). Whether other lipid pathways in the ER or on LDs are required for an effective UPR<sup>ER</sup> response to protein stress has not been fully investigated. Here, we performed a genetic screen of LD-associated genes to identify genes whose knockdown affected UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We identified the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, <italic>let-767</italic>, as required for both ER lipid and protein homeostasis. Loss of <italic>let-</italic>767 resulted in severe defects in UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation, lipid homeostasis, and ER morphology. Defects in ER morphology could be rescued through lipid supplementation; however, the deficiencies in UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation were not. Instead, knockdown of the upstream regulator of the <italic>let-767</italic> pathway resulted in a significant recovery of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> activation. Thus, we propose that loss of <italic>let-767</italic> results in accumulation of fatty acid metabolites which leads to detrimental remodeling of the ER membrane and disruption of ER functions in lipid synthesis and UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction. Our work highlights a unique cellular interaction in which lipid metabolism negatively impacts ER protein homeostasis. Further understanding of how these two systems influence one another may bring new insights into the mechanisms of protein and lipid disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LET-767 is a regulator of the UPR<sup>ER</sup></title><p>To identify novel lipid genes that influence the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, we carried out an RNAi screen under conditions of proteotoxic stress.

Within the fatty acid elongation pathway, after addition of a malonyl-CoA, acyl-CoA reductase is responsible for reduction of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA into a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA which is then further processed into a fatty acid with 2 more carbon molecules.

A disrupted membrane could hinder ER membrane protein function for ER stress signaling as well as for lipid droplet and lipid synthesis enzymes, explaining both phenotypes and why the restored ER morphology did not coincide with restored UPR<sup>ER</sup> function. Indeed, a disrupted ER membrane affecting ER function was suggested as the mechanistic cause of <italic>acs-1</italic> phenotypes, where insufficient isoC17 disrupted the ER membrane quality and hindered lipid droplet production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, ER stress through <italic>sec-11</italic> RNAi alone caused a reduction in <italic>let-767</italic> transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that a reduction of <italic>let-767</italic> itself is not directly suppressing the UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction, but possibly dependent on the levels of other factors.

HSD17B12 was found to be essential for development in mice and knockout of the gene in adult mice resulted in reduced body weight, reduced lipid content, and caused liver toxicity hypothesized to be from accumulation of toxic intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rantakari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heikelä et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>3-Ketoacyl reductases perform the second step in fatty acid synthesis/elongation, metabolizing 3-oxoacyl-CoA to 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moon and Horton, 2003</xref>). While the fatty acid elongation pathway has not been shown to affect the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, use of the fatty acid synthase inhibitor, Cerulenin, has been shown to increase levels of XBP1s with reduced transcriptional activity due to changes in palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). From these studies, we hypothesized that the accumulation of the metabolites upstream of LET-767 could be reducing the transcriptional activity of XBP-1S. To this end, we tested whether an upstream metabolite of LET-767 was sufficient to reduce UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction in huh7 cells containing a 5 x unfolded protein response element (UPRE) GFP reporter and EIF2A promoter driving mCherry. As fatty acid elongation extends fatty acids beyond the 16 carbons synthesized by fatty acid synthase, we supplemented our reporter line with the 18 carbon fatty acid metabolites upstream and downstream of the 3-ketoacyl reductase in combination with Tunicamycin to induce ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). We observed that the upstream metabolite, 3-oxostearic acid, reduced the normalized 5xUPRE reporter induction. In comparison, the downstream metabolites, 3-hydroxystearic acid and stearic acid, did not reduce the normalized 5xUPRE reporter signal. Instead, stearic acid caused a slight induction of the reporter signal, in agreement with studies showing that saturated lipids induce the UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Volmer et al., 2013</xref>). This indicated that the 5xUPRE was specifically sensitive to the 3-oxo metabolite upstream of the <italic>let-767</italic> pathway and that this interaction between lipid metabolism and the UPR<sup>ER</sup> is likely conserved in mammalian cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Fatty acid intermediate, 3-oxoacyl, is sufficient to reduce UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fatty acid elongation pathway displaying intermediate lipid metabolites and annotated <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes.

The ER is uniquely a major site of both protein and lipid synthesis. Here, we performed a genetic screen to identify lipid related genes that impact the ER response to protein stress and found <italic>let-767</italic> to be necessary for proper animal size, organelle morphology, neutral lipid accumulation, and induction of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>. Under WT conditions, the <italic>let-767</italic>/HSD17B12 pathway elongates fatty acids that are then used to produce other lipids, such as triglycerides stored in lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The UPR<sup>ER</sup> is also able to respond to ER stress by inducing XBP-1s activity. When the <italic>let-767</italic> is knocked down, the pathway is unable to elongate fatty acids and accumulates the upstream metabolite, 3-oxoacyl-CoA, and possibly other metabolic intermediates that disrupt the ER membrane quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Cells are unable to synthesize downstream lipids for lipid droplets and either through disruption of the membrane or direct interaction with 3-oxoacyl-CoA, <italic>xbp-1</italic> splicing and the activity of spliced <italic>xbp-1s</italic> is significantly reduced in the presence of protein induced ER stress. While unfolded proteins and lipid disequilibrium are known to independently induce the UPR<sup>ER</sup>, our novel finding demonstrates that changes in lipid pathways could significantly impact a cell’s ability to respond to protein stress and brings to light a potential mechanism through which lipid disequilibrium might facilitate the progression of proteopathic diseases.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi blocking UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under WT condition, acyl-CoA metabolites are elongated by the <italic>let-767</italic>/HSD17B12 pathway and utilized at the membrane to synthesize other lipids such as neutral lipids stored in lipid droplets.

LET-767 has also been implicated as a requirement for branched-chain and long-chain fatty acid production, however, its linear metabolic pathway has not been thoroughly investigated so its exact lipid products or protein interactors are yet to be identified. Through our depletion of mmBCFA and LCFA pathway genes, we find that both pathways are essential to having a maximal ER unfolded protein response to protein stress, with <italic>acs-1</italic> RNAi having the most similar phenotypes to <italic>let-767</italic> knockdown. While individual supplementation of mmBCFAs or LCFAs did not rescue the <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi phenotypes, supplementation of a more complex lipid mixture, crude worm lysate, was able to significantly rescue organelle morphology, size, and reproduction phenotypes. This suggests that loss of <italic>let-767</italic> has a more global effect on lipid production rather than affecting a single lipid species. A straightforward explanation for its requirement in global lipid equilibrium and the UPR<sup>ER</sup> could be that the <italic>let-767</italic> pathway is crucial for an elemental component of the ER, such as production of fundamental lipids required for ER membrane quality as has been shown for the <italic>acs-1</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The compromised ER integrity caused by <italic>acs-1</italic> RNAi demonstrates that a in addition to affecting lipid droplet production, a disrupted ER membrane can impact UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction and that these phenotypes can be rescued through correction of lipid deficiencies such as lipid supplementation.</p><p>We would then expect that <italic>let-767</italic> levels would be critical for ER functions, including UPR<sup>ER</sup> signaling. However, the inability of supplementation to rescue <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi phenotypes would suggest a different mechanism for the compromised ER membrane integrity. Interestingly, ER stress results in reduced <italic>let-767</italic> transcript levels. Furthermore, the reduced UPR<sup>ER</sup> signaling caused by <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi was significantly rescued by knockdown of the upstream transcription factor, <italic>sbp-1</italic>, which also reduced <italic>let-767</italic> transcript levels and lipid stores. A possible interpretation of these results is that an alternative pathway to produce the essential lipids is upregulated under ER stress or <italic>sbp-1</italic> RNAi, but with the existence of an alternative pathway, the UPR<sup>ER</sup> would not be suppressed by knockdown of <italic>let-767</italic>. Instead, we propose that the <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi phenotypes are caused by disequilibrium of the fatty elongation pathway at the <italic>let-767</italic> node. By reducing this specific node of the fatty elongation pathway, intermediate metabolites upstream of <italic>let-767</italic> could interfere with ER membrane dynamics, interactions, and functions. A disrupted ER membrane would also explain the similarities in phenotypes with <italic>acs-1</italic> RNAi, which has been shown to affect ER integrity and which we show here can impact UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). As the UPR<sup>ER</sup> sensors and numerous lipogenic enzymes reside on the ER membrane, a disrupted ER membrane would explain why knockdown of <italic>let-767</italic> and other lipid genes affects the capacity of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction. While knockdown of <italic>sbp-1</italic> also reduced the level of UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction, the reduction of numerous lipogenic pathways, including the entire <italic>let-767</italic> pathway, was able to improve the UPR<sup>ER</sup> function of animals on <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi compared to <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi alone. Mechanistically, this could function by preventing the lipid disequilibrium caused by intermediates of the fatty acid elongation pathway by reducing the entire pathway instead of just one node. While our untargeted lipidomic analysis did not reveal an increase in any specific lipid, it did confirm that <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi disrupts lipid levels globally. With multiple types of fatty acids of different lengths being elongated by the same pathway, identifying a single lipid species may prove difficult since numerous 3-oxoacyls may be contributing to the change in ER membrane quality.</p><p>To test whether the ER membrane disorganization was the source of UPR<sup>ER</sup> dysfunction, we aimed to bypass the splicing of <italic>xbp-1</italic> by IRE-1 at the ER membrane by overexpressing the already spliced isoform, <italic>xbp-1s</italic>. However, <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi still caused a reduction in the ER stress response. The reduced UPR<sup>ER</sup> induction in animals overexpressing <italic>xbp-1s</italic> points to an additional mechanism downstream of splicing for the muted UPR<sup>ER</sup>. The regulation of XBP1 mRNA has been proven to be more complex than simple splicing upon ER stress. XBP1u mRNA is required to localize to the ER membrane to facilitate splicing to XBP1s upon ER stress through a hydrophobic region and translational stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gómez-Puerta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanagitani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yanagitani et al., 2011</xref>). Without proper localization, <italic>xbp-1u</italic> would be translated and negatively regulate any <italic>xbp-1s</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, there are potentially other factors residing on the membrane that are required for effective translation of <italic>xbp-1s</italic>, such as specific ribosomal complexes or mRNA stabilizing factors. An altered ER membrane would impact every interaction of <italic>xbp-1</italic> mRNA with the ER membrane, including transient interactions that have yet to be discovered.</p><p>While splicing is a major point of regulation for <italic>xbp-1</italic>, previous studies have found other potential nodes of regulation for <italic>xbp-1</italic> through SUMOylation, deacetylation, and palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of the ER membrane by <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi could impact these other pathways affecting fatty acid synthase activity or protein palmitoylation. Through supplementation of fatty acid elongation intermediates to human huh7 hepatocytes, we provide evidence that increased levels of the 3-oxoacyl metabolite that is upstream of the <italic>let-767</italic> ortholog, HSD17B12, a 3-ketoacyl reductase, is sufficient to reduce the ER stress response to a similar level as the fatty acid synthase inhibitor, Cerulenin. Mechanistically, Cerulenin has been proposed to prevent palmitoylation of XBP1S which reduced its transcriptional activity without impacting its protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Whether the 3-ketoacyl metabolite impacts fatty acid synthase activity or protein palmitoylation requires further investigation.</p><p>Fatty acids exist in numerous configurations of varying lengths and combination of branches and double bonds. These lipids are one of the basic building blocks that compose the membranes of the cell and their qualities can have drastic effects on membrane thickness, fluidity, and curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that alterations in lipids such as mmBCFA levels can impact ER function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Our work demonstrates that incomplete processing of lipids can also impact ER function, in our case by knock down a key enzyme within the fatty elongation pathway. Further work into how different nodes within lipid pathways and how levels of lipid intermediates change with age would greatly contribute to growing amount research on the relationship between lipid changes and aging, including age-dependent neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gille et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2022</xref>).

Peak values of lipids identified by the WCMC were first corrected by subtracting corresponding peaks of blanks and then their abundance estimated relative to internal standards of their corresponding lipid class before calculating average fold change from 6 biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Cells were grown in DMEM media (11995, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMAX (35050, Thermo Fisher), 10% FBS (VWR), Non-Essential Amino Acids (100 X, 11140, Thermo Fisher), and Penicillin-Streptomycin (100 X, 15070, Thermo Fisher) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

The sfGFP is fused to a PEST sequence for tighter regulation of the reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corish and Tyler-Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Loetscher et al., 1991</xref>). The vector also allows for constitutive mCherry expression for normalization of the sfGFP signal, and neomycin resistant gene for selection. The transcriptional reporter was then transduced through lentivirus into Cas9-expressing Huh7 cells and selected for using G418 at 800 µg/mL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cell culture supplementation experiments</title><p>Cells were plated onto 10 cm plates and allowed to grow overnight.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Lipid homeostasis is essential for a maximal ER stress response&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We have now compiled full reviews, and conducted consensus building discussion. Generally, all reviewers agree that the work is unique, interesting, and sufficiently broad in scope to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, with requested changes. The reviewers' specific comments are listed below, grouped by individual reviewer, with suggested modifications or revisions for a resubmitted version of this important study. Nearly all of the suggestions are to promote clarity in presentation, scholarship, or exposition, and do not require further experimental work. The few suggestions for new experimental studies should be viewed as possible opportunities for expansion of the presented data if such studies have already been executed, although you are welcome to launch new studies according to your temporal, fiscal, and psychological capacities for such endeavor. This is an interesting and thought provoking study, and we appreciate the chance to participate in making it part of the peer-reviewed scientific record.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>a. The experimental system described in the manuscript is powerful as it makes it possible to investigate some important mechanistic questions relatively easily. For example, given the identified ER morphological changes, can overexpression or knockout of the reticulon genes lead to the s-11-activated UPRE-GFP reporter phenotype in acs<sup>-1</sup> RNAi nematodes? Does RNAi (or overexpression) of such genes recapitulate the let-767 RNAi-induced recovery of ER proteotoxic stress-induced UPRE-GFP in s-11i cells?</p><p>b. Comparisons of normalized A.F.U. in Figure 1E and 1G do not seem to correlate well with the images shown in Figure 1D and 1F, respectively. What are these values normalized to? Further explanation is needed on how the normalized A.F.U. was determined from the values obtained with the BioSorter.</p><p>Related minor comment</p><p>The scale of the y-axis of normalized A.F.U. should be consistent throughout the manuscript. For example, in Figure 4B, normalized A.F.U. is on an X10000 scale while in Figure 4D it is X1000. Both graphs show relatively similar values and differences between WT and let-767 nematodes.</p><p>c. Do the cellular levels of LCFA or mmBCFA (iso C17 or oleic acid) and/or levels of iso C17-containing lipids present in the lysate supplement used (Figure 2 and S2) explain the results in let-767 or acs<sup>-1</sup> RNAi nematodes? Does the recovery occur in a concentration-dependent manner?</p><p>d. The ER establishes contact sites with mitochondria. Does the long-chain FA oxidation that occurs in mitochondria have any effect on the hsp-4-GFP levels in either let-767 or acs<sup>-1</sup> RNAi nematodes?</p><p>e. The authors should discuss their findings with respect to the findings published in a recent paper by Bin Liang's lab (i.e., JCB 2021, 220, e202102122 &quot;mmBCFA C17iso ensures endoplasmic reticulum integrity for lipid droplet growth&quot;), as it directly concerns Acs1 involvement in lipid droplet growth in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>f. One potential addition that could help towards publication in <italic>eLife</italic> might include extending the scope of the manuscript, which would differentiate the work from previously published papers. For example, the experimental system the authors have set up may allow for the testing of the contribution of age, by using young vs. old animals or by generating lysates from either young or old animals. This is not a request for a whole set of new experiments, but determining the impact of age on the contribution of lipids to the UPR might provide a unique and important conclusion that would warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>• It should be mentioned either in the title or the abstract that this is in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>• The paper would be more accessible for readers if the following figure panels were modified to have colorblind friendly colors: Figure S1B, 3A, 3D, 3E, S3A, S3C. This is a good resource for color blind friendly data visualization: https://thenode.biologists.com/data-visualization-with-flying-colors/research/</p><p>• In the introduction, the first time a specific gene or pathway is mentioned, it would be helpful to have 1-2 sentences introducing it.</p><p>• As a general note on statistics for quantification of the UPR reporter, it says in the figure panels that 3 replicates were used even though the N value is several hundred in most panels. Please clarify what is being counted as 1 replicate. Is the replicate all the larvae from one RNAi experiment? This high N is also why even small impacts on UPR activation have such low p-values throughout the paper. It is sometimes difficult to tell which observations are biologically significant versus statistically significant.</p><p>• All microscopy images should include a scale bar.</p><p>• Please define &quot;percent mobile&quot; from Figure S3 and how this value was calculated, either in figure legend or in methods section.</p><p>• The FRAP data is very interesting, I would not expect that the mobility of an ER luminal protein would be impacted at all. Do you have any idea why this effect is seen?</p><p>• Figure S3 is important for the model proposed in Figure 6. I think this figure should be a main figure instead a supplemental figure.</p><p>• Was the FRAP experiment performed with a fluorescently tagged Ire1, like mRuby::ire-1b? This would help give credence to the final model in Figure 6 that let-767 knockdown has an impact on Ire1 activation.</p><p>• If there is data quantifying UPR expression let-767 RNAi with tunicamycin treatment, that should be included.</p><p>• It would be helpful to include an ire-1 RNAi positive control in the tunicamycin surivial curves.</p><p>• The genetic screen to identify lipid metabolism genes that crosstalk with ER stress is very interesting! It would be interesting to know why let-767 was selected for follow-up versus the other candidates from Figure S1A.</p><p>• It is unclear the exact connection between sbp-1 and let-767 and it would be useful to include more explanation of why sbp-1 knockdown was predicted to alleviate the UPR defect of let-767 knockdown.</p><p>• Please expand on the connection between asc-1 and let-767 and speculate on why the phenotype for these two is more similar to that of other LCFA and mmBCFA metabolism genes.</p><p>• Images of lipid droplets and ER are difficult to interpret. It would benefit the paper if the paper had quantification of lipid droplet number and size and ratio of ER tubules versus sheets. If this is too time consuming to quantify, it would still be useful to have arrows in the ER images of what is a tube versus a sheet, as this is difficult for readers to determine.</p><p>• It would help to understand better the link between HSD17B12 and let-767. Are these homologs? Do they have any sequence similarity?</p><p>• Were any experiments performed giving 3-oxoacyl-CoA to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and measuring UPR activation? I understand it could be potentially be converted into a different metabolite, but even so, it would be helpful to include this data if it exists.</p><p>• While outside the scope of the paper, it would greatly help in supporting the overall findings if lipidomics were performed in let-767 knockdown worms.</p><p>• What are some potential ideas of how let-767 could have impacts on UPR downstream of XBP1 splicing?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Change in lipid droplet (LD) size and number with lysate in let-767 RNAi is minimal. It might be best to report quantification of LD number and size to support their conclusions, such as in Figure 2C-D. It is also difficult to appreciate the difference in ER morphology. I suggest the authors to point out the differences in the panel or to provide images of better quality.</p><p>2. There is high background signal for both channels, mCherry and GFP, in Figure 3F. It will be great if the quality of the images can be improved and/or quantification of LD number and size can be added.</p><p>3. The authors show that 3- oxoacyl is sufficient to inhibit the UPR activation in huh7 cells. Have the authors similarly tried supplementing <italic>C. elegans</italic> with the fatty acid intermediate 3-oxoacyl?</p><p>4. Many of the reported data are from biological duplicates. At least biological triplicates should be performed to ensure reproducibility, unless the practice of biological duplicate is deem acceptable in the field for specific experiments (lifespan).</p><p>5. Labelling Figure S3A-B panels with the respective protein tested for mobility will make the figure clearer.</p><p>6.P values should be added to Figure 4E-F. It will be good to include the replicates as well with single data point (dot plot superimposed to the bar chart).</p><p>7. In the legend of Figure 5B, it should be μM and not uM.</p><p>8. In the legend of Figure 5, should it refer to &quot;bar graph of (B)&quot; instead of &quot;H&quot;?</p><p>9. In Figure 5B, where is the data for 50 μM Cerulenin?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83884.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>a.

While simultaneous knockdown of multiple <italic>cpt</italic> genes may have an increased effect on FA oxidation and increase the amount of long-chain FAs available, we do not expect an increase in available long-chain FAs to impact our phenotype as supplementation of excess oleic acid (a long-chain FA) did not rescue the UPR<sup>ER</sup> suppression caused by <italic>let-767</italic> RNAi.

Change in lipid droplet (LD) size and number with lysate in let-767 RNAi is minimal. It might be best to report quantification of LD number and size to support their conclusions, such as in Figure 2C-D. It is also difficult to appreciate the difference in ER morphology. I suggest the authors to point out the differences in the panel or to provide images of better quality.</p></disp-quote><p>Higher quality images have been added and arrows added to highlight the differences in LDs and ER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There is high background signal for both channels, mCherry and GFP, in Figure 3F.
