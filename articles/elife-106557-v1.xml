techniques have advanced the study of neuronal circuits but lack methods to reliably identify cell types while scaling to thousands of neurons. We introduce spikeMAP, a pipeline for analyzing large-scale in vitro cortical recordings that combines spike sorting with cell-type identification using viral and optogenetic validation. SpikeMAP integrates data analysis with optogenetic, viral, and pharmacological protocols to dynamically probe distinct cell types while recording from large populations. The pipeline fits spike waveforms using spline interpolation to measure half-amplitude and peak-to-peak durations, applies principal component analysis and k-means clustering to isolate single-neuron signals, and uses linear discriminant analysis to optimize cluster separability. Channel source locations are determined through spatiotemporal spike waveform characteristics. Applied to mouse prefrontal cortex slices recorded on a 4096-channel array, spikeMAP effectively distinguishes regular-spiking excitatory neurons from fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons via action potential waveform, Fano factor, and spatial cross-correlations. This validated toolbox enables comprehensive characterization of neuronal activity across cell types in high-density recordings, offering a scalable approach to study microcircuit interactions in the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spike sorting</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>multielectrodes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thivierge</surname><given-names>Jean-Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210989</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beique</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-06901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beique</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beique</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003151</institution-id><institution>Fonds de recherche du QuÃ©bec â Nature et technologies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraud</surname><given-names>Eloise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGS M scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giraud</surname><given-names>Eloise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Ottawa Brain and Mind Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beique</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name><name><surname>Thivierge</surname><given-names>Jean-Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel software tool and ground-truth optogenetic validation is provided to automatically detect putative excitatory and inhibitory cells in neuronal recordings performed with large-scale multielectrode arrays.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The advent of high-density, large-scale multielectrode array recordings has advanced our understanding of how populations of neurons represent and process information, offering crucial insights into complex network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Riquelme et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hemberger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thivierge et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the use of silicon recording probes such as Neuropixels probes in vivo has helped uncover foundational principles of neural circuits in awake behaving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peters et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains a challenge to distinguish neuronal cell types based on their physiological properties alone, despite a growing appreciation for the importance of heterogeneous cell types in circuit-level computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sylwestrak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bugeon et al., 2022</xref>). The scalability of large-scale electrophysiological recording techniques depends not only on the detection and isolation of spikes produced by single neurons (spike sorting) but also on the reliable distinction between those triggered by different cell types.</p><p>The recording of extracellular potentials is a popular method to investigate neural activity, offering a high spatiotemporal resolution while allowing for the monitoring of action potentials from thousands of cells simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Magland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BuzsÃ¡ki, 2004</xref>). Cell-type sorting based on extracellular action potential waveforms has been extensively explored. It has been proposed that excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons can be distinguished based on action potential waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafizi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BarthÃ³ et al., 2004</xref>). These methods typically extract features of action potentials such as peak-to-peak time difference and full-width-half amplitude maximum and match these features to reported values for each cell type to distinguish them. The rationale for using these features as a proxy for cell-type identity stems from intracellular recording studies, which report that inhibitory cells, such as parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic interneurons, have short-duration action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nowak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peyrache and Destexhe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connors and Gutnick, 1990</xref>), whereas excitatory pyramidal neurons have longer-duration action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCormick et al., 1985</xref>). Narrow and broad action potentials have been distinguished from one another in several neocortical areas, including prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constantinidis and Goldman-Rakic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GonzÃ¡lez-Burgos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BarthÃ³ et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tamura et al., 2004</xref>). These differences have been hypothesized to result from the fact that repolarization of the membrane potential following a spike is slower among broad-spiking pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McCormick et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nowak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</xref>). In the extracellular signal, which resembles the negative derivative of the intracellular membrane potential, this gives both a broader and shallower peak following the initial trough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henze et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Modern extracellular recording techniques allow researchers to monitor the simultaneous activity of large, intact networks of neurons. However, in dense preparations, the activity of a single cell may be captured by several electrodes, and each electrode may report the activity of several nearby cells. Thus, to segregate the activity of single cells, effective spike-sorting techniques must be employed. Spike sorting typically includes filtering the raw extracellular activity, detecting action potentials using threshold crossings, extracting spike features, and clustering to distinguish amongst neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rey et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Several methods have been developed, each with specialized features, including Kilosort4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pachitariu et al., 2023</xref>), SpyKING CIRCUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yger et al., 2018</xref>), MountainSort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), Herding Spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilgen et al., 2017</xref>), YASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2017a</xref>), and JRCLUST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). A detailed comparison of these methods is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. A common lacking feature in these methods is the ability to identify cell types in a biologically validated fashion. Despite evidence showing differences in action potential kinetics for distinct cell types as well as the use of optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilgen et al., 2017</xref>), there exist no large-scale validation efforts, to our knowledge, showing that extracellular waveforms can be used to reliably distinguish cell types. Methods leveraging genetic differences between cell types offer statistical measures predictive of cell types, such as Fano Factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becchetti et al., 2012</xref>). These methods have provided researchers with the ability to infer, in a post-hoc fashion, the most probable cell types that were sampled. Yet, a fully integrated suite offering an open-source data analysis pipeline paired with a validated experimental protocol allowing for high-density cell-type-specific activation during recordings is needed. Such a method will enable the investigation of dense and intricate circuits in a flexible, scalable, and generalizable manner.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title><bold>lang</bold>.: Programming language<bold>, # elect</bold>.</title><p>: Maximum number of electrodes tested on, <bold>data preproc</bold>.: Data preprocessing (formatting, filtering, artefact removal) included, <bold>event/channel loc</bold>.: Localization of single events, <bold>waveform extrac</bold>.: Spike features (such as peak-to-peak distance and full-width half max) are extracted from waveforms, <bold>e/i sorting</bold>: excitatory and inhibitory cell sorting, <bold>validation</bold>: validation of cell-type sorting (<italic>+)=ground truth validation via intracellular recordings, but not e/i validation</italic>, <bold>experim. prot</bold>.: integrates an experimental protocol to allow for network manipulation, <bold>unsuper</bold>.: unsupervised, requiring no manual user intervention, <bold>source code available</bold>: entire code is open-source and available.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">lang.</th><th align="left" valign="top"># elect.</th><th align="left" valign="top">data preproc.</th><th align="left" valign="top">event/ channel loc.</th><th align="left" valign="top">waveform extrac.</th><th align="left" valign="top">e/i sorting</th><th align="left" valign="top">validation</th><th align="left" valign="top">experim. prot.</th><th align="left" valign="top">unsuper.</th><th align="left" valign="top">source code available</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>spikeMAP</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top">Python and<break/>Matlab</td><td align="left" valign="top">4096</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Kilosort4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pachitariu et al., 2023</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Python</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">-</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SpyKING CIRCUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yger et al., 2018</xref>;

Crucially, we tightly integrate our analysis with an experimental protocol utilizing a stabilized step function opsin to dynamically probe distinct populations and validate sorting while avoiding the light-induced artefacts common on CMOS-based chip designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiscella et al., 2012</xref>). Our analysis pipeline, taking advantage of dense sampling, estimates cell-body location for each detected spike, yielding well-separated clusters associated with single neurons. Spike waveform features were extracted utilizing signal interpolation to estimate half-amplitude and peak-to-peak durations. These values were then entered in a principal component analysis with k-means clustering to identify uncorrelated signals from single channels on the array. Optimal separability of clusters was assessed by linear discriminant analysis. Each channelâs source location was identified using spatiotemporal characteristics of spike waveforms across the array. We further classified cells as putative excitatory or inhibitory based on their waveform properties. As a final validation, we introduced a method taking advantage of long timescale optogenetics (step function opsins) to perform cell-type-specific stimulation in acute prefrontal cortex slices from mice, providing a biological verification to our statistical methods. Together, spikeMAP provides a comprehensive toolkit for experimenters to flexibly interrogate cell-type-specific computations in a variety of neural circuits throughout the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spike sorting</title><p>Our spike sorting pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) performs three main tasks: (i) the detection of voltage deflections associated with putative somatic spikes, (ii) the identification of individual putative neurons using spike clustering, and (iii) the spatial localization of single cells in high-density recordings. We demonstrate the use of this pipeline through targeted high-density recording from medial prefrontal cortex of mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see Materials and methods). First, putative spike times were detected as threshold crossings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bi</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewicki, 1998</xref>), identifying negative signal peaks from the mean of the filtered signal (see Materials and methods). Optimal threshold choice is key in discriminating spikes from noise, as the number of spikes detected per electrode is highly dependent on the threshold used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Here, the optimal threshold for detection was selected by fitting the voltage histogram of each channel with a Gaussian distribution to separate spiking activity from normally distributed noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At a threshold of â3Ï, the signal could be largely accounted for by Gaussian noise, while a separation between signal and noise began around a threshold of â4Ï. To avoid multiple detections of the same event, an absolute refractory period was imposed to discard successive events within &lt;2ms. Although filtering is crucial in event detection, it can introduce signal distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yael and Bar-Gad, 2017</xref>).

To address this issue, we employed a principal component analysis on the identified spike waveforms from individual channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rossant et al., 2016</xref>), which revealed distinct clusters putatively corresponding to individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that more than one neuron likely contributes to the voltage recorded on some channels. The SpikeMAP suite also offers a routine to select a radius around individual channels in order to enter groups of adjacent channels in PCA. Next, we employed a k-means cluster analysis to extract clusters amongst the principal components. To determine how well the data was separated by this approach, we applied a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to the labeled principal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2011</xref>), allowing our method to remain completely unsupervised. In SpikeMAP, the optimal number of k-means clusters can be chosen by a Calinski-Harabasz criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calinski and Harabasz, 1974</xref>) or pre-selected by the user.</p><p>To ensure the activity of each single cell was only reported once, we set a radius of 250 Âµm around the electrode where a given cell was detected. This radius corresponds to the approximate spread of extracellular electrical field around the soma of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). Within this radius, the channel with the largest negative deflection in mean waveform was identified. Previous work observed that the largest negative amplitude of extracellular signal originates from the axon initial segment (AIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakkum et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Obien et al., 2014</xref>). Utilizing spatial localization of the AIS, the channel showing the greatest negative deflection was likely the closest to the putative soma of a given cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2019</xref>). Activity at this channel was consistent with the somatic activity, showing a decay in peak voltage as we moved away from the putative soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delgado Ruz and Schultz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pettersen and Einevoll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">LindÃ©n et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mechler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

As an additional verification step, SpikeMAP allows the computation of spike-count correlations between putative neurons located within a user-defined radius. Signals that exceed a defined threshold of correlation can be rejected as they likely reflect the same underlying cell. To further verify that single cells located near the same electrode could be distinguished, we estimated the precise soma locations between adjacent recording electrodes using a center-of-mass analysis (see Materials and methods). This revealed subtle changes in position, reflected by distinct weights on each nearby electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Despite these subtle changes, the soma location could still be assigned to the same electrode since changes in localization across spikes were far less than the inter-electrode distance.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Decrease in voltage relative to the distance from putative soma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Voltage amplitude as a function of distance from highest electrode peak.

Other elements are novel, including the use of spline interpolation, LDA, and the ability to identify putative excitatory and inhibitory cells.

As technological progress continuously allows for denser arrays, waveform spike analyses are increasingly sensitive to noise generated by the signal of proximal units. Here, we first implemented a classification method using current knowledge about cell-type-specific waveform kinetics and spline interpolation to distinguish putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons in dense networks. We then validated this classification using a combination of viral strategies, optogenetics, and pharmacology while simultaneously recording from stimulated mouse prefrontal cortex networks.</p><p>To provide a more precise description of the shape of each spike, we first fitted each waveform using piecewise cubic spline interpolation, a method allowing for the statistical inference of points within the boundaries of a set of known points.

I cells were identified as a single cluster with rapid time constants for both FW and PP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BarthÃ³ et al., 2004</xref>). We extracted the putative soma locations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons on the MEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and visualized firing activity in a raster plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for firing rate distributions). It is possible that the spatial location of putative I cells reflects the site of injection of the opsin in medial prefrontal cortex.

Conversely, we found that only 8% of neurons that had been classified as E showed an increase in firing rate after photostimulation. The percentage of I cells responsive to light may be influenced by our viral strategy, which targets only a subset of PV-expressing interneurons largely located in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortical subregions. Additionally, non-PV inhibitory interneurons and some excitatory neurons could have been initially classified as inhibitory based on their waveform properties. These experiments, however, unambiguously identified a subset of genetically identified PV neurons: those that showed a transient photostimulation-induced increase in firing rate.

Nevertheless, it is possible that distinguishing all inhibitory cell types based on extracellular waveforms alone may not be achievable. Despite this limitation, incremental advancements such as those presented here are crucial for refining our understanding and improving analytical approaches. Given that spike sorting features in vitro can differ from properties exhibited in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nowak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GonzÃ¡lez-Burgos et al., 2005</xref>), future work should address if these classification/waveform properties can be generalized to behaving organisms, for example with tetrodes, optrodes, or implanted electrode arrays.</p><p>In sum, our work described a fully integrated method with an open-source, unsupervised, and scalable spike sorting analysis pipeline performing cell-type classification, integrated with an experimental protocol utilizing a stabilized step function opsin to validate sorting on large-scale MEAs.

Moreover, most existing spike sorting packages are for in vivo use, where the majority of electrodes are separated from each other by several hundred microns or more. There is a need for spike sorting packages that can take advantage of high-density electrode arrays where all electrodes are within a few tens of microns from other electrodes. Here, the authors offer such a software package with SpikeMAP, and they validate its performance in identifying parvalbumin interneurons that were optogenetically stimulated.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main strength of this work is that the authors use ground truth measures to show that SpikeMAP can take features of spike shapes to correctly identify known parvalbumin interneurons against a background of other neuron types. They use spike width and peak to peak distance as the key features for distinguishing between neuron types, a method that has been around for many years (BarthÃ³, Peter, et al. &quot;Characterization of neocortical principal cells and interneurons by network interactions and extracellular features.&quot; Journal of neurophysiology 92.1 (2004): 600-608.), but whose performance has not been validated in the context of high-density electrode arrays.</p><p>Another strength of this approach is that it is automated - a necessity if your electrode array has 4096 electrodes. Hand-sorting or even checking such a large number of channels is something even the cruellest advisor would not wish upon a graduate student. With such large channel counts, it is essential to have automated methods that are known to work accurately. Hence, the combination of validation and automation is an important advance.</p><p>A nice feature of this work is that with high-density electrode arrays, the spike waveforms appear on multiple nearby electrodes simultaneously. And since spike amplitudes fall off with distance, this allows triangulation of neuron locations within the regular electrode array. Thus, spike correlations between neuron types, or within neuron types, can be plotted as a function of distance. While SpikeMAP is not the first to do this (Peyrache, Adrien, et al. &quot;Spatiotemporal dynamics of neocortical excitation and inhibition during human sleep.&quot; Proceedings of the national academy of sciences 109.5 (2012): 1731-1736.), it is a welcome capability of this package.</p><p>It is also good that the code for this package is open-source, allowing a community of people (I expect in vitro labs will especially want to use this) to use the code and further improve it.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As this code was developed for use with a 4096-electrode array, it is important to be aware of double counting neurons across the many electrodes. I understand that there are ways within the code to ensure that this does not happen, but care must be taken in two key areas: First, action potentials traveling down axons will exhibit a triphasic waveform that is different from the biphasic waveform that appears near the cell body, but these two signals will still be from the same neuron (for example, see Litke et al., 2004 &quot;What does the eye tell the brain: Development of a System for the Large-Scale Recording of Retinal Output Activity&quot;; figure 14). I did not see anything that would directly address this situation, so it might be something for you to consider in updated versions of the code. Second, spike shapes are known to change when firing rates are high, like in bursting neurons (Harris, K.D., Hirase, H., Leinekugel, X., Henze, D.A. &amp; BuzsÃ¡ki, G. Temporal interaction between single spikes and complex spike bursts in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Neuron 32, 141-149 (2001)). I did not see this addressed in the present version of the manuscript.</p><p>Another area for possible improvement would be to build on the excellent validation experiments you have already conducted with parvalbumin interneurons. Although it would take more work, similar experiments could be conducted for somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons against a background of excitatory neurons. These may have different spike profiles, but your success in distinguishing them can only be known if you validate against ground truth, like you did for the PV interneurons.</p><p>Appraisal:</p><p>This work addresses the need for an automated spike sorting software package for high density electrode arrays. Although no spike sorting software is flawless, the package presented here, SpikeMAP, has been validated on PV interneurons, inspiring a degree of confidence. This is a good start, and further validation on other neuron types could increase that confidence.

According to the authors, spikeMAP not only allows for the detection of spikes produced by single neurons (spike sorting), but also allows for the reliable distinction between genetically determined cell types by utilizing viral and optogenetic strategies as ground-truth validation. While I find that the paper is nicely written, and easy to follow, I find that the algorithmic part of the paper is not really new and should have been more carefully compared to existing solutions. While the GT recordings to assess the possibilities of a spike sorting tool to distinguish properly between excitatory and inhibitory neurons is interesting, spikeMAP does not seem to bring anything new to state of the art solutions, and/or, at least, it would deserve to be properly benchmarked. This is why I would suggest the authors to perform a more intensive comparison with existing spike sorters.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The GT recordings with optogenetic activation of the cells, based on the opsins is interesting and might provide useful data to quantify how good spike sorting pipelines are, in vitro, to discriminate between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Such an approach can be quite complementary with artificially generated ground truth.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The global workflow of spikeMAP, described in Figure 1, seems to be very similar to the one of [Hilgen et al, 2020, 10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.038.]. Therefore, the first question is what is the rationale of reinventing the wheel, and not using tools that are doing something very similar (as mentioned by the authors themselves). I have a hard time, in general, believing that spikeMAP has something particularly special, given its Methods, compared to state-of-the-art spike sorters. This is why at the very least, the title of the paper is misleading, because it let the reader think that the core of the paper will be about a new spike sorting pipeline. If this is the main message the authors want to convey, then I think that numerous validations/benchmarks are missing to assess first how good spikeMAP is, w.r.t. spike sorting in general, before deciding if this is indeed the right tool to discriminate excitatory vs inhibitory cells. The GT validation, while interesting, is not enough to entirely validate the paper. The details are a bit too scarce to me, or would deserve to be better explained (see other comments after)</p><p>Regarding the putative location of the spikes, it has been shown that center of mass, while easy to compute, is not the most accurate solution [Scopin et al, 2024, 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2024.110297]. For example, it has an intrinsic bias for finding positions within the boundaries of the electrodes, while some other methods such as monopolar triangulation or grid-based convolution might have better performances. Can the authors comment on the choice of Center of Mass as a unique way to triangulate the sources?</p><p>Still in Figure 1, I am not sure to really see the point of Spline Interpolation. I see the point of such a smoothing, but the authors should demonstrate that it has a key impact on the distinction of Excitatory vs. Inhibitory cells. What's special with the value of 90kHz for a signal recorded at 18kHz? What is the gain with spline enhancement compared to without? Does such a value depend on the sampling rate, or is it a global optimum found by the authors?</p><p>Figure 2 is not really clear, especially panel B. The choice of the time scale for the B panel might not be the most appropriate, and the legend filtered/unfiltered with a dot is not clear to me in Bii. In panel E, the authors are making two clusters with PCA projections on single waveforms. Does this mean that the PCA is only applied to the main waveforms, i.e. the ones obtained where the amplitudes are peaking the most? This is not really clear from the methods, but if this is the case, then this approach is a bit simplistic and not really matching state-of-the-art solutions. Spike waveforms are quite often, especially with such high-density arrays, covering multiple channels at once and thus the extracellular patterns triggered by the single units on the MEA are spatio-temporal motifs occurring on several channels. This is why, in modern spike sorters, the information in a local neighbourhood is often kept to be projected, via PCA, on the lower dimensional space before clustering. Information on a single channel only might not be informative enough to disambiguate sources. Can the authors comment on that, and what is the exact spatial resolution of the 3Brain device? The way the authors are performing the SVD should be clarified in the methods section. Is it on a single channel, and/or on multiple channels in a local neighbourhood?</p><p>About the isolation of the single units, here again, I think the manuscript lacks some technical details. The authors are saying that they are using a k-means cluster analysis with k=2. This means that the authors are explicitly looking for 2 clusters per electrodes. If so, this is a really strong assumption that should not be held in the context of spike sorting, because since it is a blind source separation technique, one cannot pre-determine in advance how many sources are present in the vicinity of a given electrode. While the illustration on Figure 2E is ok, there is no guarantee that one cannot find more clusters, so why this choice of k=2? Again, this is why most modern spike sorting pipelines are not relying on k-means, to avoid any hard coded number of clusters. Can the authors comment on that?</p><p>I'm surprised by the linear decay of the maximal amplitude as a function of the distance from soma, as shown in Figure 2H. Is it really what should be expected? Based on the properties of the extracellular media, shouldn't we expect a power law for the decay of the amplitude? This is strange that up to 100um away from the some, the max amplitude only dropped from 260 to 240 uV. Can the authors comment on that? It would be interesting to plot that for all neurons recorded, in a normed manner V/max(V) as function of distances, to see what the curve looks like</p><p>In Figure 3A, it seems that the total number of cells is rather low for such a large number of electrodes. What are the quality criteria that are used to keep these cells? Did the authors exclude some cells from the analysis, and if yes, what are the quality criteria that are used to keep cells? If no criteria are used (because none is mentioned in the Methods), then how come so few cells are detected, and can the authors convince us that these neurons are indeed &quot;clean&quot; units (RPVs, SNRs, ...)</p><p>Still in Figure 3A, it looks like there is a bias to find inhibitory cells at the borders, since they do not appear to be uniformly distributed over the MEA. Can the authors comment on that? What would be the explanation for such a behaviour? It would be interesting to see some macroscopic quantities on Excitatory/Inhibitory cells, such as mean firing rates, averaged SNRs, ... Because again, in Figure 3C, it is not clear to me that the firing rates of inhibitory cells is higher than Excitatory ones, while it should be in theory.</p><p>For Figure 3 in general, I would have performed an exhaustive comparison of putative cells found by spikeMAP and other sorters. More precisely, I think that to prove the point that spikeMAP is indeed bringing something new to the field of spike sorting, the authors should have compared the performances of various spike sorters to discriminate Exc vs Inh cells based on their ground truth recordings. For example, either using Kilosort [Pachitariu et al, 2024, 10.1038/s41592-024-02232-7], or some other sorters that might be working with such large high-density data [Yger et al, 2018, 10.7554/eLife.34518]</p><p>Figure 4 has a big issue, and I guess the panels A and B should be redrawn. I don't understand what the red rectangle is displaying.</p><p>I understand that Figure 4 is only one example, but I have a hard time understanding from the manuscript how many slices/mice were used to obtain the GT data? I guess the manuscript could be enhanced by turning the data into an open access dataset, but then some clarification is needed. How many flashes/animals/slices are we talking about. Maybe this should be illustrated in Figure 4, if this figure is devoted to the introduction of the GT data.</p><p>While there is no doubt that GT data as the ones recorded here by the authors are the most interesting data from a validation point of view, the pretty low yield of such experiments should not discourage the use of artificially generated recordings such as the ones made in [Buccino et al, 2020, 10.1007/s12021-020-09467-7] or even recently in [Laquitaine et al, 2024, 10.1101/2024.12.04.626805v1]. In these papers, the authors have putative waveforms/firing rates patterns for excitatory and inhibitory cells, and thus the authors could test how good they are in discriminating the two subtypes</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>While I must thank the authors for their answers, I still think that they miss an important one, and only partially answering some of my concerns.</p><p>I truly think that SpikeMAP would benefit with a comparison with a state-of-the-art spike sorting pipeline, for example Kilosort. The authors said that they made the sorter modular enough such that only the E/I classification step can be compared. I think this would be worth it, just to be sure that SpikeMAP spike sorting, which might be more simple than other recent solution (with template matching), is not missing some cells, and thus degrading the E/I classification performances. I know that such a comparison is not straightforward, because there is no clear ground truth, but I would still need to be convinced that the sorting pipelines is bringing something, on its own. While there is no doubt that the E/I classification layer can be interesting, especially given the recordings shared by the authors, I'm still a bit puzzled by the sorting step. Thus maybe either a Table, a figure, or even as Supplementary one. Or the authors could try to generate fake GT data with MEArec for example, with putative E/I cells (discriminated via waveforms and firing rates) and show on such (oversimplified) data that SpikeMAP is performing similarly to modern spike sorters. Otherwise, this is a bit hard to judge...</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106557.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Giraud</surname><given-names>Eloise</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ottawa</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lynn</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vincent-Lamarre</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Montreal</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beique</surname><given-names>Jean-Claude</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ottawa</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thivierge</surname><given-names>Jean-Philippe</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Ottawa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ottawa</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p><p>As this code was developed for use with a 4096 electrode array, it is important to be aware of double-counting neurons across the many electrodes. I understand that there are ways within the code to ensure that this does not happen, but care must be taken in two key areas. Firstly, action potentials traveling down axons will exhibit a triphasic waveform that is different from the biphasic waveform that appears near the cell body, but these two signals will still be from the same neuron (for example, see Litke et al., 2004 &quot;What does the eye tell the brain: Development of a System for the Large-Scale Recording of Retinal Output Activity&quot;; figure 14). I did not see anything that would directly address this situation, so it might be something for you to consider in updated versions of the code.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have added a routine to the SpikeMAP to remove highly correlated spikes detected within a given spatial radius of each other. The following was added to the main text (line 149):</p><p>âAs an additional verification step, SpikeMAP allows the computation of spike-count correlations between putative neurons located within a user-defined radius. Signals that exceed a defined threshold of correlation can be rejected as they likely reflect the same underlying cell.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, spike shapes are known to change when firing rates are high, like in bursting neurons (Harris, K.D., Hirase, H., Leinekugel, X., Henze, D.A. &amp; BuzsÃ¡ki, G.

I did not see this addressed in the present version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a routine to SpikeMAP that computes population spike rates to verify stationarity over time.

Although it would take more work, similar experiments could be conducted for somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide neurons against a background of excitatory neurons. These may have different spike profiles, but your success in distinguishing them can only be known if you validate against ground truth, like you did for the PV interneurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following (line 326):</p><p>âfuture work could include different inhibitory interneurons such as somatostatin (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons to improve the classification of inhibitory cell types.

A full comparison between SpikeMAP and related methods is provided in Table. 1. As can be seen, SpikeMAP is the only method listed that performs E/I sorting on large-scale multielectrodes. Nonetheless, several aspects of SpikeMAP included in the spike sorting pipeline do overlap with existing methods, as these constitute necessary steps prior to performing E/I identification. These steps are not novel to the current work, nor do they constitute rigid options that cannot be substituted by the user. Rather, we aim to offer SpikeMAP users the option to combine E/I identification with preliminary steps performed either through our software or through another package of their choosing. For instance, preliminary spike sorting could be done through Kilosort before importing the spike data into SpikeMAP for E/I identification. To allow greater flexibility, we have now modularized our suite so that E/I identification can be performed as a stand-alone module. We have clarified the text accordingly (line 317):</p><p>âWhile SpikeMAP is the only known method to enable the identification of putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons on high-density multielectrode arrays (Table 1), several aspects of SpikeMAP included in the spike sorting pipeline (Figure 1) overlap with existing methods, as these constitute required steps prior to performing E/I identification. To enable users the ability to integrate SpikeMAP with existing toolboxes, we provide a modularized suite of protocols so that E/I identification can be performed separately from preliminary spike sorting steps. In this way, a user could carry out spike sorting through Kilosort or another package before importing their data to SpikeMAP for E/I identification.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The global workflow of spikeMAP, described in Figure 1, seems to be very similar to that of Hilgen et al. 2020 (10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.038).

In these papers, the authors have putative waveforms/firing rate patterns for excitatory and inhibitory cells, and thus, the authors could test how good they are in discriminating the two subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be worthwhile for future work to apply SpikeMAP to artificially generated spike trains, and have added the following (line 328):</p><p>âAnother avenue could involve applying SpikeMAP on artificially generated spike data (Buccino &amp; Einevoll 2021; Laquitaine et al., 2024).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 154 seems to include a parenthetical expression left over from editing: &quot;sensitive to noise (contamination? Better than noise?) generated by the signal of proximal units.&quot; See also line 186: &quot;use (reliance?) of light-sensitive&quot; and line 245: &quot;In the absence of synaptic blockers (right?),&quot; and line 270: &quot;the size of the data prevents manual intervention (curation?).&quot; Check carefully for all parentheses like that, which should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have revised the text and removed parenthetical expressions left over from editing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In lines 285-286, you state that: &quot;k-mean clustering of spike waveform properties best differentiated the two principal classes of cells...&quot; But I could not find where you compared k-means clustering to other methods. I think you just argued that k-means seemed to work well, but not better than, another method. If that is so, then you should probably rephrase those lines.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that direct comparisons are not performed here, hence we removed this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Methods section, E/I classification, lines 396-405: You give us figures on what fraction was E and I (PV subtype) (94.75% and 5.25%), but there is more that you could have said. First of all, what is the expected fraction of parvalbumin-sensitive interneurons in the cortex - is it near 5%?</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the text as follows (line 444): âThis number is close to the expected percentage of PV interneurons in cortex (4-6%) (Markram et al. 2004).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, how would these percentages change if you altered the threshold from 3 s.d. to something lower, like 2 s.d.? Giving us some idea of how the threshold affects the fraction of PV interneurons could give us an idea of whether this method agrees with our expectations or not.</p></disp-quote><p>While SpikeMAP offers the flexibility to set the voltage threshold manually, we opted for a stringent threshold to demonstrate the capabilities of the software. As seen in Figure 2D, at 2 and 3 s.d., the signal is largely accounted for by Gaussian noise, while deviation from noise arises around 4 s.d. We clarified the text as follows (line 120):</p><p>âAt a threshold of -3 , the signal could be largely accounted for by Gaussian noise, while a separation between signal and noise began around a threshold of -4 â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, did the inhibitory neurons identified by this optogenetic method also have narrow spike widths at half amplitude? Could you do a scatterplot of all the spike widths and inter-peak distances that had color-coded dots for E and I based on your optogenetic method?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a scatterplot (Supplemental Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Can you compare your methods with others now widely in use, like, for example, Spiking Circus or Kilosort? You do that in Table 1 in terms of features, but not in terms of performance. For example, you could have applied Kilosort4 to your data from the 4096 electrode array and seen how often it sorted the same neurons that SpikeMAP did. I realize this could not give you a comparison of how many were E/I, but it could tell you how close your numbers of neurons agreed with their numbers. Were your numbers within 5% of each other? This would be helpful for groups who are already using Kilosort4.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned ealier, packages listed in Table 1 do not provide an identification of putative E/I neurons on high-density electrode arrays. To facilitation the integration of SpikeMAP with other spike sorting packages, our suite now provides a stand-alone module to perform E/I identification. This is now mentioned in the text (see earlier comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I would encourage the authors to decide what the paper is about: is it about a new sorting method (and if yes, more tests/benchmarks are needed to explain the pros and the cons of the pipelines, and the Methods need to be expanded). Or is it about the new data for Ground Truth validation, and again, if yes, then maybe explain more what they are, how many slices/mice/cells, ... Maybe also consider making the data available online as an open dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the paper is best slated toward ground truth validation of E/I identification. We now specify how many slices/mice/cells etc. (see Supplemental Table 1) and make the data available online as open source.</p></body></sub-article></article>
