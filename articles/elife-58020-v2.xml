to replication inhibitors, but the reasons for this sensitivity have been enigmatic. Here, we show that RIF1 must be present both during replication stress and in the ensuing recovery period to promote cell survival. Of two isoforms produced by alternative splicing, we find that RIF1-Long alone can protect cells against replication inhibition, but RIF1-Short is incapable of mediating protection. Consistent with this isoform-specific role, RIF1-Long is required to promote the formation of the 53BP1 nuclear bodies that protect unrepaired damage sites in the G1 phase following replication stress. Overall, our observations show that RIF1 is needed at several cell cycle stages after replication insult, with the RIF1-Long isoform playing a specific role during the ensuing G1 phase in damage site protection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replication stress</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

chromosome maintenance, acting in double-strand break repair and DNA replication control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>). During double-strand break repair, RIF1 is recruited by 53BP1, dependent upon phosphorylation of 53BP1 by ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chapman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Virgilio et al., 2013</xref>). Together RIF1 and 53BP1 recruit Shieldin and suppress BRCA1 recruitment to damage sites, opposing homologous recombination-based repair and favouring non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Setiaputra and Durocher, 2019</xref>).</p><p>RIF1 is also implicated in protecting cells from replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar and Cheok, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazouzi et al., 2016</xref>). Replication stress can be induced by various conditions including drugs such as Aphidicolin, which interrupts replication fork progression by inhibiting the replicative DNA polymerases α, δ and ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syvaoja et al., 1990</xref>). Replication stress leads to genomic instability, mutation and eventually disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burrell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerzendorfer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogi et al., 2012</xref>), so understanding the cellular response is central for understanding accurate genome duplication and the action of replication inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imai et al., 2016</xref>). RIF1-deficient cells are acutely sensitive to replication stress, in fact appearing to be more sensitive to replication inhibitors than to double-strand break-inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that protection from stress is a critical RIF1 function.</p><p>Several roles have been described for RIF1 in replication control. RIF1 acts as a Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) ‘substrate-targeting subunit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peti et al., 2013</xref>) that suppresses replication origin initiation by directing PP1 to dephosphorylate the MCM replicative helicase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattarocci et al., 2014</xref>). RIF1 moreover stimulates origin licensing during G1 phase, and protects replication forks from unscheduled degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garzón et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether deficiency in these functions accounts for the replication stress sensitivity of cells lacking RIF1 has remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feng et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>RIF1 also acts in mitosis to maintain genomic stability. During anaphase, RIF1 is recruited to ultra-fine anaphase bridges (UFBs), along with the BLM and PICH proteins that ensure proper chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hengeveld et al., 2015</xref>). UFBs are believed to correspond to unresolved topological entanglements that escape checkpoint surveillance and persist into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergoglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhowmick et al., 2016</xref>). Unresolved DNA damage that passes to daughter cells leads to the formation of 53BP1 nuclear bodies during G1 phase, which protect the damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruhn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreno et al., 2016</xref>). RIF1 has also recently been described as functioning at the midbody during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhowmick et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The human RIF1 transcript undergoes alternative splicing producing two protein isoforms: a long variant of 2472 amino acids (‘RIF1-L’), and a short variant (‘RIF1-S’) which lacks 26 amino acids close to the C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Blackburn, 2004</xref>). RIF1-S was reported to be more abundant in various cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Blackburn, 2004</xref>), hinting at distinct effects of the isoforms. Although RIF1-L was designated the canonical form, studies using cloned RIF1 have predominantly used RIF1-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batenburg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Blackburn, 2004</xref>), without testing for distinct functions of the isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysing fluorescent degron-tagged RIF1 reveals highly dynamic cell cycle localisation</title><p>We aimed to understand how RIF1 guards against replication stress.

Specifically, we tested if RIF1 function is required during DNA replication stress, after its occurrence, or both during and after stress. Using auxin-inducible degron (AID) technology we constructed a cell line allowing rapid depletion and re-expression of RIF1 at different phases of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). In an HCT116-based cell line carrying the auxin-responsive degron recognition protein OsTIR1 under doxycycline (DOX) control, we N-terminally tagged both RIF1 genomic copies with a degron-Clover construct, termed ‘mAC’, consisting of a <underline>m</underline>ini-auxin-inducible degron and monomer <underline>C</underline>lover (a derivative of GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yesbolatova et al., 2019</xref>). The expressed construct remains under control of the endogenous RIF1 promoter. Western blot analysis indicated that expression levels of mAC-RIF1 in the absence of Auxin were similar to those of endogenous untagged RIF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Treatment for 24 hr with DOX and Auxin led to near-complete degradation of RIF1, as visualised by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Using flow cytometry analysis of the RIF1-fused mClover tag, we established suitable concentrations of DOX and Auxin to allow effective depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Degradation was largely complete after 3 hr of Auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whilst expression was restored to almost normal levels 5 hr after Auxin removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these results confirm the construction of a cell line allowing rapid depletion and re-expression of RIF1.</p><p>We visualised mAC-RIF1 based on Clover fluorescence, in the first study of the dynamic behaviour of tagged endogenous RIF1 in living cells.

This result suggests that only RIF1-L can protect cells from replication stress caused by Aphidicolin, and that RIF1-S is ineffective in this role.</p><p>To confirm this finding in a different cell line, we used HEK293-derived stable cell lines, containing siRIF1-resistant cDNA constructs encoding either GFP-RIF1-L or GFP-RIF1-S expressed under DOX control.

The isoforms are equally effective in preventing hyperphosphorylation of the MCM complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and protecting nascent DNA at blocked replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Nor did we observe significant differences between cells expressing RIF1-S or RIF1-L in replication fork speed (as assessed by nascent DNA tract length; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), bulk DNA synthesis levels (as measured by flow cytometry; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>), or replisome density (based on PCNA loading on chromatin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>). RIF1-S therefore can apparently fulfil the known functions of RIF1 during DNA replication, and yet cannot safeguard cells from Aphidicolin treatment. These observations imply that responding to replication stress demands a further RIF1-mediated mechanism to promote cell survival, probably one that operates after the period of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that specifically requires RIF1-L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>In its functions in origin repression and nascent DNA protection during S phase, RIF1 acts as a PP1 substrate-targeting subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garzón et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukherjee et al., 2019</xref>). To further test for separability of the effect of RIF1 in replication stress survival from its known roles in replication control, we investigated whether PP1 interaction is essential for RIF1-L to protect against Aphidicolin treatment. We used the HEK293 cell line expressing a version of RIF1-L mutated at the PP1 interaction motifs to prevent PP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>). This ‘RIF1-L-pp1bs’ protein was almost as effective as wild-type RIF1-L in conferring resistance to Aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>), indicating that RIF1-L acts largely independent of PP1 function in protecting cells from the effects of Aphidicolin. This independence from PP1 reinforces the evidence that the function of RIF1 in protecting from replication stress is distinct from its previously known roles in replication control, which do require PP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>RIF1-Long and -Short isoforms do not appear to differ in mitotic functions</title><p>We considered other routes through which RIF1 might promote survival after Aphidicolin treatment, focusing on events occurring after the replication stress period itself. Chromosomal bridge structures have been reported to form after replication stress—in particular UFBs, believed to correspond to sites of under-replicated DNA that become single-stranded when chromosomes separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). UFBs do not stain with DAPI (which recognises double-stranded DNA). RIF1 acts at UFBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hengeveld et al., 2015</xref>), so we tested whether the RIF1-L and RIF1-S isoforms show differential recruitment to these sites or affect their rate of formation. UFB formation is induced by treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitor ICRF-193 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ai</xref>,ii). We found no clear difference in rates of UFB formation in the HCT116 RIF1-L or RIF1-S cells after ICRF-193 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aii</xref>, left), and both RIF1-L and RIF1-S were localised at the UFBs formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ai</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aii</xref>, right). Treatment of these HCT116-based cell lines with Aphidicolin surprisingly did not induce UFBs, but rather increased the incidence of anaphase chromosome bridges (defined as bridge structures that stain with DAPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ai</xref>, Bi). These anaphase bridges were formed at similar rates in the RIF1-L and RIF1-S-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii</xref>, left) and both RIF1-L and RIF1-S were localised to these anaphase bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi</xref>, Bii, right). Overall therefore, both RIF1 isoforms can localise effectively to both anaphase bridge and UFB structures; and the loss of RIF1 does not greatly affect the rate at which such bridge structures occur. The results of this analysis were consistent with observations made by Imagestream flow cytometry, where analysis of untreated cell lines revealed chromosome bridge structures with localised RIF1 in 9 of 35 mitotic RIF1-L cells, and 8 of 38 mitotic RIF1-S cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Both RIF1-L and RIF1-S localise to replication stress-induced chromosome bridges.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (<bold>i</bold>) Representative images showing PICH and mAC-RIF1 localised at UFBs induced by ICRF-193 treatment of HCT116 cells containing only RIF1-L (upper panels) or RIF1-S (lower panels) isoforms.

We examined the formation of 53BP1 NBs 12 hr after removal of Aphidicolin in our cells expressing only mAC-RIF1-L, only mAC-RIF1-S, or neither isoform. We limited our analysis to G1 phase cells by counting only those that were cyclin A2-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The parental (mAC-RIF1) cell line showed an elevated fraction of cells with multiple large 53BP1 NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> top row, 5B black bars and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> top left panel), as expected. RIF1 was often colocalised with these bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> top row and 5C). In contrast, a reduced number of 53BP1 NBs were observed in RIF1-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> bottom row, 5B open bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> bottom right panel), demonstrating that RIF1 contributes to the formation of 53BP1 bodies after replication stress. Examining the cell lines expressing only Long or Short RIF1 isoforms, we found that mAC-RIF1-L localised normally with 53BP1 bodies, and supported their formation at a near normal rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> second row, 5B,C red bars and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> top right panel). In contrast, the number of 53BP1 NBs formed in mAC-RIF1-S cells was similar to that in RIF1-KO cells, and mAC-RIF1-S showed reduced co-localisation with the 53BP1 bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> third row, 5B,C grey bars and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> bottom left panel).

The two RIF1 isoforms therefore differ in their effectiveness in promoting 53BP1 nuclear body formation following replication stress, with RIF1-L but not RIF1-S functional in this role. Since 53BP1 nuclear bodies are known to protect DNA damaged as a consequence of Aphidicolin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>), the defect in 53BP1 body formation in the absence of RIF1-L is likely to be an important factor in the replication stress sensitivity of RIF1-deficient cells, and may explain the isoform specificity of the replication stress protection function of RIF1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>RIF1-L preferentially localises to 53BP1 protective nuclear bodies and promotes their formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images showing 53BP1 nuclear bodies and RIF1 foci in HCT116 cell lines.

This deficiency of RIF1-S function was initially surprising, since RIF1-S appears competent to fulfil the known functions of RIF1 in DNA replication management—in particular RIF1-S is able to support replication licensing and control MCM phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and to protect against nascent DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Consistently however, all of these known functions of RIF1 in replication control (promotion of replication licensing, control of MCM phosphorylation, and nascent DNA protection) depend on PP1 recruitment by RIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garzón et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>); whilst we find that protection against replication stress does not require PP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), again suggesting that the role of RIF1 in protecting from replication stress might involve additional mechanisms.</p><p>Testing the effects of conditional depletion in synchronised cultures revealed that RIF1 is still needed after a period of replication stress to guard against toxicity, implying that protection from Aphidicolin involves a further function of RIF1. We therefore investigated whether RIF1 operates in post-S phase replication stress response pathways. RIF1 was reported to act at chromosome bridge structures formed during mitosis after replication stress, so we tested whether the RIF1-L and RIF1-S isoforms function differently in this role. However, our investigations provided no evidence for differential roles of RIF1-L and RIF1-S at UFBs or anaphase bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Nor did we find any role for RIF1 in determining rates of MiDAS or chromatin breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Our finding that RIF1 does not affect chromatin breaks contrasts with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Debatisse and Rosselli, 2019</xref>, who observed that RIF1 depletion suppresses fragile site breakage in human lymphoblastoid cells. Debatisse and Rosselli interpreted this suppression as due to earlier replication of fragile site DNA in lymphoblastoid cells in the absence of RIF1. The lack of any effect in our HCT116-based line may reflect cell line-specificity of RIF1 effects on replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gnan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Rather than a differential role of the RIF1 isoforms during mitosis, our investigation revealed a role for RIF1-L in promoting the assembly of G1 phase 53BP1 nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Although in DNA repair RIF1 is generally thought to act downstream of 53BP1, RIF1 was recently shown to contribute to the correct substructure of 53BP1 ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) that form at radiation-induced double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ochs et al., 2019</xref>). Ochs et al did not report the number of 53BP1 IRIF foci formed in the absence of RIF1, or test effects of the RIF1 isoforms. The factors important for the larger, replication stress-induced G1 phase 53BP1 nuclear body (NB) structures are less well understood, and there has been no investigation of how RIF1 affects NB formation. The role we have discovered for RIF1-L could be related to the effect described by Ochs et al for RIF1 in 53BP1 IRIF organisation, but in RIF1-S cells we found no evident reduction in IRIF formation after DSB-inducing treatment, in contrast to the clear defect in replication stress-induced G1 phase 53BP1 NB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This difference suggests that the pathway through which RIF1 organises IRIF substructure (Ochs et al) may differ from the pathway through which RIF1-L promotes 53BP1 NB formation (this study). Factors that have been implicated upstream of 53BP1 NB formation include phospho-ATM and RNF168 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukas et al., 2011</xref>), but an initial investigation of these factors in RIF1-L and RIF1-S cells revealed no striking differences.</p><p>Our finding that RIF1-L but not RIF1-S can function in promoting 53BP1 body formation potentially explains the specific requirement for RIF1-L in protecting against replication stress, since 53BP1 NB assembly represents an important step in correct handling of stress-associated damage to enable ongoing proliferation. RIF1-L may act to directly promote 53BP1 NB assembly, or possibly assist with the transit of damaged sites through to G1 phase to allow such protective bodies to form. Presently it is unclear how the apparently small difference of RIF1-L from the RIF1-S isoform (the inclusion of just 26 amino acids) specifically supports 53BP1 nuclear body formation. Interestingly however, this region contains the motif ‘SPKF’ at amino acids 2265–2268, with the S-2265 residue identified as phosphorylated in high-throughput proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schweppe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) and in our own proteomics data. This sequence conforms to a ‘phosphoSPxF’ BRCT interaction motif, raising the possibility that RIF1-L interacts with one of the several BRCT domain-containing proteins involved in chromosome maintenance (which include BRCA1, TopBP1 and 53BP1 itself) to effect its role in promoting 53BP1 NB formation and protecting from Aphidicolin. However, the physical interaction of RIF1 with 53BP1 does not appear to be mediated through a BRCT domain-mediated interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callen et al., 2013</xref>). We found that TopBP1 is important to enable the observed association of RIF1-L with 53BP1 NBs. However, co-immunoprecipitation analysis of RIF1-L following Aphidicolin treatment did not identify any interaction with TopBP1 (data not shown), so the molecular mechanism through which RIF1-L promotes 53BP1 NB formation remains an open question.</p><p>The findings described here suggest that RIF1 contributes to recognising under-replicated and unrepaired sites for special protection and handling later in the chromosome cycle—in particular for delayed replication that guards against unscheduled recombinational repair to prevent the formation of pathological intermediates, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spies et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, this study highlights the multifunctional role of RIF1 in ensuring chromosome maintenance to promote the survival and proliferation of cells after replication stress, emphasising the importance of RIF1 for determining response to replication-inhibiting chemotherapeutic drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>). Constructed using the same procedure, described briefly under ‘HEK293 cell lines and culture conditions’, were cell lines: HEK293 Flp-In T-REx GFP-RIF1-L and HEK293 Flp-In T-REx GFP-RIF1-L-pp1bs. Construction of the necessary plasmids is described in the next section.</p><p>The HCT116 mAC-RIF1 cell line was constructed as outlined below in ‘HCT116 cell lines and culture conditions’, using the system described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yesbolatova et al., 2019</xref>). HCT116 mAC-RIF1-L, HCT116 mAC-RIF1-S and HCT116 RIF1 KO cells were constructed as described below. HCT116 mAC-RIF1 mCherry-PCNA was constructed by introducing the mCherry-PCNA construct under control of the EF1 alpha promoter using the piggyBac system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yusa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>For the HEK293-derived cell lines, presence of the Tet-repressor modification provides confirmation of cell line identity. For HCT116 OsTIR1-derived cells and HCT116 RIF1 KO cell lines, presence of the OsTIR1 modification confirms cell line identity. U2OS cells are from ATCC. Cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids used for cell line constructions</title><p>RIF1 is encoded on chromosome 2. The RIF1-Long isoform cDNA (RIF1-L; NCBI RefSeq NM_018151.4) encodes a 2,472-amino acid protein, whilst the short isoform (RIF1-S; RefSeq NM_001177663.1) lacks the 78-nucleotide stretch corresponding to exon 31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu and Blackburn, 2004</xref>). In this study we designate the exon containing the RIF1 ATG start codon as ‘exon 1’, so that our ‘exon 31’ corresponds to ‘exon 32’ of RefSeq NM_018151.4.</p><p>The GFP-RIF1 constructs used in this study are based on pcDNA5/FRT/TO-GFP-RIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>), which carries human RIF1-S cDNA with GFP fused at its N-terminus. To construct pcDNA5/FRT/TO-GFP-RIF1-L, a PCR fragment containing RIF1-S cDNA was amplified from pcDNA5/FRT/TO-GFP-RIF1 using primers SH593 and SH594, and cloned into pIRESpuro3 vector (linearised by EcoRV and EcoRI) using the In-Fusion HD cloning system, to create plasmid pSH1009. The NheI-NotI fragment of the plasmid pSH1009 was replaced using the In-Fusion HD system by two PCR fragments (amplified by SH572 and SH595 and SH596 and SH597 respectively), to construct pSH1011 which has RIF1-L cDNA. The NheI-PspOMI fragment of pcDNA5/FRT/TO-GFP-RIF1 was replaced by NheI-NotI fragment of the pSH1011 plasmid to construct pcDNA5/FRT/TO-GFP-RIF1-L. Construction of a GFP-RIF1-S-pp1bs plasmid was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2017</xref>). The GFP-RIF1-L-pp1bs construct was made following a similar strategy.</p><p>The plasmid pX330-U6-chimeric_BB-CBh-hSPCas9 from Feng Zhang (Addgene, 42230) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cong et al., 2013</xref>) was used to construct the CRISPR/Cas9 vector for the guide RNA according to the protocol described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). Donor plasmids were based on pBluescript and constructed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yesbolatova et al., 2019</xref>).

Transfections and hygromycin B selection of stably transfected cells were performed as described by the manufacturer. Clones were tested for doxycycline-dependent induction of GFP fusion proteins by western blot and microscopy.</p><p>To assess the effect of ectopically expressing RIF1, cells were transfected with either Control siRNA or siRNA against human RIF1 (see key resource table for sequence). 2 days later, cells were split with addition of 1 μg/ml DOX then incubated for 24 hr to induce expression of GFP-RIF1 variant proteins. siRNA transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Synonymous base mutations in the ectopically expressed GFP-RIF1 constructs make them resistant to siRNA targeted against endogenous RIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escribano-Díaz et al., 2013</xref>).

Two days after transfection cells were diluted in 10 cm dishes, to which 100 µg/mL of Hygromycin B Gold (Invivogen) was added for selection. After 10–12 days, colonies were picked for further selection in a 96-well plate. Bi-allelic insertion of the donor sequence was checked by genomic PCR. Clones taken forward for analysis of RIF1 function were selected based on near endogenous RIF1 levels of RIF1 and efficient AID-mediated degradation of RIF1.</p><p>To induce degradation of miniAID-mClover-fused RIF1, OsTIR1 expression was first induced by 0.2 μg/ml DOX added to the culture medium, to produce a functional SCF (Skp1–Cullin–F-box) ubiquitin ligase that directs degradation of an AID-tagged protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). After 24 hr, 10 μM Auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) was added to the culture medium to promote the interaction of mAC-RIF1 with SCF-OsTIR1, driving ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of mAC-RIF1. To suppress premature degradation of RIF1 in the presence of DOX, 100 μM of the auxin antagonist Auxinole, which interferes with TIR1 activity, was added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yesbolatova et al., 2019</xref>). In subsequent depletion experiments DOX was first added in the presence of Auxinole, and then Auxinole was replaced with Auxin.

After two days, cells were counted using the Invitrogen Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter and 250 cells added to each well of a 6-well plate (samples always plated in technical triplicate). For HEK293-based cell lines, 1 μg/ml DOX was added to the culture medium to induce ectopic RIF1 expression whilst for HCT116-derived cell lines, 10 μM Auxin was added to the culture medium to degrade RIF1. Cells were incubated for 24 hr after which Aphidicolin (or Hydroxyurea) was added and cells incubated for a further 24 hr, before washing twice with PBS and replacement with the appropriate Aphidicolin-free medium. For HEK293-derived cell lines, 1 μg/ml supplementary DOX was re-added 72 hr after Aphidicolin removal and cells were then incubated for a further 4 days. In the case of HCT116-derived cell lines, after Aphidicolin removal, cells were incubated for 7 days in medium containing appropriate drug (DOX, Auxin, Auxinole). At the end of the incubation period, colonies consisting of more than 20 cells were counted directly using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buonomo et al., 2009</xref>. Values were normalised to the 0 μM APH (DMSO) control. Statistical significance was calculated using a student’s T-test in Prism (Graphpad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>To assess DNA content, cells were recovered by trypsinisation, then fixed with 70% ethanol. Cells were spun down and resuspended in 0.5 ml FxCyclePI/RNase staining solution (Molecular Probes, F10797) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light.

Cells were washed and medium containing 2 mM Mevalonic acid (MVA) added to release the cells from the arrest. 8 hr after release, 9 μM RO-3306 was added to hold cells at the G2/M boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Javanmoghadam-Kamrani and Keyomarsi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vassilev et al., 2006</xref>). After 28 hr in RO-3306, cells were washed and drug-free medium added allowing cells to enter mitosis. Flow cytometry was used to analyse synchronisation efficiency, and to establish and optimise the procedure for the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> based on assessment of cell cycle progression kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>DNA fibre assay</title><p>Cells were pulse-labelled with 50 μM CldU (20 min), followed by another pulse with 250 μM IdU (20 min). After treatment with 2 mM Hydroxyurea for 4 hr, cells were harvested and lysed on a microscope slide with spreading buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.4, 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS). Slides were tilted to allow the DNA suspension to run slowly and spread the fibres down the slide. Slides were fixed in cold (−20°C) methanol-acetic acid (3:1) and DNA denatured in 2.5 M HCl at RT for 30 min. Slides were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hr at RT in a humidity chamber (anti-CldU, anti-IdU, anti-ssDNA). After washes with PBS, the slides were incubated with secondary antibodies (anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 594, anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 488, anti-mouse IgG2a Alexa Fluor 350). Slides were air-dried and mounted with Prolong (Invitrogen). Samples were imaged under a Zeiss Axio Imager and analysed using ImageJ. CldU and IdU tract lengths were measured in double-labelled forks and the IdU/CldU ratio was used as an indicator of nascent DNA degradation. Statistical significance was calculated using a Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Wide-field immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>HCT116 cells were cultured in a glass-bottomed dish (MatTek). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were antibody stained with primary antibodies (anti-53BP1, anti-FANCD2, anti-BLM) and secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, anti-goat Alexa Fluor 594, GFP-Booster ATTO 488). Microscopy was performed using a DeltaVision microscope (GE) with a x60 objective. 41 Z-stacks of 0.3 μM were taken and deconvolution was performed using the SoftWoRx software (DeltaVision). Maximum intensity projections (MIP) were created using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Unless stated otherwise, images shown are projections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Live-cell imaging</title><p>HCT116 cells were cultured in a glass-bottomed dish (MatTek) containing medium without phenol red. To visualise nuclei in live cells, 0.5 μM SiR-DNA (Spirochrome) was added to the medium before observation. Live-cell imaging was performed using a DeltaVision microscope equipped with an incubation chamber and a CO<sub>2</sub> supply (GE). Image analysis and quantification was performed using the Volocity software (PerkinElmer).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>HCT116 cells and U2OS cells were cultured in ibiTreat μ-slide eight well dishes (Ibidi). Cells were treated with 1 μM Aphidicolin for 24 hr after which Aphidicolin was removed and cells were incubated for a further 12 hr. Where indicated siTopBP1 (Ambion s21823, see key resource table for sequence) transfection was performed 48 hr before Aphidicolin treatment. Cells were fixed with either a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigma, HT-5012) for 10 min at room temperature or with 100% methanol for 15 min at −20°C. Blocking was for 30 min with PBST/1%BSA at 4°C after which antibody staining was performed (anti-cyclinA2-Alexa Fluor 555, anti-53BP1 self-conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647). Slides were mounted with Ibidi mounting medium containing DAPI. Confocal microscopy was performed using a LSM880 + Airyscan (Zeiss) with a x63 objective. Z-stacks were imaged (40 slices). Images were processed first to an Airyscan image and then to a MIP using ZEN Black (Zeiss). Cyclin A2 staining was used to identify G1 cells (Cyclin A2 negative = G1 cells). Both image analysis (colocalisation) and quantification were performed using CellProfiler (Broad Institute) with a custom-made pipeline. The ‘IdentifyPrimaryObjects’ module was used to identify individual cells (DAPI positive), the G1 cell population (CyclinA2 negative), mAC-RIF1 foci (mClover positive) and 53BP1 foci (Alexa Fluor 647 positive). The ‘RelateObjects’ module was used to count the number of mAC-RIF1 and 53BP1 foci in a cell and to assess colocalisation of 53BP1 foci with mAC-RIF1 foci. Statistical significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA using Prism (Graphpad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>cDNA analysis of RIF1 splice variants</title><p>A human cDNA panel covering 48 major tissues was obtained from Insight Biotechnology (Origene HMRT104). The two RIF1 splicing variants were amplified by competitive PCR using a single primer pair (see key resource table). The PCR products were analysed on a 2% agarose gel (3:1 mix of low-melting temperature agarose and normal agarose). Bands were visualised by staining with SYBR Green I dye, and fluorescent images were captured using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Touch system. Intensities of bands specific to RIF1-L, RIF1-S and an additional minor band caused by heteroduplex formation, were measured using ImageLab software (Bio-Rad). The relative abundance of RIF-L and RIF1-S were calculated based on the band intensities, with 50% of the heteroduplex band intensity assigned to RIF1-L and 50% assigned to RIF1-S.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mitotic enrichment for mitotic bridge analysis</title><p>HCT116 cells were treated with 0.1 μM ICRF-193 (Topoisomerase II inhibitor) (Sigma) for 30 min. Alternatively cells were treated with 1 μM Aphidicolin for 24 hr after which Aphidicolin was removed and cells were incubated for a further 12 hr. Mitotic shake-off was performed to release mitotic cells, which were then spun down onto a slide. Cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Sigman, HT-5012) for 10 min at room temperature. Blocking was for 30 min with 5% FBS/PBS followed by primary antibody staining (anti-PICH) and secondary antibody staining (AF647). Slides were mounted with Prolong Glass mounting medium (Invitrogen). Z-stack (10 optical sections) images were acquired using an LSM880 + Airyscan (Zeiss) with a x63 objective, and processed as above. UFBs were counted manually and defined as PICH-positive, DNA-negative threads between separating chromatin masses. Chromosome bridges were counted manually and defined as DNA-positive threads between separating chromatin masses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Preparing metaphase spreads</title><p>HCT116 cells were treated with 0.4 μM Aphidicolin for 24 hr after which 0.1 μg/ml colcemid (Gibco) was added in parallel with 40 μM EdU for 30 min before harvesting. Chromosome preparation was performed by incubating cells with 75 mM KCI for 10 min followed by fixing cells three times with methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1). The chromosome preparation was dropped onto slides and the Click-iT reaction (Invitrogen) using Alexa Fluor 488 was performed to fluorescently label EdU. Slides were mounted with Vectashield and imaged using a Zeiss Epiflourescence microscope using a x100 objective. Images were manually examined for apparent breaks or gaps as well as EdU incorporation in mitotic chromosomes, and ‘per chromosome’ values were calculated. Statistical significance was calculated using a Mann-Whitney test (Prism Graphpad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Contact for reagent sharing</title><p>Request for reagents or further information should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Anne Donaldson (a.d.donaldson.ac.uk).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to members of the Aberdeen Chromosome Biology Group for helpful comments, and Ronan Broderick and Wojciech Niedzwiedz for advice on mitotic bridge analysis.

mechanisms that all appear to be geared towards maintaining genome stability. The specific mechanisms include DNA replication initiation, replication fork stability or drug sensitivity, and some are associated with DSB end protection and DNA repair pathway choice. In this manuscript, the Donaldson lab presents exciting and completely unanticipated evidence for splice-isoform specific functions of Rif1 in human cells. A shorter isoform (Rif1S) appears to be able to fulfill the replication initiation and fork associated functions, but only the longer Rif1L also is able to protect chromosomes from potential damage incurred by DNA replication inhibitors (Aphidicolin or HU). This function appears required during S-phase but also after S in the formation of the 53BP1-nuclear bodies in the next G1. These results thus are remarkable for both the DNA replication and repair fields as they possibly open up a new way of thinking about how Rif1 functions extend to the next G1 phase and the 53BP1 NB formation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The RIF1-Long splice variant promotes G1 phase 53BP1 nuclear bodies to protect against replication stress&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The highly conserved Rif1 protein functions in an increasing variety of mechanisms that all appear to be geared towards guarding genome stability. Some of them affect DNA replication initiation, fork stability or DNA replication drug sensitivity, while others are associated with DSB end protection and DNA repair pathway choice. However, molecular mechanisms describing how Rif1 works in these seemingly disparate mechanisms are relatively sparse. In this manuscript, the Donaldson lab present exciting evidence for a splice-isoform specific function in human cells. Indeed, while a slightly shorter isoform (Rif1S, lacks exon 31, 2446 a.a.) appears to be able to fulfill the replication initiation and replication fork associated functions, only the Rif1L form (includes exon 31, 2472 a.a.) also is able to protect chromosomes from potential damage incurred by DNA replication inhibitors (Aphidicolin or HU). This function appears required during S-phase but also after S in the formation of the 53BP1-nuclear bodies in the next G1. Therefore, these experiments document isoform specific functions for human Rif1 that were completely unanticipated.</p><p>All reviewers appreciated the exciting, strong and conclusive evidence around the isoform specific functions for the Rif1L versus the Rif1S. They also appreciate the novelty of these findings for the DNA replication and repair fields as they possibly open up a new way of thinking about how Rif1 functions extend to the next G1 phase and the 53BP1 NB formation. They therefore unanimously thought that the paper could develop into a strong candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, we strive to publish the most influential and solid papers and in that line of thinking, certain aspects of the work must be strengthened. After a discussion about how to solidly bring this paper up to the next level, the reviewers request:</p><p>1) The link between the isoform specific function of Rif1L and the 53BP1 NB in G1 was perceived as most exciting, but also needing some more substantiating. In order to support/test the claims of paucity of 53BP1-NBs around under-replicated DNA in RIF1-L deficient cells, you should provide additional molecular connections, such as processes important at fragile sites. For example, you could monitor UFB formation, FANCD2 twin foci on UFBs, MiDAS.</p><p>2) Data on global DNA synthesis, fork speed, fork density in RIF1-S or RIF1-L expressing cells is missing. This could be derived with appropriate DNA combing experiments and reviewers thought that some of those data may already be in your hands.</p><p>3) A big question is the molecular mechanism by which the 26aa region unique to the Rif1L form functions. While fully determining the mechanism is perhaps beyond the scope of this format, the reader is left hanging. Is the sequence interesting, similar to anything else, found in protein-protein interaction screens, or are there known modifications at any of those positions?</p><p>4) Most of the data are presented in bar charts which is not the best method. A modern data presentation that reveals the distribution and reproducibility across independent replicates would be much better. The number of independent biological (not technical) replicates is not reported. A recent discussion of the shortcomings of bar graphs (Lord et al. JCB 2020 https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202001064)</p><p>Just to be clear, the reviewers do expect you to fully address these above points, even with new experimentation, as indicated.</p><p>Reviewers made additional comments on certain aspects of the work which you will find compiled below. Those points are for your perusal, to be incorporated at least textually if possible, but are deemed not essential to be addressed by experiments.</p><p>5) Do RIF1-L deficient cells show other upstream regulators of 53BP1-NBs such as pATM, RNF168? You could also check for the presence of γH2AX in G1 (another proxy for 53BP1-NBs) and extend this analysis to S and G2 phase (as a proxy for unrepaired DNA lesions) to get an overview to understand the consequence of defective 53BP1-NBs around under-replicated DNA.</p><p>6) Authors should monitor the total as well nuclear levels of 53BP1 protein in RIF1-L deficient cells.</p><p>7) You could provide more evidence to link the defective 53BP1-NBs formation and aphidicolin sensitivity. A recent study has suggested that RIF1 loss leads to unprotected replication factories (Ribeyre et al., 2020). You could also check whether such local alteration in replication factories is evident in RIF1-L deficient cells. (Ref.: Ribeyre, C., Lebdy, R., Patouillard, J., Larroque, M., Abou-Merhi, R., Larroque, C., and Constantinou, A. (2020). The isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) reveals a role for RIF1 in the organization of replication factories. bioRxiv, 669234.)</p><p>8) The function unique to Rif1L (vs. Rif1S) is confined to two phenotypes: colony forming ability after replication stress and 53BP1 nuclear foci. I appreciate that the authors have done considerable work to show how the two forms are similar (origin firing, MCM dephosphorylation, etc.). More characterization of this phosphatase-independent function through additional stainings or assays would greatly strengthen the paper.</p><p>9) In Figure 2C, FACS analyses are shown for cell cycle distribution of cells in the experiments. Given that the execution point approaches here do rely on robust and quantitative cell cycle arrest phenotypes, the FACS profiles are of limited use.

Their rates of formation are not affected by the RIF1 isoform present, and both RIF1-L and RIF1-S localise to the UFB and chromosome bridge structures induced.(Our finding that ICRF-193 is more effective than Aphidicolin in inducing UFBs is consistent with previous studies, which mainly use ICRF-193 for UFB induction e.g. Nielsen et al. 2015 Nature Comm 6: 8962; Hengeveld et al., 2015)</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows that complete deletion of RIF1 has no significant effect on MiDAS or on the incidence of chromatin breaks, making it very unlikely that the RIF1 isoforms would have differential effects on MiDAS or chromatin breakage.</p><p>These new figures are discussed in the subsection “RIF1-Long and -Short isoforms do not appear to differ in mitotic functions”. Overall, these new analyses do not suggest that the differential capability of RIF1 isoforms in protecting against Aphidicolin is caused by a differential role of the isoforms affecting mitotic bridges, chromatin breaks, or MiDAS sites. Based on the results shown in revised Figures 4 and 5 and the supplements to these figures, we suspect that the defect in RIF1-L-deficient cells involved failure to recognise damage sites that <italic>remain</italic> problematic <italic>after</italic> these mitotic processes, and to handle them correctly as cells progress into and through the next cell cycle—in a process involving 53BP NBs and possibly TopBP1 (please see also new data presented in response to point 5 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data on global DNA synthesis, fork speed, fork density in RIF1-S or RIF1-L expressing cells is missing.

The 26 aa region unique to RIF1-L contains a ‘phosphoSPxF’ BRCT interaction motif, raising the possibility that RIF1-L interacts with one of the several BRCT domain-containing proteins involved in chromosome maintenance. However at present we do not know which BRCT protein would be the relevant target, since initial IP experiments did not suggest a likely candidate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most of the data are presented in bar charts which is not the best method.

In most cases we also show the separate biological replicate experiments in the supplementary figures.

TopBP1 has also been suggested as involved in correct recognition of damage sites and their transfer into 53BP1 NBs (Pedersen et al., 2015), so we tested for any effect of TopBP1 on 53BP1 bodies by RIF1, and found that TopBP1 depletion causes a defect in RIF1-L localisation to 53BP1 NBs (presented in revised Figure 5—figure supplement 2). This observation may suggest how damage is recognised and carried through by RIF1-L to 53BP1 NBs. Based on IP studies we have not however found evidence for a direct interaction of RIF1-L with TopBP1, suggesting the effect could be indirect and making further elaboration on the connection between TopBP1 and RIF1-L function beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Authors should monitor the total as well nuclear levels of 53BP1 protein in RIF1-L deficient cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a western blot showing total levels of 53BP1 in the various cell lines (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) You could provide more evidence to link the defective 53BP1-NBs formation and aphidicolin sensitivity.
