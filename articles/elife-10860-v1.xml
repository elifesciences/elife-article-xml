xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> seeks to address growing concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected on the basis of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/studies/">citations and Altmetric scores</ext-link> (Errington et al., 2014). This Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments from “IDH mutation impairs histone demethylation and results in a block to cell differentiation” by Lu and colleagues, published in Nature in 2012 (Lu et al., 2012). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported in Figures 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D and 4D. Lu and colleagues demonstrated that expression of mutant forms of IDH1 or IDH2 caused global increases in histone methylation and increased levels of 2 hydroxyglutarate (Figure 1B). This was correlated with a block in differentiation (Figures 2A, B and D). This effect appeared to be mediated by the histone demethylase KDM4C (Figure 4D). The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cos.io/">Center for Open Science</ext-link>and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.scienceexchange.com/">Science Exchange</ext-link>, and the results of the replications will be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10860.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10860.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>IDH mutation</kwd><kwd>2HG metabolism</kwd><kwd>reproducibility project: cancer biology</kwd><kwd>methodology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, provided to the Center for Open Science in collaboration with Science Exchange.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the metabolic proteins IDH1 and IDH2 are associated with gliomas, acute myeloid leukemias, chondrosarcomas, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, lymphomas, melanomas and colon, thyroid and prostate cancers (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Krell et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work has shown that these mutations change the specificity of the reaction catalyzed by IDH proteins; instead of producing α-ketoglutarate from isocitrate, they produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), a metabolite that can have oncogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Krell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">McKenney and Levine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ward et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Lu and colleagues expand upon this work to identify a potential mechanism for how 2HG can effect major changes in cell behavior. They present evidence that 2HG interferes with global demethylation that is required for progenitor cells to complete terminal differentiation. Transfection of 3T3-L1 cells with the mutant forms of <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> that produce 2HG lead to an increase in global methylation levels and prevented normal in vitro differentiation into adipocytes. The 2HG-sensitive histone demethylase KDM4C appeared to be required for this process, as knockdown of KDM4C recapitulated the phenotype of 2HG production. Examination of glioma samples showed a correlation between <italic>IDH</italic> mutation status and level of overall methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, Lu and colleagues’ findings help explain how mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 potentially interface with cancer development and progression.</p><p>In Figure 1B, Lu and colleagues examined the effects of mutations in <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> on global levels of methylation by transfecting mutant and wild type forms of the genes into 293T cells and using Western blot to assess the levels of various methylation markers. They also confirmed that introduction of the mutated forms of <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> correlated with increased intracellular levels of the oncometabolite 2HG. Their findings suggest that mutations in <italic>IDH1</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> correlate with increased levels of many methylation markers, and this key finding is replicated in Protocol 1.</p><p>In order to understand the effects of hypermethylation more fully, Lu and colleagues turned to an in vitro model of differentiation; when treated with appropriate signals, 3T3-L1 cells undergo epigenetic changes required for them to differentiation into adipocytes. In Figure 2A and B, they transfect undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells with the wild type and mutant forms of IDH2 and assess the cells’ ability to differentiate into adipocytes, as determined by staining for lipid droplets with Oil-Red-O. While differentiated 3T3-L1 cells transfected with vector only or wild type <italic>IDH2</italic> showed robust Oil-Red-O staining, cells transfected with mutant <italic>IDH2</italic> did not, indicating a block in differentiation. qRT-PCR confirmed that cells transfected with mutant <italic>IDH</italic> variants did not express high levels of known adipocyte markers (Figure 2D). This key finding will be replicated in Protocol 2.</p><p>Lu and colleagues identified a histone demethylase, <italic>KDM4C</italic>, expressed as 3T3-L1 differentiation progressed, that appeared to be sensitive to 2HG. In Figure 4D, they use siRNAs to knock down levels of <italic>KDM4C</italic> in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Western blot analysis and Oil-Red-O staining confirmed that loss of KDM4C increased global methylation levels and inhibited differentiation. This key finding will be replicated in Protocol 3.</p><p>Several aspects of Lu’s findings have been corroborated by other work. Multiple groups have demonstrated that perturbations in IDH proteins alter methylation levels; overexpression of the <italic>IDH1</italic><sup>R132H</sup> allele in human tumor cells lines increased global histone methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Duncan et al., 2012</xref>), exogenous <italic>IDH2</italic><sup>R140Q</sup> increased methylation levels in erythroleukemia progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kernytsky et al., 2015</xref>) and an immortalized astrocyte cell line expressing <italic>IDH1</italic><sup>R132H</sup> also demonstrated increased levels of methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Turcan et al., 2012</xref>). Members of the Thompson lab (authors of this study) have confirmed that expression of mutant variants of IDH proteins in 3T3-L1 cells blocked differentiation into adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Londono Gentile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ward et al., 2013</xref>). Sasaki and colleagues have shown that mutant <italic>IDH1</italic> expression increased levels of methylation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>), while Akbay and colleagues published a similar observation for mutant forms of <italic>IDH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akbay et al., 2014</xref>). This effect may even hold true for human patients, as there is a marked increase in H3K9me3 levels associated with <italic>IDH</italic> mutations in oligodendromas and high grade astrocytomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Venneti et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all protocol information was derived from the original paper, references from the original paper, or information obtained directly from the authors.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Irwin Davidson (Reviewing Editor) and Randy Schekman (Senior Editor).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found this proposed study to have important impact on the functional consequences of the frequently occurring IDH mutations and their mode of action. The provided protocol appears complete, but several points concerning the statistical methods remain to be clarified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Normality and homoscedasticity will be assessed using adequate tests and methods. However what kind of transformation do the authors plan to apply in case of skewed data? Do the authors have an idea of how the data could be skewed? Similarly, which test do the authors intend to apply in case of non-normal data?</p><p>Power calculations assume normally distributed data. In the opposite case non parametric tests will be used with much less power. Power calculations should be taken with caution, as they are performed according to an optimistic scenario.</p><p>Protocol 1:</p><p>The authors should clarify if the MANOVA analyses are planned to analyze the results of western blots and that:</p><p>a) Response variables are intensities measured for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, etc.;b) The factor of variability is the cohort with 5 different levels: control, IDH1<sup>-WT</sup>, IDH1 mutant, IDH2<sup>-WT</sup>, IDH2 mutant;c) Contrasts to be tested are the ones listed under the subsection “Confirmatory analysis plan” (H3K9me2, WT vs. mutant, etc.).</p><p>Clarifications should be made for each model used in this protocol, as it is not always clear how the suggested model fits the data. The same comments hold true for the other protocols, for example the 2HG/glutamate ratios where there is only one response variable and a factor of variability with 5 levels with 2 tested contrasts.</p><p>Protocol 2:</p><p>For the 2HG/glutamate ratio, please describe the model (one factor with three levels, one contrast?).</p><p>For the qRT-PCR, is it a per-gene model? What are the response variables? Please clarify.</p><p>Protocol 3:</p><p>Again please clarify the MANOVA model (response variable, factor levels, contrasts).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10860.003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: Normality and homoscedasticity will be assessed using adequate tests and methods.

This might be the case with the 2HG/glutamate ratios that are listed in the protocols, which only show representative images, but display them on a log scale, which suggests the data might be skewed.</p><p>In the case of non-normal data, the revised manuscript includes the non-parametric tests that would be applied. When there is reason to suspect that a non-parametric test might be applied, such as a large difference in variance between the groups being tested, we have included non-parametric as well as parametric power calculations as described in response to the second question.</p><p><italic>Power calculations assume normally distributed data. In the opposite case non parametric tests will be used with much less power. Power calculations should be taken with caution, as they are performed according to an optimistic scenario.</italic> </p><p>We agree and understand the limitations of using the original data we have been able to obtain, or estimate, as a basis for the sample size for the replication attempt. We also agree that some of the assumptions made are according to an optimistic scenario. However, we hope that by performing power calculations using non-parametric tests, when there is reason to believe the data would violate the assumptions of a parametric test, we will ensure the sample size used for the replication study will be suitable for a parametric test (what we aim to perform if possible) or the non-parametric test (what we quite possible will need to perform). Further, as pointed out, this still stands risk of decreased power depending on the nature of the replication data (such as if there is normal distribution) in order to perform the proposed comparisons. Additionally, we have revised the analysis plans and power calculations to reflect the proposed models and contrasts, including the potential non-parametric tests that might be performed.</p><p><italic>Protocol 1: The authors should clarify if the MANOVA analyses are planned to analyze the results of western blots and that:</italic></p><p> <italic>a) Response variables are intensities measured for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, etc.;b) The factor of variability is the cohort with 5 different levels: control, IDH1<sup>-WT</sup>, IDH1 mutant, IDH2<sup>-WT</sup>, IDH2 mutant;c) Contrasts to be tested are the ones listed under the subsection “Confirmatory analysis plan” (H3K9me2, WT vs. mutant, etc.).</italic></p><p> <italic>Clarifications should be made for each model used in this protocol, as it is not always clear how the suggested model fits the data. The same comments hold true for the other protocols, for example the 2HG/glutamate ratios where there is only one response variable and a factor of variability with 5 levels with 2 tested contrasts. Protocol 2: For the 2HG/glutamate ratio, please describe the model (one factor with three levels, one contrast?).</italic></p><p><italic>For the qRT-PCR, is it a per-gene model? What are the response variables? Please clarify. Protocol 3: Again please clarify the MANOVA model (response variable, factor levels, contrasts).</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have included the model of each proposed analysis plan, to reflect the DV, IV, and contrasts proposed. Additionally, we have revised the analysis plans and power calculations to reflect the proposed models and contrasts, included the potential non-parametric tests that might be performed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
