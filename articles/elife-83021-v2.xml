Strikingly, the seam number and location vary along individual microtubules, generating holes of one to a few subunits in size within their lattices. Together, our results reveal that the formation of mixed and discontinuous microtubule lattices is an intrinsic property of tubulin that requires the formation of unique lateral interactions without longitudinal ones. They further suggest that microtubule assembly is tightly regulated in a cytoplasmic environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></kwd><kwd>egg cytoplasmic extracts</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd><italic>sus scrofa domesticus</italic></kwd><kwd>purified tubulin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE11-0017-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chrétien</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE13-0001-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chrétien</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA00019/1019-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gibeaux</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Fondation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_192566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinmetz</surname><given-names>Michel O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tubulin engages unique lateral interactions without longitudinal ones during microtubule polymerization, leaving holes of a few subunits size potentially at the origin of tubulin exchange within their shaft.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The organization of the αβ-tubulin heterodimer within microtubules was originally inferred from the analysis of transmission electron microscopy images of negatively stained axonemal doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amos and Klug, 1974</xref>). It was proposed that the tubulin subunits engage heterotypic lateral interactions (α-β, β-α) in the complete 13 protofilaments A-microtubule, and homotypic ones (α-α, β-β) in the incomplete 10 protofilaments B-microtubule, giving rise to the concept of the A and B lattices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, using kinesin-motor domains that bind uniquely to β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), it was shown later that in both the A and B microtubules of the doublet, tubulin heterodimers engage homotypic interactions of the B type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song and Mandelkow, 1995</xref>), which is also the case in microtubules assembled in vitro from purified tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crepeau et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song and Mandelkow, 1993</xref>). Noticeably, for geometrical reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McEwen and Edelstein, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wade and Chrétien, 1993</xref>), microtubules organized with 13 protofilaments and three-start lateral helices should contain at least one ‘seam’ of the A-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which corresponds to our current view of microtubule lattice organization.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Organization of tubulin within microtubules.</title><p>The αβ-tubulin heterodimers (α in cyan, β in yellow) alternate head-to-tail along protofilaments, 13 of which associate laterally to form the microtubule wall.

Using the same approach on cells treated with detergent to remove the membrane and decorate the microtubules with kinesin-motor domains, the authors provided the first evidence of a preferred B-lattice-type organization in cellulo and could visualize unique seams in cytoplasmic microtubules. But due to the limitation of the method and the small number of microtubules observed, they did not exclude the possibility of several seams in cellulo. Since then, several studies have revealed the presence of multiple seams in microtubules assembled in vitro, noticeably in the presence of the stabilizing drug Taxol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Debs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">des Georges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sosa et al., 1997</xref>). The predominance of B-type lateral contacts in cellulo was confirmed by cryo-electron tomography after detergent removal of the membrane and decoration with kinesin-motor domains, but with no detailed statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McIntosh et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it turns out that our knowledge on the organization of αβ-tubulin heterodimers within microtubules assembled in vitro in the absence of drug and in cellulo remains limited.</p><p>To gain a deeper understanding of microtubule lattice organization in vitro and in a cytoplasmic environment, we analyzed microtubules assembled from purified porcine brain tubulin in the presence of GTP, the slowly hydrolysable analogue GMPCPP, and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg cytoplasmic extracts. Microtubules were decorated with kinesin-motor domains and their binding pattern was analyzed using cryo-electron tomography followed by sub-tomogram averaging (STA). To this end, we specifically developed a segmented sub-tomogram averaging (SSTA) strategy, which allowed us to investigate the structural heterogeneity of individual microtubules. We find that in almost all conditions the seam number and location vary within individual microtubules, leaving holes of one to a few subunits in size within their wall. Microtubules assembled in a cytoplasmic environment are more regular, suggesting a tightly regulated process. Moreover, the formation of discontinuous mixed AB-lattices implies that tubulin can engage unique lateral interactions without longitudinal ones at the growing tip, a process that accounts for the formation of holes within their wall during polymerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Microtubules were self-assembled in vitro from purified porcine brain tubulin in the presence of 1 mM GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and kinesin-motor domains were added at the polymerization plateau right before vitrification of the specimen grids into liquid ethane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Cryo-electron tomograms were acquired preferentially using a dual-axis strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guesdon et al., 2013</xref>) so that all microtubules could be analyzed independently of their orientation with respect to the tilt axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). The low magnifications used, between ×25,000 and ×29,000, allowed us to record long stretches of the microtubules, ~1–2 µm in length, to optimize the STA strategy along individual fibers.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The number and location of seams vary within individual microtubules assembled from purified tubulin</title><p>We first processed entire microtubules present in the tomograms using an STA approach that retrieves small sub-volumes of ~50 nm<sup>3</sup> in size at every kinesin-motor domain position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zabeo et al., 2018</xref>; i.e., every ~8 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The resulting 3D volumes clearly revealed the protofilament number and the organization of the kinesin-motor domains around the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). To model the underlying αβ-tubulin heterodimer lattice, we placed yellow spheres onto kinesin densities and cyan spheres in between. While the cyan and yellow spheres are not strictly placed on top of the α- and β-subunits, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), this simplified modeling allowed us to describe their underlying organization within microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In agreement with previous studies performed on Taxol-stabilized microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Debs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">des Georges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kikkawa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sosa et al., 1997</xref>), we found that microtubules assembled in vitro from purified tubulin in the presence of GTP contained one to several A-lattice seams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, we could frequently observe protofilaments with a much thinner appearance where the kinesin-motor domain periodicity was partly or completely lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). We hypothesized that the appearance of such aberrant protofilaments resulted from the averaging of regions containing kinesin-motor domain densities with regions out of register. To explore this idea, we divided the model and motive list used to calculate the full volumes into shorter segments of ~125–180 nm in length and generated new volumes for these segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Using this SSTA approach, we could identify regions where the seam number and/or location varied within individual microtubules. In the example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the segment S1 contains five seams while S3 and S4 contain three seams. S2 still displays two aberrant protofilaments, indicating that the change in seam number occurred in this region. To confirm this hypothesis, we extracted the corresponding region in the raw tomogram that was further filtered by thresholding intensities in Fourier space to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Comparison between the kinesin-motor domain patterns in the sub-tomogram averages of segments S1 to S3 with the filtered S2 region confirmed that this latter constitutes a transition zone where the seam number changes from 5 to 3. Line plots along the registered protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) shows that the kinesin-motor domain periodicity becomes out of phase after the transition in the aberrant protofilaments, implying an offset of at least one monomer (or an odd number) before and after the transition, and hence the presence of holes within the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Analysis of 24 microtubules taken on 4 tomograms, representing 195 segments of ~160 nm length (i.e., 2664 lateral interactions), allowed us to characterize 119 lattice-type transitions with an average frequency of 3.69 µm<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), but with a high heterogeneity. Some microtubules showed no or little lattice-type transitions (e.g., MT3 and MT4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>; MT16, MT21, and MT23, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), while others were heavily dislocated, with a lattice-type transition frequency as high as ~15 µm<sup>–1</sup> (e.g., MT13 and MT14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sub-tomogram averaging of a 14_3 microtubule with a unique seam.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sub-tomogram average of a 1390.4 nm long 14_3 microtubule assembled in vitro from purified tubulin and decorated with kinesin-motor domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> MT3, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>).

In addition, the low magnification used to analyze long stretches of the microtubules was at the detriment of resolution. To improve the quality of the raw cryo-electron tomograms, we used GMPCPP to assemble microtubules at a lower tubulin concentration (10 µM) and acquired single-axis tilt series at a magnification of ×50,000. SSTA was performed on kinesin-motor domains decorated GMPCPP-microtubules suitably oriented with respect to the tilt axis in order to localize transition regions and to visualize corresponding holes in their lattice. The microtubule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> transitioned from 1 to 3 seams as demonstrated by SSTA. Visualization of the microtubule in the raw tomogram reveals a transition from a B- to an A-lattice organization in the three protofilaments located at its lower surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), as assessed by the diffraction patterns of the corresponding regions, and after filtration of the equatorial and 8 nm<sup>–1</sup> layer lines.

First, the transition regions had to be located at the top or bottom surface of the microtubule with respect to the electron beam since edges were severely smoothed due to the lack of data at high angle that elongate densities in this direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This artifact is inherent to electron tomography, limiting the search of holes within microtubules in raw tomograms. A second severe artifact commonly encountered, especially in thin ice layers, was denaturation of kinesin heads at the air–water interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This artifact shows up as a diminution of the kinesin-motor domain density, whose periodical arrangement can only be recovered after SSTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This analysis clearly showed that SSTA remains compulsory to localize changes in lattice-type organization within individual microtubules, and thus visualize the corresponding holes in regions suitably oriented with respect to the tilt axis and not in interaction with the air–water interfaces.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Limitations in the visualization of holes in raw tomograms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microtubule embedded in an ~140-nm-thick ice layer (top left).

Ideally, cryo-electron tomography should reveal holes in the absence of averaging. Yet, we found severe limitations that are independent of the instrument used, but that are linked to the methodology. First, missing data at high angle, whether they are taken by single- or dual-axis cryo-electron tomography, blur densities on the edges of microtubules with respect to the tilt axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guesdon et al., 2013</xref>). Second, we found that the interaction of the microtubules with the air–water interface diminishes the kinesin-motor domain densities, likely as a consequence of denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D’Imprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klebl et al., 2022</xref>). Third, the lattice-type transition frequency remains low with respect to the number of tubulin heterodimers within microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D,</xref> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It is 3.69 and 1.25 transitions every µm for microtubules assembled in the presence of GTP and GMPCPP, respectively, and 1 every ~10 µm for cytoplasmic extract microtubules. Considering that 1 µm of a 13 protofilament microtubule contains ~1625 dimers, this translates to one lattice-type transition every 16,250 dimers, which hinders the localization of holes in raw data. Conversely, the SSTA approach in combination with dual-axis cryo-electron tomography we used allows localization of lattice-type transitions along individual microtubules independently of their orientation with respect to the tilt axis, and at surfaces that interact with the air–water interface. While missing data at high angle are inherent to the method of electron tomography, means to limit denaturation of proteins at the air–water interface must be found. This is critical for cryo-electron tomography, but also for single-particle analysis methods where this artifact is a limiting factor to obtain high-resolution data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D’Imprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klebl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Changes in lattice types along individual microtubules could result from an imperfect annealing of shorter microtubules, a process known to occur in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rothwell et al., 1986</xref>). Yet, the lattice-type transition frequency observed with purified tubulin would necessitate annealing of very short segments, sometimes a few tens to hundreds of nm in length. The average lattice-type transition frequency observed in cytoplasmic extracts could be compatible with annealing of microtubules a few µm in length. However, the fact that these transitions involved systematically a lateral seam offset of only one protofilament suggests a firm regulatory mechanism. Hence, a more plausible explanation is that these lattice discontinuities are formed during microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig11video1">Figure 11—video 1</xref>). At present, classical models of microtubule elongation hypothesize that tubulin engages either uniquely longitudinal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, step 1), or both longitudinal and lateral interactions with the growing tip of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, step 2). A purely longitudinal elongation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McIntosh et al., 2018</xref>) can hardly explain how microtubules can vary in terms of protofilament and/or helix start numbers as well as in lattice types, and thus how holes can arise during assembly. Conversely, to account for the presence of holes of one to a few subunits in size, it is sufficient to consider that tubulin can engage lateral interactions without longitudinal ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, step 3). Gaps of an odd number of tubulin subunits will induce lattice-type transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, steps 4–5), while those of an even number will induce no changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Hence, since both types of events are likely to occur, we may underestimate the presence of holes within microtubules. In addition, a finer sampling of the microtubule lattice with shorter segments could also reveal a higher hole frequency. Formation of lateral contacts without longitudinal ones at the seam region can also explain how the seam can vary in position by one protofilament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>) since this only requires that a tubulin dimer engages homotypic lateral interactions at the seam region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, step 2). This event will also leave a gap of an odd number of subunits within the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, steps 3–4).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Formation of holes within microtubules during assembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Formation of multiple seams; red dots indicate new interactions.

This is definitely the case for microtubules assembled from purified tubulin and has profound consequences for the interpretation of biochemical, biophysical, and structural results. For instance, 3D reconstruction studies will have to take into account the heterogeneity of the microtubule lattice to reach higher resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Debs et al., 2020</xref>). The lattice organization of cytoplasmic extract microtubules is more in agreement with the B-lattice, single-seam model. However, exceptions are also observed such as changes in protofilament and/or helix start numbers, as well as in the location of seams within individual microtubules. Therefore, our results suggest that the formation of heterogeneous microtubule lattices is an intrinsic property of tubulin polymerization, which is firmly regulated in cells. One key regulatory factor could be the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC), which imposes the 13 protofilament organization to a nascent microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Böhler et al., 2021</xref>). But how this structure is preserved during microtubule elongation remains unclear, especially if one considers a two-dimensional assembly process where the lattice can vary in terms of protofilament number, helix-start number, or lattice type during elongation. Proteins of the end-binding (EB) family are other good candidates that could play a key role in regulating microtubule structure during assembly in cells. They interact with the tip of growing microtubules and bind in between protofilaments that are organized according to a B-lattice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; they thus may favor the formation of homotypic lateral interactions during assembly. In addition, EBs have been shown to induce the formation of 13 protofilaments, three-start helix microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vitre et al., 2008</xref>), which could also be forced to adopt a preferential B-lattice-type organization. Conversely, microtubule polymerases like XMAP215, which act at growing microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>), may favor lattice heterogeneities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>).

Although it is exquisitely regulated in cells by a myriad of microtubule-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cleary and Hancock, 2021</xref>), it is also an intrinsic property of microtubules assembled from purified tubulin, demonstrating that it is intimately tied to tubulin assembly properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brouhard, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The αβ-tubulin heterodimer binds two molecules of GTP, one located between the α and β monomers at the non-exchangeable N-site, and one on the β-subunit at the longitudinal interface between heterodimers at the E-site that becomes hydrolyzed to GDP during assembly. GTP-hydrolysis destabilizes the microtubule lattice, likely weakening tubulin lateral interactions by a mechanism that remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). A slight delay between polymerization and GTP-hydrolysis would allow the formation of a protective GTP-cap at growing microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pantaloni and Carlier, 1986</xref>). The current model(s) speculate that stochastic loss of this GTP-cap induces depolymerization events known as catastrophes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that lead to disappearance of the GTP-cap remain unknown. The origin of repolymerization events, termed rescues, is also unclear, but may involve tubulin molecules that have not hydrolyzed their GTP and that remain trapped inside the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimitrov et al., 2008</xref>). It should be noted that the vast majority of theoretical models that have been designed so far to explain microtubule dynamic instability rely on a continuous lattice composed of B-type lattice contacts interrupted by a single seam of the A-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowne-Anderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowne-Anderson et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, exceptions to this rule have been documented over the years, essentially in microtubules assembled in vitro from purified tubulin. It is known that microtubules can accommodate different protofilament and helix-start numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chrétien and Wade, 1991</xref>). These numbers can vary within individual microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chrétien et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foster et al., 2022</xref>), necessarily leaving holes inside their lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schaedel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Théry and Blanchoin, 2021</xref>). Microtubules can also adopt configurations with a high protofilament skew that must be compensated by a relaxation step whose detailed mechanism remains to be described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chrétien and Fuller, 2000</xref>). Microtubules with different numbers of seams have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Debs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">des Georges et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Howes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kikkawa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sosa et al., 1997</xref>), although it was not considered that both seam number and location could vary within individual microtubules. Therefore, these previous studies and this study indicate that the microtubule lattice is highly labile, with the ability to form different kinds of structural defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hunyadi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rai et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The formation of lattice defects during microtubule polymerization must impose energetical penalties at the growing microtubule end, potentially destabilizing the protective GTP-cap if present, and hence be at the origin of catastrophes. Likewise, holes must let patches of unhydrolyzed GTP-tubulin molecules within microtubules, potentially at the origin of rescues. Hence, we propose that microtubule dynamic instability is not only driven by the nucleotide state of tubulin, but also by the intrinsic structural instability of the microtubule lattice. MAPs such as EBs and XMAP215 may exploit this structural instability to finely tune microtubule dynamics in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Briefly, eggs arrested in metaphase of meiosis II were collected, dejellied, and fractionated by centrifugation. The cytoplasmic layer was isolated, supplemented with 10 mg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin (LPC), 20 mM cytochalasin B, and a creatine phosphate and ATP energy regeneration mix.

Egg extracts were supplemented with 40 ng/µg rhodamine-tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc, TL590M-B) before microtubule assembly was conducted by addition of 5% DMSO and incubation at 23°C, for 30–45 min. Reactions were then extemporaneously diluted 1:10, 1:50, or 1:100 in 1× BRB80 buffer for vitrification on an electron microscopy grid. Frozen grids were imaged within a Linkam CMS196M cryo-correlative microscopy stage mounted on an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a Lumencor SOLA SE U-nIR light source, UPLFLN10×/0.30 and LMPLFLN50×/0.50 objectives, and a Photometrics Prime-BSI sCMOS Back Illuminated camera.

Kif5B was diluted at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in BRB80, 0.1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, and 60 nM mix-matrix capped gold nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duchesne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guesdon et al., 2016</xref>) and prewarmed at 35°C. First, 3 µl of the microtubule sample was deposited at the surface of a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R2/2, Cu200) in the temperature (35°C) and humidity-controlled atmosphere (~95 %) of an automatic plunge-freezer (EM GP, Leica). Then, 3 µl of the prewarmed kinesin-motor domain suspension was added to the grid onto the sample, incubated for 30 s, and blotted manually. An additional 3 µl of the prewarmed kinesin-motor domain suspension was added to the grid, blotted with the EM GP for 2 s using Whatman grade 1 filter paper and plunged into liquid ethane.</p><p>Microtubule aster assembly was induced in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg cytoplasmic extracts by adding 5% DMSO or 15 µM of the GTPase-deficient Ran mutant RanQ69L purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helmke and Heald, 2014</xref>) and incubating at 23°C for 30–45 min. Kif5B was diluted at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in BRB80, 0.1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, and 60 nM mix-matrix capped gold nanoparticles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duchesne et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guesdon et al., 2016</xref>), and prewarmed at 23°C. A 3 µl volume of the Kif5B suspension was first deposited at the surface of a glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R2/2, Cu200) in the temperature (23°C) and humidity-controlled atmosphere (~95%) of the EM GP, on the side of the grid to be blotted. Immediately one volume of the extract sample was diluted 50× in the prewarmed Kif5B suspension, and 3 µl of this mix was deposited on the other side of the grid. The grid was blotted from the opposite side of the sample with the EM GP for 4 s using Whatman grade filter 4 and plunged into liquid ethane.</p><p>For dual-axis cryo-electron tomography, specimen grids were transferred to a rotating cryo-holder (model CT3500TR, Gatan) and observed using a 200 kV electron microscope equipped with a LaB<sub>6</sub> cathode (Tecnai G<sup>2</sup> T20 Sphera, FEI). Images of microtubules assembled from purified tubulin were recorded on a 4k × 4K CCD camera (USC4000, Gatan) in binning mode 2 and at a nominal magnification of ×29,000 (electron dose ~1.0 é/Å<sup>2</sup>), providing a final pixel size of 0.79 nm. Images of microtubules assembled in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts were recorded on a 4K × 4k CMOS camera (XF416, TVIPS) in binning mode 2 and at a nominal magnification of ×25,000 (electron dose ~0.6 é/Å<sup>2</sup>) or ×29,000 (electron dose ~1.0 é/Å<sup>2</sup>), providing final pixel sizes of 0.87 nm and 0.74 nm, respectively. Pixel sizes were calibrated using TMV as a standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guesdon et al., 2016</xref>). Dual-axis cryo-electron tomography data were acquired as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guesdon et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, a first tilt series of ~40 images was taken in an angular range of ~±60° starting from 0° and using a Saxton scheme. The specimen was turned by an ~90° in plane rotation at low magnification, and a second tilt series was taken on the same area using parameters identical to the first series. Tomograms were reconstructed using the Etomo graphical user interface of the IMOD program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>). Tilt series were typically filtered after alignment using a low-pass filter at 0.15 cycles/pixels and a sigma of 0.05. Tomograms were reconstructed in 3D using the SIRT-like filter of Etomo with 15 equivalent iterations. Dual-axis cryo-electron tomograms were converted to bytes before further processing.</p><p>For single-axis cryo-electron tomography, specimen grids were transferred to a dual-grid cryo-transfer holder model 205 (Simple Origin). Data were acquired on a 4K × 4k CMOS camera (XF416, TVIPS) in binning mode 1 and at a nominal magnification of ×50,000 (electron dose ~2.5 é/Å<sup>2</sup>), providing a final pixel size of 0.21 nm. Typically, 40 images were taken in an angular range of ~±60° starting from 0° or using a symmetric electron dose scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagen et al., 2017</xref>). To localize holes within microtubules by SSTA, tomograms were subsequently binned by 4 to provide a final pixel size of 0.83 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sub-tomogram averaging</title><p>Sub-tomogram averages were calculated using the procedure described online (available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bio3d.colorado.edu/RML_2017/2017_IMOD_PEET_Workshop/Lab_Instructions/L8Microtubules.pdf">here</ext-link>). Briefly, a first model was created by following individual protofilaments in cross section using the slicer tool in IMOD. Usually, ~50 electronic slices were averaged to reinforce the contrast. A second model was next extrapolated from the first one to mark the microtubule center at the same point positions. Then, a third model was calculated from the previous ones with points spaced every ~8 nm, and a motive list containing Euler angles of each sub-volume with respect to the chosen reference was created. Sub-volumes of ~40 pixels<sup>3</sup> were extracted at each point position using the graphical user interface of the PEET program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>). Inner and outer cylindrical masks were used to isolate the microtubule wall densities. Registration of the microtubule sub-volumes was performed by cross-correlation, limiting rotational angular searches around the microtubule axis to about half the angular separation between protofilaments. Other angles were set to take into account variations of microtubule curvature in the X, Y, and Z directions. SSTA was performed using a new routine (splitIntoNsegments) implemented into the PEET program version 1.14.1. This routine splits the initial model and motive list into <italic>N</italic> segments of equal size and creates sub-directories for each segment. Sub-tomogram averages are calculated for each segment using the original sub-tomogram average parameters of the whole microtubule as a template.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis and model building</title><p>Sub-tomogram averages were inspected using the isosurface panel of IMOD. Four scattered models were created. Model 1 was used to mark the kinesin-motor domain densities (yellow spheres), model 2 to mark the absence of densities (cyan spheres), model 3 aberrant densities (red spheres), and model 4 the microtubule center. Spheres from model 1–3 were placed along the <italic>S</italic>-start lateral helices. The fourth last model was enlarged to cross the kinesin-motor domain densities in order to place the other spheres at a same radius. The number of protofilaments and the different lateral contacts (A, B, and undefined lateral contacts) were retrieved from these models.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experimentation in this study was performed according to our animal use protocol APAFiS #26858-2020072110205978 approved by the Animal Use Ethic Committee (#7, Rennes, France) and the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Khanh Huy Bui (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The technical concerns regarding the cryo-tomography data should be addressed fully.</p><p>2) A major concern to be addressed, was about how generalizable the findings were and whether they were the result of the quality of tubulin used, the protocol and conditions for polymerization or whether the results observed were linked to the inherent properties of tubulin. The authors should gather to increase the confidence that findings are more generalizable. it is important to know whether their findings will be more generally applicable. A number of suggestions have been listed by reviewer 3 to address this important point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My major comments are:</p><p>In terms of visualization, I found the cyan and yellow balls extremely hard to correlate to the seam location. And I am saying this as someone who looks at microtubules very frequently and is extremely familiar with the A-lattice, B-lattice and the seam. It is confusing with the colour in Figure 1, where α, β-tubulin and kinesin are cyan, yellow and orange colour. The cyan ball is not at the place of the α-tubulin and in Figure 1, α-tubulin and kinesin do definitely not form a ring as shown in Figure 2B. Choosing to place the ball on only kinesin should be good and less confusing.

According to the senior author's old paper (Chretien et al. 1998), the skew angle is -0.75 degrees. If it is true, the averaging of a 1390.4 nm long microtubule (~170 subtomograms) should cover well the missing wedge. I did a quick measure of the skew angle from the map EMD_15735, the skew angle measured is -0.46 (biased by the missing wedge from the map). Even with this value, the map should not contain the missing wedge. However, the map still contains the missing wedge effect.

If there is a partial decoration of kinesin, can the analysis stand? One of the fair ways to analyze is to perform a single kinesin/tubulin region alignment only and then plot the alignment result such as in this study from the Briggs lab (Figure 3, Faini et al. Science, 2012). Or perhaps a 3D classification to supervised/unsupervised classify regions of microtubule with a non-missing wedge reference from different microtubules to unbiasedly analyze the data vs. partitioning the microtubule into different segments.</p><p>– Also, looking at the map emd-15737 and the corresponding model, one of the seams is in close proximity to another microtubule.

All microtubules polymerised in cell extract stimulated by RanQ69L have a single seam and 13_3 protofilament architecture (shown in Figure supplement 6). These RanQ69L data are provided as a control for use of 5% DMSO for stimulation of microtubule polymerization in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract. There is not enough data here to exclude the possibility that DMSO has affected the protofilament and seam number of microtubules. The RanQ69L-stimulated microtubules do contain instances of seam movement and so the main conclusions regarding the prevalence and importance of lattice-type transitions are well supported. To address this, the two datasets should be reported on separately and the differences discussed.</p><p>– The data show the variation in lattice architecture in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract microtubules is very low, but this is not clear from the figures. A graph showing comparison of the different parameters measured should be included in the main figures (possibly Figure 8) to enable better visual comparison. These could include frequency of microtubule architecture (pf and start number), lattice transitions, single seam microtubules and microtubules with seam number change.</p><p>– I agree that at the sites of lattice transition there is likely a hole caused by absence of an odd number of tubulin subunits. However, the method is not able to determine their exact size or position as each segment is an average structure of 20-40 tubulin dimers. The model presented in Figure 4C does not reflect that. Could a model for only the S2 region also be shown (full length, as in the panel in Figure 4A)? The ambiguous region could be denoted by grey tubulin dimers to show the uncertainty in their exact position. The model should also be rotated to show pfa 1-4 in the center rather than offset to the left.</p><p>– The authors discuss the implications of observing mixed AB-lattices for theories about growth of microtubules via annealing of short sections or addition of subunits at the ends.

While it is true that older studies were limited methodologically from looking more quantitatively at pf changes, a very recent study from the Carter lab (Foster et al.

Could these defects be due to denatured tubulin? This could be more pronounced in the purified tubulin sample which could have denatured/aggregated tubulin that would incorporate non-canonically in the lattice and possibly fall off and give rise to defects?

While this reminds that kinesin binds to β tubulin, explaining why we kept the same colors as in the atomic models, it is by no way a superposition of the spheres with the α- and β-tubulin subunits. Indeed, if one had to place the atomic models of tubulin in the maps, they would be slightly longitudinally displaced with respect to the positions of the spheres (this is apparent in Figure 1C), but this does not change their register within the microtubule lattice. Hence, the objective of this representation was uniquely to describe the organization of the underlying αβ-tubulin lattice, and thus end-up with simple models that we could quantify. To make it clear, we have added the following sentence in the result section (L97-101):</p><p>“To model the underlying αβ-tubulin heterodimer lattice, we placed yellow spheres onto kinesin densities and cyan spheres in between.

In the present case, the missing wedge of data was 66.93° for the <italic>a</italic>-tilt axis (angular range -52.96°, +60.11°) and 72.80° for the <italic>b</italic>-tilt axis (angular range -50.33°, +56.27°). Since the microtubule was roughly parallel to the <italic>a</italic>-tilt axis (see Figure A on the right), we will consider its missing wedge.</p><p>The length required to cover the missing wedge can be expressed as L=N*dx*w/abs(tan(q)*360), where w is the missing wedge (in degrees), dx is the separation between protofilaments (5.15 nm (Chrétien and Wade, 1991)), N the number of protofilaments, and q the protofilament skew angle. The protofilament skew angle measured directly on the raw data was -0.64° (-0.75° is a theoretical prediction), which gives a length L = 1200 nm to fill in the missing wedge with new data. Hence, as expected by the referee, the length of the microtubule (1390 nm) was sufficient (although according to our calculations a protofilament skew angle of -0.46° would have required a 1670 nm long microtubule. Hence, the referee might have used calculations different from ours).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we compare a 13_3 (MT4 in Figure 2—Figure supplement 3) with the 14_3 microtubule of Figure 2 (MT3 in Figure 2—Figure supplement 3).

Since the protofilaments do not rotate in the 13_3 microtubules, the elongation of densities in the direction of the missing wedge is clearly apparent and the missing wedge is not compensated in its FFT.

To visualize this effect, we have made a simple simulation with a Fourier transform of a tomogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> D), applied clockwise rotations every 4° over 60° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> E) and 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> F). This simulation reproduces fairly our sub-tomographic approach, since we add progressively views into the missing wedge by following individual protofilaments along the microtubule. On the right are profile densities along the yellow circle. It can be seen that while data are incorporated into the missing wedge in (E), their intensities are lower than in the original regions of the FFT. Indeed, at least a 180° rotation of the protofilaments around the microtubule axis is necessary to evenly fill the Fourier space (F), a prerequisite to obtain a fully symmetric map devoid of missing wedge artefacts. In theory, PEET is supposed to compensate for unequal distribution of densities in Fourier space, but this may only be partial as observed in our data. Nevertheless, these missing wedge artefacts present in the full volumes, and also in the segments, do not modify the positions of the kinesin-motor domain densities, and have no impact on the characterization of microtubule lattice organization in the microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– One of the weaknesses of the analysis of averaging a short segment and trying to analyze the subtomogram averaging and interpreting the seam is that the assumption of 100% kinesin decoration.

Nevertheless, we acknowledge that more sophisticate methods than ours can be imagined to analyze the changes in lattice types within individual microtubules. One of the main limitations of our approach is that, by averaging over short segments, we likely underestimate the lattice-type transition frequencies, and hence the number of holes within microtubules (this is discussed in the manuscript). New analytical methods may tackle this issue. Developing these is however beyond the scope of this paper and our method has the advantage to be both sufficiently efficient and robust to reveal the so far unexpected lattice heterogeneity of individual microtubules and the differences between the in vitro and the <italic>ex cellulo</italic> contexts.

The main effect of missing data at high angle (whether it is a missing wedge or a prism), is an elongation of structures along the beam direction (Guesdon et al., 2013; Mastronarde, 1997). This is clearly a limitation when one tries to analyze microtubule edges that have been severely smoothed by this imaging artefact, explaining why some averaging over short segments is still necessary. However, this artefact does not modify the positions of the kinesin motor domains in the final volumes, allowing us to describe their organization in the segmented sub-tomogram averages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Main points:</p><p>– The conclusion that they observe different protofilament, helical start and seam numbers in all conditions (L25-26, L71), is not supported by the data.

These RanQ69L data are provided as a control for use of 5% DMSO for stimulation of microtubule polymerization in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract. There is not enough data here to exclude the possibility that DMSO has affected the protofilament and seam number of microtubules. The RanQ69L-stimulated microtubules do contain instances of seam movement and so the main conclusions regarding the prevalence and importance of lattice-type transitions are well supported. To address this, the two datasets should be reported on separately and the differences discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In these sentences (L25-26, L71), we indeed made reference to <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg cytoplasmic extracts as a whole, independently of whether microtubule aster formation was stimulated by DMSO or Ran. Hence, the referee is right and we changed the phrase by (L25-26): 'We find that in almost all conditions the seam number and location vary within individual microtubules, leaving holes of one to a few subunits in size within their wall.'. This is also corrected in L71. In the Ran experiments, we simply asked whether lattice-type transitions were present like in DMSO egg extracts, which was indeed the case. Following the referee's suggestions, we have modified the end of the result section as follows L221-224:</p><p>“In addition, variations in protofilament and helix-start numbers were also observed such as 12_2, 12_3, 13_4 and 14_3 microtubule-lattice regions, but uniquely in the Xenopus-DMSO sample (Figure 9A-D, Figure 9—Video 1, Figure 10A, Table 2)', and (L229-233): ' Microtubules with protofilament numbers different than 13 were not observed in the <italic>Xenopus</italic>-Ran sample (Figure 8—figure supplement 5, Figure 10B, Table 2).

While most previous data on cell microtubule architecture have been gathered from thin sections of specimens embedded in resin and further stained with the tannic-acid method, the possibility to characterize long stretches of cellular microtubules offered by the method of cryo-electron tomography such as performed by (Foster et al., 2021), will certainly provide new and interesting information concerning this issue.</p><p>But most importantly, and as we discuss it in our manuscript, we know very little concerning the organization of the ab-tubulin heterodimers within cellular microtubules.

Hence, we believe that it is fair to discuss these two features (lattice type and protofilament number) in parallel. We specifically focus on EBs because there are involved in those two aspects: they bind in between protofilaments organized according to a B-type lattice and they also favor the formation of 13_3 microtubules.

Nevertheless, even if kinesin motor domains expand the microtubule lattice, we do not imagine how this could be related to the changes in registry of the ab-tubulin heterodimers that we observe within preformed microtubules. Other modifications reported recently concern the removal of tubulin dimers by full-length kinesin during his walk onto microtubules (Budaitis et al., 2021; Kuo et al., 2022; Sabo and Lansky, 2022; Triclin et al., 2021).

(2021) cited above, we do not know other studies where changes in protofilament numbers along individual microtubules have been documented in intact cells. In interphasic <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, it was reported to be 0.04 µm<sup>-1</sup> (calculated from data in Table II of (Chrétien et al., 1992)), which is the same order of magnitude to what we observe here in metaphase arrested egg extracts (~0.1 µm<sup>-1</sup>). However, we cannot tell whether these transitions are more frequent than in intact cells, since we could not find such data in the work of Foster et al. (2021) or in any other previous studies. We would of course be interested to know the old and new references suggested by the referee so that we can discuss them in our manuscript. Alternatively, if by 'protofilament changes' the referee refers to the range of protofilament numbers different than 13 in cells, there is an abundant literature on this subject reviewed recently by (Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017) (see also our answer to reviewer #2 concerning this issue).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could these defects be due to denatured tubulin? This could be more pronounced in the purified tubulin sample which could have denatured/aggregated tubulin that would incorporate non-canonically in the lattice and possibly fall off and give rise to defects?</p></disp-quote><p>At the molecular level, changes in lattice types involve switches between homotypic (αα, ββ) and heterotypic (αβ, βα) lateral interactions in adjacent protofilaments. None of these are abnormal interactions (i.e., 'non-canonical'), since they occur naturally in microtubules. By analogy with defects found in crystals and nanotubes for instance, the term 'defect' is a geometrical characteristic that must be understood as a local modification in the registry of the ab-heterodimers within the microtubule lattice, and by no way a 'defect' in the tubulin molecule by itself. Hence, there is no need to speculate that denatured tubulin is at the origin of such transitions that we also find in a cytoplasmic context.</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the referee's concern, we must quote that we use very classical protocols to purify tubulin and assemble microtubules, similar to those used by many laboratories in the field. The present batch of tubulin was prepared according to (Castoldi and Popov, 2003) followed by a cycling step to remove free GTP (Ashford and Hyman, 2006) and was stored at -80 °C until use. Upon tawing, tubulin is diluted at the right concentration, incubated with the nucleotide of interest (here, GTP at 1 mM or GMPCPP at 0.1 mM), and subjected to a high-speed run in an airfuge to remove denaturated tubulin that typically forms aggregates upon tawing. Tubulin is a very labile protein that denaturates with time at 4 °C (Ashford and Hyman, 2006), implying that experiments should be performed quickly after tawing. In addition, tubulin denaturation occurs inevitably during microtubule assembly (see our detailed study in (Weis et al., 2010) concerning this issue and the role of the chaperone HSP90 in protecting tubulin from thermal denaturation). However, once denaturated the protein forms aggregates, and to our knowledge, incorporation of denatured tubulin within microtubules has not been reported.</p><p>We also stress that we are one of the rare laboratories that check the level of aggregation after microtubule self-assembly, by cooling down the sample at 4 °C and measure the difference in OD between the start of the reaction and the basal level at 4 °C, see Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. In this figure, it can be seen that the level of aggregation is very low compared to the OD contributed by the microtubules at the polymerization the plateau. Nevertheless, if we follow the referee reasoning, lattice defects should accumulate at the plateau during self-assembly. Conversely, if the frequency of lattice defects scales with the microtubule growth rate, it should be very high during the sigmoid phase of microtubule self-assembly, and then decrease progressively at the plateau due to microtubule dynamic instability. Experiments are planned to test this latter hypothesis (see also below), which will indirectly address the referee's concerns about tubulin denaturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors show that these numbers hold with tubulin purified from a different prep or different procedure than the batch they used? Or is the frequency of these defects a reflection of the integrity/quality of the tubulin used? Or ice thickness?</p></disp-quote><p>See point #3 in our answer to the referee's Public Review. Please also see a Figure showing the comparison between the seam distribution obtained by Debs et al. (2020) on Taxol stabilized self-assembled microtubules, and the one we obtained with self-assembled GDP-microtubules (Figure 10C, dark-blue bars). The fact that multi-seams have been observed by several group since 1994, and that used different sources of tubulin and different protocols for its purification, strongly suggests that it is a general property of microtubule assembly from purified tubulin. Hence, our results are not only in perfect line with these previous observations, but go beyond since we find that the number and location of seams vary within individual microtubules. This was not described before because none of these previous studies addressed the structural heterogeneity of individual microtubule lattices. In addition, it must be stressed that in all these previous studies, Taxol was used to assemble and/or stabilize the microtubules, raising the concern that the drug could have induced multi-seams. Here, we used classical self-assembly conditions in the presence of GTP to show that the formation of multi-seams is inherent to the tubulin polymerization reaction.</p><p>Concerning ice thickness, we cannot imagine how this could modify the registry of the αβ-tubulin heterodimer within the microtubule lattice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are the observed defects also recapitulated if they use templated polymerization from seeds? Axonemes for example?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a study that we are planning to perform to investigate the effect of tubulin concentration, and hence growth rate, on lattice type transition frequency, similar to the one described in (Schaedel et al., 2019) where we investigated changes in protofilament numbers as a function of tubulin concentration. These experiments will take time and go clearly beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The tubulin concentration used is very high – 40 microM.</p></disp-quote><p>See point #1 in our answer to the referee's Public Review. Maybe the referee was misled by our sentence in L139-141 were we quoted 'Direct visualization of holes within microtubules self-assembled at high tubulin concentration (40 µM) in the presence of GTP was hampered by the high background generated by free tubulin in solution.' We used the term &quot;high&quot; by comparison to the GMPCPP conditions where tubulin can assemble at a lower concentration (10 µM). To correct this, we now quote (L139-141):</p><p>“Direct visualization of holes within microtubules self-assembled at a tubulin concentration of 40 µM in the presence of GTP was hampered by the high background generated by free tubulin in solution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tubulin nucleates at lower concentrations and in vivo the concentration of available tubulin for polymerization is much lower (~5 microM).</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the CC to overcome the nucleation barrier with mammalian brain tubulin, see our answer above. To our knowledge, the accepted value for tubulin concentration in cells from vertebrates is closer to ~20 µM e.g., it was estimated to ~22 µM in 3T3 cells (Hiller and Weber, 1978) and ~24 µM in egg extracts (Gard and Kirschner, 1987). We hypothesize that the value of 5 µM quoted by the referee is derived from measurements in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (Loiodice et al., 2019) that contains a very limited number of microtubules (Höög et al., 2007), and may not be taken as representative of eucaryotic cells in vertebrates from instance. Nevertheless, variations in tubulin concentration likely occur between cell types in a same species, and also between species. Yet, microtubule nucleation and assembly in cells is regulated by a vast array of macromolecular assemblages and proteins such as the g-TuRC and MAPs. Here, we used a tubulin concentration ~twice that reported in cells, which remains close to physiological conditions, at least the same order of magnitude. Therefore, it cannot be quoted as 'very high'. Noticeably, it may turn out to be crucial for cells to have a tubulin concentration close to its CC so that self-assembly does not occur, and thus ensure that microtubule polymerization starts from nucleating centers such as the centrosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do these defects show the same frequency when polymerization is carried out at lower concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point that we plan to examine in details. The general question behind is whether the lattice-type transition frequency increases with the microtubule growth rate. We already showed that this is the case for the protofilament number transition frequency, and that as the growth rates increases, a wider range of protofilament numbers is formed (Schaedel et al., 2019). We thus speculate that this will also hold true for the lattice-type transition frequency, but this remains to be investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Samples are diluted, 50X in some instances before addition to the grid – could these dilutions leads to the defects observed? Growth on the grid from a template would resolve this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>See point #4 in our answer to the referee's Public Review. In addition, it is unclear to us how seeded assembly would avoid this phenomenon. Microtubules have been reported to transition in protofilament number, even when nucleated by centrosomes (Schaedel et al., 2019). Hence, we anticipate that transitions in lattice-types will follow the same trends once nucleated from seeds. But as stated above, this is a study that we plan to perform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors speculate that EB proteins could aid in more faithful polymerization – it is though worth keeping in mind that cells do just fine without EBs, so one would think that the effects on the lattice structure would be minor or conversely the defects are not particularly relevant functionally.</p></disp-quote><p>By contrast to the referee's claims, there is an abundant literature that demonstrated that perturbing EBs has strong consequences on cell functions. To cite a few, in (Draviam et al., 2006), RNAi of EB1 resulted in chromosome missegregation at anaphase. In (Komarova et al., 2009), shRNA of EB1 and EB3 promoted persistent microtubule growth, whereas in the presence of purified tubulin they increased the catastrophe frequency. Noticeably, the authors report that a triple KO of EB1, EB2 and EB3 was incompatible with cell viability. In (Thomas et al., 2016), siRNA of EB1 resulted in chromosome misalignment due to a decrease in Ska1 (spindle-kinetochore-associated protein) association with microtubules. In (Yang et al., 2017), disruption of EB1, EB2 and EB3 had little impact on cell division, but perturbed the organization of non centrosomal microtubules, leading to a compaction of the Golgi as well as defects in cell migration. In our hands, depleting EBs from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts results in a strong decrease in the size of microtubule asters, and a deregulation of microtubule protofilament number (ongoing experiments). This is perfectly in line with previous results by us and others showing that EBs favor 13_3 microtubules (des Georges et al., 2008; Vitre et al., 2008).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All in all this is a well-executed study that shows that tubulin in vitro can be promiscuous in its polymerization properties, but it is not clear to me how generalizable the defect frequencies they find are and it is likely that they will vary with the polymerization conditions, quality of tubulin etc. It seems that a more thorough analysis would be warranted to examine how their findings hold in different assembly conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Generalization of our work seems to be a major concern of the referee. Conversely, we argue, based on a robust bibliography background, that multi-seams have been observed by many others in the past, and hence with different tubulin batches and widely different assembly conditions (see point #3 in our answer to the referee's Public Review). Finally, we acknowledge the fact that our discovery opens new perspectives such as studies on the effect of microtubule growth rate on lattice type transition frequency and the effect of MAPs (including EBs) on their structural integrity. These are all ongoing experiments, but that go clearly outside the scope of the current study and that will require more lengthy and detailed studies.</p><p>References</p><p>Ashford, A.
