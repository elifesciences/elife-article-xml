However, these algorithms often fail to identify ORFs lacking canonical features such as a length of &gt;50 codons or the presence of an upstream Shine-Dalgarno sequence. Here, we use ribosome profiling approaches to identify actively translated ORFs in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Most of the ORFs we identify have not been previously described, indicating that the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> transcriptome is pervasively translated. The newly described ORFs are predominantly short, with many encoding proteins of ≤50 amino acids. Codon usage of the newly discovered ORFs suggests that most have not been subject to purifying selection, and hence are unlikely to contribute to cell fitness. Nevertheless, we identify 90 new ORFs (median length of 52 codons) that bear the hallmarks of purifying selection. Thus, our data suggest that pervasive translation of short ORFs in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> serves as a rich source for the evolution of new functional proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>How can you predict which proteins an organism can make?

The rest of the sequences showed no evidence of having evolved a useful job, yet they were still manufactured by the mycobacteria.

Binding of the 30 S initiation complex to the mRNA involves base-pairing interactions between the mRNA Shine-Dalgarno (S-D) sequence, located a short distance upstream of the start codon, and the anti-S-D sequence in the 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Local mRNA secondary structure around the ribosome binding site can reduce interaction with the 30 S initiation complex. Translation initiates at a start codon, typically an AUG; less frequently, translation initiation occurs at GUG or UUG, and in rare instances at AUC, AUU, and AUA start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gvozdjak and Samanta, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hecht et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the likelihood of translation initiation at a given sequence will depend on the sequence upstream of the start codon, the degree of secondary structure in the region surrounding the start codon, and start codon identity.</p><p>Due to the requirement for a 5’ untranslated region that includes the S-D sequence, mRNAs translated using the canonical mechanism are referred to as ‘leadered’. By contrast, ‘leaderless’ translation initiation occurs on mRNAs that lack a 5’ UTR, such that the transcription start site (TSS) and translation start codon coincide. The mechanism of leaderless translation initiation is poorly understood. Until recently, there were few known examples of leaderless mRNAs; leaderless translation in the model bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was shown to be rare and inefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). However, recent studies indicate that leaderless translation initiation is a prevalent and robust mechanism in many bacterial and archaeal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck and Moll, 2018</xref>). We and others showed that ~25% of all mRNAs in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) are leaderless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, our data suggested that any RNA with a 5’ AUG or GUG will be efficiently translated using the leaderless mechanism in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial open reading frames (ORFs) are typically identified from genome sequences using automated prediction algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besemer and Borodovsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delcher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hyatt et al., 2010</xref>). Among the criteria used by these algorithms are ORF length, and the presence of a S-D sequence. Hence, they often fail to identify non-canonical ORFs, including overlapping ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burge and Karlin, 1998</xref>), leaderless ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck and Moll, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lomsadze et al., 2018</xref>), and short ORFs (sORFs; encoding small proteins of 50 or fewer amino acids; most algorithms have a lower size limit of 50 codons). Recent studies have revealed hundreds of sORFs in diverse bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sberro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Storz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">VanOrsdel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>). Some sORFs encode functional small proteins that contribute to cell fitness, whereas other sORFs function as <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulators. In eukaryotes, there have been reports of ‘pervasive translation’ of thousands of unannotated sORFs, likely due to the imperfect specificity of the translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacholder et al., 2021</xref>). The function, if any, of these sORFs and their encoded proteins is unclear, although they are rarely subject to purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacholder et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, pervasively translated eukaryotic sORFs may function as ‘proto-genes’, that, over the course of evolution, can acquire a function promoting cell fitness, a process referred to as ‘de novo gene birth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blevins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vakirlis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) is a powerful experimental approach to identify the translated regions of mRNAs by mapping ribosome-protected RNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Ribo-RET is a modified form of Ribo-seq in which bacterial cells are treated with the antibiotic retapamulin before lysis; retapamulin traps bacterial ribosomes at sites of translation initiation, whereas elongating ribosomes are free to complete translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, Ribo-RET facilitates the identification of overlapping ORFs by limiting the signal to the start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meydan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>). Ribo-RET was recently applied to <italic>E. coli</italic>, revealing start codons for many previously undescribed ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>), including sORFs, and ORFs positioned in frame with annotated ORFs, such that the translated protein is an isoform of the previously described protein. Here, we use a combination of Ribo-seq and Ribo-RET to map translated ORFs in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We detect thousands of robustly translated, previously undescribed sORFs from leaderless and leadered mRNAs. We also identify hundreds of ORFs that have start codons upstream or downstream of those for annotated genes, in the same reading frame. We conclude that the <italic>Mtb</italic> transcriptome is pervasively translated, with spurious translation initiation occurring at many sites. We also identify a subset of novel sORFs that appear to be under purifying selection, suggesting these ORFs, or the proteins they encode, contribute to cell fitness. Thus, our data suggest that pervasive translation of sORFs in <italic>Mtb</italic> serves as a rich source for the evolution of functional genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hundreds of actively translated sORFs from leaderless mRNAs</title><p><italic>Mtb</italic> has a genome of 4,411,532bp, with 3989 annotated protein-coding genes (RefSeq annotation). Two previous studies of <italic>Mtb</italic> identified 1285 transcription start sites (TSSs) for which the associated transcript begins with the sequence ‘RUG’ (<italic>R</italic> = A or G; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that these transcripts correspond to leaderless mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). Of the 1285 TSSs associated with a 5’ RUG, 577 match the start codons of protein-coding genes included in the current genome annotation, as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). A further 338 of the RUG-associated TSSs correspond to putative ORFs whose start codons are unannotated, but whose stop codons match those of annotated genes; we refer to this architecture as ‘isoform’, since translation of these putative ORFs would generate N-terminally extended or truncated isoforms of annotated proteins. We note that some isoform ORFs likely reflect mis-annotations, as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, 370 of the 1,285 RUG-associated TSSs correspond to putative ORFs whose start and stop codons do not match those of any annotated gene; we refer to these as putative ‘novel’ ORFs.</p><p>To determine whether the putative isoform and novel leaderless ORFs are actively translated, we performed Ribo-seq in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Note that all genome-scale data described in this manuscript can be viewed in our interactive genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mtb.wadsworth.org/">https://mtb.wadsworth.org/</ext-link>). We first assessed ribosome occupancy profiles for leadered ORFs that are present in the current genome annotation. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>), we observed enrichment of ribosome occupancy at start and stop codons of annotated, leadered ORFs; the 3’ ends of ribosome-protected RNA fragments are enriched 15 nt downstream of the start codons, and 12 nt downstream of stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We note that there are also smaller peaks and troughs of Ribo-seq signal precisely at start and stop codons, likely attributable to sequence biases associated with library preparation that are highlighted when groups of similar sequences (e.g. start/stop codons) are aligned (see Methods). We next assessed ribosome occupancy profiles for the 577 leaderless ORFs that are present in the current genome annotation. As expected, we observed an enrichment of ribosome-protected RNA fragments, with 3’ ends positioned 12 nt downstream of stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), consistent with the profile observed for leadered ORFs. However, 3’ ends of ribosome-protected RNA fragments were not enriched 15 nt downstream of the start codons of the 577 annotated leaderless ORFs; rather, we observed enrichment spread across the region ~25–35 nt downstream of leaderless start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting either that ribosomes at leaderless ORF start codons behave differently to those at leadered ORF start codons, or that ribosome-protected fragments are too small to be represented in the RNA library; this observation is consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sawyer et al., 2021</xref>). Further confounding analysis of leaderless start codons, which are, by definition, aligned with TSSs, we consistently observed non-random Ribo-seq signals at TSSs of non-leaderless transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), albeit to a lesser extent than that observed for leaderless gene starts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ribo-seq data support the translation of hundreds of isoform and novel ORFs from leaderless mRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Metagene plot showing normalized Ribo-seq sequence read coverage for untreated cells in the regions around start (left graph) and stop codons (right graph) of previously annotated, leadered ORFs.

Thus, our data are consistent with active translation of the majority of the 370 putative novel ORFs as leaderless mRNAs. Strikingly, 268 of the leaderless novel ORFs are sORFs. We conclude that <italic>Mtb</italic> has hundreds of actively translated sORFs on leaderless mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ribo-RET identifies sites of translation initiation in <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p>While there are likely &gt;1000 leaderless mRNAs in <italic>Mtb</italic>, most mRNAs are leadered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sawyer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). Given that our data support the existence of &gt;300 novel ORFs translated from the 5’ ends of leaderless mRNAs, we speculated that there are many more unannotated ORFs translated from leadered initiation codons. While sites of leaderless translation initiation can be readily identified from TSS maps, identification of novel leadered ORFs is more challenging. Translated leadered ORFs generate signal in Ribo-seq datasets, but identification of novel ORFs from Ribo-seq data is confounded by (i) the potential for artifactual signal in 5’ UTRs due to the binding of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2016</xref>), and (ii) masking of signal by overlapping ORFs on the same strand. To circumvent these problems, we performed Ribo-RET with <italic>Mtb</italic> to specifically map sites of translation initiation. We aligned the ribosome-protected RNA fragment sequences to the <italic>Mtb</italic> genome to identify ‘Initiation-Enriched Ribosome Footprints’ (IERFs), sites of ribosome occupancy that exceed the local background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Specifically, IERFs correspond to genomic coordinates that have ribosome occupancy coverage that exceeds an arbitrarily defined threshold value (5.5 reads per million) and is at least 10-fold higher than the mean ribosome occupancy coverage in the region 50 nt upstream to 50 nt downstream. We hypothesized that most IERFs correspond to sites of translation initiation. In support of this idea, there is a strong enrichment of IERF 3’ ends 15 nt downstream of the start codons of annotated, leadered genes; this enrichment is substantially greater than that observed for Ribo-seq data from cells grown without retapamulin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ribo-RET of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>tuberculosis</italic> identifies sites of translation initiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Metagene plot showing normalized Ribo-seq and Ribo-RET sequence read coverage (single replicate for each; data indicate the position of ribosome footprint 3’ ends) in the region from –50 to +100 nt relative to the start codons of annotated, leadered ORFs.

The enrichment and position of start codon and Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence features upstream of IERFs are consistent with IERFs marking sites of translation initiation. We observed a strong enrichment of A/T immediately 3’ of the IERFs, i.e. on the other side of the site cleaved by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) during the Ribo-RET procedure; ‘A’ was found most frequently (53% of IERFs), and ‘G’ found the least frequently (2% of IERFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This sequence bias is likely not due to a biological phenomenon, but rather to the sequence preference of MNase, which is known to display sequence bias when cutting DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dingwall et al., 1981</xref>) and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>). The sequence bias is apparent in the complete Ribo-RET libraries, with 74% of sequenced ribosome-protected fragments having an ‘A’ or ‘U’ 3’ of the upstream MNase site. Given that the genomic A/T content in <italic>Mtb</italic> is only 34%, it is likely that inefficient RNA processing by MNase led to an underrepresentation of some G/C-rich translation initiation sites in the Ribo-RET data, and may explain the extended footprints ( &gt; 15 nt) in G/C-rich contexts (see Discussion). This sequence bias also likely favors cleavage precisely at exposed start codons, which are strongly enriched for A/T bases, creating more RNA library fragments that end in these sequences (e.g. enriched Ribo-seq signal precisely at start codons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identification of putative ORFs from Ribo-RET data</title><p>A total of 1994 IERFs were found in both replicate experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). 71% (1406) of these IERFs were associated with a potential ATG or GTG start codon 14–18 nt upstream of their 3’ ends, or a potential TTG start codon 15 nt upstream of their 3’ ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>), a far higher proportion than that expected by chance (17%).

We hypothesized that the start codons identified by Ribo-RET would direct translation initiation in a reporter system that controls for extraneous contextual variables. We selected 18 novel predicted start codons that scored in the top quartile for ribosome occupancy in Ribo-RET datasets; in Ribo-seq profiles, the associated ribosome densities per transcript cover a broad range of values (median percentile rank of 37 for the eight ORFs that could be assessed). We tested these start codons by fusing them to a luciferase reporter, including 25 bp of upstream sequence for each ORF tested. We constructed equivalent reporter fusions with a single base substitution in the predicted start codon (RTG to RCG). For comparison, we included wild-type and start codon mutant luciferase reporter fusions for three annotated ORFs (<italic>icl1</italic>, <italic>sucC</italic>, and <italic>mmsA</italic>). The reporter plasmids were integrated into the chromosome of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Luciferase expression from each of the 20 luciferase fusions, including those for five novel ORFs from our lower-confidence list, was significantly reduced by mutation of the start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01, as indicated, one-way Student’s T-test). Mutation of the start codons reduced, but did not abolish, luciferase expression; this was true even for the three annotated ORFs. We speculate that translation can initiate at low levels from non-canonical start codons, as has been described for <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hecht et al., 2017</xref>). We note that our plasmid reporter system was designed to minimize extraneous variables between constructs that could confound initiation codon evaluation, which necessarily removed the candidate start codons from their larger native context. Overall, the luciferase reporter fusion data are consistent with active translation from the start codons identified by Ribo-RET.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Validation of novel and isoform ORFs using western blotting</title><p>To directly assess translation of selected putative ORFs, we generated constructs for two complete novel ORFs with 3 x FLAG tags fused at the encoded C-terminus. We generated equivalent constructs with a single base substitution in the putative start codon. The tagged constructs were integrated into the chromosome of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. The two proteins were detected by western blot, and they were not detected from cells with mutant start codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We generated equivalent 3 x FLAG-tagged strains for two isoform ORFs. We detected the overlapping, full-length protein by western blot, and expression of these full-length proteins was unaffected by mutation of the isoform ORF start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also detected a protein of smaller size, corresponding to the expected size of the isoform protein; expression of these small isoform proteins was not detected in the start codon mutant constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Notably, for the pairs of novel and isoform proteins we detected by western blot, the two more highly expressed proteins were from the lower-confidence set of ORFs. Overall, these data support the ORF predictions from the Ribo-RET data, and the existence of novel and isoform ORFs identified from only a single replicate of Ribo-RET data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Limited G/C-Skew in the codons of non-overlapping novel ORFs</title><p>The <italic>Mtb</italic> genome has a high G/C content (65.6%). There is a G/C bias within codons of annotated genes: the second position of codons is particularly constrained to encode specific amino acids, which supersedes the G/C bias of the genome, whereas the third (wobble) position has few such constraints. Hence, functional ORFs under purifying selection exhibit G/C content below the genome average at the second codon position and above the genome average at the third codon position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bibb et al., 1984</xref>). We refer to the difference in G/C content at third positions and second positions of codons as ‘G/C-skew’, with positive G/C-skew expected for ORFs subject to purifying selection. We reasoned that we could exploit G/C-skew to assess the likelihood that novel ORFs identified by Ribo-RET have experienced purifying selection at the codon level. We assessed G/C skew for all 2299 novel ORFs identified in this study (leadered and leaderless). We limited the analysis to regions that do not overlap previously annotated genes, since G/C-skew could be impacted by selective pressure on an overlapping gene; 62% of ORFs were discarded because they completely overlap an annotated gene, and 17% of ORFs had some portion excluded. The set of all tested novel ORFs has modest, but significant, positive G/C-skew (Fisher’s exact test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2e<sup>–16</sup>; n = 19,750 codons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, C</xref> ), consistent with a subset of codons in this class having been under purifying selection. However, the degree of positive G/C-skew for the novel ORFs is much smaller than that for the annotated ORFs we identified in our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that the proportion of novel ORFs experiencing purifying selection, and/or the intensity of that selection, is much lower than that for the annotated ORF group. To identify specific novel ORFs that have likely experienced purifying selection of their codons, and hence are likely to contribute to cell fitness, we determined G/C-skew for the non-overlapping regions of each novel ORF individually. We then ranked the ORFs by the significance of their G/C-skew (Fisher’s exact test; see Materials and methods for details). Of the 103 ORFs with the most significant G/C-skew, there is a strong enrichment for positive G/C-skew: 90 of the ORFs have positive G/C skew and 13 have negative G/C skew. This suggests that ~80 of the 90 ORFs with positive G/C skew have been subject to purifying selection on their codons. It is important to note that the size of the ORF is a major consideration when determining the significance of G/C-skew; the small size of novel ORFs therefore limits this analysis. Moreover, the G/C-skew analysis provides no information on regions of novel ORFs that overlap annotated genes. Hence, the number of novel ORFs that we predict to be functional based on their G/C-skew is almost certainly a substantial underestimate. Nonetheless, the overall G/C-skew of novel ORFs relative to that of annotated ORFs provides strong evidence that the majority of novel ORFs are not functional.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>G/C skew within codons of novel and annotated ORFs.</title><p>Histogram showing the frequency of G/C nucleotides at each of the three codon positions for annotated ORFs or novel ORFs.

This conclusion is strongly supported by the clear association of initiating and terminating ribosomes with the start and stop codons, respectively, in untreated cells. We note that the enrichment of terminating ribosomes at the stop codons of novel ORFs in Ribo-seq data (i.e. no retapamulin treatment) is independent of the methods used to identify the novel ORF start codons. The novel and isoform ORFs are also supported by validation of selected ORFs using multiple independent genetic and biochemical approaches. Overall, our data reveal a far greater number of ORFs than previously appreciated, with annotated ORFs outnumbered by isoform and novel ORFs. Many genomic regions encode overlapping ORFs on opposite strands or on the same strand in different frames, contrary to the textbook view of genome organization.</p><p>There are 3898 annotated <italic>Mtb</italic> ORFs, but the ORF discovery approaches applied here under-sampled these, identifying 1669. Failure to identify more annotated ORFs is likely due to the following biological and technical reasons: (i) Many genes are likely to be expressed at levels too low to be detected. In support of this idea, the median Ribo-seq read coverage for leadered, annotated ORFs identified by Ribo-RET was significantly higher than that for equivalent ORFs not identified by Ribo-RET (3.8-fold; Mann-Whitney U test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 2.2e<sup>–16</sup>); (ii) Many ORF start codons are likely to be misannotated, so they would be classified as isoforms. (iii) The A/T sequence preference of MNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) likely led to exclusion of some ORFs from the Ribo-RET libraries. In support of this idea, the base at position +17 relative to the start codon (i.e. immediately downstream of the preferred MNase cleavage site) is 1.7-fold more likely to be ‘A’, and 1.6-fold less likely to be ‘G’, for annotated ORFs we identified, than for those we did not. Given the clear underrepresentation of annotated ORFs in our datasets, we conclude that there are many more isoform and novel ORFs to be discovered.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The abundance of novel start codons likely reflects pervasive translation</title><p>Evidence from other bacterial species suggests that the primary determinants of leadered translation initiation in <italic>Mtb</italic> are likely to be (i) a suitable start codon, (ii) an upstream sequence that can act as a S-D, and (iii) low local secondary structure around the ribosome-binding site. We detected enrichment of three different start codons in Ribo-RET data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), while S-D sequences can be located at a range of distances upstream of the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vellanoweth and Rabinowitz, 1992</xref>). Hence, there is limited sequence specificity associated with translation initiation. Moreover, a recent report showed that in <italic>E. coli</italic>, an S-D sequence is not an essential requirement for translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saito et al., 2020</xref>). Leaderless translation initiation has even fewer sequence requirements; our data suggest that a 5’ AUG or GUG is sufficient for robust leaderless translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). While AUG and GUG represent only ~3% of all possible trinucleotide sequences, there is likely to be a strong bias towards 5’ AUG or GUG from the process of transcription initiation; the majority of TSSs in <italic>Mtb</italic> are purines, and the majority of +2 nucleotides are pyrimidines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that many <italic>Mtb</italic> transcripts are subject to spurious translation either by the leaderless or leadered mechanism, simply because the nominal sequence requirements for these processes commonly occur by chance. Thus, there is pervasive translation of the <italic>Mtb</italic> transcriptome, similar to the pervasive translation described in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacholder et al., 2021</xref>). Pervasive translation has been proposed as an explanation for some of the novel ORFs detected in <italic>E. coli</italic> by Ribo-RET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The process of pervasive translation is analogous to pervasive transcription, whereby many DNA sequences function as promoters, often from within genes, to drive transcription of spurious RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lybecker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wade and Grainger, 2014</xref>). Indeed, there are many intragenic promoters in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shell et al., 2015</xref>), providing an additional source of potential spurious translation. We speculate that like spurious transcripts, which are rapidly degraded by RNases, the protein products of pervasive translation are rapidly degraded, as has been proposed for pervasively translated ORFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). Since Ribo-seq and Ribo-RET detect translation, not the protein product, the stability of the encoded proteins would not impact our ability to detect the corresponding ORFs.</p><p>Pervasive translation, by definition, means that ribosomes will spend some fraction of the time translating spurious ORFs. Although we detected many more novel ORFs than annotated ORFs, the total number of codons in all detected novel ORFs is ~20% that of annotated ORFs because of the smaller size of novel proteins. Moreover, novel ORFs as a group are expressed at substantially lower levels than annotated ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Thus, it is likely that &lt;10% of translation in <italic>Mtb</italic> at any given time is of spurious ORFs, so pervasive translation is unlikely to be overly detrimental to the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Proto-genes and the evolution of new functional genes</title><p>Studies of eukaryotes indicate the existence of proto-genes, targets of pervasive translation of either intergenic sequences or sequences antisense to annotated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacholder et al., 2021</xref>). Proto-genes have the potential to evolve into functional ORFs that contribute to cell fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blevins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vakirlis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>). There is also evidence that some bacterial protein-coding genes evolved from intergenic sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yomtovian et al., 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that <italic>Mtb</italic> has a rich source of proto-genes. As described for proto-genes in yeast, the novel ORFs we identified in <italic>Mtb</italic> tend to be less well expressed, have less adapted codon usage, and are shorter than annotated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blevins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>). Pervasive translation in <italic>Mtb</italic> likely facilitates the evolution of new gene function in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Since pervasive translation represents a low proportion of all translation, the fitness cost of pervasive translation may be balanced by the benefits of having a large pool of proto-genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>New functional ORFs/proteins in <italic>Mtb</italic></title><p>The question of whether an ORF is functional first requires a definition of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keeling et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we define function as the ability to improve cell fitness. While functional ORFs need not be under purifying selection, ORFs undergoing purifying selection are presumably functional. One metric of purifying selection available in the G/C-rich genomes of mycobacteria is G/C-skew. Analysis of G/C-skew in the codons of novel ORFs identified 90 ORFs that are likely to be functional (positive G/C, p &lt; 0.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, C</xref>). 54 of these 90 novel ORFs are leadered, and the Ribo-RET signal associated with these 54 ORFs was significantly higher than that for the set of all other novel ORFs (Mann-Whitney U test <italic>P</italic> = 1.8e<sup>–5</sup>), consistent with the idea that functional ORFs are likely to be more highly expressed than non-functional ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>). Of the 90 ORFs that are likely functional based on their G/C-skew, 44 are ≤51 codons long. Thus, this single indicator of purifying selection has greatly expanded the set of likely functional small ORFs/proteins described for <italic>Mtb</italic>. There may be other constraints that additionally limit codon selection, especially for regulatory sORFs, such that functional sORFs lack positive G/C skew. Indeed, this is the case for a phylogenetically conserved set of cysteine-rich regulatory sORFs; cysteine codons that are likely to be essential for sORF regulatory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canestrari et al., 2020</xref>) also reduce the G/C-skew (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of codon usage for isoform ORFs is not informative due to their overlap with annotated ORFs. Some isoform ORFs are likely to represent mis-annotations of annotated ORFs. Multiple lines of evidence support this idea: (i) 19% (288) of isoform start codons are ≤10 codons from the corresponding annotated start codon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref>); this was 3.4-fold more likely for leaderless isoform ORFs, presumably because they lack a S-D, which likely reduces the accuracy of start codon prediction by annotation pipelines. (ii) Leadered isoform ORFs that initiate within 10 codons of an annotated ORF have significantly higher Ribo-RET occupancy than other leadered isoform ORFs (Mann Whitney U Test <italic>P</italic> = 6.3e<sup>–13</sup>; Ribo-RET occupancy from a single replicate), and are significantly less likely to overlap an annotated gene whose start codon was identified by Ribo-RET (Fisher’s Exact Test <italic>P</italic> = 3e<sup>–4</sup>). Nonetheless, since most isoform ORFs start far from an annotated ORF start, we presume that most do not represent mis-annotations; indeed, for 43% (644) of the isoform ORFs, we also detected the start codon of the overlapping annotated ORF by Ribo-RET. While we expect many isoform ORFs to be a manifestation of pervasive translation, we speculate that some encode proteins with functions related to the function of protein encoded by the overlapping, annotated gene, as has been proposed for isoform ORFs in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meydan et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that the <italic>Mtb</italic> transcriptome is pervasively translated.

As ribosome-profiling studies are extended to more diverse species, we anticipate a massive increase in the discovery of bacterial sORFs/small proteins. Future studies aimed at functional characterization of sORFs/small proteins will require prioritizing with clear supporting evidence for function from codon usage patterns, phylogenetic conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sberro et al., 2019</xref>), or genetic data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mc<sup>2</sup>7000</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.097">10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.05.097</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Δ<italic>panCD</italic> Δ<italic>RD1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mc<sup>2</sup>155</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365%E2%80%932958.1990.tb02040.x">10.1111/j.1365–2958.1990.tb02040.x</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SIGMA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog # F1804</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used at (1:1,000) dilution for western blot</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pRV1133C (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pRV1133C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Integrates at <italic>attP</italic> site; includes the <italic>metE</italic> promoter region</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pGE450 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pGE450</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Derivative of pRV1133C containing 3 x FLAG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pGE190 (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pGE190</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Derivative of pRV1133C containing the nLuc gene from pNL1.1 (Promega, cat no 1001)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Micrococcal nuclease (S7)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SIGMA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog # 10107921001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay Reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog # N1110</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Retapamulin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SIGMA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog # CDS023386</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CLC Genomics Workbench</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Qiagen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v8.5.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Alignment of sequence reads from.fastq files</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNAfold</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1748-7188-6-26">10.1186/1748-7188-6-26</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v2.4.14</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ViennaRNA Package <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/">https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>All oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>.

The positions of read 3’ ends were determined from the resultant.sam files, and used to determine coverage on each strand at each genome position.

To be selected as an IERF, a position required a minimum of 5.5 RPM coverage (equivalent to 20 sequence reads in the first replicate dataset), with at least 10-fold higher coverage than the average coverage in the 101 nt region centered on the coordinate being considered, and equal or higher coverage than every position in the 21 nt region centered on the coordinate being considered. For high-confidence ORF calls, all criteria had to be met in both replicate datasets. IERFs were inferred to represent an ORF if the IERF position was 15 nt downstream of a TTG, 14–18 nt downstream of an ATG, or 14–18 nt downstream of a GTG. These trinucleotide sequences and distances were selected based on a &gt; 1.4 fold enrichment upstream of IERFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In a small number of cases, two IERFs were associated with the same start codon; this only occurred in cases where the two IERFs had identical Ribo-RET sequence coverage. This double-matching means that the number of IERFs is slightly higher than the number of identified ORFs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calculating false discovery rates for ORF prediction from Ribo-RET data</title><p>The likelihood of randomly selecting a genome coordinate with an associated start codon sequence (as defined above for IERFs) was estimated by selecting 100,000 random genome coordinates and determining the fraction, ‘R’, that would be associated with a start codon. The set of IERFs contains a number of true positives (i.e. corresponding to a genuine start codon), and a number of false positives. We assume that true positive IERFs are all associated with a start codon using the parameters described above for calling ORFs. We assume that false positive IERFs are associated with a start codon at the same frequency as random genome coordinates, that is R. Since we know how many IERFs were not associated with a start codon, we can use this number to estimate how many false positive IERFs were associated with a start codon by chance.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Pervasive translation in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by me serving as both Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As you can see from their comments below, the reviewers were somewhat discrepant in their perspectives on this paper, necessitating more extensive consultation. The major concern of two of the reviewers was that ~1000 novel ORFs seems extremely high. Both of these reviewers thought further computational analysis (such as re-evaluation of the ribosome profiling data to better sort out real candidates from noise) and further validation (such as tagging of representative candidates in the native genome) was required to support this conclusion. Given the centrality of the &quot;pervasive translation&quot; to your paper, I agree that further analysis and validation is warranted. Since it is anticipated that this work will take longer than two months, I need to reject this submission. However, if you are able to thoroughly address the reviewers' comments, I would encourage you to resubmit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Ribosome profiling can be used to experimentally improve the annotation of genomes, identifying open reading frames that were missed by computational approaches. Recently Mankin (Mol. Cell 2019) and Storz (mBio 2019) published studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> in which antibiotics trap ribosomes exclusively at start sites, allowing them to identify novel ORFs inside and outside of annotated genes. Wade and co-workers employ this strategy in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. While this study is certainly valuable in defining the proteome of this important pathogen, it does not make use of novel methods nor arrive at substantially different conclusions from these earlier studies.</p><p>Wade and co-workers claim that they have identified &gt;1000 novel ORFs but I have some concerns about such a large number of new genes. The ribosomal profiling data (from untreated and retapamulin-treated cells) appear to be quite good. The authors show that novel ORFs on average have enriched Shine-Dalgarno sequences, lower RNA structure, and higher density at stop codons. But I want to see evidence for each novel ORF that it is translated (not the average). For ORFs outside of annotated genes, they can establish a threshold of ribosome reads that establishes confidence in translation (this data is given in table 1). Some of these values are quite low suggesting that the ORFs are not translated (at least at appreciable levels). This could also be done for the 300 or so leaderless mRNAs. For ORFs inside annotated genes, the signal at the novel start site should be compared to the signal at the annotated start site (or perhaps the ribosome density across the gene in untreated cells) and only if the novel start site signal is above some ratio should it be considered.</p><p>I also have concerns about the validation studies. A very small amount of sequence upstream of the start sites candidate genes was integrated into a different organism with a constant promoter. This means that other things that are essential for translation (transcription of that region, mRNA structure at the start site) are not taken into account. It is not surprising that start codons will initiate translation of a reporter gene if driven by a decent promoter. The question is whether or not this happens in the native genome. Validation should be done by adding an epitope tag to the 3'-end of the ORF in the native genome. I recognize that this is a lot to ask in an organism that is BSL3 with such a slow growth rate. But the strategy shown in Figure 4 doesn't work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Smith and colleagues perform ribosome profiling on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in the presence and absence of an antibiotic that blocks ribosomes at initiation. Collectively, the data support the idea that there is widespread low-level translation of small unannotated ORFs throughout the genome, most of which are unlikely to produce functional proteins. The study was rigorously and thoughtfully performed from both the experimental and analytical perspectives. The manuscript is well-written and most of the figures are clear and straightforward to interpret. The findings are significant, with a number of potentially important implications for mycobacterial physiology and evolution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Smith et al. describes a ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) study of the translatome of the human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb). The authors map elongating and initiating (via Retapamulin treatment, which stalls initiation complexes, &quot;ribo-RET&quot;) ribosomes on mRNAs by deep sequencing. This provides empirical evidence for translated ORFs (annotated or novel), including those within coding regions via Retapamulin-based identification of internal initiation sites. Based on genome-wide analysis of this data, the authors suggest ~1000 novel translated ORFs with high confidence and even more with lower confidence. Some of the novel ORFs, including isoforms of annotated genes or novel ORFs, are validated based on luciferase reporters or Western blots analysis of FLAG-tagged variants of the WT sequences or start-codon mutants. Finally, codon analysis suggests that most of the novel ORFs are likely non-functional as they do not show signatures of purifying selection. The study also provides a resource of novel ORFs that could be studied for functions in TB physiology. This includes small proteins, which are underrepresented in genome annotations, as well as functional studies. This is the first Ribo-seq study of Mtb, and ribo-RET has only been used in <italic>E. coli</italic> so far. The authors provide their data in a public web-based genome browser.</p><p>The Ribo-seq data and analysis appear solid. The major finding of the study is that there appears to be pervasive, non-productive translation in Mycobacteria, where the protein itself has no function. This mirrors the extensive antisense transcription that has also been reported, which might likewise provide substrate for evolution. Such pervasive translation has been reported previously (Meydan et al. 2019 Mol Cell, Weaver et al. MBio2019, Impens et al. Nat Microbiol. 2017). However, to much lower extend. The suggested number of &gt;1000 novel ORFs seems rather high. While the topic is generally interesting, some additional analyses and experiments (see detailed comments) should be performed to validate the novel ORFS and strengthen the case for pervasive translation. Also, more discussion of how broadly this applies to bacteria (and/or higher organisms) and to put the study into context with previous reports of pervasive translation is also needed, in order to highlight novelty and strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) The introduction/discussion is rather short and appears too focused on previous work on Mycobacteria/Ribo-seq. It would be helpful to discuss also if proteomics approaches indicated pervasive translation and place the findings of this study more into context of other studies.</p><p>2) According to Figure 4C, 425 annotated ORFs were detected by ribo-RET. How many ORFs are annotated in total in Mtb and what percentage is detected? For the ones for which no TIS is found in the ribo-RET, are these not expressed under the examined conditions or why are they not captured?</p><p>3) The authors suggest that most of the novel ORFs are probably non-functional. However, they might act as regulatory elements based on translation, e.g. like attenuators or upstream ORFs Such ORFs might also be under little selection at the codon level. This should be discussed.</p><p>4) The suggested number or novel ORFs appears very high and only a small number is further validated in this study. I think it is important to provide some more evidence for them. For example, is there is any evidence from Mtb N-terminal proteomics data (Shell et al. PLOS Genet 2015) for any of these novel ORFs? This would nicely support the Ribo-seq data, even if the sensitivity allows detection of only a few.</p><p>5) Along the same lines: How many of these novel ORFs were detected in previous Ribo-seq data in M. smegmatis? Do these show hallmarks of selection at the codon level? How many are conserved in other strains? This might identify candidates for future study and strengthen the catalogue.</p><p>6) Figure 4A: What kind of start codon mutation was introduced? A stop codon? Why do the start codon mutations of the fluorescence reporters not fully abolish expression, or at least abolish expression to similar background levels for all constructs? Some of the mutations have a surprisingly small effect. Are these canonical ATG start codons? It is also unclear what is the background level (i.e. bacteria without the luciferase reporter). A positive control, i.e. an known annotated ORF and its start codon mutant, should also be included. How actively translated are these novel examples compared to annotated ORFs?</p><p>7) Figures 4B and C and S9: Some controls are missing from the Western blot validation experiments: samples from an untagged WT strain should be loaded in parallel as a control to ensure the bands are specific. Moreover, for 4C, it would be helpful to add also a start-codon mutant of Rv3709c full-length alone (to see if the smaller isoform band remains) and in combination with the start codon mutant of the isoform.</p><p>8) Figure 1 and 3: The authors show multiple times sequence coverages from ribosome profiling data. How would the sequence coverage look like for a fragmented total RNA sample as control?</p><p>9) Lines 48-50: The authors discuss library artefacts towards the 5'end. Have they tried alternative library preparation protocols to avoid that bias?</p><p>10) Can the authors show that micrococcal nuclease digestion was complete by providing gradient profiles (+/- MNase and +/- Ret). Were non-coding RNAs under-represented in the ribosome footprint libraries?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pervasive Translation in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Some concerns remain, these primarily relate to clarifying the analysis approach. In addition, the <italic>E. coli</italic> comparisons emerged repeatedly as problematic amongst reviewer comments. Please reconsider how these data are presented or interpreted. Your revision should carefully address the comments by revising the text, no wet lab experiments are necessary.</p><p>1. Reviewers felt it was difficult to evaluate whether the ribosome profiling data really support so many new translated regions in Mtb, given that so much depends on what threshold is set for including or excluding candidate sites. More discussion of the threshold used and an explanation / validation in the Results section (what exactly qualifies as an IERF?) is required.</p><p>2. Are the novel genes conserved in other mycobacterial species? As the ribo-RET data do not yet exist for these species, the authors could perform bioinformatic analyses to determine whether the ORFs in question are conserved, and if so, whether there is translation in the M. smegmatis ribo-seq data already available. Conservation or lack thereof would speak to their being functional and subject to selection.</p><p>3. Reviewers concur that the <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments are somewhat problematic. The authors could repeat the analyses in <italic>E. coli</italic> and Mtb without using prior annotations. In other words, find ORFs in each genome de novo and determine how many possible start sites have associated ribo-RET density. If indeed Mtb has pervasive translation and <italic>E. coli</italic> does not, there should be a higher fraction in Mtb with no reference to prior annotations. This analysis would make the comparison much more compelling.</p><p>4. The authors have selected 18 novel predicted ORFs for further validation using luciferase reporters. However, it remains unclear how these ORFs were selected and if they reflect high/low confidence candidates. This is important to assess how many of the &gt;1000 candidates (and pervasive translation as a take home message of this paper) are indeed bona fide ORFs or just artifacts. Or was the validation focused on examples that have strong signals in the sequencing data or those with strong conservation? Please clarify. In case the validated candidates just reflect the top candidates, it might be useful to shorten the list of pervasive ORFs to a higher confidence set, e.g. integrating 3-nt periodicity using smORFer (PMID: 34125903).</p><p>5. While start/stop codon patterns were revealed by the metagene analysis of the Ribo-seq data, it remains unclear how well they are reflected on a single gene basis. How many of the &gt;1000 ORFs have this pattern? What is the &quot;median&quot; pattern? Or is it just approximately 100 abundant bona fide sORFs that skew the plots? Single genes with abundant read coverages in Ribo-Ret can introduce artifact peaks into metagene plots.</p><p>Other points that must be addressed:</p><p>1. Line 107-109: as a possible explanation of the displacement of the start codon peak further downstream, the authors suggest that retapamulin (RET) may not trap initiating ribosomes at leaderless mRNAs. However, it appears that the samples shown in Figure 1 were not treated with RET.</p><p>2. A leaderless mRNA should give a 15 nt ribosome footprint that would likely be missed in the study. This footprint size was confirmed by Sawyer 2021. Please show the footprint length distribution of the libraries in the supplemental information. It is puzzling why there are peaks of density 25-35 downstream of leaderless start codons. Please explain.</p><p>3. Can the Mtb ribo-seq data from Sawyer 2021 be used to validate expression of the novel ORFs described here?</p><p>4. Line 183: 1,994 IERFS. What is the threshold for the authors to call these as significant? Add one or two lines about this in the Results section. Why is this a reasonable threshold? Much depends on this seemingly arbitrary cutoff.</p><p>5. The RNA secondary structural analyses in Figure 3B – does this include all IERFs? Perhaps it should be separated in leadered vs leaderless. The region included in the RNA folding would be different, given that leaderless mRNAs have no upstream mRNA. Leaderless initiation is very sensitive to RNA structure (Bharmal, NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, September 2021).</p><p>6. Figure 5: Perhaps there would be value in showing violin plots with the distribution of ribosome density (rpkm) and perhaps translational efficiency (ribo-seq / RNA-seq) for each gene.</p><p>7. 44 proteins expressed from novel ORFs were confirmed by MS analyses. Is there anything that these proteins have in common (biochemical similarities, high expression levels, etc) that would explain why these were detectable, but the vast majority of the new proteins were not detectable? More information about these 44 new proteins would be useful. The primary data with the y and b ion series for the three peptides confirmed by MS/MS (with synthetic standards) represent a quality control issue that could be moved to the supplementary materials.</p><p>8. Lines 76-79: Please be more specific here. It is unclear what means &quot;large numbers&quot; and &quot;many sites&quot;. 10, 100, 1000?</p><p>9. Line 85: It would be helpful to indicate the genome size and total number of annotated genes at the start of this section.</p><p>10. Can the authors comment on whether they have detected any dual function sRNAs (sRNA encoding a sORF) in their data?</p><p>11. Lines 463-465: It feels that up to 10% spurious translation could be quite significant and detrimental to the cell. Can the authors comment on/clarify, what would be the cutoff for the definition of &quot;pervasive&quot;? 1%? 10%? 50%?</p><p>12. How are leaderless transcripts defined in this manuscript? Can leaderless also not include mRNAs with very short 5'UTRs (1-3 nt) and no Shine-Dalgarno? Does the data suggest that a 5'-end AUG/GTG etc is a requirement for leaderless initiation? Or could it also initiate 1-2nt downstream of the TSS/5'-end?</p><p>13. Please clarify what is an IERF vs an ORF? Sometimes it is not clear if the authors are requiring that an EIRF also be associated with an in-frame stop codon? Perhaps mention also that some of the detected IERFs could be due to resistance to MNase digestion?</p><p>14. Line 259: &quot;Novel ORFs tend to be weakly expressed but efficiently translated&quot; – this seems a bit confusing or conflicting. Would it be better to say weakly &quot;transcribed&quot;?</p><p>15. Lines 102-103 – &quot;attributable to sequence biases associated with library preparation&quot;. Can the authors be more specific here? Why would library preparation biases be more prevalent at start and stop codons?</p><p>16. Lines 85-86: Simply having an RUG at the 5' position does not usually result in annotation of a leaderless gene as it also requires an in-frame stop codon. Was an RUG the only requirement in these studies? Or an RUG associated with an ORF? Please clarify.</p><p>17.

The data appear to be high quality, and importantly, they make use of the antibiotic retapamulin to trap newly initiated 70S ribosomes at start codons (while allowing elongating ribosomes to run-off transcripts), defining many new sites of translational initiation genome-wide. There are a stunning number of novel translated regions, more than the number of annotated genes whose translation can be detected in their experiments. The authors argue that pervasive translation occurs throughout the Mtb transcriptome.</p><p>It is difficult to evaluate whether the ribosome profiling data really support so many new translated regions in Mtb, given that so much depends on what threshold they set for including or excluding candidate sites. I would like to see more discussion of the threshold used and an explanation / validation in the Results section (what exactly qualifies as an IERF?). But I recognize that ribo-seq and retapamulin have been used in previous studies in <italic>E. coli</italic>, confirming the validity of the approach. And the authors argue that their novel initiation sites show enrichment of SD sequences upstream of the start codon, lower local mRNA structure, and levels of ribosome density and translational efficiency similar to known annotated genes. Furthermore, some fraction of these novel proteins can be detected by MS experiments. Together, I find these arguments compelling.</p><p>1) Are the novel genes conserved in other mycobacterial species?

This is problematic because the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome is arguably the best annotated genome after decades of studies. And it may be that a smaller fraction of annotated genes are expressed in Mtb under standard lab conditions than in <italic>E. coli</italic> under different lab conditions. Finally, it is not clear that the methods used to decide what counts as a novel start site are the same in this study and the <italic>E. coli</italic> study. I propose that with the <italic>E. coli</italic> data from Meyden 2019, the authors use exactly the same metrics for calling start sites to repeat the analyses in <italic>E. coli</italic> and Mtb without using prior annotations. In other words, find ORFs in each genome de novo and determine how many possible start sites have associated ribo-RET density.

Ribo-seq and Ribo-Ret in Mtb surprisingly provided evidence for the translation of &gt;1000 novel ORFs, many of which were short. In their resubmitted manuscript, the authors have carefully addressed the previous comments of the three reviewers and have added further data (e.g. additional reporter fusions and mass spectrometry-based detection of small proteins) to further support their conclusions about pervasive translation in Mycobacteria and validation on novel ORFs. Global analysis of Ribo-seq patterns at the start and stop codons, translation efficiency, as well as the newly included small protein-targeted proteomics and GC skew, supported that many of these novel ORFs are bona fide, translated ORFs. Validation of selected translation initiation regions by luciferase translational fusions and ORFs by C-terminal FLAG-tagging/western blotting support the global data. A focus is placed on leaderless ORFs, which are especially prevalent in Mtb. The authors' analysis of novel ORF conservation suggests that most of the novel ORFs are not under purifying selection, making it unclear if they have a function in Mtb. Based on this, the authors propose that Mtb experiences pervasive, apparently non-productive, translation, as has been described previously for bacterial transcriptomes.</p><p>Ribo-seq is a powerful method for monitoring translation and detection of novel ORFs. Its derivative, Ribo-Ret, has not yet been applied to many prokaryotes and is not trivial to establish or analyze. The analysis methods established and presented in this study are of interest to others applying the technique to diverse prokaryotes to overall increase confidence in Ribo-seq-predicted ORFs. Furthermore, the detected, conserved sORFs serve as a resource for the Mtb and small protein communities, and it is highly appreciated that the data has been made readily available in a browser. Compared to <italic>E. coli</italic>, Mtb is a high-GC organism with a unique genomic structure. The idea of pervasive translation is fairly new in prokaryotes, and the study has implications for exploring how genes arise.</p><p>Overall, this is an important study with careful analysis of the data, considerable validation, and careful response to reviewers' comments.

However, these represented a relatively small minority of the total number of ORFs identified, as we now discuss in the manuscript. In other words, the large majority of ORFs identified by Ribo-RET in <italic>E. coli</italic> are annotated genes. By contrast, we detected more unannotated ORFs than annotated ORFs in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.

Hence, we previously performed rigorous analytical and experimental follow-up work showing that (i) putative sites of translation initiation identified by Ribo-RET are far more frequently associated with likely start codons than expected by chance, (ii) novel start codons are associated with Shine-Dalgarno sequences, (iii) novel start codons are associated with reduced RNA secondary structure, (iv) novel start and stop codons have enriched ribosome density in Ribo-seq data, similar to that observed for annotated ORFs, (v) regions around novel and isoform start codons drive translation in a luciferase reporter construct, and (vi) two selected novel ORFs and two selected isoform ORFs are supported by western blot data. As the reviewer notes, these data do not assign confidence scores to individual ORFs, but rather demonstrate a pattern of pervasive translation. We now provide additional support for individual novel ORFs in the form of mass spectrometry data.</p><p>To further address the reviewer’s concern, we have determined the ribosome density across novel ORF transcripts by normalizing Ribo-seq coverage to RNA-seq coverage, a common measure of relative ribosome occupancy. Normalizing to RNA-seq data accounts for the large variability in RNA levels for the set of novel ORFs; thus, low Ribo-seq signal could reflect efficient translation of an RNA that is of low abundance. We limited our analysis to the regions of novel ORFs that do not overlap an annotated ORF on the same strand, including an additional 30 nt at either end of annotated ORFs to account for the footprints of initiating/terminating ribosomes that extend beyond the ORF boundaries. It is important to note that the novel ORFs analyzed are likely a biased set, enriched for ORFs located antisense to annotated genes; however, avoiding overlap with annotated genes is essential to interpret these data. For the remaining 871 novel ORFs, some represented in full and others represented only partially, RNA-seq and Ribo-seq coverage tends to be lower than for annotated ORFs, but ribosome density per transcript is only slightly reduced. Moreover, ribosome density per transcript tends to be much higher for novel ORFs than for a set of control non-coding transcripts selected based on transcription start site data for regions not close to ORFs. Thus, our data clearly show that most of the novel ORF transcripts are robustly translated, even if many are weakly expressed. These analyses are included as a new figure and supplementary figure (Figure 5, and Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1). We have also added normalized ribosome density measurements for individual ORFs to Supplementary Tables 1 and 3; we anticipate that readers will use these numbers to assign confidence to individual ORF calls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For ORFs inside annotated genes, the signal at the novel start site should be compared to the signal at the annotated start site (or perhaps the ribosome density across the gene in untreated cells) and only if the novel start site signal is above some ratio should it be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>It is impossible to assign Ribo-seq or RNA-seq signal to a single ORF if it overlaps another ORF.

A very small amount of sequence upstream of the start sites candidate genes was integrated into a different organism with a constant promoter. This means that other things that are essential for translation (transcription of that region, mRNA structure at the start site) are not taken into account. It is not surprising that start codons will initiate translation of a reporter gene if driven by a decent promoter. The question is whether or not this happens in the native genome. Validation should be done by adding an epitope tag to the 3'-end of the ORF in the native genome. I recognize that this is a lot to ask in an organism that is BSL3 with such a slow growth rate. But the strategy shown in Figure 4 doesn't work.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation of the nLuc reporter fusion data is that the selected sequences <italic>can</italic> function as ribosome binding sites; we have added text to note that the sequences are not in their native context.</p><p>We agree that the optimal version of the western blot experiment would be to introduce epitope tags at the native locus in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. However, this is technically challenging and would take ~6 months.

We used a strong promoter to rule out the possibility that an <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> promoter might be transcriptionally inactive in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. We disagree that any potential start codon would be efficiently translated if it were located within a well-transcribed RNA; our Ribo-RET and Ribo-seq data clearly show that this is not the case. We also note that for the isoform ORFs, the overlapping ORF serves as an internal control for the western blot that accounts for transcript levels. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer’s assertion that many sequences could function as start codons if present in an RNA, and indeed we believe this is the basis for the pervasive translation we observe.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we have used mass spectrometry to identify proteins translated from the novel ORFs.

The authors map elongating and initiating (via Retapamulin treatment, which stalls initiation complexes, &quot;ribo-RET&quot;) ribosomes on mRNAs by deep sequencing. This provides empirical evidence for translated ORFs (annotated or novel), including those within coding regions via Retapamulin-based identification of internal initiation sites. Based on genome-wide analysis of this data, the authors suggest ~1000 novel translated ORFs with high confidence and even more with lower confidence. Some of the novel ORFs, including isoforms of annotated genes or novel ORFs, are validated based on luciferase reporters or Western blots analysis of FLAG-tagged variants of the WT sequences or start-codon mutants. Finally, codon analysis suggests that most of the novel ORFs are likely non-functional as they do not show signatures of purifying selection. The study also provides a resource of novel ORFs that could be studied for functions in TB physiology. This includes small proteins, which are underrepresented in genome annotations, as well as functional studies. This is the first Ribo-seq study of Mtb, and ribo-RET has only been used in <italic>E. coli</italic> so far. The authors provide their data in a public web-based genome browser.</p><p>The Ribo-seq data and analysis appear solid. The major finding of the study is that there appears to be pervasive, non-productive translation in Mycobacteria, where the protein itself has no function. This mirrors the extensive antisense transcription that has also been reported, which might likewise provide substrate for evolution. Such pervasive translation has been reported previously (Meydan et al. 2019 Mol Cell, Weaver et al. MBio2019, Impens et al. Nat Microbiol. 2017). However, to much lower extend. The suggested number of &gt;1000 novel ORFs seems rather high. While the topic is generally interesting, some additional analyses and experiments (see detailed comments) should be performed to validate the novel ORFS and strengthen the case for pervasive translation. Also, more discussion of how broadly this applies to bacteria (and/or higher organisms) and to put the study into context with previous reports of pervasive translation is also needed, in order to highlight novelty and strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new controls and a new mass spectrometry experiment that strengthen the case for pervasive translation in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The introduction/discussion is rather short and appears too focused on previous work on Mycobacteria/Ribo-seq. It would be helpful to discuss also if proteomics approaches indicated pervasive translation and place the findings of this study more into context of other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have greatly expanded the Discussion, and we have added text comparing our work to other related studies. In the new section of the Results that describes proteomic data, we discuss the limitations of standard techniques that greatly limit the number of small proteins that can be detected. For these reasons, we have chosen not to compare our work to proteomic studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to Figure 4C, 425 annotated ORFs were detected by ribo-RET. How many ORFs are annotated in total in Mtb and what percentage is detected? For the ones for which no TIS is found in the ribo-RET, are these not expressed under the examined conditions or why are they not captured?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that most of the novel ORFs are probably non-functional. However, they might act as regulatory elements based on translation, e.g. like attenuators or upstream ORFs Such ORFs might also be under little selection at the codon level. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section on this topic in the Discussion. uORFs might have atypical codon usage because they are embedded within an RNA structure that is conserved because they are involved in regulation, and/or because rare codons participate in regulation. To investigate this question, we have now looked at codon usage in a set of six previously described regulatory uORFs that are enriched in cysteine codons. Only one of the individual uORFs has significant G/C skew (Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the group of ORFs as a whole does not have significant G/C skew; this is despite strong evidence that these are conserved, regulatory uORFs. We repeated the analysis after removing the cysteine codons, reasoning that they are likely essential for the uORF regulatory functions, and they are expected to reduce G/C skew. Indeed, removing the cysteine codons increased the G/C skew for all ORFs, and the G/C skew for the set of uORFs as a group was much higher, and statistically significant (Fisher’s exact test <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). We now discuss the implications of this analysis for the full set of novel ORFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The suggested number or novel ORFs appears very high and only a small number is further validated in this study. I think it is important to provide some more evidence for them. For example, is there is any evidence from Mtb N-terminal proteomics data (Shell et al. PLOS Genet 2015) for any of these novel ORFs? This would nicely support the Ribo-seq data, even if the sensitivity allows detection of only a few.</p></disp-quote><p>See comments in response to Reviewer 1. In short, we believe the Ribo-seq data provide very strong evidence that the majority of novel ORFs are robustly translated. Nonetheless, we have added mass spectrometry data as suggested, providing independent experimental support for 44 novel ORFs. We note that the small size of most of the novel ORFs makes them difficult to detect using standard proteomic approaches, which are biased strongly against small proteins. We attempted to enrich for small proteins, but this clearly requires further optimization. We have also determined the ribosome density per transcript for many of the novel ORFs; these data further support the idea that the novel ORFs are efficiently translated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along the same lines: How many of these novel ORFs were detected in previous Ribo-seq data in M. smegmatis? Do these show hallmarks of selection at the codon level? How many are conserved in other strains? This might identify candidates for future study and strengthen the catalogue.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the question of whether novel ORFs are functional, we have ranked non-overlapping novel ORFs by their G/C-skew, highlighting ORFs that are likely under purifying selection. Thus, we identify ~90 likely functional novel ORFs. Comparison to data from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is confounded by the difficulty in identifying novel ORFs from standard Ribo-seq data. We plan to address this in a future manuscript that includes Ribo-RET data for <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4A: What kind of start codon mutation was introduced? A stop codon? Why do the start codon mutations of the fluorescence reporters not fully abolish expression, or at least abolish expression to similar background levels for all constructs? Some of the mutations have a surprisingly small effect. Are these canonical ATG start codons? It is also unclear what is the background level (i.e. bacteria without the luciferase reporter). A positive control, i.e. an known annotated ORF and its start codon mutant, should also be included. How actively translated are these novel examples compared to annotated ORFs?</p></disp-quote><p>The start codons were mutated to RCG. The luciferase assay data are plotted on a log scale, so the effect of mutating the start codon in each case is large. Nonetheless, most of the mutant constructs retain some activity. Interestingly, we observed the same phenomenon when investigating novel ORFs in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where we integrated the luciferase reporter at the native chromosomal locus (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.02.450978v2). We speculate that there are alternative internal start codons, or that non-canonical start codon sequences can be used, as described for <italic>E. coli</italic> (PMID 28334756). As a control, we have included sequences for three annotated ORF; these behave similarly to the other reporters, giving us confidence in our conclusion that the novel/isoform RBSs are functional.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figures 4B and C and S9: Some controls are missing from the Western blot validation experiments: samples from an untagged WT strain should be loaded in parallel as a control to ensure the bands are specific. Moreover, for 4C, it would be helpful to add also a start-codon mutant of Rv3709c full-length alone (to see if the smaller isoform band remains) and in combination with the start codon mutant of the isoform.</p></disp-quote><p>The start codon mutants serve as a control, and the blots looking at different proteins, all of which use the same epitope tag, control for each other when detecting non-specific bands. For isoform ORFs, we did not mutate the start codon of the full-length gene because this would likely lead to premature Rho-dependent transcription termination upstream of the isoform start codon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 1 and 3: The authors show multiple times sequence coverages from ribosome profiling data. How would the sequence coverage look like for a fragmented total RNA sample as control?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this control dataset, which does not show enrichment 15/12 nt downstream of start/stop codons (Figure 4, Figure Supplement 1B-D). We do observe the artifactual signal precisely at start/stop codons that we attribute to imprecise sequence read alignment due to these libraries being made by polyadenylation of RNA fragments. We have also included a control analysis of mock ORFs (Figure 4, Figure Supplement 1A). Specifically, we identified mock ORFs whose stop codons do not match any annotated ORF or any ORF we identified by Ribo-RET. We limited the set of mock ORFs to those found in regions that are detectably transcribed. We do not observe Ribo-seq signal enrichment 15/12 nt downstream of the start/stop codons of the mock ORFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Lines 48-50: The authors discuss library artefacts towards the 5'end. Have they tried alternative library preparation protocols to avoid that bias?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not, but our data suggest that this would be a good idea for any groups applying Ribo-seq methods to bacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Can the authors show that micrococcal nuclease digestion was complete by providing gradient profiles (+/- MNase and +/- Ret). Were non-coding RNAs under-represented in the ribosome footprint libraries?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have gradient profiles for the samples used for Ribo-RET and Ribo-seq. However, the clear enrichment of ribosome occupancy at start and stop codons shows that MNase processing was sufficient. Non-coding RNAs are strongly under-represented in the Ribo-seq data relative to RNA-seq, as now indicated in Figure 5 and Figure 5, Figure Supplement 1 (new figures).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers felt that the current submission has been substantively improved. Some concerns remain, these primarily relate to clarifying the analysis approach. In addition, the <italic>E. coli</italic> comparisons emerged repeatedly as problematic amongst reviewer comments. Please reconsider how these data are presented or interpreted. Your revision should carefully address the comments by revising the text, no wet lab experiments are necessary.</p><p>1. Reviewers felt it was difficult to evaluate whether the ribosome profiling data really support so many new translated regions in Mtb, given that so much depends on what threshold is set for including or excluding candidate sites. More discussion of the threshold used and an explanation / validation in the Results section (what exactly qualifies as an IERF?) is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the details for IERF identification to the relevant part of the Results. The most important parameter in identifying IERFs is the minimum read coverage in the Ribo-RET data. The value we chose (5.5 reads per million) is arbitrary; a higher value would identify fewer IERFs and hence fewer ORFs, but with a lower FDR. We tried to strike a balance between detecting more translated ORFs and keeping the FDR low. We do not believe that there is a defined set of translated ORFs; rather, there is a continuum of expression levels for all possible ORFs, such that a lower threshold of discovery or a more sensitive approach will identify more translated ORFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Are the novel genes conserved in other mycobacterial species? As the ribo-RET data do not yet exist for these species, the authors could perform bioinformatic analyses to determine whether the ORFs in question are conserved, and if so, whether there is translation in the M. smegmatis ribo-seq data already available. Conservation or lack thereof would speak to their being functional and subject to selection.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and important question, but we believe it is beyond the scope of the current study. tBLASTn analysis reveals potential homologues for &gt;100 non-overlapping, novel ORFs, with only about a third of these having significant G/C-skew. However, a more sophisticated analysis is required to determine whether conservation is due to selective pressure on the ORF itself or overlapping sequence features. This is something we are working on for a future publication. Similarly, we have generated Ribo-RET data for <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> to identify novel ORFs. Comparison of the <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> datasets will be the subject of a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Reviewers concur that the E. coli experiments are somewhat problematic. The authors could repeat the analyses in E. coli and Mtb without using prior annotations. In other words, find ORFs in each genome de novo and determine how many possible start sites have associated ribo-RET density. If indeed Mtb has pervasive translation and <italic>E. coli</italic> does not, there should be a higher fraction in Mtb with no reference to prior annotations. This analysis would make the comparison much more compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have chosen to remove the text suggesting that <italic>Mtb</italic> has a larger proportion of translation dedicated to novel ORFs than <italic>E. coli</italic>. While our data suggest that this is the case, there are enough technical differences between the studies of the two species that we do not feel we can make this claim with sufficient confidence, even if we were to analyze the data using the same pipeline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4a. The authors have selected 18 novel predicted ORFs for further validation using luciferase reporters. However, it remains unclear how these ORFs were selected and if they reflect high/low confidence candidates. This is important to assess how many of the &gt;1000 candidates (and pervasive translation as a take home message of this paper) are indeed bona fide ORFs or just artifacts. Or was the validation focused on examples that have strong signals in the sequencing data or those with strong conservation? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>They are all from the top 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of Ribo-RET scores, but they cover a broad range of values for ribosome density per transcript (median percentile rank of 37 for the 8 ORFs that could be assessed in non-overlapping regions). We have added these details to the text in the Results section. We believe the MS data provide a much better assessment of the novel ORFs identified by Ribo-RET. Hence, we have moved the luciferase assay data and the western blot data to the supplement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4b. In case the validated candidates just reflect the top candidates, it might be useful to shorten the list of pervasive ORFs to a higher confidence set, e.g. integrating 3-nt periodicity using smORFer (PMID: 34125903).</p></disp-quote><p>There is strong evidence from our data and from published <italic>E. coli</italic> Ribo-seq data (PMID 27924019) that the 3 nt periodicity in bacterial Ribo-seq data is due to sequence biases within codons (e.g. G/C-skew), and does not reflect the codon-by-codon movement of ribosomes across ORFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While start/stop codon patterns were revealed by the metagene analysis of the Ribo-seq data, it remains unclear how well they are reflected on a single gene basis. How many of the &gt;1000 ORFs have this pattern? What is the &quot;median&quot; pattern? Or is it just approximately 100 abundant bona fide sORFs that skew the plots? Single genes with abundant read coverages in Ribo-Ret can introduce artifact peaks into metagene plots.</p></disp-quote><p>For each ORF that contributes data to the metagene plots, values are normalized to the maximum value in the analyzed region. Thus, all ORFs are contribute equally; no single ORF can dominate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points that must be addressed:</p><p>1. Line 107-109: as a possible explanation of the displacement of the start codon peak further downstream, the authors suggest that retapamulin (RET) may not trap initiating ribosomes at leaderless mRNAs. However, it appears that the samples shown in Figure 1 were not treated with RET.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence refers to Ribo-seq data without drug treatment. We observe an enrichment of signal 15 nt downstream of leadered ORF start codons even without RET treatment, albeit to a lesser degree (e.g. Figure 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A leaderless mRNA should give a 15 nt ribosome footprint that would likely be missed in the study. This footprint size was confirmed by Sawyer 2021. Please show the footprint length distribution of the libraries in the supplemental information. It is puzzling why there are peaks of density 25-35 downstream of leaderless start codons. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have chosen not to make a plot of the distribution of sequence read lengths because it is the mappable sequence reads that count, and the standard read-mapping tools ignore very short reads. We note that Sawyer <italic>et al.</italic> showed similar sequence read coverage around leaderless start codons as our data. We agree that the peak of ribosome footprint 3’ density 25-30 nt downstream of leaderless start codons is an interesting observation, but it is one that we cannot explain. We presume it reflects the fundamentally different mechanism of leaderless translation initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the Mtb ribo-seq data from Sawyer 2021 be used to validate expression of the novel ORFs described here?</p></disp-quote><p>Ribo-seq data from the Sawyer <italic>et al.</italic> study have substantially lower enrichment of signal downstream of start and stop codons, likely because cells were treated with chloramphenicol before harvesting. Hence, these data are not as useful for validating the novel ORF calls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 183: 1,994 IERFS. What is the threshold for the authors to call these as significant? Add one or two lines about this in the Results section. Why is this a reasonable threshold? Much depends on this seemingly arbitrary cutoff.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to major comment #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The RNA secondary structural analyses in Figure 3B – does this include all IERFs? Perhaps it should be separated in leadered vs leaderless. The region included in the RNA folding would be different, given that leaderless mRNAs have no upstream mRNA. Leaderless initiation is very sensitive to RNA structure (Bharmal, NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, September 2021).</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis only considers leadered ORFs. Since the leaderless ORFs were inferred based on transcription start site data, there is no expectation that the secondary structure at the start of these RNAs will be lower than that of random sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Is there anything that these proteins have in common (biochemical similarities, high expression levels, etc) that would explain why these were detectable, but the vast majority of the new proteins were not detectable? More information about these 44 new proteins would be useful. The primary data with the y and b ion series for the three peptides confirmed by MS/MS (with synthetic standards) represent a quality control issue that could be moved to the supplementary materials.</p></disp-quote><p>The y and b ion series data are important to show that the peptides we detected from cell lysates were correctly assigned to their corresponding proteins. We did not identify any features strongly enriched in the proteins we validated by MS, although the proteins we detected by MS tend to be associated with ORFs with higher ribosome occupancy per transcript than ORFs associated with MS-undetected proteins (Mann-Whitney U Test <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).

How are leaderless transcripts defined in this manuscript? Can leaderless also not include mRNAs with very short 5'UTRs (1-3 nt) and no Shine-Dalgarno?

The effect of very short 5’ UTRs on leaderless translation in mycobacteria will be the subject of a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Please clarify what is an IERF vs an ORF? Sometimes it is not clear if the authors are requiring that an EIRF also be associated with an in-frame stop codon? Perhaps mention also that some of the detected IERFs could be due to resistance to MNase digestion?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in more detail in our response to major comment #1, we have added text to the Results to clarify how IERFs were identified. In brief, an IERF is a site of enrichment in the Ribo-RET data. Most IERFs correspond to a site of translation initiation, but ~30% were not assigned to an ORF, likely for a variety of reasons, e.g. the ORF uses a non-canonical start codon, the spacing between the start codon and the enriched Ribo-RET signal does not fall within the range we required, the Ribo-RET signal is not due to ribosome occupancy but rather to association with another large complex, the Ribo-RET signal is due to ribosomes stalled for a reason other than being trapped at a start codon. Without more data, we are reluctant to comment in the manuscript on specific reasons why some IERFs are not associated with expected start codons at expected positions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Line 259: &quot;Novel ORFs tend to be weakly expressed but efficiently translated&quot; – this seems a bit confusing or conflicting. Would it be better to say weakly &quot;transcribed&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “expressed” to “transcribed”, as suggested. We previously used “expressed” because we wanted to include the possibility that RNA stability contributes to the RNA level, but we are comfortable saying transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Lines 102-103 – &quot;attributable to sequence biases associated with library preparation&quot;. Can the authors be more specific here? Why would library preparation biases be more prevalent at start and stop codons?</p></disp-quote><p>The MNase bias is the same everywhere, but start codons always have a “T” at the second position, and stop codons always have a “T” at the first position, so the bias lines up across all ORFs. The same effect would be observed if metagene plots were made for any specific nucleotide sequence, e.g. all AAT codons. We have added some text to clarify this point: “We note that there are also smaller peaks and troughs of Ribo-seq signal precisely at start and stop codons, likely attributable to sequence biases associated with library preparation that are highlighted when similar sequences (e.g. start/stop codons) are aligned”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Lines 85-86: Simply having an RUG at the 5' position does not usually result in annotation of a leaderless gene as it also requires an in-frame stop codon.

Every RUG will have an in-frame stop somewhere downstream. The 1,285 transcripts referred to are those that begin with RUG. If a 5’ RUG is sufficient for leaderless translation, the locations of leaderless ORFs can be inferred from the positions of the transcription start sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17.
