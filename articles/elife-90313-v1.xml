Many studies have reported impaired BM perception in autism spectrum disorder, which is characterised by deficits in social interaction. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often exhibit similar difficulties in social interaction. However, few studies have investigated BM perception in children with ADHD. Here, we compared differences in the ability to process local kinematic and global configurational cues, two fundamental abilities of BM perception, between typically developing and ADHD children. We further investigated the relationship between BM perception and social interaction skills measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and examined the contributions of latent factors (e.g. sex, age, attention, and intelligence) to BM perception. The results revealed that children with ADHD exhibited atypical BM perception. Local and global BM processing showed distinct features. Local BM processing ability was related to social interaction skills, whereas global BM processing ability significantly improved with age. Critically, general BM perception (i.e. both local and global BM processing) may be affected by sustained attentional ability in children with ADHD. This relationship was primarily mediated by reasoning intelligence. These findings elucidate atypical BM perception in ADHD and the latent factors related to BM perception. Moreover, this study provides new evidence that BM perception is a hallmark of social cognition and advances our understanding of the potential roles of local and global processing in BM perception and social cognitive disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual search</kwd><kwd>visual perception</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>developmental disorder</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>RDoC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z181100001518005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021ZD0203800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31830037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Interdisciplinary Innovation Team</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCTD-2021-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Children with ADHD exhibit atypical biological motion perception, with local processing related to social interaction skills and global processing showing age-related improvement.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ADHD is a common developmental disorder with a prevalence ranging from 2 to 7% in children and adolescents, averaging approximately 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sayal et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the well-established core symptoms of ADHD (including the inability to sustain attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity), some characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such as dysfunction in social communication and social interaction, have also been frequently observed in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzadzinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mulligan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reiersen et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, experimental studies focusing on social cognition in children with ADHD are limited. Some studies have reported poor performance on social cognition tasks. Among these, impaired theory of mind (ToM) and emotion recognition are the most frequently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bora and Pantelis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nejati, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uekermann et al., 2010</xref>). It is difficult for children with ADHD to recognize the emotions and intentions of others. However, our understanding of other social cognitive processes in ADHD remains limited. Further exploration of a diverse range of social cognitions (e.g. biological motion perception) can provide a fresh perspective on the impaired social function observed in ADHD. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that social cognition in ADHD may vary depending on different factors at the cognitive, pathological, or developmental levels, such as general cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bora and Pantelis, 2016</xref>), symptom severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKay et al., 2023</xref>), or age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bora and Pantelis, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, understanding how these factors relate to social cognitive dysfunction in ADHD is still in its infancy. Bridging this gap is crucial as it can help depict the developmental trajectory of social cognition and identify effective interventions for impaired social interaction in individuals with ADHD.</p><p>BM, which refers to the movement of a living creature, conveys a wealth of information beyond bodily movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dittrich, 1993</xref>), such as intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pavlova, 2012</xref>), emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2005</xref>), sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kozlowski and Cutting, 1977</xref>), and identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jokisch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loula et al., 2005</xref>). The advent of point-light display (PLD) technology, which is used to depict human motions, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johansson, 1973</xref>) allows researchers to separate biological motion from other characteristics such as shape and colour. Considering its seminal impact on cognitive, developmental, and clinical neuroscience, BM perception has drawn significant attention from scientists. Some researchers have attempted to deconstruct BM processing into more specific components. Our study concentrated on two fundamental abilities involved in processing BM cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): the ability to process local BM cues derived from major joint motion tracks, and the ability to process global BM cues of human configuration. Previous studies revealed differences between local and global BM perception. Separate neural signals for these abilities imply two independent BM processing stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duarte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jastorff and Orban, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vangeneugden et al., 2014</xref>). Local BM cues not only help identify locomotive direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Troje and Westhoff, 2006</xref>) but also contribute to the detection of life in a visual environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Troje, 2008</xref>) without the observersâ explicit recognition or attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertenthal and Pinto, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Troje, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Troje, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, the processing of local BM cues is less affected by attention, relatively robust to masking noise, and does not show a learning trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Troje, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, global BM processing involves top-down modulation, with attention playing a critical role in its perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson and Parasuraman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton et al., 2002</xref>). Dispersed attention adversely affects performance. Compared with local BM processing, global BM processing is susceptible to learning and is heavily hindered by increased mask densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton et al., 2002</xref>). These findings suggest that local and global mechanisms play different roles in BM perception, although the exact mechanism underlying this distinction remains unclear. Exploring these two components of BM perception will enhance our understanding of the differences between local and global BM processing and shed light on the psychological processes involved in atypical BM perception.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of biological motion (BM) and scrambled BM sequence.</title><p>Intact walker contains information of local kinematics and global configuration.

This is because BM perception is considered a hallmark of social cognition. Individuals with deficits in BM processing exhibit worse social perception in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pavlova, 2012</xref>). Another study found that participantsâ ability to process BM cues correlated with their autistic traits, particularly in the subdimension of social communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, examining BM perception could enhance our understanding of social dysfunction in children with ADHD. Compared with the numerous studies examining impaired BM perception in ASD, few studies have focused on BM perception in children with ADHD. An EEG study found neuroelectrophysiological changes in the processing of BM stimuli in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">KrÃ¶ger et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, compared with the typically developing (TD) group, children with ADHD showed reduced activity of motion-sensitive components (N200) while watching biological and scrambled motions, although no behavioural differences were observed. Another study found that children with ADHD performed worse in BM detection with moderate noise ratios than the TD group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Imanipour et al., 2021</xref>). This finding may be due to the fact that BM stimuli with noise dots will increase the difficulty of identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McKay et al., 2012</xref>), which highlights the difference in BM processing between TD and ADHD groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">KrÃ¶ger et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite initial findings about atypical BM perception in ADHD, previous studies on ADHD treated BM perception as a single entity, which may have led to misleading or inconsistent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Federici et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, it is essential to deconstruct BM processing into multiple components and motion features. To enhance our understanding of the ability to process distinct BM cues in ADHD, we employed a carefully designed behavioural paradigm, as used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), with slight adjustments made to adapt it for children. This paradigm comprised three tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): BM-Local, BM-Global, and BM-General. BM-Local assessed the ability to process local BM cues. Scrambled BM sequences were displayed and the participants used local BM cues to judge the direction the scrambled walker was facing. BM-Global tested the ability to process the global configuration cues of the BM walker. Local cues were uninformative, and the participants used global BM cues to determine the presence of an intact walker. BM-General tested participantsâ ability to process general BM cues (local +global cues). The stimulus sequences consisted of an intact walker and a mask containing similar target local cues so that the participants could use general BM cues to judge the direction the walker was facing.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the trial sequence.</title><p>In biological motion (BM)-Local, a monitor displayed scrambled BM sequences. Participants only judged the facing direction of the scrambled walker using local BM cues. In BM-Global, each trial only showed an intact or scrambled walker (black dots in the figure) embedded within a mask containing local BM cues. Because the two conditions contained the same local cues that were also present in the mask, the participant must rely on global BM cues to determine whether an intact walker was present in the mask. The figure shows one of five possible directions the intact walker could face (i.e. facing participants). In BM-General, the stimuli sequence consisted of an intact walker (black dots) and a mask containing similar target local cues, and children judged the direction the walker was facing using general BM cues (local +global). Dots in the figure are rendered in black for better illustration but were displayed in white in the actual experiments.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90313-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Experiment 1 examined three specific BM perception abilities in children with ADHD. Children with ADHD show impaired social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grzadzinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mulligan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reiersen et al., 2007</xref>), which implies atypical social cognition. Therefore, we speculated that children with ADHD would perform worse on the three tasks than TD children. In Experiment 2, we further explored the relationship between BM perception and social interaction ability in children with ADHD and identified potential factors (e.g. intelligence quotient [IQ], age, and attention) that may affect BM perception in this population. We speculated that if the mechanisms of processing local and global BM cues are indeed distinct, as suggested by previous studies, then impairment in the ADHD population and the influential factors behind the impairment may be different.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Children with ADHD exhibit atypical BM perception</title><p>Thirty-six TD children (age = 9.09 Â± 2.18, 14 male) and 39 children with ADHD (age = 9.88Â±2.23, 28 male) participated in Experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

To better understand their role in atypical BM processing, we examined the relationship between BM task performance and factors such as age, full-scale intellectual quotient (FIQ), and attention function in the ADHD group. Children with ADHD in Experiments 1 and 2 completed the QB test for assessing attention function (see Materials and methods). Data from the ADHD group in both Experiments 1 and 2 were integrated, resulting in 80 ADHD participants (one child did not complete the QB test). Three linear models were built to investigate the contributing factors: (a) <italic>ACC<sub>BM-Local</sub> = Î²<sub>0</sub> + Î²<sub>1</sub> * age + Î²<sub>2</sub> * gender + Î²<sub>3</sub> * FIQ + Î²<sub>4</sub> * QbInattention</italic>, (b) <italic>ACC<sub>BM-Global</sub> = Î²<sub>0</sub> + Î²<sub>1</sub> * age + Î²<sub>2</sub> * gender + Î²<sub>3</sub> * FIQ + Î²<sub>4</sub> * QbInattention</italic>, and (c) <italic>ACC<sub>BM-General</sub> = Î²<sub>0</sub> + Î²<sub>1</sub> * age + Î²<sub>2</sub> * gender + Î²<sub>3</sub> * FIQ + Î²<sub>4</sub> * QbInattention + Î²<sub>5</sub> * ACC<sub>BM-Local</sub> + Î²<sub>6</sub> * ACC<sub>BM-Global</sub>.

We screened the factors with the largest contribution to the models using stepwise regression. In model (a), no variable remained after stepwise regression, suggesting that local BM processing remained stable with age and was not affected by attention or IQ. In model (b), the ability to process global BM cues was enhanced with age (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>1</sub></italic>=0.251, p=0.025). In model (c), higher FIQ, particularly on the subdimension of Perceptual Reasoning (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>3</sub></italic>=0.271, p=0.005), and better performance in global BM processing (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>6</sub></italic>=0.290, p=0.004) predicted better performance in general BM processing. Furthermore, as children aged, the ability to probe general BM information improved (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>1</sub></italic>=0.365, p&lt;0.001).

Owing to the potential collinearity issue, we employed a post hoc path analysis to visualise these relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We speculated that age-related improvement was different when processing different BM cues and in different groups. Therefore, we examined the differences between the age-related improvement in processing local cues and that in processing global and general cues (see Appendix 2). In the ADHD group, we observed that the ability to process general BM cues significantly improved with age compared to local cues (p&lt;0.001) and a trend that the improvement in processing global BM cues with age was greater than that in processing local BM cues (p=0. 073). However, these patterns were not observed in the TD group. In addition, we examined the differences in the improvements in processing of BM cues with age between the two groups for each task. There was no difference in the effect of age on the response accuracy between the TD and ADHD groups for the three tasks (see Appendix 2).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study contributes several promising findings concerning atypical BM perception in children with ADHD. Specifically, we observed atypical local and global BM perception in children with ADHD. Notably, local and global BM processing exhibited distinct features. The ability to process local BM cues appears to be associated with social interaction traits in children with ADHD. In contrast, global BM processing was associated with age-related development. In addition, general BM perception may be affected by factors such as attention.</p><p>BM perception is a widely studied topic in visual cognition owing to its inherent biological and social properties. BM processing has significant value in successfully navigating daily life, particularly in non-verbal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dittrich et al., 1996</xref>) and adaptive behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pollick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson and Parasuraman, 2012</xref>). In TD children, there is a clear association between BM perception and social cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kutsuki et al., 2009</xref>). For example, 12-month-old infants exhibit social behaviours (i.e. following gaze) elicited by BM displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yoon and Johnson, 2009</xref>). Therefore, BM perception plays a crucial role in the development of childrenâs social cognition. This âsocial interpretationâ of BM suggests that the difficulties in processing BM may serve as an indicator of impaired social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are consistent with these findings. We observed atypical BM perception in children with ADHD and a significant relationship between BM perception performance and the SRS total score. Further subgroup analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the SRS total score and the accuracy of local BM processing in the ADHD group. This correlation was stronger in the ADHD group than in the TD group. The lack of a significant correlation may be due to the narrow range of SRS scores in the TD group. Future studies should increase the sample size to explore the correlations among diverse individuals. These findings suggest that BM processing is a distinct hallmark of social cognition in ADHD children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pavlova, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>BM perception is a multi-level phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Troje, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Troje and Basbaum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Troje and Chang, 2013</xref>). At least in part, the processing of local and global BM information appears to involve different neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duarte et al., 2022</xref>). Sensitivity to local BM cues emerges early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simion et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vallortigara et al., 2005</xref>) and involves rapid processing in the subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzzell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duarte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirai et al., 2009</xref>). As a basic pre-attentive feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), local BM cues can guide visual attention spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosbach et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thornton and Vuong, 2004</xref>). In contrast, the ability to process global BM cues is related to slow cortical BM processing and is influenced by many factors such as attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson and Parasuraman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton et al., 2002</xref>) and visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang and Troje, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Troje and Basbaum, 2008</xref>). As mentioned above, we found a significant negative correlation between the SRS total score and the accuracy of local BM processing, specifically in the ADHD group. This could be due to decreased visual input related to atypical local BM processing, which further impairs global BM processing. According to the two-process theory of biological motion processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirai and Senju, 2020</xref>), local BM cues guide visual attention toward BM stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simion et al., 2008</xref>). Consequently, the visual input of BM stimuli increases, facilitating the development of the ability to process global BM cues through learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Troje, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grossman et al., 2004</xref>). The latter is a prerequisite for attributing intentions to others and facilitating social interactions with other individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Troje, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frith and Frith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Troje and Chang, 2023</xref>). Thus, atypical local BM processing may contribute to impaired social interactions through altered visual input. Further empirical studies are required to confirm these hypotheses.</p><p>The ability to process global BM cues develops with age. Previous studies indicated that global BM perception is enhanced with age in TD children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annaz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghanouni et al., 2015</xref>). This developmental trend in global BM processing is also evident in individuals with impaired BM perception (e.g. children with ASD). BM processing performance in children with ASD becomes more aligned with that of TD children as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hubert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Murphy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saygin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todorova et al., 2019</xref>). Our study contributes new evidence to the understanding of the development of global BM processing. We found that the ability to process global and general BM cues improved significantly with age in both the TD and ADHD groups, implying that the processing module for global BM cues tends to mature with development. This finding is akin to the potential age-related improvements observed in certain aspects of social cognitive deficits in individuals with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bora and Pantelis, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in the ADHD group, the improvement in processing general and global BM cues was greater than in processing local BM cues. Few developmental studies have been conducted on local BM processing. The ability to process local BM cues remained stable and did not exhibit a learning trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Troje, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton et al., 2002</xref>). A reasonable interpretation may be that local BM processing is a low-level mechanism, probably performed by the primary visual cortex and subcortical regions such as the superior colliculus, pulvinar, and ventral lateral nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirai and Senju, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loula et al., 2005</xref>), which are not malleable. Although there was no statistical difference between the improvements in processing local and global BM cues in the TD group, this may be due to the relatively small sample size or the relatively higher baseline abilities of BM perception in TD children, resulting in a relatively milder improvement. It is worth noting that the ability to process global BM cues was positively correlated with the performance in processing general BM cues in the ADHD group, whereas no such correlation was found in the TD group. This suggests that TD children are able to extract and integrate both local and global cues, whereas children with ADHD may rely more on global BM cues to judge the direction the walker is facing when presented with both local and global BM cues, which correspond to a hierarchical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Troje and Basbaum, 2008</xref>). Once a living creature is detected, an agent (i.e. is it a human?) can be recognised by a coherent, articulated body structure that is perceptually organised based on its motions (i.e. local BM cues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosch, 1988</xref>). This involves top-down processing and probably requires attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavanagh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thornton et al., 2002</xref>), particularly in the presence of competing information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson and Parasuraman, 2012</xref>). Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies on the cortical processing of BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Safford et al., 2010</xref>), as we found that the severity of inattention in children with ADHD was negatively correlated with their performance in global BM processing, whereas this significant correlation was not found in local BM processing, which may involve bottom-up processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirai and Senju, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Troje and Chang, 2023</xref>) and might not need participantsâ explicit attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Troje, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). However, further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>Interestingly, children with impaired BM perception may employ a compensatory strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutherford and Troje, 2012</xref>). Previous studies found no impairment in BM recognition in individuals with autism with high IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutherford and Troje, 2012</xref>), but children with ASD exhibited weaker adaptation effects for biological motion than TD children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Boxtel et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility is that individuals with a high IQ and impaired BM perception can develop or employ reliable strategies for BM recognition, compensating for the lack of intuitive social perceptual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koldewyn et al., 2010</xref>). The current study supports this assumption, as children with a higher IQ, particularly in Perceptual Reasoning, demonstrated better performance. Owing to the impact of attention deficits on Perceptual Reasoning, the performance of children with ADHD did not align with that of TD children.</p><p>Overall, our study reveals two distinct and atypical fundamental abilities underlying BM perception in children with ADHD. Notably, anomalous local BM processing may predict impaired social interactions in children with ADHD. Moreover, these results revealed the potential contributions of age, IQ, and attention to BM information processing. These findings also shed new light for future studies. First, different developmental trends appear in local and global BM processing. Further studies are required to explore the relationship between the two fundamental BM processing abilities, which will contribute to understanding the respective and mutual neural mechanisms underlying the two types of BM processing. Second, exploring the performance of more advanced BM processing in children with ADHD, such as emotion and identity recognition in BM tasks, is necessary to delineate the neural profiles involved in processing BM in ADHD. Finally, a comparative study between ADHD and ASD is warranted to identify common neuropsychological traits and biomarkers of social cognition impairment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred seventeen children with and without ADHD were recruited for this study. Eighty-one children met the ADHD diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</xref>). The clinical diagnosis was first made by an experienced child and adolescent psychiatrist in the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Outpatient Department of Peking University Sixth Hospital, based on the ADHD Rating Scale. The Chinese version of the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime Version DSM-5 (K-SADS-PL-C DSM-5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>), a semi-structured interview instrument, was then implemented to confirm the diagnosis. Thirty-six TD children from ordinary primary schools in Beijing were screened for the presence of ADHD, ASD, affective disorders, and behavioural disorders by a trained psychiatrist. All participants in the ADHD group had a full-scale IQ &gt;75 (fifth upper percentile) on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, and all TD children had a full-scale IQ above the fifth percentile on Ravenâs Standard Progressive Matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pind et al., 2003</xref>), which is used to measure reasoning ability and is regarded as a non-verbal estimate of intelligence. The exclusion criteria for both groups were as follows: (a) neurological diseases; (b) other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. ASD, mental retardation, and tic disorders), affective disorders, and schizophrenia; (c) disorders that would impact the completion of the experiment; (d) taking psychotropic drugs or stimulants within the past 30 days; and (e) previous head trauma or neurosurgery.</p><p>Thirty-six TD children (age = 9.09Â±2.18, 14 male) and 39 children with ADHD (age = 9.88Â±2.23, 28 male) participated in Experiment 1.

The participantsâ demographic characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Currently, there is no comparable study on ADHD that indicates effect size as a reference. Studies investigating BM perception in children with ASD typically have sample sizes ranging from 15 to 35 participants per group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todorova et al., 2019</xref>). Considering the mild impairment of social function in children with ADHD, we determined that a sample size of 35â40 participants per group was reasonable for this study. All individuals in each group had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and were naÃ¯ve to the experimental objectives. Written informed consent, and consent to publish, was obtained from the parents of all the children before testing.

Specifically, the 13 dots constituting the intact walker were randomly relocated within the original range of the BM walker (randomly presented in 2D). This manipulation disrupted the global configuration of the intact walker while retaining local kinematics. After the display, we required the children to press a left or right button to indicate the direction of motion of the unidentified creature (i.e. the scrambled BM walker) as accurately as possible. Children did not receive feedback on the accuracy of each response.

A target walker (scrambled or intact) was displayed within the mask (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) during this task. The mask consisted of two scrambled target walkers (26 dots) with the same locomotion direction as the target walker, displayed within a boundary approximately 1.44 times larger than the intact walker. A scrambled or intact version of the target walker was randomly embedded in the mask and entirely overlaid. Thus, the global BM component could be isolated as two conditions (i.e. scrambled and intact walkers) containing the same local kinematics information, rendering the local motion cues uninformative. The children were required to judge whether there was an intact walker on the mask. A correct response relied on the extraction of global cues from an intact walker. To prevent children from learning the shape of the walker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang and Troje, 2009a</xref>), we set target walkers that possibly faced one of five equally spaced directions from left to right.

The mask used in this task was similar to that used in BM-Global. The children were required to judge the direction the target walker was facing (left or right).

BM-General consisted of 30 trials, with 15 trials for each facing direction. The other parameters of BM-Global and BM-General were similar to those of BM-Local.

Propensity Score Matching (PSM), to obtain a sub-dataset (1:1 matching) using the Matching package in R 4.3.0. We matched the characteristics, namely age and gender, to create more similar groups. After matching, 24 TD children (age = 9.70Â±2.08, 14 male) and 24 children with ADHD (age = 9.67Â±1.93, 14 male) were included in the following analysis. The two groups did not differ significantly in age (<italic>t</italic><sub>46</sub>=0.041, p=0.967) and had an identical gender ratio. Our findings, as reproduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1âfigure 1</xref>, confirmed that the TD group exhibited higher response accuracy than the ADHD group in all three tasks (BM-Local - TD: 0.51Â±0.11, ADHD: 0.45Â±0.10, <italic>t</italic><sub>46</sub>=2.092, p=0.042, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>=0.60; BM-Global - TD: 0.73Â±0.11, ADHD: 0.57Â±0.10, <italic>t</italic><sub>46</sub>=5.116, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>=1.48; BM-General - TD: 0.79Â±0.14, ADHD: 0.58Â±0.15, <italic>t</italic><sub>46</sub> = 5.088, p<italic>&lt;</italic>0.001, Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>=1.47).</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1âfigure 1.</label><caption><title>The mean accuracy of the three tasks (subsampled balanced data).</title><p>Typically developing (TD) children had higher accuracies than children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in three tasks in Experiment 1.

We constructed general linear models to compare these correlations. We first examined the difference in the correlations between the response accuracy for each task and SRS total score between the TD and ADHD groups. The differences between correlations were tested by testing interaction terms in general linear models. Specifically, we recoded the categorical variable (i.e. <italic>group</italic>) into a dummy variable (<italic>D</italic>) using the TD group as a reference and constructed a general linear model for each task (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2âtable 1</xref>, Model 1â3): <italic>SRS = Î²<sub>0</sub> + Î²<sub>1</sub> * ACC + Î²<sub>2</sub> * d + Î²<sub>3</sub> * (ACC * D). ACC</italic> refers to the response accuracy, and <italic>SRS</italic> refers to the SRS total score. If the effect of the interaction term (i.e. <italic>Î²<sub>3</sub></italic>) is statistically significant, it indicates that the correlations between response accuracy and SRS total score for the TD and ADHD groups are significantly different. For BM-Local, we observed that the correlation between SRS total score and ACC in the ADHD group was significantly stronger than in the TD group (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>3</sub></italic>=â0.629, p=0.003). However, no significant difference was identified with regard to BM-Global (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>3</sub></italic>=â0.195 p=0.381) or BM-General (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>3</sub></italic>=â0.179, p=0.455).</p><p>In addition, we further examined the relative differences in correlations with SRS total score between BM-Local and BM-Global or BM-General in the ADHD group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2âfigure 1</xref>). Similarly, we recoded three task types to two dummy variables, <italic>D<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>2</sub></italic>, using BM-Local as a reference. The coefficient of <italic>D<sub>1</sub></italic> represents the difference in relationship to SRS total score between BM-Local and BM-Global, and the coefficient of <italic>D<sub>2</sub></italic> represents the difference in relationship to SRS total score between BM-Local and BM-General. A general linear model was constructed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2âtable 1</xref>, Model 4): <italic>SRS = Î²<sub>0</sub> + Î²<sub>1</sub> * ACC + Î²<sub>2</sub> * D<sub>1</sub> + Î²<sub>3</sub> * D<sub>2</sub> + Î²<sub>4</sub> * (ACC * D<sub>1</sub>) + Î²<sub>5</sub> * (ACC * D<sub>2</sub>)</italic>. If the effect of the interaction term (i.e. <italic>Î²<sub>4</sub></italic> or <italic>Î²<sub>5</sub></italic>) is statistically significant, it indicates a difference in correlations with SRS total score between BM-Local and BM-Global (or BM-General). The results suggested trends where the correlations with SRS total score were more negative for BM-Local relative to BM-Global (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>4</sub></italic>=0.580 p=0.074) and BM-General (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>5</sub></italic>=0.550 p=0.073).</p><p>To further examined the differences between the age-related improvement in processing local cues and that in processing global and general cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2âfigure 2</xref>), we employed similar analyses as described earlier. We recoded task types into two dummy variables, <italic>D<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>2</sub></italic>, using BM-Local as a reference. The coefficient of <italic>D<sub>1</sub></italic> represents the difference in relationship to age between BM-Local and BM-Global, and the coefficient of <italic>D<sub>2</sub></italic> represents the difference in relationship to age between BM-Local and BM-General. The following model was created for each group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2âtable 2</xref>, Model 5â6): <italic>ACC = Î²<sub>0</sub> + Î²<sub>1</sub> * age + Î²<sub>2</sub> * D<sub>1</sub> + Î²<sub>3</sub> * D<sub>2</sub> + Î²<sub>4</sub> * (age * D<sub>1</sub>) + Î²<sub>5</sub> * (age * D<sub>2</sub>)</italic>. If the effect of the interaction term (i.e. <italic>Î²<sub>4</sub></italic> or <italic>Î²<sub>5</sub></italic>) is statistically significant, it indicates a difference in the effect of age on ACC between BM-Local and BM-Global (or BM-General). In the ADHD group, we observed a significant difference in the effect of age on ACC between BM-Local and BM-General (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>5</sub></italic>=0.462, p&lt;0.001) and marginally significant differences in the effect of age on ACC between BM-Local and BM-Global (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>4</sub></italic>=0.228, p=0.073). However, there was no difference in the effect of age between BM-Local and BM-Global or BM-General in the TD group (standardised <italic>Î²<sub>4</sub></italic>=0.095, p=0. 575; standardised <italic>Î²<sub>5</sub></italic>=0.056, p=0.739).</p><p>We also examined the differences in age-related improvements in processing BM cues between two groups for each task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2âfigure 3</xref>).

If the effect of the interaction term (i.e. <italic>Î²<sub>3</sub></italic>) is statistically significant, it indicates a difference in the effect of age on ACC between the TD group and the ADHD group.

We did identify correlations between performance on all BM tasks and SRS scores. However, it is noteworthy that this finding is not unexpected, given the significant distinctions in SRS scores between TD and ADHD children, alongside their marked differences in all BM tasks. Correlation analyses involving data from both groups may reflect group differences. To elucidate the relationship between social ability impairment and diminished BM processing in children with ADHD, we conducted additional subgroup analyses and found correlations only in the BM-local task. To further support the specificity of this correlation, we compared the differences in coefficients. We revised our modelling procedure for testing differences between correlations in supplementary materials and presented all models statistics in Table S2, S3. Discrepancies in these coefficients, which exclude the influence of differences between groups, suggest that social factors specifically influence the performance of the BM-Local task in children with ADHD. We acknowledge that the analysis for differences between correlations is based on a relative small sample size and provided modest interpretation in discussion. Future studies will aim to increase the sample size to validate our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Theoretical assumptions.

E.g., that local BM processing does not improve with age and is uninfluenced by attention.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comment. To the best of our knowledge, there have been fewer developmental studies conducted on local BM processing compared to global BM processing. Our study is the first one to directly explore the relationship between local BM processing and age. Additionally, we used QbInattention to evaluate sustained attention function (considered as âtop-downâ attention) and examined its correlation with local BM processing. Some indirect evidence supported that the ability to process local BM cues remained stable and was unaffected by top-down attention. For example, local BM processing did not show a learning trend (Chang 2009) and was linked to the activation of subcortical regions (Hirai 2020). Research has demonstrated that local BM cues can convey information about walking direction without participantsâ explicit attention or recognition (Chang 2009, Hirai 2011, Thompson 2007, Wang 2010), indicating the involvement of âbottom-upâ processing (Hirai 2020, Troje 2023). Consistent with previous findings, we did not find significant correlation between local BM processing and age or QbInattention. We acknowledge that the statement such as âlocal BM processing does not improve with age and is uninfluenced by attentionâ should be approached with cautions. Therefore, we interpreted our results carefully:</p><p>âOnce a living creature is detected, an agent (i.e., is it a human?) can be recognised by a coherent, articulated body structure that is perceptually organised based on its motions (i.e., local BM cues)71. This involves top-down processing and probably requires attention25,72, particularly in the presence of competing information26. Our findings are consistent with those of previous studies on the cortical processing of BM73, as we found that the severity of inattention in children with ADHD was negatively correlated with their performance in global BM processing, whereas this significant correlation was not found in local BM processing, which may involve bottom-up processing61,65 and might not need participantsâ explicit attention21,23,74,75. However, further studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.â (lines 461-470)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Supplementary materials: For all reported results, I suggest the authors use consistent model notation with complete reporting of all statistics in line with common conventions (ideally tables reporting beta values, error terms and confidence intervals for all model predictors, as well as R squared values). In particular the beta values for the reference category are needed to be able to fully interpret the beta values for the reported contrasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the your suggestion. In the newly revised manuscript, we reported all statistics including beta values, error terms and confidence intervals for all model predictors, and R squared values. These detailed statistics can be found in Table S1, S2 and S3. We hope this additional information will offer readers a more comprehensive understanding of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also address the following inconsistencies:</p><p>- At least when reporting the model results, the same term should be used when refering to task type (either task 1/2/3/ or local/global/general BM).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the your for this feedback. We use the same term (BM-Local/Global/General) to refer to task type in the whole text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Second linear model in the Supplementary Materials: The authors state that the results suggest that the correlation between SRS and task 1 is greater than that between task 2 and SRS scores. First of all, to be able to support this claim the authors need to provide the coefficient for task 1 (which, if task 1 is the reference variable should be Ã1). Second, as I currently understand the reported model results, the fact that Ã4 (representing the difference in relationship to SRS scores between task 2 and task 1; the authors refer to Ã3 here although I assume they mean Ã4) is negative and shows a trend towards significance would actually mean the relationship between BM processing accuracy and SRS scores is more negative for task 2 relative to task 1 and not, as the authors state, that the correlation with SRS scores is greater for task 1. I realise this contradicts the individual r values and scatter plots and hope the authors can clarify the model results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for pointing out these issues. For the second linear model (Model 4 in revised manuscript), we reported the coefficients for all predictors and model summaries including the coefficient for task 1 (Ã1). In addition, we have made correction to the model results. The values of Ã4 (representing the difference in relationship to SRS scores between BM-Global and BM-Local) and Ã5 (representing the difference in relationship to SRS scores between BM-General and BM-Local) were positive and showed a trend towards significance, indicating that the correlations with SRS total score were more negative for BM-Local relative to BM-Global and BM-General:</p><p>âA general linear model was constructed (Table S2, Model 4): SRS = Î²0 + Î²1 * ACC + Î²2 * D1 + Î²3 * D2 + Î²4 * (ACC * D1) + Î²5 * (ACC * D2). If the effect of the interaction term (i.e., Î²4 or Î²5 ) is statistically significant, it indicates a difference in correlations with SRS total score between BM-Local and BM-Global (or BM-General). The results suggested trends where the correlations with SRS total score were more negative for BM-Local relative to BM-Global (standardized Î²4 = 0.580 p = 0.074) and BM-General (standardized Î²5 = 0.550 p = 0.073).â (lines SI 36-42)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Third linear model in the Supplementary Materials: In the dummy variable representing task, when local BM is the reference level, which task is represented by d1 and d2, respectively? If I understand the authors' procedure correctly, d1 should represent the difference between local and global BM and d2 the difference between local and general BM. If this is true, Ã4 should code for the difference between local and global BM and not, as stated by the authors, for the difference between local and general BM. Also, what is d3?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue. We corrected and clarified the results of third model (Model 5 in revised manuscript) in the revised version and pointed out what is represented by d1 (D1) and d2 (D2), respectively:</p><p>âWe recoded task types into two dummy variables, D1 and D2, using BM-Local as a reference. The coefficient of D1 represents the difference in relationship to age between BM-Local and BM-Global, and the coefficient of D2 represents the difference in relationship to age between BM-Local and BM-General. The following model was created for each group (Table S3, Model 5-6): ACC = Î²0 + Î²1 * age + Î²2 * D1 + Î²3 * D2 + Î²4 * (age * D1) + Î²5 * (age * D2). If the effect of the interaction term (i.e., Î²4 or Î²5) is statistically significant, it indicates a difference in the effect of age on ACC between BM-Local and BM-Global (or BM-General). In the ADHD group, we observed a significant difference in the effect of age on ACC between BM-Local and BM-General (standardized Î²5 = 0.462, p &lt; 0.001) and marginally significant differences in the effect of age on ACC between BM-Local and BM-Global (standardized Î²4 = 0.228, p = 0.073).â (lines SI 47-57)</p></body></sub-article></article>
