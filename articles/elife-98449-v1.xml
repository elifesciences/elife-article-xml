directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. A knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM; as a model of blood derived macrophages) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM do not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside the human body, immune cells known as macrophages are constantly looking for microbes, cell debris and other potential threats to engulf and digest.

Despite a large body of evidence indicating that these tissue resident AM have a distinct phenotype and function to peripherally derived macrophages, there remains a significant lack of data regarding human AM function and plasticity in response to infection and their ability to change under the influence of Th1 or Th2 environments. Macrophage function exists on a spectrum of activation states based on tissue residency, ontogeny, cytokine milieu and the plasticity of the macrophage in response to environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ginhoux et al., 2010</xref>). Much of the research has focused on the contribution of metabolic pathways to polarising macrophages into distinct pro-inflammatory or regulatory phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th1 or Th2 microenvironments induced by cytokines such as IFN-γ or IL-4 respectively, in human macrophages, especially in tissue resident macrophages, such as AM. A knowledge gap remains as to whether the tissue resident AM is metabolically and functionally plastic and therefore capable of mounting effective pro-inflammatory responses despite its homeostatic, regulatory tissue resident phenotype.</p><p>Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vijayan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>). Since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung, we sought to determine the plasticity of AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Using primary human AM and MDM, we modelled Th1 and Th2 microenvironments with the addition of IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively. To further examine the function of IFN-γ or IL-4 primed macrophages, we stimulated cells with the gram-negative bacterial component, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or whole bacteria, irradiated <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb; iH37Rv). Firstly, we assessed the metabolic phenotype of unprimed human AM, or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4. IFN-γ significantly increased the cellular energetics of both human AM and MDM. Furthermore, subsequent stimulation led to an increase in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a surrogate marker of glycolysis in both macrophages. Therefore, using the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) we then examined the mechanistic role of glycolysis in the phenotypic and functional plasticity of both AM and MDM. Herein the functional plasticity is defined as the ability of primed macrophages to differentially alter cytokine production in response to bacterial stimuli whereas the phenotypic plasticity is defined by alterations in surface expression of activation markers.</p><p>These data demonstrate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ or IL-4 differently than MDM. These novel data demonstrate differential metabolic responses within human macrophage subpopulations that are linked with functionality. Furthermore, these data address a knowledge gap in human respiratory innate immunology and provide evidence that the AM is a tractable target to support human respiratory health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IFN-γ induces metabolic reprogramming in both AM and MDM</title><p>AM alter their metabolism in response to Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>). Human macrophages also undergo a rapid increase in ECAR early in response to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ó Maoldomhnaigh et al., 2021a</xref>) and these pathways can be pharmacologically manipulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phelan et al., 2020</xref>). The metabolic and functional plasticity of human AM remains unexplored; however, evidence shows they express both ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitsi et al., 2018</xref>). Murine AM can be reprogrammed through an IFN-γ-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore sought to examine whether priming human AM with IFN-γ compared with IL-4 or unprimed AM, could influence their metabolic function and response to bacterial stimuli. We stimulated with whole bacteria; Mtb (iH37Rv) or gram-negative cell wall component; LPS. AM were plated in a Seahorse plate and primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 (both 10 ng/ml) for 24 hr or left unprimed. AM ECAR and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were recorded for 30 min at baseline. AM were then stimulated in the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer with medium (control), iH37Rv (MOI; 1–10) or LPS (100 ng/ml) and ECAR and OCR were continuously monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>&amp;B).</p><p>At 150 min post stimulation fold change compared to unprimed unstimulated AM was calculated for ECAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). IFN-γ priming significantly increased the ECAR and OCR of unstimulated human AM compared with control or IL-4 primed AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Upon stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS, AM significantly increased ECAR compared to their respective unstimulated controls, regardless of cytokine priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). IFN-γ primed and subsequently stimulated AM exhibited a significantly increased ECAR compared with stimulated control or IL-4 primed AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). IL-4 primed iH37Rv stimulated AM increased ECAR to similar extent as unprimed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; left). Conversely, IL-4 primed AM stimulated with LPS AM did not increase their ECAR to the same extent as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; right), suggesting that IL-4 reduces the AM ability to increase ECAR in response to LPS stimulation. IFN-γ significantly increased the OCR of AM in response to stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS, and had enhanced OCR compared with other stimulated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data indicate that priming human AM with IFN-γ increases both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, which is then further increased upon stimulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IFN-γ increases energetic metabolism in the AM but enhances ‘Warburg’-like metabolism in MDM in response to inflammatory stimuli.</title><p>Human AM (<bold>A–D</bold>) were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

This was carried out to equalise all the primed data sets at baseline before stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). These data indicate that whilst the peak of glycolysis is elevated in IFN-γ primed AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), all AM have a similar capacity to increase glycolysis upon stimulation when baseline differences in metabolism were adjusted for the effects of cytokine priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). IFN-γ increased the percent change in OCR of AM in response to both bacterial stimuli compared to the unstimulated IFN-γ primed control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data indicate that priming AM alters the metabolic baselines of human tissue resident macrophages and not their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli.</p><p>In order to compare the metabolic responses of AM with blood-derived macrophages, we next assessed MDM. Human MDM were left unprimed or primed with IFN-γ or IL-4 (both 10 ng/ml). 24 hr after cytokine priming metabolic flux was monitored by recording ECAR and OCR at baseline for 30 min. MDM were then stimulated with medium, iH37Rv or LPS and ECAR and OCR was continuously monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>As per previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ó Maoldomhnaigh et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ó Maoldomhnaigh et al., 2021b</xref>) a sustained increase in ECAR and a transient decrease in OCR occurred in MDM after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). At 150 min post stimulation, fold change was calculated compared to unprimed unstimulated MDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). IFN-γ priming significantly increased the ECAR and OCR of MDM whereas IL-4 priming significantly reduced the ECAR in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Stimulation of human MDM with iH37Rv or LPS significantly increased ECAR in all MDM; however, IL-4 primed MDM stimulated with iH37Rv or LPS have significantly reduced ECAR compared with control or IFN-γ primed MDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). IFN-γ primed MDM stimulated with iH37Rv have increased ECAR compared with control MDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Similar to AM, IFN-γ primed MDM have increased OCR compared with control or IL-4 primed MDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast with the AM, stimulation of IFN-γ primed MDM does not further increase OCR however, the elevated OCR in IFN-γ primed MDM remains significantly higher compared to control or IL-4 primed MDM when stimulated with iH37Rv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The percent change in ECAR upon stimulation (from respective baselines) illustrates that all MDM groups significantly increase ECAR from their own baseline in response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Interestingly, although IL-4 significantly reduced ECAR in iH37Rv and LPS stimulated MDM compared with unprimed stimulated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), the IL-4 primed MDM have significantly enhanced capacity to ramp up glycolysis in response to LPS, as evidence by the significantly increased percentage change in LPS stimulated, IL-4 primed MDM compared with IFN-γ primed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Control or IFN-γ primed MDM stimulated with either iH37Rv or LPS decreases percentage change in the OCR associated with a stimulation-induced shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This effect is not observed in IL-4 primed MDM, moreover, IL-4 primed MDM stimulated with iH37Rv had significantly elevated percent change in OCR compared with stimulated unprimed or IFN-γ primed MDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data indicate that IL-4 priming prevents human MDM utilising ‘Warburg’-like metabolism in response to stimulation.</p><p>Since AM and MDM had distinct responses to priming and stimulation, we next directly compared the metabolic responses of AM and MDM. AM and MDM had similar levels of ECAR relative to their own unprimed controls, which were both enhanced upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). The OCR is elevated in the AM compared with the MDM; IFN-γ primed AM exhibit significantly increased OCR compared with MDM in response to stimulation with iH37Rv or LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>In summary, human AM upregulate glycolysis early in response to stimulation. IFN-γ significantly promoted cellular energetics (both ECAR and OCR) in unstimulated AM which was further enhanced by stimulation. IFN-γ promotes increased cellular energetics in stimulated human MDM by promoting both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, whilst maintaining the capacity for the cells to shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism in response to stimulation. IL-4 priming significantly reduced the cellular energetics compared with control or IFN-γ primed MDM. Importantly, IL-4 prevents the drop in OCR occurring in stimulated MDM thereby inhibiting ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IL-4 primed AM had reduced fold change in glycolysis upon stimulation with LPS compared with controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IFN-γ promotes HLA-DR and CD40 markedly more on human MDM than AM whereas IL-4 promoted CD86</title><p>Having established that energetic responses are plastic in response to IFN-γ in the AM and that post stimulation energetic responses are different in human macrophage types under Th1 or Th2 priming conditions, we next sought to determine the effect on the plasticity of the macrophage phenotype by examining expression of activation markers associated with antigen presentation function.

We and others have reported that lung resident macrophages are dependent on glycolysis to respond to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavrich et al., 2018</xref>) or Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gleeson et al., 2018</xref>); however, their metabolic behaviour is distinct from murine AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woods et al., 2020</xref>) reinforcing the need to define cellular metabolism and its tractability in human macrophages in order to design effective immunometabolic therapies. We demonstrate here that human AM can be metabolically reprogrammed by IFN-γ which increased both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and is further enhanced by stimulation with Mtb or LPS. This is in contrast with literature showing murine AM do not increase glycolysis in real-time following LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woods et al., 2020</xref>), although whether IFN-γ can influence this in mice remains unknown. Our previous work shows that upon activation, the human MDM underwent ‘Warburg’-like metabolism associated with an increase in glycolysis with a concomitant reduction in oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ó Maoldomhnaigh et al., 2021a</xref>). We confirmed this observation and this persists when primed with IFN-γ, unlike AM which do not undergo the shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IL-4 primed macrophages are associated in the literature with an increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Van den Bossche and Saraber, 2018</xref>). Indeed, murine IL-4 primed BMDM have increased ECAR and OCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundahl et al., 2022</xref>). IL-4 did not promote oxidative metabolism in human AM or MDM, even when stimulated. IL-4 decreased glycolysis while preventing a decline in oxidative metabolism in MDM, inhibiting their shift to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. When directly comparing percentage change in ECAR of unprimed or macrophages primed with IFN-γ or IL-4, they all had similar rates of change despite profound differences in maximal ECAR. These data suggest that the resting state of the macrophage, and the cytokines it has recently been exposed to before activation, may be a key determining factor for the response and outcome to infections.</p><p>Directly comparing the AM with the MDM demonstrates that human AM are more reliant on oxidative metabolism upon IFN-γ priming and stimulation. Previous observations had identified a high baseline of lactate in supernatants of human AM compared to MDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, IFN-γ primed AM and MDM had significantly reduced capacity to increase ECAR (percentage change) in response to LPS stimulation, suggesting that there may be a point of maximal glycolysis. This ability to induce maximal glycolysis may be advantageous during infection as lactate, a breakdown product of glycolysis, has been shown to have antimicrobial functions against Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ó Maoldomhnaigh et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, pathogens such as Mtb can downregulate metabolic pathways after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cumming et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendonca et al., 2022</xref>) and IFN-γ is crucial for control of Mtb via glycolysis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braverman et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our current data, and as recently suggested by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cumming et al., 2020</xref>), we speculate that control of Mtb in humans may be dependent on IFN-γ regulating glycolysis and not ‘Warburg’-like metabolism.</p><p>To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that IFN-γ alone is sufficient to cause metabolic reprogramming of both lung resident AM and peripherally derived MDM. While other studies have demonstrated a role for IFN-γ inducing metabolic alterations in macrophages these studies have focused on murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braverman et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, evidence in murine BMDM indicates that IFN-γ alone does not increase glycolysis but that LPS was required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van den Bossche et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the use of LPS in combination with IFN-γ to polarise macrophages toward the an inflammatory phenotype is not a model easily translatable to humans, which are strikingly more sensitive to LPS than mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mestas and Hughes, 2004</xref>) and the ‘M1’ macrophage elicited cannot be subsequently challenged with infectious agents, as the response is confounded by the initial LPS stimulation. Moreover, the use of LPS in addition to IFN-γ to polarise the macrophage towards the ‘M1’ phenotype is arguably not comparable with a macrophage that is polarised with IL-4 (or IL-10) in the absence of TLR stimuli. We wanted to assess the ability of IFN-γ alone to affect the function of human macrophages, to enable direct comparisons of macrophage subpopulations in order to fully assess the functional differences elicited in response to subsequent stimulation, in keeping with other human models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cumming et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>AM expression of activation markers was more limited compared to MDM, even when primed and stimulated. AM upregulated only HLA-DR consistently in response to IFN-γ, broadly in keeping with murine AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Agostino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afkhami et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, MDM have a greater capacity to increase all activation markers in response to IFN-γ and stimulation. The response of IFN-γ primed MDM to Mtb was dependent on glycolysis for optimal activation marker expression, while LPS upregulated these markers independently of glycolysis, irrespective of cytokine priming. In contrast the AM was dependent on glycolysis for upregulation of these markers in response to LPS and not Mtb. These data once again suggest a differential role of glycolysis within human macrophages.</p><p>Glycolytic metabolism in macrophages has been intrinsically linked to cytokine production, particularly IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phelan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lachmandas et al., 2016</xref>). We have demonstrated that increased ECAR early in MDM activation is associated with increased secretion of IL-1β in both MDM and AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, IFN-γ can promote IL-1β by inhibiting miR-21, a negative regulator of glycolysis in both human MDM and murine BMDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hackett et al., 2020</xref>). Our data builds on the observation that IFN-γ upregulates pro-IL-1β by a glycolytic-dependent mechanism in murine BMDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), by demonstrating the increased secretion of mature IL-1β by IFN-γ primed human macrophages. Moreover, we have confirmed that IL-1β secretion is dependent on glycolysis in IFN-γ primed human AM and MDM, which is line with data from murine BMDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braverman et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study, we also demonstrate that 2DG can reduce both IL-1β and IL-10 secretion by IFN-γ primed AM and MDM in response to Mtb. Moreover, 2DG inhibited LPS induced IL-10 in AM and unprimed MDM. 2DG has previously been shown to inhibit IL-10 production by LPS stimulated human MDM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vijayan et al., 2019</xref>; however, restricting glycolysis using glucose-free medium inhibited IL-1β but promoted IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, IL-10 production is inhibited by IFN-γ in human MDM, which is similar to previous data in IFN-γ primed murine BMDM where IL-10 secretion was also inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Müller et al., 2017</xref>). However, our data also demonstrates that IFN-γ does not inhibit or promote IL-10 in human AM stimulated with LPS even though interestingly, IFN-γ primed AM had increased TNF in response to LPS. This suggests that there may be additional pathways involved in IL-10 secretion by human macrophages, which is supported by reductions in IL-10 secretion by IL-4 primed AM, which are not metabolically altered.</p><p>TNF is crucial to control infections such as Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keane et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris and Keane, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourigault et al., 2013</xref>). We demonstrate that IFN-γ enhances TNF production in response to Mtb stimulation in human MDM and AM; however, AM have a much greater ability to increase TNF. Moreover, IFN-γ primed AM stimulated with Mtb have significantly more production of IL-1β, TNF and IL-10 compared with unprimed controls. This is in contrast with IFN-γ primed MDM which only upregulate TNF compared to their unprimed controls. These data indicate that effective immune responses to Mtb in the lung may require AM to be primed with IFN-γ and may in part explain why patients deficient in IFN-γ or associated signalling have increased risk of TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ní Cheallaigh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remus et al., 2001</xref>). IFN-γ-driven production of TNF is dependent on glycolysis in AM. MDM secretion of TNF is independent of glycolysis and conversely, inhibition of glycolysis in IL-4 primed Mtb stimulated MDM enhanced TNF production. Previous studies have demonstrated that glycolysis was required by murine BMDM but not AM to secrete TNF and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woods et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, our data demonstrates that human AM need glycolysis for optimal TNF production, especially in the presence of IFN-γ, whereas MDM do not. Once again, we highlight that there is variation in the metabolic requirements within human macrophage subpopulations, and importantly, that the AM is metabolically tractable to modulate its function.</p><p>Whether the AM can respond to IL-4 has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kulikauskaite and Wack, 2020</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the human AM can respond to IL-4 with evidence that IL-4 reduced glycolysis in response to LPS stimulation. In addition, AM were functionally altered by IL-4 resulting in reduced IL-1β and IL-10 production and upregulated CD86. These data provide evidence that the human AM is capable of responding to IL-4 which may inform type 2 lung immunity, and susceptibility to infection in patients with asthma, for example.</p><p>Trained immunity improves innate responses to infection and is emerging as a key component of host directed therapies (HDT) and strategies to improve vaccine efficacy and the design of respiratory mucosal vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Agostino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afkhami et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Netea et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). Both IFN-γ and IL-4 can induce trained immunity in murine and human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundahl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schrijver et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2023</xref>). MDM trained with IFN-γ and LPS, and stimulated with Mtb had increased TNF in the acute activation phase of trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lundahl et al., 2022</xref>), which we observed in IFN-γ primed MDM subsequently stimulated with Mtb. We also observed an increase in TNF, IL-1β and IL-10 in AM potentially suggesting that AM will be a target for innate training, as increased IL-1β is associated with optimal training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Teufel et al., 2022</xref>). AM from mice that received an inhaled adenovirus vectored vaccine undergo trained immunity mediated by IFN-γ resulting in elevated MHC-II expression, enhanced cytokine production, and protection against specific and non-specific infection challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Agostino et al., 2020</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that an adenovirus vectored vaccine induces trained immunity in human monocytes and postulated that this may be IFN-γ dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2023</xref>). The current study provides evidence that IFN-γ can metabolically reprogramme the human AM, resulting in enhanced HLA-DR expression and cytokine production in response to subsequent stimulation. Cumulatively this highlights the importance of ascertaining whether IFN-γ can induce trained immunity in the human AM, which may enhance the design of respiratory mucosal vaccines.</p><p>Immune augmentation therapies delivered directly to the lung are necessary to help combat the growing threat of drug-resistant pathogens, including Mtb. We have demonstrated such approaches both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phelan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cahill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lawlor et al., 2016</xref>). Clinical trials have indicated that nebulized IFN-γ is a viable HDT to help combat Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharti et al., 2022</xref>) and is in clinical trials for sepsis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04990232">https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04990232</ext-link>). Our data supports the use of inhalable IFN-γ as an immuno-supportive therapy which modulates metabolic responses. Moreover, our data indicates that IFN-γ affects metabolism and cytokine secretion in AM significantly more than MDM which lends support for the therapeutic strategy of delivering IFN-γ to the lung, by targeting the macrophage population that most need immune augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) and limiting potential side effects.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Study limitations</title><p>We acknowledge that our in vitro model is simplified and may not fully reflect macrophages in vivo. Nevertheless, these data address knowledge gaps in human macrophage biology and are required to aid the translation of immunometabolism into clinical benefits in respiratory medicine. We used LPS and irradiated Mtb to model successful macrophage responses to infection. Future experiments should examine how virulent respiratory pathogens such as gram-negative <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> and Mtb affect human AM in Th1 or Th2 environments, to determine infection-specific effects.</p><p>The inhibition of glycolysis with 2DG cannot definitively link all observations solely to glycolysis, as limiting glycolysis will ultimately limit oxidative phosphorylation. Blocking oxidative phosphorylation with oligomycin reduced LPS induced cytokine secretion in the human AM and not MDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pereverzeva et al., 2022</xref>), both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation may therefore be needed for optimal AM function. The concentration of 2DG used only partially inhibited glycolysis; however, ablation of glycolysis induces significant cytotoxicity and confounds assay outcomes. Therefore, where 2DG had no effect, a role for glycolysis cannot be definitively excluded. Furthermore, only one dose of IFN-γ was utilised due to limitations in AM yield; however, recently both low and high doses of IFN-γ have been shown to have similar effects on AM in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thiel et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Establishing the immunometabolic and functional outputs of human macrophages will aid in future work examining the plasticity of the human AM. While we have established herein that the human AM is plastic in response to IFN-γ, since the AM is yolk-sac derived and long-lived, this raises the question of whether the plasticity of the AM can allow multiple sequential changes to respond and adapt to changing microenvironments in the lung. Another question raised is whether other tissue resident macrophages behave similarly to AM or whether they have unique responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Human AM and infiltrating MDM both increase glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in response to IFN-γ, and stimulation results in a further increase in glycolysis. Cumulatively, the data presented herein suggests that the MDM maybe more phenotypically plastic than the AM, while the AM have enhanced functional plasticity in their ability to produce cytokine after exposure Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Our data supports the hypothesis that there may be distinct roles for AM and infiltrating MDM during infection since IFN-γ increased metabolic responses are mechanistically associated with different cellular functions. Our data demonstrates that cytokine production in human AM can be promoted by supporting cellular metabolism, thus providing evidence that human tissue resident AM are a tractable target for host-directed immuno-supportive adjunctive therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Buffy coats were obtained with consent from healthy donors (aged between 18–69; ethical approval, School of Medicine Research Ethics Committee, Trinity College Dublin).

The two subpopulations are resident airway macrophages (AM) isolated via bronchoalveolar lavage and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) isolated from human blood and differentiated using human serum. The two cell types were primed using IFNγ and Il-4, which are produced at sites of inflammation as part of initiation and resolution of inflammation respectively, followed by stimulation with either heat-killed tuberculosis (Mtb) or LPS to simulate interaction with a bacterial pathogen that is either gram-negative in the case of Mtb or gram-positive in the case of LPS. The authors use human cells for this work, which makes use of widely reported and thoroughly described priming signals, as well as model antigens. This makes the observations on the functional response of these two subpopulations relevant to human health and disease to a greater extent that the mouse models typically used to interrogate these interactions. To examine the relationship between metabolism and functional response, the authors measure rates of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis under baseline conditions, primed using IFNγ or IL-4, and primed and stimulated with Mtb or LPS.</p><p>Overall, this study reveals how inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine priming contributes to the metabolic reprogramming of AM and MDM populations. Their conclusions regarding the relationship between cytokine secretion and inflammatory molecule expression in response to bacterial stimuli are supported by the data. The involvement of metabolism in innate immune cell function is relevant when devising treatment strategies that target the innate immune response during infection. The data presented in this paper further our understanding of that relationship and advance the field of innate immune cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Comments to the authors:</p><p>R1. The authors show a similar reduction in ECAR as a measure of glycolytic inhibition upon treating H37Rv-infected unprimed MDMs with 5 mM 2-DG at 1 h and 24 h. However, the data pertaining to the extent of glycolytic inhibition upon 2-DG treatment in IFN-γ or IL-4 primed AMs or MDMs is not included.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we have not checked the ECAR of every dataset herein treated with 2DG. However, we have provided evidence that 2DG reduced ECAR in the control datasets, and moreover, 2DG is functionally affecting the cells (e.g. the presence of 2DG altered cytokine production in both AM and MDM, even in the presence of IFN-γ or IL-4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2. The authors have replotted the same data as percent change and fold difference with different normalizing samples. While they have corrected one of the highlighted discrepancies in the data plotting of Fig. 1A and 1C, similar discrepancies are still evident in many other instances. Based on my understanding of the data and normalization methodology stated by the authors in response to comment (#5) by reviewer 1, the authors are plotting fold changes across all samples with respect to unstimulated and unprimed macrophages, whereas percent changes are plotted for stimulated (LPS or dead H37Rv) samples with respect to baseline measurements for each unstimulated sample under differently primed macrophages. I believe the slope of lines connecting unstimulated and LPS stimulates/H37Rv infected upon percent increase or decrease (from the baseline of unstimulated samples) will still maintain their trend in fold changes (relative to unstimulated and unprimed macrophages) irrespective of changes in absolute values. For instance, in Fig. 1F, there are at least 3 samples that show an increase in fold change in OCR upon H37Rv infection in IFN-γ primed MDMs. However, Fig. 1H, plotted from the same data, shows a decrease in OCR across all IFN-γ primed MDMs upon H37Rv infection. The authors have also highlighted that this decrease in OCR upon H37Rv infection in IFN- γ primed MDMs is highly significant (P &lt; 0.01). The same data is again plotted as a bar plot in Fig. 1J as fold change relative to unstimulated and unprimed macrophages (mislabeled as percent change to unstimulated), showing no difference upon H37Rv infection of IFN-γ primed MDMs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended the axis in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 to more accurately describe the two different forms of analysis. We have fixed the errors outlined. We have also amended the methods in the text to clarify the two analyses carried out on the metabolic data. Lines 113-122 as follows:</p><p>“Fold change in ECAR and OCR was calculated compared to unstimulated unprimed controls at 150 minutes, where unstimulated unprimed macrophages were set to 1. This allows for analysis of the effects of both priming and subsequent stimulation for and accounts for the variation in the raw ECAR and OCR reading between runs thereby making each donor its own control.</p><p>Percent change in ECAR and OCR was also calculated to equalise groups to the same point prior to stimulation. Each condition was compared to its own respective primed or unprimed baseline at 30 minutes and this was set to 100%, prior to stimulation, this was carried to examine the capacity of cells to increase metabolic parameters in response to stimulation. Post stimulation percent change data was then extracted and analysed at 150 minutes. This controls for the priming effect and enables the analysis of metabolic capacity in each dataset.”</p><p>For figure 1J, the data is replotted from fold change datasets (not percentage change where the decrease in OCR is significant). The axis label has been revised for accuracy.</p></body></sub-article></article>
