mutations were identified in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> gene. In somatic cells, CCDC146 is located at the centrosome and at multiple microtubule-related organelles during mitotic division, suggesting that it is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP). To decipher the molecular pathogenesis of infertility associated with <italic>CCDC146</italic> mutations, a <italic>Ccdc146</italic> knock-out (KO) mouse line was created. KO male mice were infertile, and sperm exhibited a phenotype identical to CCDC146 mutated patients. CCDC146 expression starts during late spermiogenesis. In the spermatozoon, the protein is conserved but is not localized to centrioles, unlike in somatic cells, rather it is present in the axoneme at the level of microtubule doublets. Expansion microscopy associated with the use of the detergent sarkosyl to solubilize microtubule doublets suggests that the protein may be a microtubule inner protein (MIP). At the subcellular level, the absence of CCDC146 impacted all microtubule-based organelles such as the manchette, the head–tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), and the axoneme. Through this study, a new genetic cause of infertility and a new factor in the formation and/or structure of the sperm axoneme were characterized.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>infertility</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>flagellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE17-0014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Pierre F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE13-0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnoult</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009243</institution-id><institution>Direction Générale de l’offre de Soins</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRTS 2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Pierre F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014865</institution-id><institution>Fondation Maladies Rares</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FGD-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Pierre F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>715289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guichard</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CCDC146 is a structural component of the flagellum in sperm, located in the doublet microtubules of the axoneme, whose absence leads to multiple morphological anomalies of the flagellum.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility is a major health concern, affecting approximately 50 million couples worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boivin et al., 2007</xref>), or 12.5% of women and 10% of men. It is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the “failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse”. In almost all countries, infertile couples have access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) to try to conceive a baby, and there are now 5 million people born as a result of ART. Despite this success, almost half of the couples seeking medical support for infertility fail to successfully conceive and bear a child by the end of their medical care. The main reason for these failures is that one member of the couple produces gametes that are unable to support fertilization and/or embryonic development. Indeed, ART does not specifically treat or even try to elucidate the underlying causes of a couple’s infertility, rather it tries to bypass the observed defects. Consequently, when defects in the gametes cannot be circumvented by the techniques currently proposed, ART fails. To really treat infertility, a first step would be to gain a better understanding of the problems with gametogenesis for each patient. This type of approach should increase the likelihood of adopting the best strategy for affected patients, and if necessary, should guide the development of innovative therapies.</p><p>Male infertility has several causes, such as infectious diseases, anatomical defects, or a genetic disorder, including chromosomal or single-gene deficiencies. Genetic defects play a major role in male infertility, with over 4000 genes thought to be involved in sperm production, of which more than 2000 are testis-enriched and almost exclusively involved in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Uhlén et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in any of these genes can negatively affect spermatogenesis and produce one of many described sperm disorders. The characterization and identification of the molecular bases of male infertility is thus a real challenge. Nevertheless, thanks to the emergence of massively parallel sequencing technologies, such as whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), the identification of genetic defects has been greatly facilitated in recent years. As a consequence, remarkable progress has been made in the characterization of numerous human genetic diseases, including male infertility.</p><p>Today, more than 120 genes are associated with all types of male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houston et al., 2021</xref>), including quantitative and qualitative sperm defects. Qualitative spermatogenesis defects impacting sperm morphology, also known as ‘teratozoospermia’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurois et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Touré et al., 2021</xref>), are a heterogeneous group of abnormalities covering a wide range of sperm phenotypes. Among these phenotypes, some relate to the morphology of the flagellum. These defects are usually not uniform, and patients’ sperm show a wide range of flagellar morphologies such as short and/or coiled and/or irregularly sized flagella. Due to this heterogeneity, this phenotype is now referred to as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagellum (MMAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Touré et al., 2021</xref>). Sperm from these patients are generally immotile, and patients are sterile.</p><p>Given the number of proteins present in the flagellum and necessary for its formation and functioning, many genes have already been linked to the MMAF phenotype. Study of the MMAF phenotype in humans has allowed the identification of around 50 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) coding for proteins involved in axonemal organization, present in the structures surrounding the axoneme – such as the outer dense fibers and the fibrous sheath – and involved in intra-flagellar transport (IFT). Moreover, some genes have been identified from mouse models, and their human orthologs are very good gene candidates for MMAF, even if no patient has yet been identified with mutations in these genes. Finally, based on the remarkable structural similarity of the axonemal structure of motile cilia and flagella, some MMAF genes were initially identified in the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). However, this structural similarity does not necessarily imply a molecular similarity, and only around half (10 of the 22 PCD-related genes identified so far; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sironen et al., 2020</xref>) are effectively associated with male infertility. However, in most cases, the number of patients is very low and the details of the sperm tail phenotype are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sironen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have recruited 167 patients with MMAF.

Despite this success, a molecular diagnosis is obtained in half of the patients (49.7%) with this sperm phenotype, suggesting that novel candidate genes remain to be identified. We have pursued our effort with this cohort to identify further mutations that could explain the patient MMAF phenotype. As such, we have identified bi-allelic truncating mutations in <italic>CCDC146</italic> in two unrelated infertile patients displaying MMAF. <italic>CCDC146</italic> is known to code for a centrosomal protein when heterologously expressed in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2018</xref>), but minimal information is available on its distribution within the cell, or its function when naturally present. Moreover, this gene has never been associated with any human disease.</p><p>The centrosome, located adjacent to the nucleus, is a microtubule-based structure composed of a pair of orthogonally oriented centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). The centrosome is the major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells, and as such regulates the microtubule organization within the cell. Therefore, it controls intracellular organization and intracellular transport, and consequently regulates cell shape, cell polarity, and cell migration. The centrosome is also crucial for cell division as it controls the assembly of the mitotic/meiotic spindle, ensuring correct segregation of sister chromatids in each of the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blanco-Ameijeiras et al., 2022</xref>). The importance of this organelle is highlighted by the fact that 3% (579 proteins) of all known human proteins have been experimentally detected in the centrosome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). Centrioles also play essential roles in spermatogenesis and particularly during spermiogenesis. In round spermatids, the centriole pair docks to the cell membrane, whereas the distal centriole serves as the basal body initiating assembly of the axoneme. The proximal centriole then tightly attaches to the sperm nucleus and gradually develops the head-to-tail coupling apparatus (HTCA), linking the sperm head to the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In human and bovine sperm, the proximal centriole is retained and the distal centriole is remodeled to produce an ‘atypical’ centriole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fishman et al., 2018</xref> in contrast, in rodents, both centrioles are degenerated during epididymal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manandhar et al., 1998</xref>). Despite the number of proteins making up the centrosome, and its importance in sperm differentiation and flagellum formation, very few centrosomal proteins have been linked to MMAF in humans – so far only CEP135 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sha et al., 2017</xref>), CEP148 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), or DZIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lv et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, some major axonemal proteins with an accessory location in the centrosome, such as CFAP58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sha et al., 2021</xref>) and ODF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakagawa et al., 2001</xref>), have also been reported to be involved in MMAF syndrome. Other centrosomal proteins lead to MMAF in mice; these include CEP131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2013</xref>) and CCDC42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pasek et al., 2016</xref>). The discovery that MMAF in humans is linked to CCDC146, known so far as a centrosomal protein, adds to our knowledge of proteins important for axoneme biogenesis.</p><p>In this article, we first evaluated the localization of endogenous CCDC146 during the cell cycle in two types of cell cultures, immortalized HEK-293T cells and primary human foreskin fibroblasts. To validate the gene candidate and improve our knowledge of the corresponding protein, we also generated two mouse models. The first one was a <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO model, with which we studied the impact of lack of the protein on the general phenotype, and in particular on male reproductive function using several optical and electronic microscopy techniques. The second model was a HA-tagged CCDC146 model, with which we studied the localization of the protein in different cell types. Data from these genetically modified mouse models were confirmed in human sperm cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WES identifies <italic>CCDC146</italic> as a gene involved in MMAF</title><p>We performed WES to investigate a highly selected cohort of 167 MMAF patients previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coutton et al., 2019</xref>. The WES data was analyzed using an open-source bioinformatics pipeline developed in-house, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kherraf et al., 2022</xref>). From these data, we identified two patients with homozygous truncating variants in the <italic>CCDC146</italic> (coiled-coil domain containing 146) gene, NM_020879.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which contains 19 exons in human. Sperm parameters of both patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. No other candidate variants reported to be associated with male infertility were detected in these patients. Despite an ubiquitous expression, this gene is highly transcribed in human testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The first identified mutation is located in exon 9 and corresponds to c.1084C&gt;T, the second is located in exon 15 and corresponds to c.2112Del (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The c.1084C&gt;T variant is a nonsense mutation, whereas the single-nucleotide deletion c.2112Del is predicted to induce a translational frameshift. Both mutations were predicted to produce premature stop codons: p.(Arg362Ter) and p.(Arg704serfsTer7), respectively, leading either to the complete absence of the protein or to the production of a truncated and non-functional protein. These variants are annotated with a high impact on the protein structure (MoBiDiC prioritization algorithm [MPA] score = 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yauy et al., 2018</xref>). The two mutations are therefore most likely deleterious. Both variants were absent in our control cohort and their minor allele frequencies (MAF), according to the gnomAD v3 database, were 6.984 × 10<sup>–5</sup> and 6.5 × 10<sup>–06</sup>, respectively. The presence of these variants and their homozygous state were verified by Sanger sequencing, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

To confirm this localization, we performed immunofluorescence experiments (IF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). First, we validated the specificity of the anti-CCDC146 antibody (Ab) in HEK-293T cells by expressing DDK-tagged CCDC146. We observed a nice colocalization of the DDK and CCDC146 signals in both interphase and mitotic cells, showing that both Abs target the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), strongly suggesting that the anti-CCDC146 Ab is specific. Next, we focused on the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In HEK-293T cells, using an antibody recognizing centrin (anti-centrin Ab) as a centriole marker and the anti-CCDC146 Ab, CCDC146 was shown to colocalize with centrioles. This colocalization strongly suggests that CCDC146 is a centriolar protein. However, the signal was not strictly localized to centrioles, as peri-centriolar labeling was clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A1d</xref>, overlay). As this labeling pattern suggests the presence of centriolar satellite proteins, we next performed co-labeling with an antibody recognizing PCM1, a canonical centriolar satellite marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Odabasi et al., 2020</xref>). Once again, the colocalization was only partial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, the presence of CCDC146 was assessed at the basal body of primary cilia in cells cultured under serum-deprived conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly to centrosome staining, CCDC146 was observed on the basal body by also around it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B1d</xref>).

To overcome a lack of specific antibodies recognizing mouse CCDC146 (the commercial Ab works for human CCDC146 only), a mouse strain expressing a HA-CCDC146 knock-in (KI) was created. Because the functional domains of the protein are unknown, and to limit as such as possible the risk of interfering with the structure of the protein, we choose to insert the hemagglutinin (HA) tag, which contains only nine amino acids (YPYDVPDYA). HA sequence was inserted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system into the coding sequence of the <italic>Ccdc146</italic> gene between the two first codons to produce a tagged protein at the N-terminus domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This insertion induced no phenotypic changes, and both female and male mice were viable with normal fertility. Interestingly, the protein was retained in epididymal sperm, where one band was observed around 120 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The theoretical MW of the tagged protein is around 116.2 kDa (115.1 + 1.1); the observed MW was slightly higher, suggesting that the protein migrates at a different weight or some post-translational modifications. The band is specific because it was observed in HA-CCDC146 sperm only and not in WT epididymal sperm. The protein is therefore present during spermatid differentiation and conserved in mature sperm. To better characterize the presence of CCDC146 in sperm, sperm flagella and heads were purified after mild sonication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and protein extracts were analyzed by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

For this study, we used the mouse model expressing HA-tagged CCDC146 protein.

We validated the specificity of the punctiform staining by performing a statistical comparison of the density of dots in the principal piece of WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Nevertheless, using U-ExM, on some spermatozoa with frayed microtubule doublets, that is, with the flagellum taking on the shape of a hair, we could find that isolated doublets carried the punctiform labeling confirming the results of analyses on human spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Taken together, these results from mouse and human sperm demonstrate that CCDC146 is an axonemal protein, probably associated with microtubule doublets.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>CCDC146 localizes to the microtubule doublets of the axoneme in human and mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sperm was double-stained with anti-tubulin (green) and anti-CCDC146 (magenta) Abs and observed by expansion microscopy.

We therefore hypothesized that CCDC146 could be a MIP. MIPs are generally resistant to solubilization by detergents. However, N-lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) can solubilize microtubule doublets, with increasing concentrations destabilizing first the A-tubule, then the B-tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanagisawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Witman et al., 1972</xref>). Microtubule solubilization allows release of the MIPs contained within the tubules, and the method is recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Linck, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirima and Oiwa, 2018</xref>). To test whether our hypothesis that CCDC146 may be a MIP, we treated spermatozoa from HA-tagged CCDC146 mice with sarkosyl and performed a WB on the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1 fig10sdata2">Figure 10—source data 1 and 2</xref>). The protein was effectively solubilized, leading to the appearance of bands at around 120 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel following migration of extracts from sperm treated with 0.2 and 0.4% sarkosyl concentrations. Interestingly, a second band around 90 kDa was also immunodecorated by anti-HA antibody in the sarkosyl treated sample, a band not present in the protein extracts from WT males. This band may correspond to proteolytic fragment of CCDC146, the solubilization of microtubules by sarkosyl may have made CCDC146 more accessible to endogenous proteases. The other detergents and buffers tested – RIPA, CHAPS, or Tris-HCl – barely solubilized CCDC146 or led to no solubilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata3">Figure 10—source data 3</xref>). This result confirms the unique action of sarkosyl on CCDC146 and strengthens the hypothesis that the protein is associated with the doublets of microtubules. To confirm the action of sarkosyl on the accessibility of the antigenic site, murine spermatozoa were labeled with an anti-HA antibody after treatment with sarkosyl or no treatment. CCDC146 labeling in the principal piece was significantly increased in the presence of sarkosyl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). The full image panel can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The presence of the protein in the midpiece was difficult to assess because non-specific staining was observed in this area, the non-specific staining being due to secondary antibodies as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>, where they were used alone.

For <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO males, although some sperm cells presented centrioles with almost normal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B2</xref>), centriole separation was visible in numerous spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B3 and B4</xref>), with the structures located far away from the connecting piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B5</xref>) or duplicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B6</xref>).

Moreover, acrosomes were severely impacted at steps 13–15 spermatid, with strong deformations and detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16H</xref>, blue arrowheads).</p><fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>Spermatid head shape is aberrant in the absence of CCDC146.</title><p>Comparative ultrastructural analysis of the spermatid head in WT (<bold>A–D</bold>) and <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO (<bold>E–H</bold>) testis sections.

This gene was first described in mice by our team earlier this year in the context of a research project on the different types of genetic causes of sperm abnormalities in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martinez et al., 2022</xref>). However, no data other than the sperm phenotype (MMAF) was presented in this initial report. In this article, we present for the first time, the evidence of the presence of mutations in humans and a description of the localization of the protein in somatic and germ cells. We also examined the lesion spectrum at the subcellular level, to obtain a detailed view of the molecular pathogenesis associated with defects in this gene.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Genetic complexity of MMAF</title><p>The question of how to interpret and annotate the mutations identified by high-throughput sequencing is an important issue in clinical genetics. The most difficult step is certainly the identification of genes associated with a given disease. Beyond pure genetic data and the pathogenicity of mutations, a fundamental element is the reproduction of the disease when the gene is absent in an animal model. When these two elements are combined – KO photocopying disease and pathogenicity of the identified mutations – the probability of mutation causality in the studied disease is very high. Both mutations are predicted to produce a premature stop codons: p.Arg362Ter and p.Arg704serfsTer7, leading either to the complete absence of the protein in case of non-sense mediated mRNA decay or to the production of a truncated protein missing almost two-third or one-fourth of the protein, respectively. <italic>CCDC146</italic> is very well conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), including the 3′ end of the protein which contains a large coil-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In view of the very high degree of conservation, it is most likely that the 3′ end of the protein, absent in both subjects, is critical for the CCDC146 function and hence that both mutations are deleterious. These results, combined with the fact that the absence of CCDC146 is deleterious in mice and induces an infertility similar to that observed in the human, enable us to associate <italic>CCDC146</italic> with MMAF syndrome in humans.</p><p>It is essential to characterize all genes involved in male infertility. Therefore, the characterization of a new gene involved in MMAF syndrome is not just ‘one more gene’. First, it further confirms that MMAF syndrome is a heterogeneous recessive genetic disease, currently associated with defects in more than 50 genes. Second, it helps direct the diagnostic strategy to be directed during genome-wide searches. The type of profiling required for MMAF is very different from that performed for instance for cystic fibrosis, where one mutation is responsible for more than 50% of cases. Third, the discovery of all genes involved in MMAF is important in the context of oligogenic heterozygous inheritance of sperm abnormalities in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martinez et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, a homozygous deleterious mutation is found in only half of all MMAF patients, suggesting that other modes of inheritance must be involved. Only by establishing an extended list of genes linked to MMAF will it be possible to determine whether oligogenic heterozygous inheritance is a relevant cause of this syndrome in humans. Finally, some of the genes involved in MMAF syndrome are also involved in ciliary diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sironen et al., 2020</xref>). By further exploring MMAF-type infertility, we can hope to enhance our understanding of another underlying pathology. Although the vast majority of patients with PCD are diagnosed before 5 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2014</xref>), one study showed that in a cohort of 240 adults with a mean age of 36 y (36 ± 13) presenting with chronic productive cough and recurrent chest infections, PCD was identified for the first time in 10% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shoemark et al., 2007</xref>). This result suggests that infertility diagnosis can occur before PCD diagnosis, and consequently that infertility management might improve PCD diagnosis and care.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CCDC146 is present in flagellum and absent in sperm centriole</title><p>Several proteomics studies of the sperm centriole identified CCDC146 as a centrosome-associated protein in bovine sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amargant et al., 2021</xref>), a species where centrioles are present in ejaculated sperm. Using a different methodological approach, based on IF with conventional and expansion microscopy, we observed no CCDC146 signal in centrioles from testicular mouse and ejaculated human sperm. The same result was obtained with two different types of antibodies: with human sperm, we used a commercial anti-CCDC146 Ab, whereas with mouse sperm we used several anti-HA antibodies. The same IF approach allowed us to clearly identify the sperm centrosome using a number of antibodies such as anti-POC5 and anti-β tubulin, ruling out a possible failure of our IF protocol. It is worth noting that centrosomal proteins were isolated from whole flagella using several strategies including sequential use of multiple detergents, and that the centrosomal proteins were purified in the last fractions. These results indicate that CCDC146 is in fact barely soluble in conventional buffers, which could explain why it is co-purified with the centrosomal fraction in proteomics studies.</p><p>In epididymal mouse sperm, the biochemical analyses showed the presence of the protein in the flagellum only, and not in the head fractions: the detection of the band appeared very quickly at visualization and became very strong after few minutes, demonstrating that the protein is abundant in the flagella. It is important to note that epididymal sperm do not have centrioles and therefore this signal is not a centriolar signal. We also performed a statistical analysis showing that the immunostaining observed in the principal piece of mouse sperm is very specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the intracellular localization of CCDC146 in the flagellum of mouse sperm. In human, we obtained very similar results, with a flagellar localization. Using expansion microscopy, we show that the protein is associated with the microtubule doublets in both mouse sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>) and human sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, CCDC146 was solubilized with the sarkosyl detergent only, known to destabilize microtubules and generally used to identify microtubule inner proteins (MIP) and the CCDC146 fluorescent signal was enhanced when sperm were treated with this peculiar detergent. Expansion microscopy also revealed a strong signal in mouse sperm at the point of axoneme rupture. Taken together, these elements strongly suggest that CCDC146 is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and may be a MIP. However, more experiments need to be performed to validate the inner localization of CCDC146 because there are other proteins, located in the peri-axonemal structure of the axoneme, that are difficult to solubilize as well.</p><p>Finally, in human sperm, staining was observed on acrosome and in the midpiece. Staining on acrosome should always be taken with caution in sperm. Indeed, numerous glycosylated proteins are present at the surface of the plasma membrane regarding the outer acrosomal membrane for sperm attachment and are responsible to numerous nonspecific staining. Moreover this acrosomal staining was not observed in mouse sperm, strongly suggesting that it is not specific.</p><p>Concerning the staining in the midpiece observed in both conventional and expansion microscopy, it also seems to be nonspecific and associated with secondary Abs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref> showing the localization of POC5, a very similar staining of the midpiece was also observed, although POC5 was never described to be present in the midpiece, therefore questioning the specificity of the signal observed with the anti-CCDC146 antibody in the midpiece. POC5 and CCDC146 staining experiments shared the same secondary Ab and the midpiece signal was likely due to it. For midpiece staining observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref> by IF, it is worth to note that a similar staining was observed when secondary Ab were used alone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The strong fluorescent signal is clearly due to secondary Abs, likely masking the punctuate staining of the axoneme.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional complexity of CCDC146</title><p>The results presented in this report show striking differences in localization of CCDC146 between somatic and germ cells. Our results show that the protein displays several subcellular localizations, which vary according to the cell cycle, and the cell nature. In somatic cells, the protein is mostly associated with the centrosome and other microtubular structures – in particular, the mitotic spindle – at the end of microtubules and at the level of the kinetochore and the midbody. These observations also identify CCDC146 as a MAP. In contrast, in spermatozoa, our results indicate that CCDC146 is an axonemal protein that seems to be associated with the microtubule doublets. Despite its broad cellular distribution, the association of CCDC146 with tubulin-dependent structures is remarkable. However, centrosomal and axonemal localizations in somatic and germ cells, respectively, have also been reported for CFAP58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020b</xref>), thus the reuse of centrosomal proteins in the sperm flagellar axoneme is not unheard of. In addition, 80% of all proteins identified as centrosomal are found in multiple localizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). The ability of a protein to home to several locations depending on its cellular environment has been widely described, in particular for MAP. The different localizations are linked to the presence of distinct binding sites on the protein. For example, MAP6 binds and stabilizes microtubules, through Mc modules, and associates with membranes and neuroreceptors through palmitoylated cysteines. MAP6 can also localize in the microtubule lumen, in its role as MIP, thanks to its Mn modules. Finally, in addition to its associations with subcellular compartments and receptors, the presence of proline-rich domains (PRD) in the MAP6 sequence allows it to bind to SH3-domain-containing proteins, and thus triggering activation of signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuveillier et al., 2021</xref>). Another example of a protein with multiple localizations is CFAP21, which is a MIP but also a cytosolic calcium sensor. In the latter capacity, CFAP21 modulates the interaction of STIM1 and ORAI1 upon depletion of calcium stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jardin et al., 2021</xref>). These examples illustrate the complexity of function of some multiple-domain proteins.</p><p>The fact that CCDC146 can localize to multiple subcellular compartments suggests that it also contains several domains. Interestingly, a PF05557 motif (Pfam mitotic checkpoint protein, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/E9Q9F7/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/E9Q9F7/</ext-link>) has been identified in the mouse CCDC146 sequence between amino acids 130 and 162. Proteins belonging to the ‘mitotic spindle checkpoint’ monitor correct attachment of the bipolar spindle to the kinetochores. The presence of this motif likely explains the ability of CCDC146 to localize to cell cycle-dependent subcellular compartments containing tubulin. However, the most important structural motifs identified in CCDC146 are the coiled-coil domains. Although coiled-coil domains play a structural role in a variety of protein interactions, their presence in CCDC146 remains mysterious, and how they contribute to its function remains to be elucidated. Nevertheless, this motif is compatible with a MIP function for this protein since several MIP proteins, including CCDC11 (FAP53), CCDC19 (FAP45), and CCDC173 (FAP210), are coiled-coil proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). It is worth noting that the ortholog of <italic>CCDC146</italic> in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, <italic>MBO2</italic>, codes for a protein required for the beak-like projections of doublets 5 and 6, located inside the lumen of the tubule B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Segal et al., 1984</xref>), in the proximal part of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellum. Although no beak-like projections are present in the mammalian axoneme, the location inside the tubule seems to be evolutionarily conserved. A more recent study of MBO2 showed that the protein is also present all along the flagellum of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and is tightly associated with microtubule doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tam and Lefebvre, 2002</xref>). These observations support our results showing association of CCDC146 with this axonemal structure.</p><p>The results presented here also show a striking difference in the phenotype induced by the lack of the protein in somatic and male germ cells. This protein is essential for spermatogenesis, and its absence leads to immotile non-functional sperm and to complete infertility in both humans and mice. Conversely, both patients and <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice seem to be healthy and present no other conditions such as PCD. CCDC146, despite its wide expression profile in many tissues, therefore seems to be dispensable except during spermatogenesis. Nevertheless, because this protein is localized on the tips of the spindle and may be involved in mitotic checkpoints, its absence may lead to late proliferative disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that <italic>CCDC146</italic> is reported to be downregulated in thyroid cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). The link between infertility and risk of cancer was recently underlined, with mutations found in genes like <italic>FANCM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasak et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it would be interesting to monitor aging in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO mice and to study their life expectancy and cancer rates compared to WT mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TEM reveals that lack of CCDC146 severely impacts microtubule-based organelles</title><p>No morphological defects were observed before the elongating spermatid stage, and in round spermatids, the acrosome started to spread on the nucleus in a normal way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Morphological defects appeared clearly from the onset of spermatid elongation. This result indicates that the protein is only necessary for late spermiogenesis, from the phase corresponding to flagellum biogenesis. All the organelles composed mainly of tubulin were strongly affected by the absence of the protein.</p><p>The manchette structure in elongating <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids was asymmetric, abnormally broad, and ectopic, leading to the formation of aberrantly shaped sperm heads. So far, manchette defects have been associated with defects in IFT, and intra-manchette transport (IMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lehti and Sironen, 2016</xref>). CCDC146 was only localized to the sperm axoneme by IF, and no signal was observed in the manchette, suggesting that CCDC146 is probably not involved in the transport machinery. Moreover, our results indicated that the manchette was remarkably long in elongated spermatids. A similar phenotype was observed in Katanin80-deficient animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O’Donnell et al., 2012</xref>). Katanin80 is a microtubule-severing enzyme that is important for manchette reduction. Interestingly, the absence of WDR62, a scaffold protein involved in centriole duplication, leads to defective katanin80 expression, and the presence of elongated manchettes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2021</xref>). In combination with our results, this detail suggests that the manchette’s structure and its reduction are influenced by centrosomal proteins, possibly through katanin80 defects. The precise molecular link between CCDC146 and manchette assembly and reduction remains to be identified.</p><p>The HTCA was also aberrant in <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids. Centrioles in elongating spermatids were frequently displaced from their implantation fossa at the nuclear envelope. We observed some correctly lodged centrioles in round spermatids; however, we are unable to determine with certainty whether the majority of centrioles failed to correctly attach or whether they detached from the nuclear envelope during spermatid elongation. Defects in cohesion of the HTCA have been associated with the acephalic spermatozoa syndrome and were shown to involve a number of proteins such as SUN5, SPATA6, and ODF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beurois et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyer-Fender, 2022</xref>). Here, we did not observe any sperm decapitation, suggesting that CCDC146 is involved in a different pathway controlling the HTCA. Moreover, elongating <italic>Ccdc146</italic> KO spermatids displayed supernumerary centrioles. Abnormal centriole numbers have also been reported in the absence of a few other centrosome-associated proteins including DZIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lv et al., 2020</xref>) and CCDC42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pasek et al., 2016</xref>), and of microtubule-regulating proteins such as katanin like-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunleavy et al., 2017</xref>) and tubulin deglutamylase CCP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giordano et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results suggest a relationship between the manchette and the centrioles. In the literature, there is limited information about this relationship. Studies of the spermiogenesis defects observed in different models deficient for centrosomal proteins show some common features such as abnormal manchette and duplicated centrosomes. The absence of these proteins does not appear to be directly responsible for these defects, rather it seems to modify the expression of microtubule regulatory proteins such as katanins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O’Donnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunleavy et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, there is a report showing that both organelles share molecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tapia Contreras and Hoyer-Fender, 2019</xref>).These modifications could explain the pleiotropic effect of the absence of CCDC146 on microtubule-based organelles.</p><p>In conclusion, by characterizing the genetic causes of human infertility, we not only improve the diagnosis and prognosis of these pathologies but also pave the way for the discovery of new players in spermatogenesis. We are constantly adding to the number of proteins present in the flagella of the mammalian spermatozoa that are necessary for its construction and functioning. This study showed that CCDC146, a protein previously described as a centrosomal protein in somatic and germ cells, localizes in spermatozoa’s axonemal microtubule doublets. The presence of CCDC146 in somatic cells’ centrosomes gives weight to the idea of a centrosome with a dynamic composition, allowing it to fulfill its multitude of functions throughout all the phases of cellular life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Among pathologies with multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagellum (MMAF), only 50% of the patients have no identified genetic causes. It is thus primordial to find novel genes that cause the MMAF syndrome. In the current work, the authors follow up the identification of two patients with MMAF carrying a mutation in the CCDC146 gene. To understand how mutations in CCDC146 lead to male infertility, the authors generated two mouse models: a CCDC146-knockout mouse, and a knockin mouse in which the CCDC146 locus is tagged with an HA tag. Male CCDC146-knockout mice are infertile, which proves the causative role of this gene in the observed MMAF cases. Strikingly, animals develop no other obvious pathologies, thus underpinning the specific role of CCDC146 in male fertility. The authors have carefully characterised the subcellular roles of CCDC146 by using a combination of expansion and electron microscopy. They demonstrate that all microtubule-based organelles, such as the sperm manchette, the centrioles, as well as the sperm axonemes are defective when CCDC146 is absent. Their data show that CCDC146 is a microtubule-associated protein, and indicate, but do not prove beyond any doubt, that it could be a microtubule-inner protein (MIP).</p><p>This is a solid work that defines CCDC146 as a novel cause of male infertility. The authors have performed comprehensive phenotypic analysis to define the defects in CCDC146 knockout mice. The manuscript text is well written and easy to follow also for non-specialists. The introduction and discussion chapters contain important background information that allow to put the current work into the greater context of fertility research. Overall, this manuscript provides convincing evidence for CCDC146 being essential for male fertility and illustrates this with a large panel of phenotypic observations. Together, the work provides important first insights into the role of a so-far unexplored proteins, CCDC146, in spermatogenesis, thereby broadening the spectrum of genes involved in male infertility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>First of all, we'd like to thank the three reviewers for their meticulous work that enable us to present now an improved manuscript and substantial changes were made to the article following reviewers' and editors' recommendations. We read all their comments and suggestions very carefully. Apart from a few misunderstandings, all comments were very pertinent. We responded positively to almost all the comments and suggestions, and as a result, we have made extensive changes to the document and the figures. This manuscript now contains 16 principal figures and 15 figure supplements.</p><p>The number of principal figures is now 16 (1 new figure), and additional panels have been added to certain figures. On the other hand, we have added 7 additional figures (supplement figures) to answer the reviewers' questions and/or comments.</p><p>Main figures</p><p>▪ Figures 1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: unchanged ▪ Figure 7 and 8 were switched.</p><p>▪ Figure 2: we added panel F in response to reviewer 3's and request for sperm defect statistics</p><p>▪ Figure 3: the contrast in panel B has been taken over to homogenize colors</p><p>▪ Figure 6: This figure was recomposed. The WB on testicular extract was suppressed and we present a new WB allowing to compare the presence of CCDC146 in the flagella fraction. Using an anti-HA Ab, we demonstrate that the protein is localized in the flagella in epididymal sperm. Request of the 3 reviewers.</p><p>▪ Figure 7 (old 8): to avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum. Moreover, the WB was removed and is now presented in figure 6 (improved as requested).</p><p>▪ Figure 8.

Answer to question requested by reviewer 2 note #1</p><p>All the reviewers' and editors’ comments have been answered (see our point to point response) and we resubmit what we believe to be a significantly improved manuscript. We strongly hope that we meet all your expectations and that our manuscript will be suitable for publication in &quot;eLife&quot;. We look forward to your feedback,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point by point answer</p><p>Please note that there has been active discussion of the manuscript and the summarize points below is the minimal revision request that the reviewers think the authors should address even under this new review model system. It was the reviewers' consensus that the manuscript is prepared with a lot of oversights - please see all the minor points to improve your manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>All minimal revision requests have been addressed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minimal revision request</p><p>1. Clinical report/evaluation of the two patients should be given as it was not described even in their previous study as well as full description of CCDC146.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide now a new Figure 1-figure supplement 1 describing the patients sperm parameters</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Antibody specificity should be provided, especially given two of the reviewers were not convinced that the mid piece signal is non-specific as the authors claim. As both KO and KI model in their hands, this should be straightforward.</p></disp-quote><p>To validate the specificity of the Antibody, we transfected HEK cells with a human DDK-tagged CCDC146 plasmid and performed a double immunostaining with a DDK antibody and the CCDC146 antibody. We show that both staining are superimposable, strongly suggesting that the CCDC146 Ab specifically target CCDC146. This experiment is now presented in Figure 4-Figure supplement 1.Next, to avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors should improve statistical analysis to support their experimental results for the reader can make fair assessment. Combined with clear demonstration of ab specificity, this lack of statistical analysis with very few sample number is a major driver of dampening enthusiasm towards the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>Several statistical analyses were carried out and are now included:</p><p>1. distribution of the HA signal in mouse sperm cells (see point 2 Figure 7 panel B)</p><p>2. quantification and statistical analyses of the defect observed in Ccdc146 KO sperm (figure 2 panelE)</p><p>3. Quantification and statistical analyses of the length of the manchette in spermatids 13-15 steps (Figure 13-Figure supplement 1 new)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors need to clarify (peri-centriolar vs. centriole)</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 4A, we have clearly shown that the protein colocalizes with centrin, a centriolar core protein in somatic cells. This colocalization strongly suggests that CCDC146 is therefore a centriolar protein, and this is now clearly indicated lines 211-212. However, its localization is not restricted to the centrioles and a clear staining was also observed in the pericentriolar material (PCM). The presence of a protein in PCM and centriole was already described, and the best example is maybe gamma-tubulin (PMID: 8749391).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>or tone down (CCDC146 to be a MIP) of their claim/description.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning its localization in sperm, we agree with the reviewer that our demonstration that CCDC146 is MIP would deserve more results. Because of that, we have toned down the MIP hypothesis throughout the manuscript. See lines 491495</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Testis-specific expression of CCDC146 as it is not consistent with their data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also modified our claim concerning the testis-expression of CCDC146. Line 176</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. As described in general comments, this study limits how the CCDC146 deficiency impairs abnormal centriole and manchette formation. The authors should explain their relationship in developing germ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, there are limited information about the relationship between the manchette and the centriole. However, few articles have highlighted that both organelles share molecular components. For instance, WDR62 is required for centriole duplication in spermatogenesis and manchette removal in spermiogenesis (Commun Biol. 2021; 4: 645. doi: 10.1038/s42003-021-02171-5). Another study demonstrates that CCDC42 localizes to the manchette, the connecting piece and the tail (Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2019 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2019.00151">https://doi.org/10.3389/fcell.2019.00151</ext-link>). These articles underline that centrosomal proteins are involved in manchette formation and removal during spermiogenesis and support our results showing the impact of CCDC146 lack on centriole and manchette biogenesis. This information is now discussed. See lines 596-603</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors generated knock-in mouse model. If then, are the transgene can rescue the MMAF phenotype in CCDC146-null mice? This reviewer strongly suggest to test this part to clearly support the pathogenicity by CCDC146.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed wrote that we created a “transgenic mice”, which was misleading. We actually created a CCDC16 knock-in expressing a tagged-protein. The strain was actually made by CRISPR-Cas9 and a sequence coding for the HA-tag was inserted just before the first amino acid in exon 2, leading to the translation of an endogenous HA-tagged CCDC146 protein. We have removed the word transgenic from the text and made changes accordingly (see lines 250-253). We can therefore not use this strain to rescue the MMAF phenotype as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Although the authors cite the previous study (Coutton et al., 2019), the study does not describe any information for CCDC146 and clinical information for the patients. The authors must show the results for clinical analysis to clarify the attended patients are MMAF patients without other phenotypic defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now inserted a table, indicating all sperm parameters for the patients harboring a mutation in the CCDC146 gene (Figure 1-Figure supplement 1) and is now indicated lines 159-160</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors describe CCDC146 expression is dominant in testes, However, the level in testis is only moderate in human (Supp Figure 1). Thus, this description is not suitable.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1-figure supplement 2 (old FigS1), the median of expression in testis is around 12 in human, a value considered as high expression by the analysis software from Genevestigator. However, for mouse, it is true that the level of expression is medium. We assumed that reviewer’s comment concerned testis expression in mouse. To take into account this remark, we changed the text accordingly. See line 176.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Although the authors mentioned that two mice lines are generated, only one line information is provided. Authors must include information for another line and provide basic characterization results to support the shared phenotype within the lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a revised Figure 2-figure supplement 1CD, presenting the second line and the corresponding text in the main text is found lines 178-183.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In somatic cells, the CCDC146 localizes at both peri-centriole and microtubule but its intracellular localization in sperm is distinguished. The authors should explain this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>The multi-localization of a centriolar protein is already discussed in detail in discussion lines 520-526. We have written:</p><p>“Despite its broad cellular distribution, the association of CCDC146 with tubulin-dependent structures is remarkable. However, centrosomal and axonemal localizations in somatic and germ cells, respectively, have also been reported for CFAP58 [37, 55], thus the re-use of centrosomal proteins in the sperm flagellar axoneme is not unheard of. In addition, 80% of all proteins identified as centrosomal are found in multiple localizations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome">https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/subcellular/centrosome</ext-link>). The ability of a protein to home to several locations depending on its cellular environment has been widely described, in particular for MAP. The different localizations are linked to the presence of distinct binding sites on the protein…. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Authors mention CCDC146 is a centriolar protein in the title and results subtitle. However, the description in results part depicts CCDC146 is a peri-centriolar protein, which makes confusion. Do the authors claim CCDC146 is centrosomal protein?</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 4A, we have clearly shown that the protein colocalizes with centrin, a centriolar core protein. This colocalization strongly suggests that CCDC146 is therefore a centriolar protein in somatic cells, and is now clearly indicated lines 211-212. However, its localization is not restricted to the centrioles and a clear staining was also observed in the pericentriolar material (PCM). The presence of a protein in PCM and centriole was already described and the best example is maybe gamma-tubulin (PMID:8749391).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Verification of the antibody against CCDC146 must be performed and shown to support the observed signal are correct. 2nd antibody only signal is not proper negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very important remark. The commercial antibody raised against human CCDC146 was validated in HEK293-cells expressing a DDK-tagged CCDC146 protein. Cells were co-marked with anti-DDK and anti-CCDC146 antibodies. We have a perfect colocalization of the staining. This experiment is now presented in Figure 4-figure supplement 1 and presented in the text (lines 206-208).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In human sperm, conventional immunostaining reveals CCDC146 is detected from acrosome head and midpiece. However, in ExM, the signal at acrosome is not detected. How is this discrepancy explained? The major concern for the ExM could be physical (dimension) and biochemical (properties) distortion of the sample. Without clear positive and negative control, current conclusion is not clearly understood. Furthermore, it is unclear why the authors conclude the midpiece signal is non-specific. The authors must provide experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Staining on acrosome should always be taken with caution in sperm. Indeed, numerous glycosylated proteins are present at the surface of the plasma membrane regarding the outer acrosomal membrane for sperm attachment and are responsible for numerous nonspecific staining. Moreover, this acrosomal staining was not observed in mouse sperm, strongly suggesting that it is not specific.</p><p>Concerning the staining in the midpiece observed in both conventional and Expansion microscopy, it also seems to be nonspecific and associated with secondary Abs.</p><p>For IF, we now provide new images showing clearly the nonspecific staining of the midpiece when secondary Ab were used alone (see Figure 10-figure supplement 1B).</p><p>For ExM, we provide new images in Figure 8-figure supplement 1B (POC5 staining) showing a staining of the midpiece (likely mitochondria), although POC5 was never described to be present in the midpiece. Both experiments (CCDC146 and POC5 staining by ExM) shared the same secondary Ab and the midpiece signal was likely due to it.</p><p>Moreover, we now provide new images (figure 7C) in ExM on mouse sperm showing no staining in the midpiece and demonstrating that the punctuated signal is present all along the flagellum. Finally, we would like to underline that we now provide new IF results, using an anti-HA conjugated with alexafluor 488 and confirming the ExM results.</p><p>These points are now discussed lines 498-502 for acrosome and lines 503-511 for midpiece staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For intracellular localization of the CCDC146 in mouse sperm, the authors should provide clear negative control using WT sperm which do not carry the transgene.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was performed.</p><p>To avoid the issue of the non-specificity of secondary antibodies, we performed a new set of IF experiments using an HA Tag Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Antibody (anti-HA-AF488-C Ab) on WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific. We have added a paragraph in the MM section to describe the process of image analysis. We finally present new images obtained by ExM showing no staining in the midpiece (figure 7C new). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the presence of the protein in the flagellum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Current imaging data do not clearly support the intracellular localization of the CCDC146. Although western blot imaging reveal that CCDC146 is detected from sperm flagella, this is crude approach. Thus, this reviewer highly recommends the authors provide more clear experimental evidence, such as immuno EM.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide now a WB comparing the presence of the protein in the flagellum and in the head fractions; see new figure 6. We show that CCDC146 is only present in the flagellum fraction; The detection of the band appeared very quickly at visualization and became very strong after few minutes, demonstrating that the protein is abundant in the flagella. It is important to note that epididymal sperm do not have centrioles and therefore this signal is not a centriolar signal. We also now provide new statistical analyses showing that the immuno-staining observed in the principal piece is very specific (Figure 7B). Altogether, these results demonstrate unequivocally the intracellular localization of CCDC146 in the flagellum. This point is now discussed lines 480-489</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Although sarkosyl is known to dissociate tubulin, it is not well understood and accepted that the enhanced detection of CCDC146 by the detergent indicates its microtubule inner space. Sperm axoneme to carry microtubule is also wrapped peri-axonemal components with structural proteins, which are even not well solubilized by high concentration of the ionic detergent like SDS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the solubilization of the protein by sarkozyl is not a proof of the presence of the protein inside microtubule. Taking into account this point, the MIP hypothesis was toned down and we now discuss alternative hypothesis concerning these results; See discussion lines 490-497</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Some repetitive figures can be removed to streamline to grasp the overall story easier. Some claims are not fully supported by evidence that need to tone down. Some figures not referenced in the main text need to be mentioned at least once.</p></disp-quote><p>All figures are now referenced in the text</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. 163-164 - Please clarify the claim that there is going to be an absence of the protein or nonfunctional protein, especially for the patient with a deletion that could generate a truncated protein at two third size of the full-length protein. Similarly, 35% of the protein level is present for the patient with a nonsense mutation. Some in silico structural analysis or analysis of conserved domains would be beneficial to support these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Both mutations are predicted to produce a premature stop codons: p.Arg362Ter and p.Arg704serfsTer7, leading either to the complete absence of the protein in case of non-sense mediated mRNA decay or to the production of a truncated protein missing almost two third or one fourth of the protein respectively. CCDC146 is very well conserved throughout evolution (Figure supplementary 1), including the 3’ end of the protein which contains a large coil-coil domain (Figure 1B). In view of the very high degree of conservation, it is most likely that the 3’ end of the protein, absent in both subjects, is critical for the CCDC146 function and hence that both mutations are deleterious. This explanation is now added to the discussion. see lines 439-448</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. 173, 423 - Please clearly state a rationale of your mouse model design (i.e., why a mouse model that recapitulate human mutation is not generated) as the truncations identified in human patients are located further towards the C-terminus, and it is not clear whether truncated proteins are present, and if so, they could still be functional. Basically, the current mouse model supports the causality of the human mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question, which goes beyond the scope of this article, and raises the question of how to confirm the pathogenicity of mutations identified by high-throughput sequencing. The production of KO or KI animals is an important tool to help confirm one’ suspicions but the first element to take into consideration is the nature of the genetic data.</p><p>Here we had two patients with homozygous truncating variants. In human, it is well established that the presence of premature stop codons usually induces non-sense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), inducing the complete absence of the protein or a strong reduction in protein production. In the unlikely absence of NMD in our two patients, the identified variants would induce the production of proteins missing 60% and 30% of their C terminal part. Often (and it is particularly true for structural proteins) the production of abnormal proteins is more deleterious than the complete absence of the protein (and it is most likely the purpose of NMD, to limit the production of abnormal “toxic” proteins). For these reasons, to try to recapitulate the most likely consequences of the human variants, without risking obtaining an even more severe effect, we decided to introduce a stop codon in the first exon in order to remove the totality of the protein in the KO mice.</p><p>The second element is to interpret the phenotype of the KO animals. Here, the human sperm phenotype is perfectly recapitulated in the KO mice.</p><p>Overall, we have strong genetic arguments in human and the reproduction of the phenotype in KO mice confirming the pathogenicity of the variants identified in men.</p><p>This point is now discussed see lines 433-438</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

These results are now presented in figure 7 panel A (new). The specificity of the signal obtained with the anti-HA-AF488-C Ab on mouse spermatozoa was evaluated by performing a statistical study of the density of dots in the principal piece of the flagellum from HA-CCDC146 and WT sperm. These results are now presented in figure 7 panel B (new). This study was carried out by analyzing 58 WT spermatozoa and 65 CCDC146 spermatozoa coming from 3 WT and 3 KI males. We found a highly significant difference, with a p-value &lt;0.0001, showing that the signal obtained on spermatozoa expressing the tagged protein is highly specific.

This rational is now indicated in the manuscript lines 251-254. It is worth to note, that the tagged-strain shows no sperm defect, demonstrating that the HA-tag does not interfere with CCDC146 function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

See lines 258-259</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The annotation of Fig 6 panels is problematic. First, why do the authors write &quot;Laemmli&quot; as description of the gel? It would be more helpful to write what is loaded on the gel, such as &quot;sperm&quot;. Second, in panels B and C it would be helpful to add the antibodies used. It is not clear why there is a signal in the WT lane of panel B, but not in the HA lane (supposing an anti-HA antibody is used: why has WT a specific HA band?). In panel C, it is not clear why the blot that has so beautifully shown a single band in panel B suddenly gives such a bad labelling. Can the authors explain this? Also, they cut off the blot, likely because to too much background, but this is bad practice as full blots should be shown. In the current state, the panel C does not allow any clear conclusion. To make it conclusive, it must be repeated.</p></disp-quote><p>Several mistakes were present in this figure. This figure was recomposed. The WB on testicular extract was suppressed and we now present a new WB allowing to compare the presence of CCDC146 in the flagella and head fractions from WT and HA-CCDC146 sperm.

It seems that in both, Fig 7 and 8, the authors use expansion microscopy to localise CDCC146 in sperm tails. However, the staining differs substantially between the two figures. How is this explained?</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 8 we used the commercial Ab in human sperm, whereas in figure 7 we used the anti-HA Abs in mouse sperm. Because the antibodies do not target the same part of the CCDC146 protein (the tag is placed at the N-terminus of the protein, and the HPA020082 Ab targets the last 130 amino acids of the Cter), their accessibility to the antigenic site could be different. However, it is important to note that both antibodies target the flagellum. This explanation is now inserted see lines 304-312</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig 8D and line 274: the authors do a fractionation, but only show the flagella fraction. Why?</p><p>Showing all fractions of their experiment would have underpinned the specific enrichment of CDCC146 in the flagella fraction, which is what they aim to show. Actually, given the absence of control proteins, the fact that the band in the flagellar fraction appears to be weaker than in total sperm, one could even conclude that there is more CDCC146 in another (not analysed) fraction of this experiment. Thus, the experiment as it stands is incomplete and does not, as the authors claim, confirm the flagellar localisation of the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s remark.
