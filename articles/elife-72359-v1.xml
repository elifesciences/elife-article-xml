Heterozygous germline mutations in <italic>DNMT3A</italic> lead to Tatton-Brown-Rahman Syndrome (TBRS), characterized by obesity and excessive height. While DNMT3A is known to impact feeding behavior via the hypothalamus, here we investigated a role in adipocyte progenitors utilizing heterozygous knockout mice that recapitulate cardinal TBRS phenotypes. These mice become morbidly obese due to adipocyte enlargement and tissue expansion. Adipose tissue in these mice exhibited defects in preadipocyte maturation and precocious activation of inflammatory gene networks, including interleukin-6 signaling. Adipocyte progenitor cell lines lacking DNMT3A exhibited aberrant differentiation. Furthermore, mice in which <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> was specifically ablated in adipocyte progenitors showed enlarged fat depots and increased progenitor numbers, partly recapitulating the TBRS obesity phenotypes. Loss of DNMT3A led to constitutive DNA hypomethylation, such that the DNA methylation landscape of young adipocyte progenitors resemble that of older wild-type mice. Together, our results demonstrate that DNMT3A coordinates both the central and local control of energy storage required to maintain normal weight and prevent inflammatory obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>adipose</kwd><kwd>DNMT3A</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>CpG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jaime M Reyes</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reyes</surname><given-names>Jaime M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes &amp; Digestive &amp; Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK114356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartig</surname><given-names>Sean M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes &amp; Digestive &amp; Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK092883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodell</surname><given-names>Margaret A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG036695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodell</surname><given-names>Margaret A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA222736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yung-Hsin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA183252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodell</surname><given-names>Margaret A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Normal adipogenesis requires de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) for proper differentiation and suppression of an age-associated pathogenic inflammatory program.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>De novo DNA methyltransferase 3 A (<italic>DNMT3A</italic>) plays a central role in establishing DNA methylation patterns during mammalian early embryogenesis and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> in mice results in postnatal lethality, confirming its necessity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 1992</xref>). In humans, somatic mutations in <italic>DNMT3A</italic> are enriched in the hematopoietic system during aging and malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tovy et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells alters their epigenetic landscape, increasing the stem cell pool through self-renewal at the expense of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Challen et al., 2011</xref>). Whether DNMT3A regulates differentiation in other stem cell populations is largely unknown.</p><p>Germline heterozygous mutations in <italic>DNMT3A</italic> lead to Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome (TBRS; OMIM: 615879) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tatton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>), a dominant disorder characterized by excessive height (~80% of individuals), intellectual disability (~80% of individuals), and obesity (~70% of individuals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tatton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tatton-Brown et al., 2018</xref>). We and others have recently shown that <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> haploinsufficent mice can be used to study TBRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tovy et al., 2022</xref>). These mice recapitulate key TBRS phenotypes, including enlarged body size and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christian et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms through which DNMT3A regulates weight gain in TBRS are incompletely understood.</p><p>Obesity is a complex energy balance disorder reflecting deficient communication between the hypothalamus and adipose tissue, and only a few genes have so far been identified in which mutations exert causal roles in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choquet and Meyre, 2010</xref>). Of these genes, the majority play a role in the central nervous system, which is pivotal in regulating behaviors controlling nutrient update and energy expenditure. Yet, although it is well known that mechanisms that impact adipocyte progenitor expansion and differentiation will also lead to obesity, the data on a potential role for DNA methylation in regulating adipose tissue are conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma and Kang, 2019</xref>). While broad inhibition of DNA methyltransferases with compounds such as 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine was reported to promote lipid accumulation in preadipocyte cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2016</xref>), DNMT inhibition in preadipocyte and mesenchymal precursor cell lines reduced adipogenic differentiation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016b</xref>). Similarly, the role of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> in body weight regulation is unclear. While one study showed homozygous ablation of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> specifically in hypothalamic Sim1-positive neurons led to hyperphagia and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kohno et al., 2014</xref>), knockout of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> in mature adipocytes protected mice from developing insulin resistance while on a high-fat-diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">You et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we utilize a mouse model of TBRS to establish that while dysregulation of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> indeed regulates food intake, <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> also plays a cell-intrinsic role in adipocyte progenitors to permit normal maturation. We find that, similar to its role in the hematopoietic system, DNMT3A regulates adipose stem and progenitor cell function. Our results establish that DNMT3A directly regulates obesity through the adipose tissue, in addition to its role in the hypothalamus, and demonstrate how constitutive loss of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> creates a domino effect in which excess feeding together with faulty adipocytes lead to obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterozygous <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> loss leads to adipose tissue expansion and weight gain</title><p>TBRS patients harbor heterozygous frameshift or missense mutations in <italic>DNMT3A</italic>, predicted to be partial or complete loss-of-function, distributed throughout the gene’s main functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tatton-Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tovy et al., 2022</xref>). In order to study the role of DNMT3A in weight gain and adipose tissue biology, we utilized mice heterozygous for a <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> null allele (‘3A-HET’) along with their wild-type (WT) counterparts. In humans, TBRS phenotypes become particularly evident around adolescence when patients exhibit marked height and weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tatton-Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, WT and 3A-HET mice were indistinguishable until around 3 months of age. However, by 6 months, both male and female 3A-HET mice were heavier than controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At 12 months of age, the cohort of HET averaged 3 standard deviations (SD) above the mean weight of WT mice, becoming obese (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). The increased length of 3A-HET mice, while statistically significant, was mild, and therefore could not account for the increased weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Body composition analysis was performed to determine whether fat versus lean mass contributed to the weight difference. We detected a steady increase in fat percentage and a concomitant reduction in lean mass in 3A-HET mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dnmt3a-HET mice become overweight and develop obesity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Weight of male <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>-HET (HET, n=14) and WT (n=12) littermates on regular chow. * p=0.03, ***&lt;p = 0.001 as determined by two-way ANOVA.

White adipose tissue (WAT) functions primarily to store energy, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) performs thermogenic functions. From WT and 3A-HET mice at 1 year of age, we dissected fat depots (gonadal, and subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue) and performed histological analysis to determine size of BAT and WAT adipocytes. On average, 3A-HET mice had heavier fat depots across all measured depots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and larger adipocytes in both WAT and BAT depots compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), suggesting the increase in total fat is largely due to hypertrophy. Expansion of adipocytes is often accompanied by infiltration of macrophages (CD45 +, F4\80 + cells) and indeed we measured more F4/80 cells in WAT from HET mice compared to WT mice at 1 year of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

In response to hormonal stimulation, 3T3-L1 and BAC-C4 terminally differentiate into adipocytes that accumulate triglycerides in the form of lipid droplets. To analyze the role of DNMT3A in adipocyte differentiation, we quantified lipid droplet size and number in our control and knockout lines.

We detected less FFA and glycerol in the plasma in 3A-HET mice compared to WT (~2 fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). This also correlated with decreased pHSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To address the role of DNMT3A directly in lipolysis, we also stimulated lipolysis ex vivo with ISO treatment of adipose fat pads extracted from 6-month-old WT and HET mice and measured release of FFA and glycerol. 3A-HET tissues displayed lower secretion of FFA from both BAT and WAT (gonadal, gWAT) compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that DNMT3A is essential to modulate the DNA methylation landscape during adipocyte development and aging, and that even heterozygous loss of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> blunts these dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Loss of DNMT3A induces a pro-inflammatory trajectory in young adipocytes</title><p>To identify genes influenced by loss or gain of DNA methylation in WT and 3A-HET cells, we performed gene ontology analysis using Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment (HOMER), analyzing hypo-DMRA and hyper-DMRA regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our analysis revealed that hypo-DMRA were largely associated with inflammatory and metabolic pathways, while hyper-DMRA were enriched for pathways associated with stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of DNMT3A, lower methylation reflects a failure to establish DNA methylation. Our cell lines and scRNAseq work revealed that 3A-HET cells fail to properly upregulate the adipogenesis gene program while aberrantly increasing a pro-inflammatory cell trajectory. Because WT hypo-DMRA were associated with pro-inflammatory pathways, we hypothesized that lower DNA methylation in those regions in young HET cells would correlate with higher activation of pro-inflammatory trajectory B. We therefore compared gene expression of stem, primed, and committed cell clusters in trajectories A or B separated by genotype to determine in which cell clusters hypo-DMRA led to upregulation of gene expression (average of log2 fold-change; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We detected significant correlation for the 3A-HET primed pre-adipocytes, and weaker correlation for committed pre-adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These results indicate that pro-inflammatory-associated regions that lose methylation during WT aging and are even less methylated in HET cells show increased gene expression in 3A-HET primed and committed cell clusters. Thus, reduced DNA methylation in those regions permits the activation of the pro-inflammatory genes.

We hypothesized that hyper-DMRAs that did not gain methylation over time in HET cells would be associated with upregulated genes.

Here, we establish a role for DNMT3A in regulating adipogenesis in vivo and in vitro and demonstrate that DNMT3A deficiency predisposes mice to obesity, even on a normal diet. We verified a role for DNMT3A in regulation of feeding and demonstrated for the first time a direct independent role for DNMT3A in regulating adipose tissue formation and function.</p><p>We show that heterozygous <italic>Dnmt3a</italic>-null mice recapitulate the obesity phenotype observed in TBRS along with increased length. Our studies show aberrant feeding behavior in HET mice which is in line with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kohno et al., 2014</xref>). In view of the recently established studies on the role of DNMT3A in emotional behavior and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LaPlant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2016</xref>), future studies may address the association between DNMT3A loss, complex neuro-psychiatric disorders and feeding behaviors.</p><p>Here, we report the particularly striking impact of reduced of DNMT3A on adipose tissue expansion and weight gain. Mutant mice displayed expanded fat depots of all types. Adipocytes were larger with decreased lipolysis as supported by phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses. The trajectory of weight gain is distinct from that of leptin-null mice, which become obese by 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). Instead, heterozygous <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> KO mice gain weight gradually, with marked tissue expansion evident mostly after 6 months. Nevertheless, after around 1 year, the HET mice are markedly obese, with body weight typically about a third higher than their WT counterparts. Future studies in which DNMT3A is restored in the HET model may further support the role of DNMT3A in regulation of lipolysis and inflammation in the adipose tissue.</p><p>We present evidence here that, in addition to its role in energy homeostasis through the central nervous system, DNMT3A directly regulates fat by enabling proper adipocyte progenitor development. The increased fat after ablation of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> specifically in inguinal depots supports a cell autonomous function for DNMT3A in preadipocytes. Furthermore, ablation of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> in white and brown preadipocyte progenitor cell lines led to incomplete differentiation, underscoring the direct role. While knockout of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> using Adiponectin<italic>-</italic>Cre, which is specific for fully differentiated adipocytes, did not lead to weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">You et al., 2017</xref>), this is expected given our hypothesis that DNMT3A primarily acts in stem and progenitor cells and not on differentiated cells. This concept was elegantly validated in the hematopoietic system where knockdown of <italic>DNMT3A</italic> in human macrophages had minimal effect compared to its loss in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lim et al., 2021</xref>). These results support the broader concept that a primary role for DNMT3A is in progenitors, enabling proper differentiation, after which it is dispensable.</p><p>Our data indicate that loss of DNMT3A expands adipocyte progenitors which exhibit aberrant differentiation: young 3A-HET mice displayed an increase in the preadipocyte pool and fewer committed cells compared to WT, and differentiated cells in vivo and in vitro were less functional by multiple measures. Paradoxically, this led to more adipose tissue and obesity. While counterintuitive, these results are in accord with observations from the hematopoietic system. Loss of DNMT3A leads to a marked increase in stem cell pool. Despite somewhat impaired differentiation, the greater number of stem cells leads to an overall increase in the number of differentiated cells in the peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Challen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>). This imbalance between self-renewal and differentiation is believed to underlie the propensity of DNMT3A mutations to contribute to clonal hematopoiesis and leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Challen and Goodell, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to blunted differentiation, loss of DNMT3A led to a precocious inflammatory phenotype in the adipose tissue. We used scRNAseq and DNA methylation analysis to define features of white adipose tissue over time in WT and HET mice. Similar to previously published scRNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Merrick et al., 2019</xref>), we identified stem-like DPP4<sup>high</sup> cells as a renewable source of adipocytes over time. The adipocyte precursors followed a pro-inflammatory trajectory characterized by elevated IL6 as WT mice aged. Strikingly, this pro-inflammatory program was already activated at 8 weeks in 3A-HET mice, months before development of obesity, suggesting that DNMT3A is required for proper adipocyte differentiation and prevents premature activation of a proinflammatory cascade. Differences in DNA methylation profiles between young and old WT and HET preadipocytes correlated closely with the precocious activation of the inflammatory cascade with reduced DNMT3A.</p><p>In obesity, adipose tissue inflammation is triggered by intrinsic signals including hypoxia, adipocyte death, and elevated lipid levels, which in turn exacerbate tissue dysfunction, lipotoxicity, inflammation, and metabolic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reilly and Saltiel, 2017</xref>). Not only did loss of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> alter adipocyte development, it also predisposed adipocytes towards a pro-inflammatory state prior to elevation of lipid levels. These results indicate that reduced DNMT3A impacts preadipocytes similarly to high-fat-diet-mediated obesity. Taken together, our study suggests that DNMT3A is essential for normal adipose tissue function over time, and DNMT3A may safeguard from inflammatory obesity in WT populations.</p><p>Given the known role of DNMT3A in regulating energy via the CNS, our data suggest a convergence with its activity in the adipose tissue. The constitutive reduced DNMT3A in TBRS patients creates a domino effect leading to the development of marked inflammatory obesity and metabolic disease. In future studies, it will be important to investigate how other tissues, such as the liver and the hematopoietic system, integrate into this cascade to contribute to obesity and its comorbidities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p>All mice were housed in AAALAC-accredited, specific-pathogen-free animal care facilities at Baylor College of Medicine, and all procedures were approved by the BCM Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol AN2234.

Within those overlapping HMRs, we defined DMRs that differ between genotypes by an average of 30% for the ageing DMRs and 20% for the DNMT3A dependent DMRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Gene ontology and gene enrichment</title><p>We used MsigDB and GSEA for gene enrichment analysis and hallmark pathway enrichment for RNAseq data and other genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). For the correlation between DMRA and the scRNA expression data we first identified genes differential (average log2 fold) within groups and cellular states as defined in the results section using the FindMarkers function from Seruat version 3.9.9 (logFC threshold = 0, minimum percentage = 0, bonferroni p-value). Next, we ranked genes by their fold change value and used the fGSEA analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Differentially methylated regions definition and analysis</title><p>Differentially methylated regions were initially defined on bases of the WT adipose methylation profile as either hypomethylated (methylation decreased ≥30%) or hypermethylated (methylation gain ≥30%) with age (hypo-DMRA and hyper-DMRA, respectively). For the purpose of methylation and gene expression correlations the association between the methylation status in those regions in HET adipose were further defined based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. For HET adipose we defined: WT hypo-DMRA and HET 8 weeks hypomethylated by at least 19% (blue regions from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) or regions defined as WT hyper-DMRA and HET 8 weeks and 1 year hypomethylated by at least 19% (purple regions from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

lipolysis and organismal metabolism. Focusing on a mouse model with heterozygous null mutations in DNMT3A, as seen in Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome in humans, the authors show that animals develop obesity with adipocyte hypertrophy. Using a combination of single cell analysis, additional genetic models, and bisulfite sequencing, the authors propose a mechanism whereby DNMT3A regulates adipocyte differentiation and overall metabolism. This well-written paper will be of broad interest to researchers studying metabolism, development, and epigenetics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72359.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Horsley</surname><given-names>Valerie</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03v76x132</institution-id><institution>Yale University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.13.460063">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.13.460063v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Do 3A-HET mice also have large inguinal white adipocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, most of our analyses were performed on gonadal and brown fat because we observed similar phenotypes across all depots. The transcriptomic analysis was performed on inguinal fat because the Prx-cre (used to ablate Dnmt3a specifically in adipocyte progenitors) is activated specifically in these depots. This approach allowed us to compare our data to that of Merrick et al., (2019) which was the main analysis of adipose tissue at the single-cell level published at the time of our experiment. We have added this rationale to the text and added a new section:</p><p>“To examine how loss of Dnmt3a affected these cell populations, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on cells isolated from inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) of WT and 3A-HET mice at 8-weeks and 1-year old. We focused on the subcutaneous inguinal adipocytes as this depot was previously investigated by scRNAseq enabling to use published data as reference for cluster annotation (Merrick et al., 2019).”</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the reviewer’s concern, we performed an additional analysis on the inguinal white fat. The analysis is consistent with other fat depots: DNMT3A-HET have larger adipocyte area in inguinal fat as well. We have added this measurement in Supplemental Figure 1 f and edited the text accordingly.</p><p>“We dissected fat depots (gonadal, and subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue) and performed histological analysis to determine size of BAT and WAT adipocytes. On average, 3A-HET mice had heavier fat depots across all measured depots”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the cellular models used in Figure 5, don't really add to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We kindly disagree with the reviewer as the cellular models in figure 5 help establish a role for DNMT3A in adipocyte biology that is not confounded by effects of Dnmt3a-KO in the brain in the context of the whole animal. In addition, the cell line findings offer important corroboration for our in vivo data, as the gene pathways that are differentially expressed in those preadipocytes cell lines recapitulate our in vivo findings from adipose Cre models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The in vivo phenotyping is incomplete. (a) The data from the metabolic cages in Figure 2 (main and supplement) should be shown as a trace over time rather than collapsing into a bar graph.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the trace over time figures in Supplemental Figure 2 per the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the data needs to be analyzed using a well validated approach, such as ANCOVA (eg. Mina et al., Cell Met, 2018; Tschop et al., Nat Meth, 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. Our data were in fact analyzed by ANCOVA using the ClaR online tool developed by Mina et al., as suggested by the reviewer. We have made sure to mention this now in the figure legend.</p><p>“Average hourly food consumption for WT (3 males and 3 females) and HET mice (3 males and 3 females) as averaged for data collected over 5 days. All analyses for CLMAS was done using CalR and the Statical analysis ACNOVA”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The ITT in Figure 2 does not appear to have worked. Neither group really showed any drop in blood glucose following insulin.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 2F we do see a 30% drop in glucose for WT mice that was not recapitulated in HET mice. We have added a bar graph describing the individual mice to show the drop in glucose levels at the 30 minutes time point post insulin injection (Figure 2f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) The authors argue that factors beyond altered feeding must explain the increased body weight in these mice. This could be tested definitively with a pair feeding study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We believe that it is the combination of multiple factors, including the overfeeding, that led to this phenotype as it takes the mice some time to gain more weight compared to their WT littermates. We agree that pair feeding study might be more definitive, but we feel that to observe that effect will take a much longer time, the study will be confounded by other aging-related factors that will be altered by DNMT3A, and this experiment will not likely change our explanation that both feeding as well as adipocyte-intrinsic factors account for the phenotype. We have endeavored to emphasize the view throughout the text that both aspects are relevant to the Dnmt3a-HET obesity phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) The Prx Cre driven deletion phenotyping in Figure 7 is quite superficial. At a minimum, the authors should perform histology and analysis of cell size as they do for the 3A-HET model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have sought to improve phenotyping with the suggested experiments. We now show that adipocyte area is significantly increased in the Prx-Cre Dnmt3a KO subq-adipocytes. As controls, we also show that gondal adipocytes, in which the Prx-cre is not expressed, are similar in size.</p><p>“In addition, like HET mice PRX-D3A mice also displayed larger adipocytes in the subcutaneous inguinal fat in which Dnmt3a is ablated, while maintaining similar adipocyte size in gonadal fat in which the Prx Cre is not expressed (Figure 7C). Consistent with expansion of adipose tissue in these mice we also detected an increase in plasma leptin in PRX-D3A mice (Figure 7D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is an overstatement from the authors to state that heterozygous loss of DNMT3A results in proinflammatory obesity (in reference to data in Figures 3 and 4). If the authors want to make this point, this should be definitely shown either by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry of adipose tissue and/or by measurement of systemic markers of inflammation.</p></disp-quote><p>We show IL6 levels in adipose tissue by flow cytometry and now show increased infiltration of macrophages into WAT in HET mice compared to WT mice (Supplemental Figure 1e). We have also tuned down wording throughout the text and adjusted the title of the inflammatory section to:</p><p>“Loss of DNMT3A leads to inflammatory phenotype in adipose tissue”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 6, are the defects in lipolysis rescued by an add-back to restore normal DNMT3A levels?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment however for technical reasons we were not able to perform the add back experiments. We have added a comment in the discussion that restoring Dnmt3a function could provide additional support to its role.</p><p>“Here we report the particularly striking impact of reduced of DNMT3A on adipose tissue expansion and weight gain. Mutant mice displayed expanded fat depots of all types. Adipocytes were larger with decreased lipolysis as supported by phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses. Future studies in which DNMT3A is restored in the HET model may further support the role of DNMT3A in regulation of lipolysis and inflammation in adipose tissue.”</p><p>However, we note that the experiments were done with 2-3 independent Dnmt3a KO clones and results are consistent, so we feel our data support the conclusions. We also performed experiments in vivo to measure lipolysis and observed similar trends in HET mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data from the bisulfite sequencing would be more compelling if the authors did qPCR of a selection of genes that are hypo- or hypermethylated to show that the results from bisulfite sequences are consistent with predicted changes at the mRNA level.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We performed this experiment in a new group of 1-year old WT and HET mice (n=3-4), and all but 1 gene that were found to be hypomethylated and upregulated in the scRNAseq were also upregulated in the qRT data. We have added these data to Supplemental Figure 9f, and modified the methylation Figure 9 to display representative genes from those validated by qRT.</p></body></sub-article></article>
