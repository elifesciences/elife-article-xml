In a previous neuroimaging study (Geuter et al., 2017) we observed an important role of the insula in such a model but could not establish its temporal aspects. Here, we employed electroencephalography to investigate neural representations of predictions and prediction errors in heat and pain processing. Our data show that alpha-to-beta activity was associated with stimulus intensity expectation, followed by a negative modulation of gamma band activity by absolute prediction errors. This is in contrast to prediction errors in visual and auditory perception, which are associated with increased gamma band activity, but is in agreement with observations in working memory and word matching, which show gamma band activity for correct, rather than violated, predictions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thermoception</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>expectation</kwd><kwd>prediction error</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>422744262–TRR 289 project A02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Büchel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG SFB TR 169 project B3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-AdG-883892-PainPersist</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Büchel</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>422744262–TRR 289 project A03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rose</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Key variables required for pain perception in the context of a predictive coding model are correlated with distinct oscillatory profiles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been shown that physically identical nociceptive input can lead to variable sensations of pain, depending on contextual factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tracey and Mantyh, 2007</xref>). In particular, attention, reappraisal, and expectation are core mechanisms that influence how nociception leads to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiech et al., 2008</xref>). A clinically important example of how expectations can shape pain processing is placebo hypoalgesia: pain relief mediated by expectation and experience – in the absence of active treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petrovic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wager et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colloca and Benedetti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bingel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atlas and Wager, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anchisi and Zanon, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the context of a generative model of pain, it has been proposed that pain perception can be seen as the consequence of an integration of expectations with nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Büchel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wiech, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ongaro and Kaptchuk, 2019</xref>). In this framework, expectations are integrated with incoming nociceptive information and both are weighted by their relative precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grahl et al., 2018</xref>) to form a pain percept. This can be seen in analogy to ideas in multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ernst and Banks, 2002</xref>). Expectations or predictions and resulting prediction errors also play a key role in generative models such as predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). In essence, this framework assumes that neuronal assemblies implement perception and learning by constantly matching incoming sensory data with the top-down predictions of an internal or generative model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knill and Pouget, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark, 2013</xref>). Basically, minimizing prediction errors allows systems to resist their tendency to disorder by the creation of models with better predictions regarding the sensory environment, leading to a more efficient encoding of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friston, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of nociceptive skin stimulation have been widely investigated. Generally, phasic gamma activity has been associated with stimulus intensity over the sensory cortex where the amplitudes of pain-induced gamma oscillations increase with objective stimulus intensity and subjective pain intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hauck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rossiter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiemann et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, pain-related gamma band oscillations have been linked to the insular cortex as well as temporal and frontal regions using depth electrodes in epilepsy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liberati et al., 2018</xref>). In tonic painful heat stimulation, medial prefrontal gamma activity has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, gamma activity is enhanced by attention in human EEG experiments in visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruber et al., 1999</xref>), auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tiitinen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debener et al., 2003</xref>), and sensorimotor processing (i.e. tactile stimuli) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauer et al., 2006</xref>) as well as in nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hauck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hauck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tiemann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pain-related alpha-to-beta band oscillations are typically found to be suppressed with higher stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mouraux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ploner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2013</xref>), which is enhanced by attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May et al., 2012</xref>) and (placebo) expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huneke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiemann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albu and Meagher, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, prestimulus theta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taesler and Rose, 2016</xref>) as well as prestimulus alpha and gamma activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tu et al., 2016</xref>) can affect subsequent pain processing. Specifically, trials with smaller prestimulus alpha and gamma oscillations were perceived as more painful, suggesting a negative modulation of subsequent pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cued pain paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atlas et al., 2010</xref>) have been used to generate expectations and prediction errors. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested an important role of the anterior insular cortex for mediating expectation effects and the integration of prior expectation and prediction errors in the context of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ploghaus et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atlas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fazeli and Büchel, 2018</xref>). These studies have revealed that neuronal signals in the anterior insula represent predictions and prediction errors with respect to pain, which in theory would allow the combination of both terms as required for predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Büchel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ongaro and Kaptchuk, 2019</xref>). However, in fMRI studies, predictions and prediction errors cannot be temporally dissociated due to the low temporal resolution of the method. To investigate this further, we conducted a cue-based pain experiment using EEG to achieve high temporal and spectral resolution of predictions and prediction error processes in the context of pain.</p><p>In this experiment (N = 29) we employed contact heat stimuli with three different intensities (low heat, medium heat, and high heat), preceded by a visual cue indicating the upcoming intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To generate prediction errors, the modality (picture or heat) was correctly cued only in 70% of all trials, and stimulus intensities were correctly cued only in 60% of all trials. We then investigated oscillatory activity related to stimulus intensity, expectation, and prediction errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Left: Graphical representation of the trial structure.</title><p>Each trial started with the presentation of a cue, indicating the stimulus intensity and modality of the following stimulus.

Based on the functional neuroanatomy of cortical microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>), with feedforward connections predominately originating from superficial layers and feedback connections from deep layers, we expect that prediction error signals should be related to higher frequencies (e.g. gamma band) than prediction signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todorovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We investigated 35 healthy male participants (mean 26, range 18–37 years), who were paid as compensation for their participation. Applicants were excluded if one of the following exclusion criteria applied: neurological, psychiatric, dermatological diseases, pain conditions, current medication, or substance abuse. All volunteers gave their informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Board of the Hamburg Medical Association. Of 35 participants, data from six participants had to be excluded from the final EEG data analysis due to technical issues during the EEG recording (i.e. the data of the excluded participants were contaminated with excessive muscle and/or technical artifacts) leaving a final sample of 29 participants. The sample size was determined according to a power calculation (G*Power V 3.1.9.4) based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>. For the left anterior insula (fMRI; Table 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>), we observed an effect size of partial eta squared of 0.17 and an effect size of 0.22 for the right anterior insula (cue × stimulus interaction). Using a power of (1-beta) of 0.95 and an alpha level of 0.05 and assuming a low correlation (0.1) between repeated measures, this leads to a sample size of 25, assuming the weaker effect in the left insula.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stimuli and task</title><p>Stimulus properties were chosen to be identical to a previous fMRI study of predictive coding in pain where both expectation and absolute prediction error effects were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fazeli and Büchel, 2018</xref>). Thermal stimulation was performed using a 30 × 30 mm<sup>2</sup> Peltier thermode (CHEPS Pathway, Medoc) at three different intensities: low heat (42°C), medium heat (46°C), and high heat (48°C) at the left radial forearm. These three temperatures cover a large range of temperatures associated with nociception. The lowest temperature was set at 42°C to ensure a temperature above the median threshold of heat-sensitive C-fiber nociceptors which have a median heat threshold of 41°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Treede et al., 1998</xref>). The baseline temperature was set at 33°C and the rise rate to 40°C/s. After two blocks, the stimulated skin patch was changed to avoid sensitization.</p><p>Aversive pictures were chosen from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lang et al., 2008</xref>) database at three different levels of aversiveness. The images presented during the EEG experiment had three levels of valence of which the low valence category had valence values of 2.02 ± 0.05 (mean ± standard error), the medium valence category had valence values of 4.06 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard error), and the high valence category had valence values of 5.23 ± 0.01 (mean ± standard error).</p><p>Prior to each picture or heat stimulus, a visual cue was presented. The color of the cue (triangle) indicated (probabilistically) the modality of the stimulus (orange for picture and blue for heat). A white digit written inside of each triangle indicated (probabilistically) the intensity of the subsequent stimulus (1, 2, and 3 for low, medium, and high intensity, respectively). During the whole trial, a centered fixation cross was presented on the screen.</p><p>Each trial began with the presentation of the cue for 500 ms as an indicator for the modality and intensity of the subsequently presented stimulus. The modality was correctly cued in 70% of all trials by the color of the triangle. In 60% of all trials, the stimulus intensity was correctly indicated by the digit within the triangle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for an overview of all cue contingencies).</p><p>Before the presentation of the stimulus, there was a blank period with a variable time frame between 1000 and 1400 ms. Then, the visual or thermal stimulus was presented for a duration of 2 s. The visual stimulus was centered on the screen and allowed the participant to perceive the stimulus without eye movements. Right after the termination of the stimulus, subjects were asked to rate the aversiveness of the stimulus on a four-point rating scale, where one was labeled as ‘neutral’ and four was labeled as ‘very strong’. Ratings were performed using a response box operated with the right hand (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for a visualization of the trial structure).</p><p>In addition, four catch trials were included in each block. Subjects were asked to report the preceding cue in terms of their information content of the modality and intensity within 8 s, and no stimulation was given in these trials.</p><p>Trials were presented in four blocks. Each block consisted of 126 trials and four catch trials and lasted about 15 min. The trial order within each block was pseudorandomized. The order of blocks was randomized across subjects. The whole EEG experiment including preparation and instructions lasted for about 3 hr.</p><p>Prior to the actual EEG experiment, subjects participated in a behavioral training session. During this session, participants were informed about the procedure and gave their written informed consent. The behavioral training session was implemented to avoid learning effects associated with the contingencies between the cues and the stimuli during the EEG session. Between two and three blocks were presented during the training session (without electrophysiological recordings). The experimenter assessed the performance after each block based on the percentage of successful catch trials and the ability to distinguish the three levels of aversiveness of each modality. The training session was terminated after the second block if participants were able to successfully label cues in 75% of the catch trials within the second block.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>EEG data acquisition</title><p>EEG data were acquired using a 64-channel Ag/AgCl active electrode system (ActiCap64; BrainProducts) placed according to the extended 10–20 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klem et al., 1999</xref>). Sixty electrodes were used of the most central scalp positions. The EEG was sampled at 500 Hz, referenced at FCz, and grounded at Iz. For artifact removal, a horizontal, bipolar electrooculogram (EOG) was recorded using two of the remaining electrodes and placing them on the skin approximately 1 cm left from the left eye and right from the right eye at the height of the pupils. One vertical EOG was recorded using one of the remaining electrodes centrally approx. 1 cm beneath the left eyelid and another electrode was fixated on the neck at the upper part of the left trapezius muscle (Musculus trapezius) to record an electromyogram.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>EEG preprocessing</title><p>The data analysis was performed using the Fieldtrip toolbox for EEG/MEG (magnetoencephalogram) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>) at Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip">http://www.ru.nl/neuroimaging/fieldtrip</ext-link>). EEG data were epoched and time-locked to the stimulus onset using the electrical trigger signaling the thermode to start the temperature rise of a given heat trial. Each epoch was centered (subtraction of the temporal mean) and detrended and included a time range of 3410 ms before and 2505 ms after trigger onset.</p><p>The data was band pass-filtered at 1–100 Hz, Butterworth, fourth order. EEG epochs were then visually inspected and trials contaminated by artifacts due to gross movements or technical artifacts were removed. Subsequently, trials contaminated by eye-blinks and movements were corrected using an independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makeig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jung et al., 2000</xref>). In all datasets, individual eye movements, showing a large EOG channel contribution and a frontal scalp distribution, were clearly seen in the removed independent components. Additionally, time–frequency decomposed ICA data were inspected at a single trial level, after z-transformation (only for artifact detection purposes) based on the mean and the standard deviation across all components separately for each frequency from 31 to 100 Hz. Time–frequency representations were calculated using a sliding window multi-taper analysis with a window of 200 ms length, which was shifted over the data with a step size of 20 ms with a spectral smoothing of 15 Hz. Artifact components or trials were easily visible and were compared with the raw ICA components. Specifically, single and separate muscle spikes were identified as columns or ‘clouds’ in time–frequency plots. Using this procedure, up to 30 components were removed before remaining non-artifactual components were back-projected and resulted in corrected data. Subsequently, the data was re-referenced to a common average of all EEG channels and the previous reference channel FCz was reused as a data channel (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for a summary of rejected components per participant).</p><p>Before time–frequency transformations for data analysis were performed on the cleaned dataset, the time axis of single trials was shifted to create cue-locked and stimulus-locked data. Cue-locked data uses the onset of the cue as t = 0. Stimulus-locked data takes the ramp-up period of the thermode into account and sets t = 0 to the time point when the thermode reached the target temperature (225, 325, and 375 ms after trigger onset for low, medium, and high heat conditions, respectively). Frequencies up to 30 Hz (1–30 Hz in 1 Hz steps) were analyzed using a sliding Hanning-window Fourier transformation with a window length of 300 ms and a step size of 50 ms. For the analysis of frequencies higher than 30 Hz (31–100 Hz in 1 Hz steps), spectral analyses of the EEG data were performed using a sliding window multi-taper analysis. A window of 200 ms length was shifted over the data with a step size of 50 ms with a spectral smoothing of 15 Hz. Spectral estimates were averaged for each subject over trials. Afterward, a z-baseline normalization was performed based on a 500 ms baseline before cue onset. For cue-locked data, a time frame ranging from −650 to −150 ms was chosen as a baseline. A distance from the cue onset to the baseline period of 150 ms was set because of the half-taper window length of 150 ms, that is, data points between −150 and 0 ms are contaminated by the onset of the cue. For stimulus-locked trials, a variable cue duration (1500–1900 ms) and a variable stimulus offset based on the ramp-up time (225–375 ms) were additionally taken into account, resulting in an according baseline from −2950 to −2450 ms from stimulus onset. For the baseline correction of time–frequency data, the mean and standard deviation were estimated for the baseline period (for each subject–channel–frequency combination, separately). The mean spectral estimate of the baseline was then subtracted from each data point, and the resulting baseline-centered values were divided by the baseline standard deviation (classical baseline normalization – additive model; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grandchamp and Delorme, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Predictive coding model</title><p>Similar to a previous fMRI study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fazeli and Büchel, 2018</xref>), our full model included three experimental within-subject factors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The stimulus intensity factor (INT) models the measured response with a simple linear function of the stimulus intensity (−1, 0, and 1 for low, medium, and high intensities, respectively). The expectation factor (EXP) was defined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; center column) linearly from the intensity predicted by the cue. Again, conditions with a low intensity cue were coded with a −1, conditions with a medium intensity cue with a 0 and conditions with a high intensity cue with a 1. The absolute prediction error factor (PE) resulted from the absolute difference of the expectation and actual stimulus intensity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; right column).</p><p>We also investigated a signed PE. However, it should be noted that such a term is not orthogonal to the EXP. However, assuming that an EXP can only be observed after the cue and a PE after the nociceptive stimulus, we were able to test for a signed PE during the heat phase. Also, we considered a one-sided PE, where a prediction error is only signaled when the stimulus is more intense as expected, which is motivated by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Summerfield and de Lange, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As the lowest stimulus intensity was often perceived as non-painful, we additionally performed an analysis only with medium and high stimulus intensities. Accordingly, the lowest stimulus intensity (42°C) were excluded in an additional repeated-measures ANOVA for this purpose (which will be referred to as the <italic>reduced pain model</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Behavioral aversiveness ratings</title><p>Behavioral aversiveness ratings were averaged for all 3 × 3 cue–stimulus combinations over each participant, resulting in a 29 × 9 matrix (subject × condition) for the full model and a 29 × 6 matrix for the reduced pain model.

Cluster permutation tests take into account that biological processes are not strictly locked to a single frequency or time point and that activity could be picked up by multiple electrodes. Cluster permutation tests are specifically useful for explorative testing, as explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>. While prior hypotheses could have been formulated regarding the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of brain responses associated with the intensity of thermal stimulation, and regions of interest could have been described, variations in the present design could be related to temporal and spectral differences compared to other studies, which would be taken into account using non-parametric cluster permutation testing.</p><p>We wanted to explore positive and negative time–frequency patterns associated with our variations of stimulus intensity, expectation, and absolute prediction errors using a repeated-measures ANOVA. A statistical value corresponding to a p-value of 0.05 (F[1,28] = 4.196) obtained from the repeated-measures ANOVA F-statistics of the respective main effect was used for clustering. Samples (exceeding the threshold of F[1,28] = 4.196) were clustered in connected sets on the basis of temporal (i.e. adjacent time points), spatial (i.e. neighboring electrodes), and spectral (i.e. +/− 1 Hz) adjacency. Further, clustering was restricted in a way that only samples were included in a cluster which had at least one significant neighbor in electrode space, that is, at least one neighboring channel also had to exceed the threshold for a sample to be included in the cluster. Neighbors were defined by a template provided by the Fieldtrip toolbox corresponding to the used EEG montage.</p><p>Subsequently, a cluster value was defined as the sum of all statistical values of included samples. Monte Carlo sampling was used to generate 1000 random permutations of the design matrix, and statistical tests were repeated in time–frequency space with the random design matrix. The probability of a cluster from the original design matrix (p-value) was calculated by the proportion of random design matrices producing a cluster with a cluster value exceeding the original cluster. This test was applied two-sided for negative and positive clusters, which were differentiated by the average slope of the estimated factors.</p><p>Monte Carlo cluster tests were performed with 1000 permutations using the test statistics of a repeated-measures ANOVA model as the value for clustering (at p&lt;0.05/F[1,28]=4.196). All tests were performed for low frequencies (1–30 Hz) and high frequencies (31–100 Hz), separately. Muscular and ocular electrodes were excluded from the cluster analysis.</p><p>The within-subject INT (which was coded as increasing linearly with stimulus intensity) was tested stimulus-locked from 0 to 1.6 s. The within-subject EXP, which was coded as increasing linearly with the cued stimulus intensity, was tested cue-locked from 0 to 3.6 s. The signed PE was coded as the difference between stimulus intensity and expectation. The absolute prediction error was coded as the absolute difference between stimulus intensity and expectation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for details). Additionally, we tested a one-sided prediction error, occurring only when the actual stimulus is of a higher intensity than expected. The signed, absolute, and one-sided PEs were tested stimulus-locked from 0 to 1.6 s.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Behavioral data – aversiveness ratings</title><p>Participants experienced aversive heat or saw picture stimuli which were probabilistically cued in terms of modality and intensity, evoking an expectation of modality and intensity.

Therefore, our observed increase in theta power agrees with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ploner et al., 2017</xref>) and most likely correspond to pain-related evoked potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lorenz and Garcia-Larrea, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiemann et al., 2015</xref>), such as the P2 with a similar topography. In addition, we observed a significant suppression of alpha-to-beta activity which, given the abovementioned delays of our painful stimuli, is in line with the reported beta suppression in previous EEG studies on pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mouraux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ploner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, power in the gamma band was also correlated with heat intensity, which is in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hauck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rossiter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tiemann et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, only the alpha-to-beta band desynchronization differentiated between medium and high pain conditions, whereas differences in the theta and gamma band activity were only evident when the lowest stimulus intensity was included which was perceived as neutral.</p><p>We observed a behavioral effect of prediction errors on perceived stimulus intensity in the reduced pain model, but this effect was only a trend in the full model. The latter finding replicates a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fazeli and Büchel, 2018</xref>) indicating a robust effect. Interestingly, the effect of prediction errors on perception increased, and became significant, when we constrained our analysis to the clearly painful stimuli (reduced pain model). This suggests that a prediction error seems to more strongly affect pain perception, whereas the effect is weaker in the context of thermoception. However, this speculation should be corroborated in a future study.</p><p>On a more conceptual level, the investigation of neurophysiological effects even in the absence of a behavioral effect has been considered meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilkinson and Halligan, 2004</xref>). In particular, the authors argue that because it is commonly unknown which parts of a cognitive process (and in which way) produce a specific behavioral response, the relationship between neurophysiological data and behavioral responses should not be overemphasized, and therefore it can be misleading to declare behavioral effects a reference or ‘gold standard’. Studies aiming to understand neurophysiological mechanisms of cognition usually relate a neurophysiological readout to a known perturbation (i.e. experimental design), which is meaningful in its own right.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Hypotheses based on microcircuits</title><p>Theoretical accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>) have suggested that predictive coding mechanisms could be related to the functional architecture of neuronal microcircuits. As feedforward connections are predominately originating from superficial layers and feedback connections from deep layers, it has been suggested that prediction errors should be expressed by higher frequencies than the predictions that accumulate them.</p><p>In the auditory modality, these ideas are supported by empirical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todorovic et al., 2011</xref>) showing that prediction errors in the context of repetition suppression were associated with higher gamma band activity. Likewise, in the visual domain, an MEG study has shown that temporo-parietal beta power was correlated with the predictability of an action kinematics–outcome sequence, while gamma power was correlated with the prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Pelt et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Frequency patterns in predictive coding of pain</title><p>Only a few studies have investigated the spectral and temporal properties of expectations and prediction errors in the context of pain (summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ploner et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study in rodents has suggested an information flow between S1 gamma and ACC (Anterior Cingulate Cortex) beta activity during spontaneous pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these data, the authors have proposed a predictive coding model including a bottom-up (gamma) and top-down (beta) component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, in humans, a recent EEG study showed that the sensorimotor cortex is more strongly connected to the medial prefrontal cortex at alpha frequencies during tonic pain, suggesting alpha band activity in tonic pain to be associated with bottom-up instead of top-down signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nickel et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the focus of these studies was on generic interactions (i.e. top-down vs. bottom-up) processes without directly inducing prediction errors as in a cued pain paradigm employed in our study.</p><p>In the flexible routing model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ploner et al., 2017</xref>, pain is seen as driven by contextual processes, such as expectations, which is associated with alpha/beta oscillations and alpha/beta synchrony across brain areas. Previous studies have started to examine the spectral properties of mechanisms related to generative models of pain perception. In particular, a previous MEG study reported that alpha suppression in the anterior insula is related mainly to pain expectation in a paradigm in which painful stimuli were interleaved with non-painful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franciotti et al., 2009</xref>). This was interpreted as a preparatory mechanism for an upcoming painful stimulus. In a related study, alpha desynchronization in the context of predictable painful stimuli has been discussed as a possible neural correlate of attentional preparatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babiloni et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Expectation is also a crucial ingredient of placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. A previous study reported that resting-state alpha band activity was also linked to the expectation of pain modulation (analgesia) in a placebo paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huneke et al., 2013</xref>). With respect to negative expectations, it has been shown that pain modulation due to nocebo expectation is associated with enhanced alpha activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albu and Meagher, 2016</xref>). Our findings are in line with these results indicating an important role of low frequency activity in mediating expectation effects in a pain network underlying a generative model for pain perception.</p><p>In contrast to prediction error effects in the visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Pelt et al., 2016</xref>) and auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parras et al., 2017</xref>) domains, we observed a negative modulation of gamma activity by absolute prediction errors. However, it should be noted that opposite effects have been observed in other cognitive domains. For instance, increased gamma power has been associated with successful matching (i.e. the absence of a prediction error) between external input and internal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrmann et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osipova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, gamma band responses have been explained in terms of the match between bottom-up and top-down information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herrmann et al., 2004b</xref>). One example is the observation of increased gamma activity with a higher so-called <italic>cloze probability</italic> in sentence-level language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Obleser and Kotz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Molinaro et al., 2013</xref>). It has been shown that a critical word that is semantically predictable by the preceding sentence (so-called high cloze probability) induces a larger gamma response than words which are semantically incongruent (i.e. unpredicted; low cloze probability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pain vs. thermoception</title><p>In the present study, the lowest stimulus intensity was often not perceived as painful but as hot. In general, stimulus properties were chosen to be comparable to a previous fMRI study which showed fMRI signals related to prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fazeli and Büchel, 2018</xref>). However, even though the lowest stimulus intensity (42°C) was above the threshold of nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Treede et al., 1998</xref>), the subjective experience of the lowest pain stimuli was often rated as neutral. Therefore, we performed an additional analysis (reduced pain model) only comprising clearly painful stimuli (46°C and 48°C) to more specifically address expectations and predictions errors in pain. The analyses of the behavioral data revealed similar results. Both models showed a highly significant effect of stimulus intensity and expectation on perceived stimulus intensity. In addition, the reduced pain model showed a significant prediction error effect, which was formally not observed in the full model. However, it is important to note that this difference should not be overinterpreted, as the p-value for the prediction error effect of the full model was at a trend level (p=0.1). Importantly, the negative representation of prediction errors in the gamma band was evident in both, the reduced and the full model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>To unravel the temporal aspects of expectations and prediction errors, this study has been designed in close analogy to a previous fMRI study and we decided to use the same experimental paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fazeli and Büchel, 2018</xref>). We therefore decided to also keep the sample characteristics similar and restricted the sample to male participants, which means that we cannot generalize our results to the population. However, our study agrees with the findings of a previous study using a similar design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geuter et al., 2017</xref>) which tested male and female participants. Future studies should investigate samples including female participants. This would also allow to investigate sex effects with respect to expectation and prediction error effects in pain.</p><p>To minimize motor responses and speed up the rating procedure, we used a four-button device to directly assess stimulus intensity (in contrast to using two buttons to move a slider on a VAS), thus being limited to a coarse rating scale of four levels, where one was labeled as ‘neutral’ and four was labeled as ‘very strong’. This allows to accommodate more trials but is not ideal to assess fine-grained differences, specifically to differentiate between non-painful and painful stimulation, as level 1 would represent 0–25 on a 0–100 VAS. Future research could use conventional 0–100 VAS to assess stimulus intensity on a finer scale.</p><p>For reasons of comparability to a previous fMRI study, we employed three different temperatures for all volunteers. Alternatively, we could have defined three levels of pain based on individual calibration of heat stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taesler and Rose, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grahl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldhaus et al., 2021</xref>). Such a procedure could have avoided trials where no pain was subjectively perceived. On the other hand, such an approach also carries the risk that subjective ratings during the calibration process do not truly reflect pain and can lead to errors (especially if ratings are too low) which then affect the entire experiment. However, to address this shortcoming, we performed an additional analysis, which only included painful stimulus intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Summary</title><p>Our data show that key variables required for pain perception and thermoception in the context of a generative model are correlated with distinct oscillatory profiles in the brain. Furthermore, each oscillatory frequency band was correlated with a distinct variable such as expectation and prediction errors. These mechanistic insights could be very helpful in patients with acute and more importantly in patients with chronic pain, where expectations have been shown to play a critical role in pain persistence.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Markus Ploner for comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Strube and colleagues investigates neural prediction error processing in the context of painful stimuli. The results suggest that alpha-to-beta oscillations were associated with pain expectation, whereas gamma band oscillations (GBO) were associated with prediction error (PE). The concept and the findings of the study are interesting. However, so far, it is not clear whether the findings unequivocally support the conclusions and additional analyses are needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a vast amount of literature on pain-related theta, alpha, and gamma activity that the authors should mention in the Introduction in order to prepare the reader for the results. Similarly, the Discussion section is very much focused on imaging effects despite a vast amount of literature on pain-related oscillations. Interestingly, the only paper the authors are citing for gamma activity is relying on an artefact (Zhang et al., 2012). The authors should discuss their findings in light of neurophysiological studies.</p><p>2) In contrast to Fazeli and Büchel, 2018, the behavioral data do not show PE effects. Does it make sense to analyze PE effects in the imaging data if no behavioural PE effects are found?</p><p>3) The study deals with expectations and PE in pain. To this end, a cueing paradigm has been performed with three thermal stimulus intensities. However, the lowest stimulus intensity has not been perceived as painful but as warm. Thus, some PE refer to errors regarding pain intensity and other PE to errors regarding pain vs non-painful warm. Moreover, the low pain cue is in fact a no pain cue. Does the study therefore really deal with PE in pain? Wouldn't it be necessary to restrict the analysis to painful stimuli? Or should the study be re-framed as studying PE in thermal perception?</p><p>Related to this, it is not clear whether it was a good decision to keep the stimulation temperature at the same level for all participants. As this is a within-subject design, the authors want to maximise the perceptual differences (e.g. no, low, high pain).</p><p>4) The current study conceptualizes PE as absolute unsigned PE, i.e., similar PE occur when the sensory evidence is less or more intense than expected. However, other PE concepts have assumed absolute signed PE, i.e., opposite neural effects occur when the sensory evidence is less or more intense than expected. Moreover, a third concept assumes negative PE, i.e., PE occur only when the sensory evidence is more intense than expected. The authors should clearly explain and motivate their PE definition. Moreover, the authors might perform similar analyses for other PE definitions.</p><p>5) The relationship between GBO and PE is negative, i.e., the greater the PE the lower the GBO amplitude. This pattern is at variance with all previous findings on GBO and PE and therefore contradicts rather than supports PE coding by GBO.</p><p>6) The relationship between alpha-to-beta-oscillations and expectations is not fully clear. The text and Figure 6 indicate a positive relationship whereas later it describes a decrease of alpha-to-beta band power associated with the manipulation of expectations, i.e., a negative relationship.</p><p>7) The expectation effects have been analyzed cue-locked. Thus, their timing with respect to thermal stimulus application is unclear, i.e. it is unknown whether expectations effects occur before or after stimulus application. The authors should find a way to clarify this.</p><p>8) Is there a reason why the authors focused on the pain part only? The visual part could serve as a control experiment, or the pain part as control for the visual experiment. It would be desirable to see whether there are similar effects of prediction error in either modalities. Alternatively, the authors might explain the motivation of the visual control condition and why it is not relevant for the present study.</p><p>9) There are problems with the analysis of gamma oscillations. There are additional and essential steps required in order to prevent that the findings are based on muscle artefacts (such as in Zhang et al., 2012). The authors may want to take the following steps:</p><p>a) Inspection of time-frequency decomposed ICA data at single trial level</p><p>b) Plot the trials after z-transforming based on the mean and the standard deviation of the entire component or potentially across all components. The z-transformation should be done separately for each frequency.</p><p>c) Artefact components or trials are easily visible and should be compared with the raw ICA time course as the muscle spikes can be easily detected there, too. However, the TFR plots are more sensitive. The artefact detection procedure may require a finer sliding window than the 50 ms which the authors used.</p><p>d) Single and separate muscle spikes are shown as columns, similar to the figure presented in Zhang (2012). Overlapping muscle spikes appear like &quot;clouds&quot; and can easily be misinterpreted as cortical activity. A sensitive single trial inspection on ICA transformed data is helpful.</p><p>e) As the authors have a low number of trials for some combinations (~1%), they may want to focus more on component rejection than on trial rejection. The authors may be required to remove up to 30 components from further analyses. The Vision Analyzer software from Brain Products has some features the authors may find useful, which is a Matlab interface for data export to FieldTrip as well as an excellent overlay function of cleaned vs uncleaned data after component removal.</p><p>10) Usually, less than half of the sample exhibits pain-related gamma activity. Could the authors provide a histogramme plot for the baseline-corrected gamma amplitude across the sample?</p><p>11) Is there a reason for not including a source analysis for pain intensity encoding? The authors provided a source analysis for all other aspects and should do the same for pain encoding for all frequencies.</p><p>12) The analysis should be explained in sufficient detail for replication. In particular, it should be explained for which time-frequency-electrode spaces cluster permutation tests were performed. Moreover, it should be detailed how prediction error effects were calculated (interactions between stimulus intensity and expectations in ANOVA?).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;The temporal characteristics of expectations and prediction errors in pain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Enrico Schulz (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers felt that the revisions have improved the manuscript, and the paper has clear potential. However, substantial revisions are still required to make this paper suitable for publication. They point out that several central issues have not been fully addressed for far.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) One issue that not been fully address are the concerns about the pain rating scale, where the &quot;1&quot; is clearly outside the pain range, being rated as neutral. Moreover, the low pain cue is in fact a no pain cue. What matters is not located in the periphery and the use of C-fibres, but the subjective pain experience of the participants. There's plenty of literature showing that participants exhibit differences in pain sensitivity. The QUEST algorithm to individually adapt pain intensities from Taesler and Rose, 2017, would have been more suitable to define different levels of pain intensity. Within-subject analyses should (probably) always use individually adapted pain intensities. This issue that the stimuli were ranging from non-painful heat to moderate pain needs to be explicitly addressed throughout the manuscript (including the title) and added to the paragraph on limitations. It is essential that the following questions are addressed convincingly and that these considerations are included to the Discussion section. Does the study really deal with PE in pain? Wouldn't it be necessary to restrict the analysis to painful stimuli? Or should the study be re-framed as studying PE in thermal perception?</p><p>2) The answer to the central question about the absence of behavioural effects is not fully convincing. The main argument is simply that it does make sense to investigate PE imaging effects without any behavioural effects. However, a more substantiated consideration of the significance of PE imaging effects in the absence of behavioural effects would be appropriate. These considerations should also be included in the Discussion section.</p><p>3) The relationship between GBO and PE is negative, i.e., the greater the PE the lower the GBO amplitude. This pattern is at variance with all previous findings on GBO and PE and therefore contradicts rather than supports PE coding by GBO. The authors reply to this point in the previous round was not sufficiently clear. Clear arguments in plain terms are needed. Moreover, the unusual inverse coding of PEs by gamma oscillations should be added to the Abstract.</p><p>4) The cluster-based permutation test is central to control for false positives. It has now been clarified that clustering has been performed across electrodes. However, it is best practice to cluster across electrodes, time and space. It is therefore essential to adjust the clustering procedure.</p><p>5) It is unclear whether it is appropriate to apply a baseline correction in reference to the entire trial segment. Could the authors provide a reference in order to justify their approach? Otherwise, they might consider applying a conventional baseline correction.</p><p>6) The reviewers suggest the authors consider dropping the source localisation. Most of the images do not seem to make much sense. The only exception that resembles a meaningful solution for the expectation analysis appears to be exaggerated. The authors rightfully mention in the manuscript that the anterior insula is involved in cognitive processing, such as expectation. However, the activity cluster points to the posterior insula and has its major part extended to the lingual gyrus. It does not seem appropriate to rely on the interpretation of one (out of many) remotely interpretable source analysis. It suggests selectively interpreting results that fit the hypotheses.</p><p>7) For the interpretation of the EXP and PE effect the authors should be sure that there are no differences in subjective pain intensity between the 3 conditions of EXP and the 2 conditions of PE. The question is whether the prediction error is a real error or whether the pain stimuli were &quot;naturally&quot; experienced as more or less painful than intended. Previous studies have shown that the trial-by-trial experience of pain can substantially jitter within subjects, even without any kind of intervention.</p><p>8) It is not clear why there is a significant cluster for expectation in the alpha/beta range between 1 – 2 s after cue onset. From visual inspection and &quot;plausibility check&quot; this cluster does not particularly stick out from the scattered apparently insignificant clusters across the entire time-frequency range. The F-values at 2.5s/70Hz even appear to be higher than the significant cluster.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The EEG study by Strube and colleagues used a predictive model paradigm to investigate the temporal dynamics of expectation and prediction errors on the processing of heat and pain. Their elaborate and balanced paradigm allowed to differentiate the neuronal oscillations contributing to the encoding of (a) stimulus intensity, (b) expectation, and (c) prediction errors. As a major weakness of the study, the lowest stimulus intensity was not perceived as painful, which does not justify restricting the interpretation to the pain domain but must include heat processing. The reason for this disadvantage is that the stimulus intensity has not been adapted to the participants. All study participants received the same stimulus intensities. This adaptation is mandatory due to the large differences in pain sensitivity across individuals and the focus on within-subject statistical analyses.</p><p>The study corroborates previous work on the influence of cognitive factors on the processing of pain. Furthermore, the study also takes advantage of the higher temporal resolution of EEG, which enabled the authors to analyse the data in reference to the onset of the expectation phase, as well as to analyse the data in reference to the subsequent (jittered) onset of the pain perception phase. As a result, the authors associated pain encoding with gamma activity and high-alpha/low-beta activity for predictor error encoding. The authors utilised an established design, which they have already published using fMRI.</p><p>The study is of utmost relevance for a broad readership of scientists in the fields of pain and cognition. The authors applied a timely randomisation algorithm at cluster-level in order to correct for multiple testing. They also applied an EEG source localisation of their effects with barely interpretable results. The many presented source maps are a good example for the challenges of EEG source localisation, which probably often do not exhibit results we can rely on. This can cause severe publication bias, where &quot;good&quot; results are published and &quot;bad&quot; results are dropped. The source localisation could have been improved by the use of individual and accurate electrode positions (instead of standard electrode positions), with the use of individual 3D brain images to account for individual anatomical differences, as well as by the co-registration of EEG electrode positions to the individual head shape.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revisions have significantly improved the manuscript.

We have now integrated several paragraphs in the Introduction as well as in the Discussion part of the revised paper and added references to existing ones, focusing more on neurophysiological studies of pain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In contrast to Fazeli and Büchel, 2018, the behavioral data do not show PE effects. Does it make sense to analyze PE effects in the imaging data if no behavioural PE effects are found?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question which pertains to neuroscientific studies in general. In essence, an experiment links a perturbation (in our case expectations, heat stimulation and prediction errors) to a readout (behavioral response, neurophysiological response, autonomic response etc.). In many cases a behavioral readout is essential, because this is the effect that determines whether the perturbation is effective, e.g. in many clinical studies, where a successful perturbation has to change disease symptoms (e.g. pain as indicated by pain ratings). However, in studies trying to understand neurophysiological mechanisms it is meaningful to interpret a neurophysiological readout as a result of a perturbation even in the absence of a behavioral effect. In addition, a VAS rating (or any behavioral read-out) integrates many neural processes and although careful experimental design tries to isolate the effects of interest, it is still subject to many cognitive and emotional processes which are not directly involved in the particular process in question (e.g. a prediction error). Consequently, the behavioral response is affected by many (unrelated) influences, which can obfuscate the effect in question.</p><p>In the study by Geuter, Boll, Eippert and Büchel, 2017, we observed a prediction error effect using autonomic measures (SCR, pupil). However, in the study using a more complex paradigm (Fazeli and Büchel, 2018) where we used pain ratings, we were not able to reveal a behavioral prediction error effect (similar to the present study). It is therefore possible, that behavioral pain ratings are less sensitive to PEs and that it would have been a better choice to have used autonomic readouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The study deals with expectations and PE in pain. To this end, a cueing paradigm has been performed with three thermal stimulus intensities. However, the lowest stimulus intensity has not been perceived as painful but as warm. Thus, some PE refer to errors regarding pain intensity and other PE to errors regarding pain vs non-painful warm. Moreover, the low pain cue is in fact a no pain cue. Does the study therefore really deal with PE in pain? Wouldn't it be necessary to restrict the analysis to painful stimuli? Or should the study be re-framed as studying PE in thermal perception?</p><p>Related to this, it is not clear whether it was a good decision to keep the stimulation temperature at the same level for all participants. As this is a within-subject design, the authors want to maximise the perceptual differences (e.g. no, low, high pain).</p></disp-quote><p>Heat sensitive C-fiber nociceptors have a median heat threshold of 41°C (Treede et al., 1995) and therefore our lowest stimulus temperature (42°C ) was set above this threshold. Although this stimulus intensity was not always rated as painful (see below), we still believe that this choice is valid, based on the neurophysiological properties of C fibers. As a consequence, it is valid to assume that these stimuli activate the nociceptive system and thus can cause pain. In addition, we used a rather coarse VAS scale with only four levels to allow brief button presses, which might have introduced rating ambiguities at the lower pain levels. Finally, using three temperatures allowed us to cover a large range of temperatures associated with nociception. We also wanted to stay as close to a previous fMRI study as possible and use the same stimulus properties (Fazeli and Buechel 2018). This has now been clarified in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The current study conceptualizes PE as absolute unsigned PE, i.e., similar PE occur when the sensory evidence is less or more intense than expected. However, other PE concepts have assumed absolute signed PE, i.e., opposite neural effects occur when the sensory evidence is less or more intense than expected. Moreover, a third concept assumes negative PE, i.e., PE occur only when the sensory evidence is more intense than expected. The authors should clearly explain and motivate their PE definition. Moreover, the authors might perform similar analyses for other PE definitions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have extended our analysis and have explored additional prediction errors. Initially we refrained from such an analysis, because a signed PE is not orthogonal to the expectation factor. However, assuming that an expectation should be observed early (after the cue) and a PE later (after the nociceptive stimulus), it is possible to test for a signed PE at the pain phase. We have now performed these analyses. However, they did not reveal any significant effect (all p&gt;0.05). This has now been added to the manuscript. Additionally, we investigated a “negative PE” that we refer to as “Pain PE” (as in Geuter et al., 2017). Essentially, this resulted in a factor where only 3 cue-stimulus combinations resulted in a PE, namely: Low Pain Cue + Medium Pain / Low Pain Cue + High Pain / Medium Pain Cue + High Pain. However, this did not reveal any significant results (all p &gt;.05).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The relationship between GBO and PE is negative, i.e., the greater the PE the lower the GBO amplitude. This pattern is at variance with all previous findings on GBO and PE and therefore contradicts rather than supports PE coding by GBO.</p></disp-quote><p>We included two lines of thought in the Discussion to relate these results to the literature associating PEs with GBO. Firstly, pre-stimulus γ oscillations have been found to modulate the subsequent pain response negatively, i.e. pain was perceived as more painful and evoked potentials showed a larger amplitude with a lower pre-stimulus γ activity (Tu et al., 2016), which implies a comparable mechanisms to our prediction error finding. Secondly, the γ response related to stimulus intensity without a prediction error entails an increase of GBO (Figure 5), which differs for the different stimulus intensities and has to be taken into account. We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion and describe this notion:</p><p>“However, from a different point of view, an early negative modulation of γ activity is directly associated with a relative γ increase over time (see Figure 7—figure supplement 3 for a schematic demonstration), suggesting a potential mechanism of the neuronal encoding of prediction errors in pain. In addition, pre-stimulus gamma oscillations modulate the subsequent pain response negatively, i.e. pain was perceived as more painful and evoked potentials showed a larger amplitude with a lower pre-stimulus gamma activity (Tu et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The relationship between alpha-to-beta-oscillations and expectations is not fully clear. The text and Figure 6 indicate a positive relationship whereas later it describes a decrease of alpha-to-beta band power associated with the manipulation of expectations, i.e., a negative relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake in the manuscript, which has now been corrected. We now correctly refer to the POSITIVE relationship in all parts of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The expectation effects have been analyzed cue-locked. Thus, their timing with respect to thermal stimulus application is unclear, i.e. it is unknown whether expectations effects occur before or after stimulus application. The authors should find a way to clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. With our revised analysis, the expectation effects expands clearly to time points before stimulus onset. To clarify this in the revised manuscript, we marked the area of the stimulus onset in the time-frequency representation of the effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Is there a reason why the authors focused on the pain part only? The visual part could serve as a control experiment, or the pain part as control for the visual experiment. It would be desirable to see whether there are similar effects of prediction error in either modalities. Alternatively, the authors might explain the motivation of the visual control condition and why it is not relevant for the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>It was our primary aim to identify effects with high temporal resolution using EEG and at the same time stay as close as possible to our previous fMRI study (Fazeli and Büchel, 2018). Therefore, we used an experimental design that was almost identical to this previous study. We agree with this reviewer, that the visual part of the experiment is interesting in its own right and we plan to jointly analyze the EEG data from this study together with the fMRI data from Fazeli and Büchel, 2018 and summarize the results in another paper. We strongly believe that this would be beyond the scope of the current manuscript with a focus on the investigation of the properties of nociceptive responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) There are problems with the analysis of gamma oscillations. There are additional and essential steps required in order to prevent that the findings are based on muscle artefacts (such as in Zhang et al., 2012). The authors may want to take the following steps:</p><p>a) Inspection of time-frequency decomposed ICA data at single trial level</p><p>b) Plot the trials after z-transforming based on the mean and the standard deviation of the entire component or potentially across all components. The z-transformation should be done separately for each frequency.</p><p>c) Artefact components or trials are easily visible and should be compared with the raw ICA time course as the muscle spikes can be easily detected there, too. However, the TFR plots are more sensitive. The artefact detection procedure may require a finer sliding window than the 50 ms which the authors used.</p><p>d) Single and separate muscle spikes are shown as columns, similar to the figure presented in Zhang et al., 2012. Overlapping muscle spikes appear like &quot;clouds&quot; and can easily be misinterpreted as cortical activity. A sensitive single trial inspection on ICA transformed data is helpful.</p><p>e). As the authors have a low number of trials for some combinations (~1%), they may want to focus more on component rejection than on trial rejection. The authors may be required to remove up to 30 components from further analyses. The Vision Analyzer software from Brain Products has some features the authors may find useful, which is a Matlab interface for data export to FieldTrip as well as an excellent overlay function of cleaned vs uncleaned data after component removal.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a major point and we thank the reviewer for pointing this out and in addition giving us clear guidance in the form of a step-by-step approach for the removal of artifacts. We have now reanalyzed our entire data set following this approach. The revised manuscript now includes a detailed description of these steps (which led to up to 30 rejected components) and a histogram showing the number of rejected artifacts per participant for an overview (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Importantly, we were able to replicate all effects using this more rigorous approach and have changed the results and figures in the revised manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Usually, less than half of the sample exhibits pain-related gamma activity. Could the authors provide a histogramme plot for the baseline-corrected gamma amplitude across the sample?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now provided a histogram for the baseline-corrected gamma amplitude for low and high pain conditions. Moreover, we added a plot showing the difference between low and high pain conditions (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Is there a reason for not including a source analysis for pain intensity encoding? The authors provided a source analysis for all other aspects and should do the same for pain encoding for all frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a source analysis for all neurophysiological effects in the supplementary materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The analysis should be explained in sufficient detail for replication. In particular, it should be explained for which time-frequency-electrode spaces cluster permutation tests were performed. Moreover, it should be detailed how prediction error effects were calculated (interactions between stimulus intensity and expectations in ANOVA?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we have now expanded on our explanations regarding our analysis, especially for the time-frequency-electrode spaces as well as for the calculation of the absolute prediction error effect.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) One issue that not been fully address are the concerns about the pain rating scale, where the &quot;1&quot; is clearly outside the pain range, being rated as neutral. Moreover, the low pain cue is in fact a no pain cue. What matters is not located in the periphery and the use of C-fibres, but the subjective pain experience of the participants. There's plenty of literature showing that participants exhibit differences in pain sensitivity. The QUEST algorithm to individually adapt pain intensities from Taesler and Rose, 2017, would have been more suitable to define different levels of pain intensity. Within-subject analyses should (probably) always use individually adapted pain intensities. This issue that the stimuli were ranging from non-painful heat to moderate pain needs to be explicitly addressed throughout the manuscript (including the title) and added to the paragraph on limitations. It is essential that the following questions are addressed convincingly and that these considerations are included to the Discussion section. Does the study really deal with PE in pain? Wouldn't it be necessary to restrict the analysis to painful stimuli? Or should the study be re-framed as studying PE in thermal perception?</p></disp-quote><p>Although our lowest stimulus temperature was above the threshold for peripheral nociceptors, we agree that at least some of the low pain trials did not lead a subjective pain experience. Therefore, we have followed the suggestion by the reviewers and performed an additional analysis, which only included the medium and high intensity heat stimuli. The behavioral data analysis shows clear effects of stimulus intensity, expectation and prediction error (PE) effect. This is similar to the analysis comprising all stimuli, yet the PE effect, which was a trend (p&lt;0.1) in the complete analysis is now significant at p&lt;0.001. Consistent with the original analysis, the new EEG analysis with only the medium and high stimulus intensities, revealed a negative absolute prediction error effect in the gamma band and an alpha-to-beta effect of stimulus intensity. These results have now been incorporated into the manuscript including a new figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The answer to the central question about the absence of behavioural effects is not fully convincing. The main argument is simply that it does make sense to investigate PE imaging effects without any behavioural effects. However, a more substantiated consideration of the significance of PE imaging effects in the absence of behavioural effects would be appropriate. These considerations should also be included in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>While reducing the design to medium and high intensity stimuli resulted in a significant prediction error effect in the behavioral data, we included an elaborate and more general discussion of whether it makes sense to investigate PE imaging effects without any behavioral effects based on the trend level effect of the full model.</p><p>“We observed a behavioral effect of prediction errors on perceived stimulus intensity in the reduced pain model, but this effect was only a trend in the full model. The latter finding replicates a previous study (Fazeli and Büchel, 2018) indicating a robust effect. Interestingly, the effect of prediction errors on perception increased, and became significant, when we constrained our analysis to the clearly painful stimuli (reduced pain model). This suggests that a prediction error seems to more strongly affect pain perception whereas the effect is weaker in the context of thermoception. However, this speculation should be corroborated in a future study.</p><p>On a more conceptual level, the investigation of neurophysiological effects even in the absence of a behavioral effect has been considered meaningful (Wilkinson and Halligan, 2004). In particular, the authors argue that because it is commonly unknown which parts of a cognitive process (and in which way) produce a specific behavioral response the relationship between neurophysiological data and behavioral responses should not be overemphasized, and therefore it can be misleading to declare behavioral effects a reference or “gold standard”. Studies aiming to understand neurophysiological mechanisms of cognition, usually relate a neurophysiological readout to a known perturbation (i.e. experimental design), which is meaningful in its own right.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The relationship between GBO and PE is negative, i.e., the greater the PE the lower the GBO amplitude. This pattern is at variance with all previous findings on GBO and PE and therefore contradicts rather than supports PE coding by GBO. The authors reply to this point in the previous round was not sufficiently clear. Clear arguments in plain terms are needed. Moreover, the unusual inverse coding of PEs by gamma oscillations should be added to the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We now explicitly state that our findings contradict a gamma response by prediction errors in the manuscript (i.e. Abstract and Discussion). However, we now also discuss that our findings are in line with the direction of gamma responses in word matching and working memory experiments. In this literature, successful matching (i.e. the absence of a prediction error) between external input and internal representation induces gamma power increases (Herrmann et al., 2004; Osipova et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2018), which is in line with our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The cluster-based permutation test is central to control for false positives. It has now been clarified that clustering has been performed across electrodes. However, it is best practice to cluster across electrodes, time and space. It is therefore essential to adjust the clustering procedure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we have not been clearer in our previous revision. We have now clarified that clustering was indeed performed across electrodes, time and space: “Samples (exceeding the threshold of F(1,28) = 4.196) were clustered in connected sets on the basis of temporal (i.e. adjacent time points), spatial (i.e. neighboring electrodes) and spectral (i.e. +/- 1Hz) adjacency.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is unclear whether it is appropriate to apply a baseline correction in reference to the entire trial segment. Could the authors provide a reference in order to justify their approach? Otherwise, they might consider applying a conventional baseline correction.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this approach is not unusual (Grandcamp and Delorme, 2011), we followed the reviewers’ advice and re-analyzed our data with a conventional baseline approach and changed the results part accordingly. We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to change the baseline correction approach as this clearly improved data quality and sensitivity. We describe our baseline approach as follows:</p><p>“Spectral estimates were averaged for each subject over trials. Afterwards, a z-baseline normalization was performed based on a 500ms baseline before cue onset. For cue-locked data, a time frame ranging from -650ms to -150ms was chosen as a baseline. A distance from the cue onset to the baseline period of 150ms was set because of the half-taper window length of 150ms, i.e. data points between -150ms and 0ms are contaminated by the onset of the cue. For stimulus-locked trials, a variable cue duration (1500-1900ms) and a variable stimulus offset based on the ramp-up time (225-375ms) were additionally taken into account, resulting in an according baseline from -2950ms to -2450ms from pain onset. For the baseline correction of time-frequency data, the mean and standard deviation were calculated for the baseline period (for each subject-channel-frequency combination, separately). The mean spectral estimate of the baseline was subtracted from each data point, and the resulting baseline-centered values were divided by the baseline standard deviation (classical baseline normalization – additive model; see Grandchamp and Delorme, 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The reviewers suggest the authors consider dropping the source localisation. Most of the images do not seem to make much sense. The only exception that resembles a meaningful solution for the expectation analysis appears to be exaggerated. The authors rightfully mention in the manuscript that the anterior insula is involved in cognitive processing, such as expectation. However, the activity cluster points to the posterior insula and has its major part extended to the lingual gyrus. It does not seem appropriate to rely on the interpretation of one (out of many) remotely interpretable source analysis. It suggests selectively interpreting results that fit the hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have dropped the source localization as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For the interpretation of the EXP and PE effect the authors should be sure that there are no differences in subjective pain intensity between the 3 conditions of EXP and the 2 conditions of PE. The question is whether the prediction error is a real error or whether the pain stimuli were &quot;naturally&quot; experienced as more or less painful than intended. Previous studies have shown that the trial-by-trial experience of pain can substantially jitter within subjects, even without any kind of intervention.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not entirely sure if we fully understand this comment. We guess that the statement “…the authors should be sure that there are no differences in subjective pain intensity between the 3 conditions of EXP and the 2 conditions of PE…” contains a typo, as (i) the full design elicits 3 levels of expectations and 3 level of prediction errors and (ii) differences in subjective pain due to expectation and prediction errors are the focus of the paper.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have several ideas what could be meant here:</p><p>1) The three factors (INT, EXP and PE) are orthogonal (uncorrelated), hence differences in Stimulus Intensity do not affect factor estimates of EXP and PE.</p><p>2) The largest part of the expectation cluster is associated with activity preceding the heat stimulus, and thus the expectation effect is not affected by differences associated with subjective pain.</p><p>3) We also performed the behavioral data analysis only on trials which remained in the EEG data analysis after trial rejection. This did not change the results, as all comparisons remained significant.</p><p>4) Trial-by-trial differences of pain perception with identical stimulus intensities are indeed very common. However, these differences cannot systematically bias our results as they “end up” in the residuals of our statistical model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is not clear why there is a significant cluster for expectation in the alpha/beta range between 1 – 2 s after cue onset. From visual inspection and &quot;plausibility check&quot; this cluster does not particularly stick out from the scattered apparently insignificant clusters across the entire time-frequency range. The F-values at 2.5s/70Hz even appear to be higher than the significant cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>While in cluster permutation testing large clusters with lower F-values can reach a higher cluster mass than clusters with apparently higher F-values at single samples, the new analysis with a different baseline approach now resulted in a very clear low frequency alpha-to-beta cluster for the expectation effect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
