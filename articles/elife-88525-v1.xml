Among these, the dicarboxylate metabolite azelaic acid (Aze) appears to play an important, but heterogeneous, role in modulating these microbiomes, as it is used as a carbon source for some heterotrophs but is toxic to others. However, the ability of Aze to promote or inhibit growth, as well as its uptake and assimilation mechanisms into bacterial cells are mostly unknown. Here, we use transcriptomics, transcriptional factor coexpression networks, uptake experiments, and metabolomics to unravel the uptake, catabolism, and toxicity of Aze on two microalgal-associated bacteria, <italic>Phycobacter</italic> and <italic>Alteromonas</italic>, whose growth is promoted or inhibited by Aze, respectively. We identify the first putative Aze transporter in bacteria, a ‘C<sub>4</sub>-TRAP transporter’, and show that Aze is assimilated through fatty acid degradation, with further catabolism occurring through the glyoxylate and butanoate metabolism pathways when used as a carbon source. <italic>Phycobacter</italic> took up Aze at an initial uptake rate of 3.8×10<sup>–9</sup> nmol/cell/hr and utilized it as a carbon source in concentrations ranging from 10 μM to 1 mM, suggesting a broad range of acclimation to Aze availability. For growth-impeded bacteria, we infer that Aze inhibits the ribosome and/or protein synthesis and that a suite of efflux pumps is utilized to shuttle Aze outside the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that seawater amended with Aze becomes enriched in bacterial families that can catabolize Aze, which appears to be a different mechanism from that in soil, where modulation by the host plant is required. This study enhances our understanding of carbon cycling in the oceans and how microscale chemical interactions can structure marine microbial populations. In addition, our findings unravel the role of a key chemical currency in the modulation of eukaryote-microbiome interactions across diverse ecosystems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diatoms</kwd><kwd>secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>azelaic acid</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Symbiosis Model Systems GBMF9335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amin</surname><given-names>Shady A</given-names></name><name><surname>Seymour</surname><given-names>Justin R</given-names></name><name><surname>Raina</surname><given-names>Jean-Baptiste</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012025</institution-id><institution>New York University Abu Dhabi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Award AD179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amin</surname><given-names>Shady A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Characterization of the molecular mechanisms that enable azelaic acid, a secondary metabolite produced by photosynthetic organisms, to promote or inhibit different bacterial populations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryote-microbiome interactions are among the most diverse associations in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Chemical exchanges between diverse eukaryotes and their microbiomes are hallmarks of these relations, particularly involving secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Helliwell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shaffer et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the importance of secondary metabolites as signaling molecules that play critical roles in structuring microbial populations and regulating global biogeochemical cycles, the molecular mechanisms by which identified chemicals regulate microbial relationships in the ocean are largely elusive. The C<sub>9</sub> dicarboxylic acid, azelaic acid (or azelate, hereafter Aze), is a ubiquitous, yet enigmatic metabolite produced by photosynthetic organisms, such as plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khakimov et al., 2014</xref>) and phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shibl et al., 2020</xref>). It is postulated to be a product of the peroxidation of galactolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zoeller et al., 2012</xref>), yet its exact biosynthetic pathway is unknown. Aze plays a crucial role as an infochemical that primes systemic acquired resistance against phytopathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spoel and Dong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wittek et al., 2014</xref>) and influences microbial diversity in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Korenblum et al., 2020</xref>). In marine environments, diatoms secrete Aze to modulate bacterial populations by promoting the growth of symbionts while simultaneously inhibiting opportunists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shibl et al., 2020</xref>). Despite this undeniable importance, no Aze uptake proteins are known in bacteria and its assimilation into bacterial cells to promote or inhibit growth is poorly understood. A single gene has recently been identified in <italic>Pseudomonas nitroreducens</italic> that acts as a transcriptional regulator of Aze, <italic>azeR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bez et al., 2020</xref>), yet its regulatory targets are unknown. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that enable the transport and assimilation of Aze into bacterial cells to induce positive or negative phenotypes will help to reveal how eukaryotic hosts influence and control their microbiome.</p><p>To examine how bacteria transport and catabolize Aze, we used <italic>Phycobacter azelaicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coe et al., 2023</xref>) (formerly <italic>Phaeobacter</italic> sp. F10, and hereafter <italic>Phycobacter</italic>) as a model to study how Aze promotes bacterial growth and <italic>Alteromonas macleodii</italic> F12 (hereafter <italic>A. macleodii</italic>) as a model to study the inhibitory effects of Aze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shibl et al., 2020</xref>). Both bacteria were isolated from the diatom <italic>Asterionellopsis glacialis,</italic> which was shown to produce Aze to modulate its microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shibl et al., 2020</xref>). In previous experiments, Aze caused an increase in cell density of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> relative to controls, while temporarily inhibiting the growth of <italic>A. macleodii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shibl et al., 2020</xref>). A combination of transcriptomics, transcriptional coexpression networks (TCNs) of master transcriptional regulators, metabolomics, and uptake experiments were used to elucidate how these bacteria process Aze. Additionally, in situ mesocosm experiments with seawater microbial communities and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> were conducted to examine whether Aze influences microbial diversity in natural environments and enriches microbial taxa that carry genes involved in Aze uptake and response. We discovered the first putative Aze transport system in bacteria and map out how each bacterium responds to and processes Aze through complex regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Growth and transcriptional response to Aze</title><p><italic>Phycobacter</italic> incubated with 1 mM Aze as the sole carbon source showed a significant increase in growth relative to no-carbon controls or growth with glutamate as the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To elucidate the transcriptional responses of <italic>Phycobacter</italic> to growth on Aze, RNA samples were collected at 0.5 and 8 hr after Aze addition to <italic>Phycobacter</italic> to capture the short-term uptake and longer-term catabolism of Aze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To infer possible mechanisms of short-term toxicity by <italic>A. macleodii</italic>, samples were collected at 0.5 hr.

Approximately 78% of DE genes were upregulated in response to Aze (n=652) and most occurred at 8 hr (n=494). Only 70 genes displayed consistent expression profiles at both 0.5 and 8 hr, suggesting the immediate, short-term response to Aze is different from long-term growth on the substrate.

While fatty acid degradation, amino acid metabolism and degradation, ABC transporters, oxidative phosphorylation, propanoate metabolism, glyoxylate, and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways exhibited similar expression ratios across both bacteria in response to Aze, upregulated genes in these pathways were mostly dominated by <italic>Phycobacter</italic> transcripts.

Among 26 enriched transporter genes in our dataset, a C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter substrate-binding protein (INS80_RS11065) was the most and the third most upregulated gene in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> grown on Aze at 0.5 and 8 hr, respectively. The small and large permease genes (INS80_RS11060 and INS80_RS11055) neighboring this gene, which form a functional TRAP transporter, were among the top 20 most upregulated genes in the transcriptome at 0.5 hr and continued to be upregulated at 8 hr, implicating these genes in transporting Aze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 2 and 3</xref>).

In addition, plants use Aze to prime their immune systems in response to phytopathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jung et al., 2009</xref>). Its toxic effects against the acne-causing bacterium, <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, popularized its use in skin care products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leeming et al., 1986</xref>). Aze has also been shown to have antitumor effects on cancerous cells, and functions as a competitive inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidoreductases and steroid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sieber and Hegel, 2014</xref>). The ability of a single metabolite to selectively inhibit or promote different populations of bacteria simultaneously poses important questions about how this metabolite evolved in the eukaryotic chemical repertoire to influence their microbiome and its role in unicellular versus multicellular phototrophs.</p><p>Identifying Aze as a putative substrate of a TRAP transporter system is a novel and exciting result. Despite numerous attempts, our efforts to knock out <italic>azeTSL</italic> in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> failed. Information about bacterial transporters and their substrates remain speculative, and much less is known about substrate specificity for bacterial TRAP transporters than others, such as ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maqbool et al., 2015</xref>). TRAP transporters consist of a substrate-binding domain and two transmembrane segments (large and small permeases), while lacking the canonical nucleotide-binding domain found in ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rosa et al., 2018</xref>). Recognized substrates for TRAP transporters vary from sugars, mono- and dicarboxylates, organosulfur molecules, heterocyclic carboxylates, and amino acids. Among dicarboxylates, only C<sub>4</sub>-compounds, such as succinate, fumarate, and malate, have been identified as substrates for TRAP transporters, which explains the prevalent annotation of ‘<italic>C<sub>4</sub>-dicarboxylate transporter</italic>’ for proteins in bacterial genomes, including <italic>Phycobacter</italic>. Other than C<sub>6</sub>-adipate that binds with high affinity to a tripartite tricarboxylate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosa et al., 2017</xref>), it is not known how dicarboxylates with &gt;4 carbons are taken up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan et al., 2007</xref>). This makes AzeTSL a putative transporter of the longest chain dicarboxylate molecule known to date. The sheer abundance of dicarboxylate transporters in bacterial genomes begs the question of whether they transport a variety of C<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>-dicarboxylates, such as C<sub>5</sub>-glutarate, C<sub>6</sub>-adipate, C<sub>7</sub>-pimelate, C<sub>8</sub>-suberate, C<sub>9</sub>-azelate, and C<sub>10</sub>-sebacate. Some of these metabolites are produced by primary producers and thus potentially serve as growth factors or signals for heterotrophic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moran et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, further work is needed to expand on the nature of substrates specific to dicarboxylate TRAP transporters.</p><p>We have shown that while <italic>Phycobacter</italic> uses fatty acid degradation and subsequently glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, and butanoate metabolism pathways to catabolize Aze, <italic>A. macleodii</italic> attempts to mitigate the toxicity of Aze by cytoplasm efflux and by downregulating its ribosome and protein synthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the fact that <italic>A. macleodii</italic> possesses a complete fatty acid degradation pathway similar to bacteria that display inhibition by Aze is intriguing, as it is unclear why such bacteria cannot catabolize this metabolite. The answer may lie in the fact that <italic>Phycobacter</italic>, and bacteria that catabolize Aze such as <italic>P. nitroreducens</italic>, possess the TF AzeR. Using RIF analysis, we have shown that <italic>azeR</italic> in <italic>Phycobacter</italic> putatively regulates its fatty acid degradation pathway and <italic>azeTSL</italic>, along with other pathways essential for the catabolism of Aze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). By activating uptake, fatty acid degradation and other essential genes, AzeR enables bacteria to efficiently metabolize Aze. In contrast, bacteria deficient in AzeR, such as <italic>A. macleodii,</italic> are presumably unable to activate these pathways rapidly and thus fall susceptible to the toxic effects of Aze. Nevertheless, <italic>A. macleodii</italic> likely uses efflux pumps and the activation of a variety of stress-related pathways mediated by the TF XRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) to recover from Aze-dependent toxicity in a relatively short period of time. While Aze exhibits a wide range of inhibitory activity, in <italic>A. macleodii,</italic> ribosome and/or protein synthesis inhibition seem to contribute to the toxicity associated with Aze, evidenced by the strong downregulation of most ribosomal protein coding genes, protein synthesis genes, and proteases. This finding agrees with previous studies that demonstrated the bacteriostatic effects of Aze on protein, DNA and RNA synthesis in <italic>P. acnes</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bojar et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bojar et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Aze addition to seawater mesocosms induced a statistically significant increase in the relative abundance of taxa that are capable of assimilating Aze compared to controls. Although the observed patterns may be driven by Aze activity, other mechanisms may be at play that led to changes in the microbial community, such as interspecies competition. Rhodobacteraceae ASVs comprised the most abundant group to be influenced by Aze additions, highlighting their adaptation to phytoplankton exudates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Landa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teeling et al., 2012</xref>), while MG II archaea ASVs exhibited the largest enrichment relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). While we cannot discount competitive interactions from inducing the significant enrichment of MG II archaea ASVs, the possibility that Aze may be a growth substrate for this important group is intriguing. The MG II archaea (<italic>Candidatus</italic> Poseidoniales) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinke et al., 2019</xref>) remain uncultivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tully, 2019</xref>), hindering our understanding of their metabolic capacity, though isotope probing and metagenomic analysis showed its assimilation of phytoplankton-derived substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Orsi et al., 2016</xref>). Several MG II genera exhibited chemotaxis toward phytoplankton exudates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raina et al., 2022</xref>) and displayed significant correlations to chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> in an oceanographic time-series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rinke et al., 2019</xref>). Further work is needed to confirm the link, if any, between Euryarchaeota and Aze. In soil, Aze primes the plant immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jung et al., 2009</xref>), which likely drives the production of a myriad of metabolites that modulate the rhizosphere microbiome. Indeed, introducing Aze directly to soil had negligible effect on the soil microbiome, while Aze introduction to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> appears to cause significant changes to the rhizosphere composition that may reflect complex interactions between the host and rhizosphere microbes. Further work is needed to clarify the mechanisms enabling plants to modulate rhizosphere microbiomes through Aze.</p><p>In summary, photosynthetically derived secondary metabolites play a significant role in structuring microalgal and plant microbiomes. In the oceans, they are hypothesized to influence algal blooms, succession of microbial populations, and global biogeochemical cycles. However, the perception and response of these metabolites in microbial heterotrophs remain largely unknown. This study set out to unravel the molecular mechanisms of Aze on bacteria that enables eukaryotic hosts to modulate their associated microbiome. More broadly, we demonstrate that bacterial lineages occupying different ecosystems, such as the phycosphere surrounding microalgal cells, may have gained an ecological advantage over others by evolving mechanisms that assimilate Aze. These findings expand the understanding of bacterial TRAP transporters and their potential substrates, while also highlighting the importance of linking ubiquitous transporter systems to chemical currencies identified in the ocean. While Aze assimilation represents an important mechanism to structure the microbiome of primary producers, it is likely one of many such metabolites that together work in concert to ensure the maintenance of healthy microbial communities, which ultimately influence higher trophic levels and control global biogeochemical cycling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth of bacterial isolates with Aze</title><p>To test if <italic>Phycobacter</italic> could use Aze as a sole carbon course, 2 mL of an overnight culture grown in Zobell marine broth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raina et al., 2022</xref>) was centrifuged and washed three times with modified mineral media (K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> was used instead of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zech et al., 2009</xref>) lacking a carbon source.

We agree that this would be a valuable addition to the study, and we mention in the text that “Despite numerous attempts, our efforts to knock-out azeTSL in Phycobacter failed.”</p><p>The success rate of mutagenesis experiments is often low and time-consuming. There are a few reasons why our knock-out experiments with Phycobacter have not been successful. Despite using several modified protocols for electroporation, no Phycobacter colonies grew on the antibiotic plate. We then tried the homologous recombination approach for conjugation but were not successful in selecting for Phycobacter cells, even when grown in high salinity conditions that favor Phycobacter and disfavor the carrier, <italic>E. coli</italic> . While we would love to include a mutagen to confirm the function of this cluster, the task seems to be unattainable at the moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study explores the breadth of effects of one important metabolite, azelaic acid, on marine microbes, and reveals in-depth its pathway of uptake and catabolism in one model bacterial strain.

We appreciate their feedback on the breadth of effects of Aze on marine microbes, and their insights into the strengths and limitations of our study.</p><p>We agree that the specific mechanisms underlying community-level shifts in seawater mesocosm experiments with added Aze are not yet fully understood and we believe such work is beyond the scope of this paper and warrants an in-depth study of its own. This can perhaps be conducted at a larger scale by using a combination of meta-omics and targeted enrichment to identify the community members directly assimilating Aze, as well as those that are benefitting indirectly or experiencing inhibition.</p><p>We also agree that the soil and Arabidopsis experiments are exploratory. However, we believe that these experiments are a valuable first step in highlighting the potential for Aze to have different modes of action in aquatic versus terrestrial microbial communities. Our interest in contrasting bacterial molecular responses in terrestrial plant rhizospheres and marine algal phycospheres stems from the fact that both environments share similar molecules and related bacteria, yet exhibit significantly different evolutionary histories and fluid dynamic profiles (Seymour et al 2017, Nature Microbiol ). Although more is known about Aze in Arabidopsis than phytoplankton, there are still gaps in this knowledge. For example, recent work has shown that Aze and derivatives can be secreted into soil (Korenblum et al 2020, PNAS ), but whether Aze directly influences microbial communities in soil as we have shown in seawater has not been explored. Thus, we feel our preliminary experiments in soil are important to provide such a distinction with seawater. Additional studies in these systems to further investigate the importance of Aze, which were beyond the scope of this current work, would be quite beneficial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>General comments:</p><p>A complete supplemental file of differentially expressed genes should be provided in the supplemental. Please add tables with the entire DESeq output for Aze additions in the genomes of Phycobacter (0.5 and 8 h) and Alteromonas (0.5 h). While it makes sense to focus the paper on Aze related genes, the full dataset should be made available in a more curated form than just the raw reads in the SRA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Looking at the table for gene expression ofPhycobacter there are 26 significantly enriched transport genes at 0.5 h other than the putative Aze TRAP transporter. Even though the TRAP transporter is likely transporting Aze, it would be good to let the readers know that other transporters showed transcript enrichment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful comment. We modified the sentence accordingly to read as follows: “Among 26 enriched transporter genes in our dataset, a C 4 - dicarboxylate tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter substrate-binding protein (INS80_RS11065) was the most and the third most upregulated gene in Phycobacter grown on Aze at 0.5 and 8 hours, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1: There are many genes enriched from -1 to 1.

For instance, the study does not directly demonstrate the activity of the TRAP transporter (as mentioned above), and does not directly demonstrate that the bacteria that increase in abundance in the mesocosm experiments are actually assimilating azelaic acid.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree that further studies are required to get definitive answers regarding the direct activity of the transporter genes and direct assimilation of Aze by bacteria in the mesocosm. These complex experiments would require establishing a reproducible workflow for knocking out genes and further isotope labeling experiments to track Aze assimilation in a natural setting. To that end, we were keen on using language throughout the manuscript indicating that transporter activity is putative. We went through the manuscript again to make sure it was clear that the transporter activity is putative at this time and is not confirmed. For the mesocosms, we cannot rule out that the changes in community structure is not due to other factors besides Aze. We have added this sentence in the discussion of the mesocosm experiments to indicate that the observed changes in microbial community cannot be directly attributed to Aze activity and may be a byproduct of other mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, I find the soil and plant experiments to be very preliminary, and would personally recommend removing them from the manuscript. This is of course the authors' choice, but I find they detract from an otherwise more solid story. I wonder whether 16 hours was sufficient to see community changes and whether adding azelaic acid directly into the plant is necessary or relevant. The study does not measure any plant immune responses so I caution against drawing conclusions about the mechanism. It seems the connection to plant immunity was already shown in the literature, in which case I'm not sure whether these experiments presented here really add anything new to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. Our 16-hour sampling time point (similar to the seawater experiment) represents an overnight incubation period that should allow sufficient change in the natural microbial composition yet avoids the long-term succession of microbes with high metabolic capacities that may outcompete the rest of the community at long incubation periods. Deciding on this length of incubation was also informed by the uptake rate of Aze and its influence on either bacteria assimilating it as a carbon source or being inhibited by it.</p><p>Since no significant changes were observed in the soil, it was necessary to test the hypothesis that the plant host might be indirectly influencing the rhizosphere microbial communities by infiltrating <italic>A. thaliana</italic> leaves with Aze. As the reviewer mentions, the association between Aze and plant immunity was previously shown; however, the overall influence on the microbial community has not been fully explored yet. The soil and plant experiments were meant to serve an exploratory purpose and we find them necessary to keep in the manuscript as a first step in comparing the mode of action of Aze within marine and terrestrial ecosystems. They are by no means the answer to what role Aze plays in soil systems, but rather they are the starting point. We hope that our results encourage some readers to investigate similar common metabolites to further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of microbial modulation in both environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the transcriptomics data, I am not clear on why the &quot;expression ratio&quot; -- i.e. the fraction of pathway genes that were differentially abundant -- was used. I would not expect all transcripts in a pathway to behave the same way in response to a perturbation, due to variation in half-life/stability, post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, etc. I recommend removing the expression ratio (right panel) from Figure 1. The left panel shows the data more clearly and more directly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insight and we agree that not all transcripts in a pathway behave the same way. However, we find the expression ratio panel visually informative to highlight the importance of a pathway in response to Aze, taking into consideration the total number of key genes involved in a pathway. For example, despite the larger number of DE genes associated with the Amino Acid Metabolism &amp; Degradation pathway compared to the Fatty Acid Degradation pathway, the expression ratio for the former in each transcriptome is lower than its Fatty Acid Degradation counterpart, indicating that the response of key fatty acid degradation genes to Aze is more pronounced. We have qualified the reasons for including expression ratios in Figure 1 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall I enjoyed reading the manuscript and applaud the authors on a nice contribution to this important field.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
