How is this stability compatible with the complexity and diversity of living forms? Looking for answers at protein level may be limiting as diverging protein sequences can result in similar morphologies. Inspired by the progressive role of apical-basal and planar cell polarity in development, we propose that stability, complexity, and diversity are emergent properties in populations of proliferating polarized cells. We support our hypothesis by a theoretical approach, developed to effectively capture both types of polar cell adhesions. When applied to specific cases of development – gastrulation and the origins of folds and tubes – our theoretical tool suggests experimentally testable predictions pointing to the strength of polar adhesion, restricted directions of cell polarities, and the rate of cell proliferation to be major determinants of morphological diversity and stability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38407.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have the power to organise themselves to form complex and stable structures, whether it is to create a fully shaped baby from a single egg, or to allow adult salamanders to grow a new limb after losing a leg. This ability has been scrutinised at many different levels. For example, researchers have looked at the chemical messages exchanged by cells, or they have recorded the different shapes an embryo goes through during development. However, it is still difficult to reconcile the information from these approaches into a description that makes sense at multiple scales.</p><p>When an embryo develops, sheets of cells fold and unfold to create complex 3D shapes, like the tubes that make our lungs. Moulding sheets into tubes relies on interactions between cells that are not the same in all directions. In fact, two types of asymmetry (or polarity) guide these interactions. Apical-basal polarity runs across a sheet of cells, which means that the top surface of the sheet differs from the bottom. Planar cell polarity runs along the sheet and distinguishes one end from the other. For instance, apical-basal polarity marks the inner and outer surfaces of our skin, while planar cell polarity controls the direction in which our hair grows.</p><p>Nissen et al. set out to investigate how these polarities help cells in an embryo organise themselves to form complicated folds and tubes. To do this, simple mathematical representations of both apical-basal and planar cell polarities were designed. The representations were then combined to create computer simulations of groups of cells as these divide and interact with each other.</p><p>Simulations of ‘cells’ with only apical-basal polarity were able to generate different shapes in the ‘tissues’ produced, including many found in living organisms. External conditions, such as how cells were arranged to start with, determined the resulting shape. With both apical-basal and planar cell polarities, the simulations reproduced an important change that occurs during early development. They also replicated how the tubes that transport nutrients and oxygen form.</p><p>These results show that simple properties of individual cells, such as polarities, can produce different shapes in developing tissues and organs, without the need for a complicated overarching program. Abnormal changes in cell polarity are also associated with diseases such as cancer. The mathematical model developed by Nissen et al. could therefore be a useful tool to study these events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organogenesis</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>pcp</kwd><kwd>convergent extension</kwd><kwd>metastable topologies</kwd><kwd>apical-basal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danmarks Grundforskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nissen</surname><given-names>Silas Boye</given-names></name><name><surname>Trusina</surname><given-names>Ala</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP/2007/2013/ERC no. 740704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sneppen</surname><given-names>Kim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biological shapes and morphological transitions can emerge from combining directed interactions between cells with apical-basal and planar cell polarity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular organisms are amazing in their ability to maintain complex morphology in face of continuous cell renewal and damages. Adult salamander can regenerate entire limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eguchi et al., 2011</xref>), and, during development, some regions can maintain patterning when moved to different parts of an embryo or if the size is varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). Given the vast complexity and diversity of living shapes, how can we reconcile the robustness to perturbations with flexibility to diversify? While undoubtedly the end result is encoded in the DNA and protein networks, looking for an answer at this level is challenging. Examples of phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Libby and Rainey, 2011</xref>), convergent evolution, and contrasting rates of morphological and protein evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherry et al., 1979</xref>) show that morphological similarity may not couple to the protein sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gould, 1970</xref>). Inspired by the unfolding of morphological complexity in development, we propose that cellular polarity may be the key for reconciling complexity, robustness, and diversity of organismal morphologies.</p><p>During early development, the increase in morphological complexity coincides with the progressive polarization of cells – first apical-basal (AB) polarity and then planar cell polarity (PCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller and Bossinger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roignot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Bowerman, 2010</xref>). This theme is ubiquitous across vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): starting from the single fertilized egg cell, first the morula formed by non-polarized cells turns into the blastula – a hollow sphere of cells with AB polarity. Then, as cells acquire additional PCP, primary head-tail axis forms and elongates during gastrulation and neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). Because of the optical transparency, these stages are particularly prominent in sea urchin. At the morula stage, a lumen in the center is formed and is gradually expanding as cells proliferate and rearrange into the hollow sphere. Next, during gastrulation, a group of cells invaginate and rearrange into a tube that narrows and elongates primarily by cell rearrangement and convergent extension movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martik and McClay, 2017</xref>). The tube then merges with the sphere at the side opposite to invagination, and as a result, the sphere transforms into a torus. Emerging data suggest that PCP drives both invagination and tube elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Croce et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2015</xref>) – a recurring theme across species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38407.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two symmetry-breaking events, gain of apical-basal (AB) polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP), on cellular level coincide with the appearance of a rich set of morphologies.</title><p>Starting from an aggregate of non-polarized cells (globular symmetry), individual cells can gain AB polarity and form one or multiple lumens (spherical symmetry).

Formation and elongation of the tubes can proceed without cell division and cell death by cells rearranging along the tube’s axis, termed convergent extension (CE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tanimizu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martik and McClay, 2017</xref>).

The early stages of organogenesis in the liver, kidney, brain, gut, and pancreas are apparently so robust, that they can be recapitulated in vitro, allowing for advanced quantification and manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Little, 2017</xref>). The case of pancreatic organoids is interesting as it illustrates an increase of morphological complexity from spheres to folds. Cells in in vitro pancreatic organoids first grow as a bulk and later acquire AB polarity and develop lumens. Depending on the growth conditions, organoids develop into a hollow sphere or acquire a complex folded shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greggio et al., 2013</xref>). It is currently unknown what drives the transition from sphere to folded state; the two possible hypotheses are rapid proliferation or physical pressure from growing into a stiff matrigel.</p><p>Is the apparent link between cellular polarity and morphological complexity accidental? Or, could it be that morphological transitions, stability, and diversity are emergent features in a population of proliferating polarized cells? If true, can we identify what drives the transition from lumens to folds and tubes? Why are these stable? Can we predict what controls fold depth, and tube length and width? To answer these questions, we lack a unified approach that could bridge polar interactions between single cells to the global features emerging on the scale of thousands of cells in 3D.</p><p>Starting with D’Arcy Thompson’s seminal contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thompson, 1942</xref>), quantitative models aided in understanding specific morphogenetic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, they are often on either of the two ends of the spectra: those modeling single cells explicitly, often rely on vertex-based approaches and are limited to dozens of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Misra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>). To capture the large features spanning thousands of cells, one typically turns to elastic models where AB polarity is implicit and epithelia is presented as a 2D elastic sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hannezo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Etournay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hufnagel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nagai and Honda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aliee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nagai and Honda, 2001</xref>).</p><p>We developed a theoretical approach that, with only a few parameters, bridges cellular and organ scales by integrating both types of polarity. A main difference to earlier approaches is that a cell’s movement is coupled to how its AB polarity and PCP are oriented relative to each other and relative to neighbor cell polarities. In other words, in our approach, the adhesion strength between neighbor cells is modulated by the orientation of their polarities. We find that polarity enables complex shapes robust to noise but sensitive to changes in initial and boundary constraints, thus supporting that morphological stability and diversity are emergent properties of polarized cell populations. Lumens, folds, and stable tubes emerge as a result of energy minimization. We make testable predictions on morphological transitions in pancreatic organoids, tubulogenesis, and sea urchin gastrulation. Our approach illustrates the evolutionary flexibility in the regulatory proteins and networks, and suggests that despite differences in proteins between organisms, the same core principles may apply.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Model</title><p>There are three key elements that allow us to bridge the scale from cellular level to macroscopic stable morphologies.</p><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>(1) Cells are approximated by point particles</title><p>Cell–cell adhesion is modeled by repulsive and attractive forces acting between cell centers.

In practice, we implemented the model in a MATLAB script (available in the Materials and methods section), where we use the Euler method. We perform the differentiation along the polarity by differentiating along all three cartesian coordinates (see Model details in the Materials and methods section). After each time step, we normalize the updated polarity vectors. The above differentiation does not include the change in partners when neighborhood changes. This is treated as a non-equilibrium step where potential energy can increase (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>).

In case of two cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>), the pair relaxes the imposed stress by rotating both the polarity and their positions. In biological terms, turning AB polarity in one cell (e.g. by apical constriction, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) of an epithelial sheet will induce bending of the sheet as is the case with bottle cells in invagination.</p><p>The present formulation of PCP has several implications. First, we restrict the effects of PCP to directed (anisotropic) cell–cell adhesion and do not consider its other possible roles, in for example asymmetric cell differentiation, thus primarily focusing on its role on CE. Second, in our current formulation, AB polarity and PCP influence each other’s orientation on equal footing (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref>). PCP, however, is typically constrained to the apical plane and thus is expected not to influence the orientation of AB polarity. Disabling PCP’s effect on AB polarity (see Materials and methods) does not influence our main results on tube formation and gastrulation. However, the symmetry in polarities is appealing for its simplicity and is indirectly supported by the following experimental observations: First, cells can acquire PCP without AB polarity present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zorn and Wells, 2009</xref>). Second, proteins required for AB polarity can be planar-polarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Warrington et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aigouy and Le Bivic, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi and Sokol, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dollar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaplan and Tolwinski, 2010</xref>). Third, changes in cell shapes during invagination (e.g. sliding of adherens junctions and formation of bottle cells) are regulated by PCP in neural tube closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ossipova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinoshita et al., 2008</xref>), gastrulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2006</xref>), sea urchin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Croce et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi and Sokol, 2009</xref>).

If proliferation is slow, and the time between two cell divisions anywhere in the system is longer than relaxation time of the whole system (the time it takes to reach equilibrium), the system approaches global equilibrium and will expand as a sphere.

For simplicity, we focus on the stability (ability to maintain regular diameter over time) and tube morphogenesis in systems without cell division.</p><p>Inducing PCP in a spherical lumen leads to two significant events. First, independent of initial orientation, after some transient time PCPs becomes globally ordered and point in direction parallel to an emerging equator that self-organizes around the sphere (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This arrangement has the lowest energy. Second, cells start intercalating along the axis perpendicular to PCP orientation, gradually elongating the lumen (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). During intercalations, cells exchange their neighbors through T1-like transitions as reported experimentally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>).

The two rows of cells with PCP pointing out of epithelial plane correspond to the cells at the dorsolateral hinge points next to the neural plate (epidermis boundaries). In chick, spinal neural tube can close with only these two hinge points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nikolopoulou et al., 2017</xref>).

A similar, exogastrulating, phenotype was observed in a PCP mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2015</xref>).

We have also tested the consequences of apical constriction (reorienting AB polarity) in the model without PCP and while this was sufficient for invagination, the cavity remained spherically symmetric and failed to form a tube.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite the stunning diversity and complexity of morphologies, the same concepts seem to emerge across organismal development. One of them is the link between local, cellular, and global, organs/whole organism, symmetry breaking. We know, from experimental and, to a lesser degree, theoretical work that cellular polarity is essential for forming axis, complex folded sheets, and interconnected tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). What we do not know is why are these shapes so stable, and where do the differences between species and organs come from. To understand the differences, we typically compare genes or gene regulatory networks, thus limiting our understanding to analog processes within a few related species.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phenomenological description bridges cell polarity to macroscopic morphologies</title><p>To address the origins of morphological diversity and stability across species and organs, we focused on a phenomenological description of polarized cell–cell interactions. This allowed us to bridge local single-cell symmetry breaking events to global changes in morphologies spanning tens of thousands of interacting cells. With this tool at hand, we find that with only a few parameters, we can recapitulate the two global symmetry breaking events: formation of epithelial sheets and folds by cells with AB polarity, and emergence of global axial symmetry (tubes) among cells with PCP.</p><p>Remarkably, our results show that interactions among AB polarized cells lead to stable morphologies, that after initial relaxation remain indefinitely in their final configuration. The morphologies are robust to noise, growth, and local damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results may explain how organs and embryos preserve their architecture while growing. Polar cell–cell interactions not only provide clue to the morphological stability, but also point to a simple explanation to the origin of the diversity. We find that the exact morphological details are defined by initial conditions, for example initial positions and orientation of polarities, and boundary conditions, for example polarities restricted to certain direction for a fraction of the cells. It is thus tempting to speculate that diverse shapes do not require multiple interacting morphogen gradients, but can be a result of differences in initial and/or boundary conditions: as for example presence of yolk cells at start and boundary constraints by vitelline membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schierenberg and Junkersdorf, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The diversity of shapes and forms is further enriched by a second symmetry breaking event, PCP, oriented perpendicular to AB polarity. Within our phenomenological framework, addition of PCP component is simple, and requires only two additional parameters: one favoring perpendicular orientation of AB polarity and PCP within a cell, and another, favoring parallel PCP alignments between neighbor cells. These constraints are the coarse-grained representation of the well-established experimental and computational results on intracellular symmetry breaking events and global ordering of planar polarities mediated by cell–cell coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Le Garrec et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amonlirdviman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The first constraint allowed formation of axial symmetry and in combination with AB polarity, stable tubes, with length and diameter remaining constant with time. The second constraint resulted in cell rearrangements and intercalations consistent with the cell-autonomous CE typically associated with PCP. The patterns of neighbor exchanges during cell-rearrangements are in line with the ubiquitous T1 exchanges through formation and resolution of four cell vertex, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>). The mechanism of the CE in our model is in line with the results by ‘filopodia tension model’ where elongated structures of many cells emerge from local cell–cell interactions in a direction defined by PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belmonte et al., 2016</xref>). The presented formulations of our model captures only some of the known events contributing to CE and does not include PCP-driven changes in cell shape mediated by for example apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>) or contribution of external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lye and Sanson, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Combining AB polarization and a local induction of PCP in a subpopulation of cells was sufficient to obtain main stages of sea urchin gastrulation: invagination, tube formation, and elongation through CE as well as merging of the tube with the animal pole at the top of the blastula. It is important to notice that the model for gastrulation uses an external force (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ25">Equation 25</xref>) acting on AB polarity, and the model for neurulation uses an imposed external constraint on PCP. This is not fully satisfying, and suggests an extension of the model to capture tissue bending induced by changes in cell shapes at the edge of the region that invaginates.</p><p>The existing in silico models treat invagination and CE-driven tube elongation as independent processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recent data, however, suggests that multiple mechanisms (intracellular apical constriction, intercellular directed cell division and cell intercalations, and supracellular actomyosin cables) act simultaneously and contribute to both invagination and tubulogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ossipova et al., 2014</xref>). Within our approach apical constriction (modeled as reorientation of AB polarity) and CE can act in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It will be interesting to parallel recent experimental work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2017</xref>) and computationally investigate how a combination of intra-, inter- and supracellular mechanisms contribute to the robustness of tubulogenesis, and to what extent the model can capture the range of observed phenotypes.</p><p>It has been proposed that the above mechanisms may all be coordinated by PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>). Besides the reported molecular links, a simple logic suggests that these mechanisms cannot be isotropic as in this case the initial bending will result in spherical structures. Thus, apical constriction, cell intercalations, and actomyosin cables have to be anisotropic (planar polarized) in directions consistent with the eventual tube orientation. This anisotropy is reported for both ‘wrapping’ tubes forming parallel to the epithelial plane, for example neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>), and ‘budding’ tubes forming orthogonally to the epithelial plane, for example salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sanchez-Corrales et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As organizing signals such as WNT can induce and orient PCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu and Sokol, 2016</xref>) within the apical plane, we asked if it is in principle possible to design PCP constraints (not limited to the apical plane) that would result in ‘wrapping’ and ‘budding’. First, pointing PCP out of the plane was sufficient for a sheet of cells to bend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is because in our formulation, PCP can drive reorientation of AB polarity and that in its turn is able to bend the sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Both ‘budding’ and ‘wrapping’ were qualitatively captured by the model when the axial and radial anisotropy were set by constraining orientation of PCP for cells within a circle (‘budding’ in sea urchin) and two stripes of cells (mimicking hinge points in neurulation ‘wrapping’). While CE was needed for proper tube forming in sea urchin example, the tube formed without CE in neurulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the simulations suggest that ‘wrapping’ in neurulation and gastrulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) vs. ‘budding’ in sea urchin and organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zegers, 2014</xref>) may be outcomes of different constraints imposed on PCP. While it is intriguing to speculate that PCP may be oriented out of epithelial plane directly by organizing signals, this may also be an indirect effect of a sequence of intermediate steps. As the organizing signals not only induce and orient PCP but also drive apical constriction (effectively reorienting AB polarity) the PCP may be gradually oriented out of the original plane of epithelium by the following sequence of events: PCP → apical constriction → tilt in AB polarity → tilt in apical plane → PCP out of original epithelial plane. This less precise but simpler interpretation highlights the fact that PCP may drive many of the alternative mechanisms of tubulogenesis and shifts the focus from the differences in mechanisms driving tubulogenesis to the differences in boundary conditions – a set of constraints imposed on cell polarities by neighboring tissue (e.g. notochord in neurulation and organizer in gastrulation).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Testable predictions</title><p>In addition to our conceptual findings, we propose three testable predictions. First, we predict that two potential mechanisms behind the emergence of folds in pancreatic organoids – matrigel resistance and rapid, out-of-equilibrium, cell proliferation – will result in distinct morphologies. Our results suggest that in case of rapid proliferation, the growing structure will develop many shallow folds close to the surface which later tend to deepen. In contrast, external pressure causes fewer but deeper and longer folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). And further, as organoids grow in size, the number of folds will reach an upper limit when under pressure, however, in case of rapid proliferation, the number of folds will keep growing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Visual inspection of published morphologies seems to support the out-of-equilibrium growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greggio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2017</xref>). To assess if the growth is out-of-equilibrium in 3D organoids, one can quantify the distributions of cell shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerruti et al., 2013</xref>). Our model thus predicts that quantitative counting of folds and measurements of the fold depth and length relative to the size of the growing structure may discriminate between the alternative hypothesis. Quantification of the folds can be done in in vitro organoids by either phase or confocal fluorescence microscopy of whole-mount immunostained samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greggio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The fold depth and length can be quantified with the same approach as applied to simulated shapes (Materials and methods) in binarized images of the 3D organoid surfaces. As oganoids cannot be cultured without gel supporting 3D growth, it will be necessary to vary both gel stiffness and generation time to uncouple their respective contribution to the folding. The work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Little, 2017</xref> shows that in brain organoids generation time can be both slowed down and speeded up by either genetic manipulation or by adding small molecule inhibitors of pathways regulating cell proliferation. Unfortunately, changing stiffness of matrigel also changes its biochemical composition and may affect cell proliferation and differentiation. One will have to turn to synthetic hydrogels, where it is now possible to uncouple mechanical and biochemical clues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gjorevski et al., 2016</xref>). To illustrate possible applications of our approach, we have only focused on two out of several possible mechanisms that may contribute to folding. The other likely alternative is that folding may result from differences in biomechanical interactions or generation times characteristic to the different cell types. These alternative scenarios are straightforward to consider in our model and will be an exciting venue to explore when more quantitative data on differences in organoid morphologies is available.</p><p>Our second prediction is that in case of tubes formed by non-proliferating cells, the length and width of the tubes are controlled by the relative strength of AB polarity and PCP. This result calls for quantification of adhesion proteins along the AB polarity and PCP axes. In PCP mutants with shorter and wider tubes, one would expect less planar polarization in adherens junctions and actomyosin, for example larger spread compared to wild type in their orientation quantified relative to the tube axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishimura et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, the balance between AB polarity and PCP can be altered by weakening AB polarity, for example mutating tight junction proteins should result in longer tubes. A similar phenotype has already been reported for <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laprise et al., 2010</xref>). With the recent advancements in in vitro systems of tubulogenesis, allowing for easy genetic manipulations and more amenable for quantitative imaging, it may in principle be possible to relate the extent of planar anisotropy in PCP mutants and strength of AB adhesion in tight junction mutants with tube length and diameter. The existing coupling between PCP and AB polarity may, however, make it challenging to tweak one polarity at a time.</p><p>Our third, and probably most challenging to test, prediction is on the conditions differentiating between tubes forming perpendicular (e.g. sea urchin gastrulation) or parallel (as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation or neurulation) to the plane of epithelium. We predict that the outcome will be defined by the orientation of PCP in the invaginating region and the geometry of the boundaries (circular for budding and axial for wrapping) set by for example WNT organizing signals. Recent development in imaging localization of PCP complexes in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu and Sokol, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Minegishi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Habib et al., 2013</xref>) allows monitoring localization of PCP complexes, and thus PCP orientation, in individual cells. By placing WNT-soaked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Habib et al., 2013</xref>) beads or WNT-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu and Sokol, 2016</xref>) one can vary PCP orientation in the cells at the epithelial boundary facing WNT and test for the direction of the epithelial bending and possibly tube formation.</p><p>Our approach is by purpose phenomenological and by its nature cannot make predictions about specific molecular details. In all cases, we do not see our simulations as finalized predictions, but rather as pointing in the most promising direction for further exploration of these complex developmental processes. Our setup easily allows for changes as we learn more. The proposed tool should be used in close collaboration with gained experimental knowledge on initial conditions, cell generation times and differentiation processes where polarities play a central role.</p><p>Our results open for a series of biological generalizations both in development and diseases. On one hand, we now may be able to explain and unify the apparently very distinct morphological transitions during gastrulation in flies, frogs, fish, mice, and humans by accounting for different initial and boundary conditions. Our model suggests how a moderate change in expression of polarities during some critical evolutionary stages could lead to widely different final morphologies. Thereby, development driven by cell–cell polarity interactions could provide major morphological transitions from local and transient modulations in polarity.</p><p>On the other hand, it becomes possible to think of gastrulation, neurulation, tubulogenesis, and organogenesis as the same class of phenomena, where the orientation of the tube is guided by local organizers, and lengths/widths of the tubes are determined by the relative strength of AB polarity and PCP. At the same time, there is an emerging view that wound healing and cancer are local perturbations – for example local loss of cells, dysregulation of cell polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2012</xref>), proliferation, or autonomously induced organizing signals – of otherwise conceptually the same developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Humphries and Mlodzik, 2018</xref>). The power of our model is that it allows to address these hypotheses through predictive models for the dynamics of many cells that interact through combinations of AB polarity and PCP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Throughout the paper, we use the Euler method to integrate the ordinary differential equations stated in the Model section with dt set to 0.1 or 0.2.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Theory bridging cell polarities with development of robust complex morphologies&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and Editor greatly appreciated the novelty of your theory that will hopefully stimulate discussion, experiments and new work. They found the paper a creative, and thought-provoking contribution to the field of development. It puts the emphasis on local and rather generic interactions between cells' polarities. It is a worthwhile goal to illustrate the range of morphogenetic events that could occur based on the assumed cellular behaviors, even if they reflect biological reality to greater or lesser extents. Nevertheless, the reviewers raise a number of concerns, summarised below. Please consider all of the reviewers' points. The reviewers often suggest presentation ideas since they do think the work is worthwhile, even if it is sometimes controversial it offers a good starting point for new models and discussion.</p><p>- The reviewers think, if the model is to inform our understanding of morphogenesis, that the mechanical forces in the model reflect, at least loosely, a physically plausible state of forces in the tissue. This is a very serious concern. Specifically, reviewer 1 raises serious concerns about the origins of tissue rotation that absolutely needs to be addressed. reviewer 2, from a very different perspective, seconds these concerns, worrying about the ability of PCP axes to influence AB axes. These points are better explained in the reviewer comments.</p><p>- All reviewers raised concerns about the sea urchin example and it would probably be useful to find a good way of either discussing this example. One suggestion is to use the current manuscript to show what is possible. The sea urchin example is (probably – unless we are misunderstanding things) implausible, but is a possible outcome given the input assumptions, and we'd therefore suggest not to eliminate it but discuss the plausibility. In the experts’ opinion, the initial conditions for neurulation are equally implausible, but still demonstrate the possibilities of the model.</p><p>- In short, a clear description of assumptions and their influence on the results would be much appreciated.</p><p>- In general, as you can easily see some of the reviewers are physicists, and some are biologists. It is a hard exercise but please try and rewrite the manuscript to appeal to both (e.g. define terms that are obvious to physicists, be critical in discussing biological reality for the ignorant physicist), as it is clear it does have the potential to influence both groups of researchers. There is no need to oversell.</p><p>- A discussion of testable predictions needs to be improved by making more explicit what manipulations would be performed and how outcomes would be analyzed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents a cell-based model for the morphogenesis of 3D epithelial structures. Cells, described as point particles, are endowed with two-unit vectors representing apico-basal (AB) polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP). Cells interact through a pair potential that is modulated according to the orientation of the polarity vectors. The positions of the cells and the orientations of the polarity vectors follow a simple relaxational dynamics, with a stochastic term.</p><p>The introduction of a minimal model to study the collective dynamics of polarized cells, in the context of epithelial morphogenesis, is of potential interest. However, to be of value, such a model should present a physically consistent description of the phenomena of interest. I am unclear that this is the case of the present model. Although its energy function is invariant under simultaneous rotation of the cell positions and polarity vectors, the dynamics as written here (below equation 8) can give rise to a net torque and rotation of the system, which should not be if motion is driven by internal forces. To rephrase my concern, if I understand the model correctly, the orientation-dependence of the energy means that the tissue as whole can rotate to orient in a specific direction, like a compass in a magnetic field (I think that's part of how flat sheets are made in one example). But for a freely-floating tissue there isn't an extrinsic force like the magnetic field to rotate it around, and it's not a motion that can occur through intercellular forces.</p><p>This is particularly evident when the polarities are fixed: with a fixed AB polarity alone (as in Figure 4), a doublet of cells minimizing its energy would rotate to align perpendicular to their polarity vectors (cf. the coupling term in equation 6). As far as I understand it, the same effect is at play in the application of the model to sea urchin gastrulation (Figure 7): the imposition of a fixed PCP orientation, through a displacement of AB polarity, gives rise to an extrinsic torque that bends the tissue. If this interpretation of the model is correct, if there's an extrinsic force imposing the orientation of the surface at every point, the model is not a serious contender to explain how an urchin is made. It's maybe less critical for other examples but leaves me unclear how seriously the possibilities illustrated by the model can be taken. That being said, the model certainly stands as a stimulant for further thinking along the same lines.</p><p>Similarly, in the case of fold formation on a sphere (Figure 5), which the authors suggest can occur if cell proliferation is on a faster time scale than relaxation, the physical origin of a slow relaxation time scale, and the mechanism of the observed instability, would merit discussion. Although assuming relaxational dynamics is standard and justified when the local minima of the energy are of interest, it might be questioned when turning to dynamical phenomena. Do folds develop through buckling, because the sphere grows (in number of cells) faster than it can expand in the surrounding medium? In many contexts, mechanical equilibration is much faster (seconds or minutes) than proliferation (hours). What would be the origin of a longer time scale for relaxation? Resistance from the surrounding medium might be one, but the authors present fast proliferation as an alternative mechanism to pressure from growth in a stiff gel.</p><p>I also have some issues of form with the manuscript (e.g. I do not find the connection that the authors draw between the model and evolution very substantive), but the above questions on the physical relevance of the model are the main issues that I would like to see clarified before the manuscript is given further consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes a mathematical model and associated simulations of large clusters of cells that can be assigned properties of apical basal polarity and planar cell polarity and may proliferate, to follow their 3D morphological evolution. The aim is to test the hypothesis that &quot;stability, complexity, and diversity are emergent properties in populations of proliferating polarized cells.&quot; The authors conclude that &quot;polarity enables complex shapes robust to noise but sensitive to changes in initial and boundary constraints.&quot; The work is of potential interest, but a number of substantial issues should be addressed. Most important, some essential definitions are not provided, the writing needs to be made more accessible to biologists who are not modelers, some key assumptions should be made explicit, and others.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Definitions needed: What precisely is meant by &quot;stability?&quot; Are the authors referring to feature constancy over time? Do they mean that models will converge to a specified set of features? What features? For example, they suggest that the trajectory in Figure 3 is stable, but noise seems to qualitatively change the shape (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), though it still produces a complex folded shape. It's not clear what, exactly, the authors are claiming.</p><p>I struggled with the idea of &quot;boundary conditions.&quot; I eventually concluded that, here, the term appears to mean restrictions on polarity orientations, and maybe other parameters. However, to a biologist, &quot;boundary conditions&quot; means something very different. Difficulty with this passage was compounded by the challenging sentence &quot;At the same time, in these symmetric cases the differences in initial conditions (no boundary conditions) are not sufficient to generate different structures.&quot; This implies that differences in initial conditions means no boundary conditions. I think the authors mean to say &quot;differences in initial conditions but without imposed boundary conditions.&quot; Finally, in the Discussion section the authors say, &quot;boundary conditions, e.g. fixed polarities for a fraction of the cells in some time.&quot; A precise definition should be provided when the idea of boundary conditions is first introduced.</p><p>&quot;Minima&quot; is defined in the Materials and methods section, but the authors also use &quot;maxima.&quot; By analogy, one can guess what this means, but please define.</p><p>Improve writing to make accessible to biologists: I'm a biologist with ample experience collaborating with modelers. Still, I found the manuscript difficult to follow and needed several readings to understand. If the goal is to make this work accessible to a broad audience (and it should be if published in <italic>eLife</italic>), the authors should carefully revise the text to replace jargon with precise simple language.</p><p>Describe implications of model structure: Several features of the model are not as explicit as they should be. One is the conflation of PCP with convergent extension behavior. PCP defines a vectorial molecular asymmetry, and PCP can have a number of outcomes. One is CE, but others include the asymmetric elaboration of cellular structures, or the asymmetric induction of gene expression that results in different cell fates, for example. Here, the model structure equates PCP to forces that drive CE. Furthermore, the descriptions of this implementation are misleading. In the Introduction, the authors, in describing the implementation of AB and PCP polarity, say &quot;In other words, the adhesion strength between neighbor cells is modulated by the orientation of their polarities.&quot; Are the authors describing how AB and PCP (=CE) are implemented in the model, or how they function biologically? There is no evidence that molecular PCP functions by regulation of adhesion (involvement of Celsr proteins notwithstanding), and differential adhesion is only one part of a complex and only partially understood set of mechanisms that drive CE.</p><p>Another implicit part of the model as I understand it, and one that is probably very important to the outcomes, is the notion that altering PCP vectors can influence the AB vectors of cells. I know of no biological precedent to justify this behavior. This input assumption is inconsistent with my understanding of the biological reality. AB polarity is an initial condition that must be met for the subsequent establishment of PCP, which is then by definition orthogonal to the AB axis. There are examples in which PCP determines edges of groups of cells that then increase tension, thereby inducing folds, but this is a different mechanism from the one implied here. I think it would be interesting for the authors to explore how their model would operate if AB polarities orient PCP, but PCP cannot directly influence AB. I suspect that the examples of tube formation would fail. At a minimum, they should discuss the need for this assumption explicitly, noting that it is not currently supported by biological data (or citing the data if there is some that I'm not aware of).</p><p>Some unlikely assumptions: While it may be interesting that complex forms such as the sea urchin-like gastrulation and the folded neural tube CAN be produced within the confines of the model, the conditions needed stretch the bounds of plausibility. The model simulating sea urchin gastrulation requires a precise choreography of PCP parameters that could happen but seem unlikely. Even more difficult to believe is the initial conditions invoked to simulate neural plate folding. Specifically, invoking &quot;two rows where the PCP points parallel and antiparallel to AB polarity&quot; invokes conditions for which I know of no precedent at all.</p><p>Additional discussion of testable predictions needed: Re-emergence of folds in pancreatic organoids, pressure causes fewer and much deeper folds that form early during growth. This seems to be a qualitative measure. How would biological observations be assigned to one or the other category? Isn't the key difference that the pressure hypothesis predicts that the number of minima maxes out, whereas the proliferation model predicts that the number keeps growing with increase in size (Figure 5)?</p><p>Re tubes formed by nonproliferating cells, &quot;in PCP mutants with shorter and wider tubes one would expect higher fraction of &quot;AB adhesion&quot; relative to &quot;PCP adhesion&quot;. However, as noted above, PCP is not directly related to any known adhesion events.</p><p>Re the conditions differentiating between tubes forming perpendicular (e.g. sea urchin gastrulation) or parallel (as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation or neurulation) to the plane of epithelium, the measurements could in principle be made, but as noted above, the conditions seem to me to be highly implausible, and ask us to ignore the likely contribution of other signals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a creative and innovative article on development. The authors introduce a simple theoretical model based on the idea that apical-basal (AB) polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP) are (the) main driving forces relevant for the formation of complex tissue morphologies. The model idealises cells as point particles with two independent axes (polarities), an AB and a PCP axis. Pairwise interactions between cells contain an attractive and a repulsive component where the magnitude of the attractive component depends on three additive factors: alignment of the AB axis, alignment between AB and PCP axis, and alignment of PCP axis. Noise comes into the model at various levels: Langevin noise in the equations of motion, noise at the level of choosing the axes orientation at cell proliferation, and noise at the level of initial conditions. In summary, this seems to be a computationally efficient model to explore the question: How can cell-cell adhesion that depends on the relative orientation of polarisation axes alone drive different morphologies during development?</p><p>Indeed, the authors simulations show that their model is able to reproduce a broad range of morphologies depending on several factors: choice of initial conditions, relative tendencies of the various axis to orient with respect to each other, and cell proliferation rate. A clear strength of the computational model (I would not call it a theory) is that it provides a mechanistic link between morphology and cell-cell interaction as well as initial conditions. Thus, I find it a clear conceptual advance in the field which puts a fresh perspective on the role of generic interactions for the emergence of different tissue morphologies. The authors also list a few testable predictions. Here, I am not so convinced yet for very basic reasons: Testable predictions require either a clear link between a molecular and an emergent process, or a set of mutually exclusive alternatives that can be tested. Concerning the latter case (in the section of organoids) the authors analyse two possible scenarios (cell proliferation and a specific way to implement external forces). These are not two mutually exclusive alternatives but only two out of many possible conceivable scenarios. Concerning the former case, in the example on sea urchin gastrulation the authors seems to a large degree put in what they would like to get out. Finally, and this is more on the side of a personal opinion, I am not convinced that morphologies that strongly depend on initial conditions are a robust way for cellular development. For instance, how can an organism make sure that all these initial conditions are properly chosen?</p><p>In summary, I found the paper a well-written, creative, and thought-provoking contribution to the field of development. It puts the emphasis on local and rather generic interactions between cells' polarities. If the authors can convincingly reply to my above queries, I would be inclined to recommend it for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38407.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript presents a cell-based model for the morphogenesis of 3D epithelial structures.

If this interpretation of the model is correct, if there's an extrinsic force imposing the orientation of the surface at every point, the model is not a serious contender to explain how an urchin is made. It's maybe less critical for other examples but leaves me unclear how seriously the possibilities illustrated by the model can be taken. That being said, the model certainly stands as a stimulant for further thinking along the same lines.</p></disp-quote><p>The above intuition about cell movement/rotation is correct as is now cooperated by Figure 2—figure supplement 3B. Also it is correct that our previous gastrulation Figure 7 used PCP to twist AB polarity and thereby enforce invagination from the outside. As our whole description of this process was too complicated we have changed to a simple one step scenario where all the gastrulation occur due to one particular set of initial conditions, and where invagination directly is caused by an initial twist of AB polarity of a subset of cells. We cannot claim that this a realistic scenario, but we propose it may be an indirect way of simulating the effects of bottle cells, and keep this example to illustrate the potential of our approach. Also we maintain the neurulation figure in supplement (Figure 1—figure supplement 11) although this still relies on the speculative assumption that changed PCP could direct movement of AB polarity. In any case the main role of PCP in our sea urchin gastrulation model is to direct the convergent extension after an initial deformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, in the case of fold formation on a sphere (Figure 5), which the authors suggest can occur if cell proliferation is on a faster time scale than relaxation, the physical origin of a slow relaxation time scale, and the mechanism of the observed instability, would merit discussion. Although assuming relaxational dynamics is standard and justified when the local minima of the energy are of interest, it might be questioned when turning to dynamical phenomena. Do folds develop through buckling, because the sphere grows (in number of cells) faster than it can expand in the surrounding medium? In many contexts, mechanical equilibration is much faster (seconds or minutes) than proliferation (hours). What would be the origin of a longer time scale for relaxation? Resistance from the surrounding medium might be one, but the authors present fast proliferation as an alternative mechanism to pressure from growth in a stiff gel.</p></disp-quote><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38407.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>At cell division, the daughter cell equilibrates by half a cell radius in one time unit, which is of order 1/1000 the generation time.</title><p>Here, we show how a new cell (in blue) reaches equilibrium (in red).

Do they mean that models will converge to a specified set of features? What features? For example, they suggest that the trajectory in Figure 3 is stable, but noise seems to qualitatively change the shape (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), though it still produces a complex folded shape. It's not clear what, exactly, the authors are claiming.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this imprecision out. By stability we mean both constancy in time and ability to converge to similar sizes and relative position of lumens and folds in presence of noise. We realized that the reader may have been confused in comparing Figure 3D with Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–F. The simulations in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3 were started from different initial conditions and should not be compared for shape similarity.</p><p>The intention was to separately illustrate stability in time (in Figure 3) and stability to noise (in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–F, where we compare end-results of the simulations run at high, Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, and low, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, noise). The shapes emerging under high and low noise are not identical, however a high level of similarity – relative position and sizes of the majority of channels and lumens – is preserved. Ideally, this larger scale qualitative comparison, sketched in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–F would benefit from a more rigorous quantification, by e.g. mapping changes in network of channels and lumens, but it is non-trivial and we judged it to be outside of the scope of this article. (To compare the relative impact of noise vs. initial conditions, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we used distributions of pairwise distances between cells that were in the same position at start. This simple method however does not work for comparing macroscopical features).</p><p>We have rewritten the subsection”The final shapes are robust to noise but sensitive to initial and boundary conditions” describing stability results. We also modified Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G to visually point to macroscopic similarities.</p><p>While addressing this point, we realized that the observed changes due to high noise come from noise acting only at early time, during “expansion” stage. The same level of noise applied after the system reached metastable state does not cause any major macroscopic changes, further supporting the link between polarity and morphological stability. We have added a sentence and Figure 2—figure supplement 1G to cover this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I struggled with the idea of &quot;boundary conditions.&quot; I eventually concluded that, here, the term appears to mean restrictions on polarity orientations, and maybe other parameters. However, to a biologist, &quot;boundary conditions&quot; means something very different.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now introduced biological context for what we mean by boundary conditions and then defined the term “boundary condition” in subsection ”Folding by pressure or rapid proliferation result in different fold-morphologies”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Difficulty with this passage was compounded by the challenging sentence &quot;At the same time, in these symmetric cases the differences in initial conditions (no boundary conditions) are not sufficient to generate different structures.&quot; This implies that differences in initial conditions means no boundary conditions.

Still, I found the manuscript difficult to follow and needed several readings to understand. If the goal is to make this work accessible to a broad audience (and it should be if published in eLife), the authors should carefully revise the text to replace jargon with precise simple language.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced a number of technical terms with a simpler expressions (e.g. replaced “metastable”, “topology”). Defined the terms “boundary conditions”, “stability” and tubes, and tried to simplify the language throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Describe implications of model structure: Several features of the model are not as explicit as they should be. One is the conflation of PCP with convergent extension behavior. PCP defines a vectorial molecular asymmetry, and PCP can have a number of outcomes. One is CE, but others include the asymmetric elaboration of cellular structures, or the asymmetric induction of gene expression that results in different cell fates, for example. Here, the model structure equates PCP to forces that drive CE.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. To clarify model implications, we have added a the following paragraph to subsection”Model implications”: “The present formulation of PCP effects has several implications. First, we restrict the effects of PCP to directed (anisotropic) cell–cell adhesion and do not consider its other possible roles, in e.g. asymmetric cell differentiation, thus primarily focusing on its role in CE. Second, in our current formulation AB polarity and PCP influence each others orientation on equal footing. However, as PCP is typically established in the apical plane, and is thus secondary to AB polarity, the current view is that AB polarity can influence PCP orientation and not the other way around.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Furthermore, the descriptions of this implementation are misleading. In the Introduction, the authors, in describing the implementation of AB and PCP polarity, say &quot;In other words, the adhesion strength between neighbor cells is modulated by the orientation of their polarities.&quot; Are the authors describing how AB and PCP (=CE) are implemented in the model, or how they function biologically?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we reformulated the sentence to: “In other words, in our approach the adhesion strength between neighbor cells is modulated by the orientation of their polarities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) There is no evidence that molecular PCP functions by regulation of adhesion (involvement of Celsr proteins notwithstanding), and differential adhesion is only one part of a complex and only partially understood set of mechanisms that drive CE.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the healthy dose of skepticism, as while initially this was also our view – originally in subsection”Cell–cell adhesion depends on the orientation of polarity” we stated “However, unlike with tight junctions, there is no biological confirmation for preferred directional adhesion with PCP” – this comment motivated us to do a careful literature survey.</p><p>We found that both proteins regulating adherens junctions, e.g. Smash (Beati et al., 2018) as well as adherence proteins, proteins forming adherens junctions, e.g. Bazooka, E-cadherins (Simões et al., 2010; Tamada et al., 2017; Levayer and Lecuit, 2013; Warrington et al., 2013; Aigouy and Le Bivic, 2016) are planar polarized. These, we believe, support our assumption of anisotropic, planar polarized adhesion. In case, if the arguments below are notwithstanding, we would very much appreciate reviewer's opinion on where they fail.</p><p>We have now modified the paragraph in subsection”Cell–cell adhesion depends on the orientation of polarity”, below Equation 8, which now reads “Cells adhere to each other by membrane proteins assembled in adherens junctions just below the apical surface. Both proteins regulating adherens junctions, e.g. Smash (Beati et al., 2018) as well as adherence proteins forming adherens junctions can be planar polarized, e.g. Bazooka, E-cadherins (Simões et al., 2010; Tamada et al., 2017; Levayer and Lecuit, 2013; Warrington et al., 2013; Aigouy and Le Bivic, 2016). These indirectly support our assumption of anisotropic, planar polarized adhesion.“</p><p>We do agree that likely there are other mechanisms contributing to convergent extension, and have added this to the DDiscussion section which now reads “The presented formulations of model captures only some of the known events contributing to CE and does not include PCP-driven cell-shape changes mediated by e.g. apical constriction (Nishimura, Honda, and Takeichi, 2012) or contribution of external forces (Lye and Sanson, 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Another implicit part of the model as I understand it, and one that is probably very important to the outcomes, is the notion that altering PCP vectors can influence the AB vectors of cells. I know of no biological precedent to justify this behavior. This input assumption is inconsistent with my understanding of the biological reality. AB polarity is an initial condition that must be met for the subsequent establishment of PCP, which is then by definition orthogonal to the AB axis. There are examples in which PCP determines edges of groups of cells that then increase tension, thereby inducing folds, but this is a different mechanism from the one implied here.</p></disp-quote><p>We again appreciate the input, and have shown that constraining PCP to the apical plane (more details on this in our reply below) does not affect CE and formation of tubes neither when we start form spherical lumen (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) or simulate sea urchin gastrulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) I think it would be interesting for the authors to explore how their model would operate if AB polarities orient PCP, but PCP cannot directly influence AB. I suspect that the examples of tube formation would fail. At a minimum, they should discuss the need for this assumption explicitly, noting that it is not currently supported by biological data (or citing the data if there is some that I'm not aware of).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for stressing this point. Indeed, in our formulation (described by Equation 7) PCP and AB polarity can influence each on equal footing, and we used this symmetry to propose an alternative hypothesis for invagination during sea urchin gastrulation (orientation of PCP set at the boundaries drive the orientation of AB polarity).</p><p>While we did explore the consequences of unidirectional, AB polarity to PCP, effects, we also found data supporting that PCP may be primary to, and direct AB polarity.</p><p>Consequences of constraining PCP: We have explored the consequences of constraining the hierarchy or polarities in two ways: First, in case of sea urchin gastrulation, without modifying our model we impose boundary conditions directly onto AB vectors (Figure 7; the entire section on sea urchin gastrulation was updated to reflect this change). Biologically, this is an implicit way to capture the effect of the bottle cells, where the change in cell shapes effectively reorients AB vectors in neighboring cells (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Second, we have directly tested how disabling PCP pull on AB polarity (setting λ<sub>2</sub> to 0 when updating Equation 10) affects tube formation. We observe no qualitative difference compared to our original results in neither tube formation (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), nor sea urchin gastrulation (not included), thus suggesting that we could relax our assumption symmetry between PCP and AB influence.</p><p>Data supporting that PCP may influence AB polarity: The idea that AB polarity and PCP may act on equal footing is appealing both for its symmetry and simplicity, and we were excited to find a number of recent data supporting that PCP is not necessarily secondary to AB polarity and may regulate AB polarity and influence its orientation.</p><p>i) Cells can acquire PCP without AB polarity present. The two examples are the radial intercalation of the multiciliated cell progenitors in <italic>Xenopus</italic> epithelia (Ossipova et al., 2015) and transition from the solid cord to a tube in intestine morphogenesis of Zebrafish (Baer, Chanut-Delalande and Affolter, 2009; Zorn and Wells, 2009). In both of these examples, cells acquire AB polarity after convergent extension / intercalation events driven by PCP.</p><p>ii) Proteins required for AB polarity can become planar-polarized. These include: Baz/Par-3 protein (Warrington, Strutt and Strutt, 2013; Aigouy and Le Bivic, 2016) which in <italic>Drosophila</italic> development has a role in both AB polarity and PCP (Beati et al., 2018); PCP regulates Lgl, protein central for establishing AB polarity (Choi and Sokol, 2009; Dollar et al., 2005) and Lgl as well as other AB polarity proteins are planar polarized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epidermis (Kaplan and Tolwinski, 2010).</p><p>iii) The changes in cell-shapes during invagination (e.g. sliding of adherens junctions and formation of bottle cells) are regulated by PCP. These changes in cell-shapes effectively reorient AB polarity (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Apical constriction leading to formation of bottle cells is under PCP control during neural tube closure (Ossipova et al., 2014; Nishimura, Honda and Takeichi, 2012; Kinoshita et al., 2008); gastrulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Lee et al., 2006), sea urchin (Croce et al., 2006) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Choi and Sokol, 2009). Also, the sliding of adherens junctions leads to shorter AB axis and is mediated by a Baz (key protein in PCP and AB polarity) during <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrulation (Wang et al., 2012). Thus, the data shows that PCP can drive changes of the cell-shape (and consequently orientation of AB polarity) and while does not directly explain how the orientations of PCP and AB polarity are coordinated, it supports our assumption that components of PCP pathway can influence the orientation of AB polarity.</p><p>These points are now included in the subsection ”Model implications”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Some unlikely assumptions: While it may be interesting that complex forms such as the sea urchin-like gastrulation and the folded neural tube CAN be produced within the confines of the model, the conditions needed stretch the bounds of plausibility. The model simulating sea urchin gastrulation requires a precise choreography of PCP parameters that could happen but seem unlikely. Even more difficult to believe is the initial conditions invoked to simulate neural plate folding. Specifically, invoking &quot;two rows where the PCP points parallel and antiparallel to AB polarity&quot; invokes conditions for which I know of no precedent at all.</p></disp-quote><p>We should have been more explicit on how our assumptions for both cases relate to the current understanding of these processes. In case of sea urchin gastrulation, the process is believed to consist of two stages, primary invagination driven by swelling of the inner layer of extracellular matrix beneath invaginating cells (Lane et al., 1993) and formation of a ring of bottle cells due to apical constriction (Kimberly and Hardin, 1998) and secondary invagination were tube elongates due to CE and pull by mesenchymal cell (Lyons, Kaltenbach, and McClay, 2012). This was the motivation for two discrete stages in our original model formulation.</p><p>We have now converged to a simpler, less choreographed version, where all conditions can be set prior to invagination and PCP remains in apical plane. First, we set boundary condition such that planar cell polarities of the invaginating cells are oriented on a spiral, and are all in the apical plane. This constraint allows for convergent extension and is present at all times. While not documented, it is consistent with observed effects of WNT orienting PCP within apical plane (Humphries and Mlodzik, 2017). Second, instead of driving invagination by PCP orientation, we simulate the effect of bottle cells (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2) by reorienting AB polarities. This external force on AB polarity can be thought of as a combined effect of bottle cells and bending by swelling of neighboring extracellular matrix. Motivated by the observations in other species where the changes of cell shapes are sufficient for invagination (does not require swelling of neighboring extracellular matrix), we have tested the case where the AB polarities of bottle cell neighbors prefer to be tilted towards each other (as in Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This completely cell-intrinsic scenario produces similar invagination outcome.</p><p>These changes are now described in a new Figure 7 and updated subsection ”Phenomenological description bridges cell polarity to macroscopic morphologies”.</p><p>The most provoking and least likely assumptions in our initial formulation was the hypothesis that boundary conditions may set PCP to point out of the apical plane. We formulated it as direct effect of instructive cues by organizing morphogens (e.g. WNT), however this effect may be indirect and act through e.g. reported cell-shape changes where PCP drives apical constriction (see our reply to point 12), which tilts AB axis in neighboring cells, thus tilting PCP orientation.</p><p>In case of neurulation, the idea was to simulate the neural plate (cells in the middle, between the two rows with constrained PCP) surrounded by the epidermis (the rest of cells). The two rows of cells with PCP pointing out of epithelial plane would then correspond to the cells at the dorsolateral hinge points next to the neural plate (epidermis boundaries). In chick spinal neural tube can close with only these two hinge points (Nikolopoulou et al., 2017). The bending is driven by apical constriction and PCP is essential for bending, CE and closure (Nikolopoulou et al., 2017). We used very simple brute-force constrain on PCP (pointing out of the epithelial plane) at the boundaries, meant to represent hinge points, to show that this could drive the entire process. Here again, this may be an indirect effect of PCP → Apical constriction → tilt of AB polarity → PCP points out of the original plane of epithelium. Including an intermediate step linking PCP with apical constriction (by e.g. introducing potential favoring tilted AB polarities) and convergent extension is rather simple and would likely result in a more robust model and require less fine-tuning of boundary conditions but is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>We have updated the Discussion section to include our reflections on PCP pointing out of plane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Additional discussion of testable predictions needed: Re-emergence of folds in pancreatic organoids, pressure causes fewer and much deeper folds that form early during growth. This seems to be a qualitative measure. How would biological observations be assigned to one or the other category?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you! We realized that we did not stress the quantitative aspect well enough and have edited the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition to the qualitative description, our results also suggest that the two scenarios can be distinguished quantitatively by the differences in depth and length of the folds (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We now refer to this figure also in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Isn't the key difference that the pressure hypothesis predicts that the number of minima maxes out, whereas the proliferation model predicts that the number keeps growing with increase in size (Figure 5)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is indeed a key difference and is now clarified both in the Results section and in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Re tubes formed by nonproliferating cells, &quot;in PCP mutants with shorter and wider tubes one would expect higher fraction of &quot;AB adhesion&quot; relative to &quot;PCP adhesion&quot;. However, as noted above, PCP is not directly related to any known adhesion events.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now elaborated on this prediction in the Discussion section. Please also see our reply to point 9 above. We also realized that our formulation “PCP adhesion “was probably confusing. We did not mean to claim this has to be a direct effect of PCP. Because we represent cells as point particles, the PCP in our model is a phenomenological description and is meant to represent the combined effect of anisotropic, both extra- and intracellular, factors (e.g. anisotropic apical constriction, polarized junctional actomyosin) that would direct cell movements and favor its position among other cells depending on orientation of these factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Re the conditions differentiating between tubes forming perpendicular (e.g. sea urchin gastrulation) or parallel (as in Drosophila gastrulation or neurulation) to the plane of epithelium, the measurements could in principle be made, but as noted above, the conditions seem to me to be highly implausible, and ask us to ignore the likely contribution of other signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added an extensive discussion addressing both the implausibility of PCP pointing out of plane of epithelium as well as the contribution of other factors (Discussion section).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) This is a creative and innovative article on development. The authors introduce a simple theoretical model based on the idea that apical-basal (AB) polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP) are (the) main driving forces relevant for the formation of complex tissue morphologies. The model idealises cells as point particles with two independent axes (polarities), an AB and a PCP axis. Pairwise interactions between cells contain an attractive and a repulsive component where the magnitude of the attractive component depends on three additive factors: alignment of the AB axis, alignment between AB and PCP axis, and alignment of PCP axis. Noise comes into the model at various levels: Langevin noise in the equations of motion, noise at the level of choosing the axes orientation at cell proliferation, and noise at the level of initial conditions. In summary, this seems to be a computationally efficient model to explore the question: How can cell-cell adhesion that depends on the relative orientation of polarisation axes alone drive different morphologies during development?</p><p>Indeed, the authors simulations show that their model is able to reproduce a broad range of morphologies depending on several factors: choice of initial conditions, relative tendencies of the various axis to orient with respect to each other, and cell proliferation rate. A clear strength of the computational model (I would not call it a theory) is that it provides a mechanistic link between morphology and cell-cell interaction as well as initial conditions. Thus, I find it a clear conceptual advance in the field which puts a fresh perspective on the role of generic interactions for the emergence of different tissue morphologies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree “theory” may overstate the nature of our work. The main motivation for calling it theory was to highlight that our approach is intentionally phenomenological and can work with few parameters. Computational model is a broad term and often associated with dozens of parameters. We have compromised the two by replacing “Theory” in the title with “Theoretical tool”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also list a few testable predictions. Here, I am not so convinced yet for very basic reasons: Testable predictions require either a clear link between a molecular and an emergent process, or a set of mutually exclusive alternatives that can be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that by its nature our phenomenological description is outside the realm of mechanistic predictions targeted at specific proteins. While the alternatives we consider are not mutually exclusive, one can in principle test how much each contributes to the final result e.g. varying the stiffness of the gel and generation time. We now added a more detailed discussion on this in the Discussion section.</p><p>The scenarios explored for pancreatic organoid folding are not limited to only two possibilities mentioned in the paper. (Other possibilities are the instabilities associated to secreted morphogens and the bias of cell differentiating into slow and fast growing cells depending on their position in the fold.) We see our model and predictions as a starting point and motivation for quantitatively testing organoid morphologies as our results suggest that different scenarios may result in quantitatively different shapes. The model will be rather easy to modify to either consider other alternatives or explore the combined effect of several, but we lack constraints by experimental data for this to be meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concerning the latter case (in the section of organoids) the authors analyse two possible scenarios (cell proliferation and a specific way to implement external forces). These are not two mutually exclusive alternatives but only two out of many possible conceivable scenarios. Concerning the former case, in the example on sea urchin gastrulation the authors seems to a large degree put in what they would like to get out.</p></disp-quote><p>In regards to gastrulation, we have simplified the modeling of gastrulation greatly in the new version, reducing it to one step: one initial condition of twisted AB polarities and one boundary condition in form of an external constraint/forcing on PCP. This emphasizes the simple interplay of initial invagination and convergent extension, and makes the connection between input and output even more transparent. We very much agree that a more realistic approach should include forces that favour invagination from cell shapes (e.g. bottle cells) and various checkpoints and differentiation processes along the developmental pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, and this is more on the side of a personal opinion, I am not convinced that morphologies that strongly depend on initial conditions are a robust way for cellular development. For instance, how can an organism make sure that all these initial conditions are properly chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>Agree, but in Figure 2 we did not have any external constraints (boundary conditions). Overall, we try to convene that both initial conditions and external constraints are important. Initial conditions can be overruled by boundary conditions, i.e. persistent constraints on cell polarities by e.g. neighboring tissues through intra- and extracellular feedbacks. The robustness of the developmental process most likely stems from these constraints. All the finally obtained morphologies are subsequently robust to noise, growth and disruptions (see also the new Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In summary, I found the paper a well-written, creative, and thought-provoking contribution to the field of development. It puts the emphasis on local and rather generic interactions between cells' polarities. If the authors can convincingly reply to my above queries, I would be inclined to recommend it for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very happy for this overall positive view on our work, and hope that our response and the resulting changes, including in particular our simpler gastrulation treatment and more modest claims, sufficiently improved the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
