The epidemic of TB has brought heavy economic and social burdens to countries around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global TB Report 2022, the global spending on essential TB services for TB diagnosis, treatment, and prevention has exceeded $6.4 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Global tuberculosis report 2023, 2023</xref>). Besides, drug-resistant forms of Mtb are currently on course to be the world’s deadliest pathogens, responsible for a quarter of deaths due to antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furin et al., 2019</xref>). The prevalence of drug-resistant Mtb is also a major threat to the control of TB. Hence, it has been an urgent task for researchers to develop more effective measures for the prevention and treatment of TB.</p><p>Recent advances in gut microbiota explorations have led to improved knowledge of the ‘gut–lung axis’. Some studies have shown that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis may affect the occurrence and development of respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory pathogens infection, etc. by the ‘gut–lung axis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keely et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barcik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The documents about the relationship between gut microbiota and TB have increased in recent years, and increasing evidence supports the presence of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis in TB patients. A case–control study of pulmonary TB in pediatric patients showed that the abundance of <italic>Prevotellaceae</italic> and <italic>Enterococcaceae</italic> was increased, and the abundance of <italic>Oscillospiraceae</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacteriaceae</italic> was decreased in TB patients compared with healthy control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Maji et al. have found that the levels of <italic>Provetalla</italic> decreased and <italic>Bacteroides</italic> increased in TB patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maji et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, our teams’ study in active TB patients showed the abundance of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> significantly altered compared with health subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2024</xref>). Another study also showed the phylum of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> altered in the feces samples of patients with recurrent TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2017</xref>). All these researches indicated that Mtb infection can lead to the alteration of intestinal microbiota composition.</p><p>However, the causal relations between Mtb infection and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis have not been fully elucidated. Some factors including alcohol, smoking, HIV infection, and diabetes have been proven to cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, and these also are important risk factors for TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naidoo et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study has shown that the mice fed with a high-fat diet-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis increased the risk of developing active TB in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias et al., 2019</xref>). Another study found <italic>Firmicutes</italic>/<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio increased in a murine model of type 2 diabetes induced by an energy-dense diet, and increased the susceptibility to Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sathkumara et al., 2021</xref>). These findings support a viewpoint that the changes in the gut microbiome are a contributing factor in Mtb infection pathogenesis and its clinical presentation. Many documents supposed that gut microbiota dysbiosis could modulate immunity and inflammation reaction at distal sites such as the lungs, reduce colonization resistance by external pathogens, and promote TB susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naidoo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Osei Sekyere et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, modulation of the gut microbiota and balance of the gut–lung axis was a potential avenue for TB prevention and management.</p><p>Based on our previous studies and other reports, we found the effect of Mtb infection on the gut <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> was most significant. Hence, in the present study, clindamycin (CL), an antibiotic that selectively disorders anaerobic <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">You et al., 2019</xref>), was used to establish a mouse model of intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. We uncovered the important role of gut microbiome dysbiosis affecting <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> colonization in the mouse lungs using the technology of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Furthermore, based on the ‘gut–lung axis’ theory, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the mice lungs after <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> infection. We aim to explore the potential role and mechanism of gut microbiome dysbiosis enhancing <italic>Mycobacteria</italic> colonization in the lungs of mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clindamycin increases <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> colonization in the lungs of mice</title><p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> procedure, we established a clindamycin-treated mice model to assess the effects of clindamycin-associated gut dysbiosis on <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (MS) colonization in the lungs of mice. The results showed that the mice with clindamycin treated presented a significantly higher colonization of MS in the lungs than that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

To assess the effect of CL on gut mucosal damage and permeability, the intestinal fatty acid binding protein (i-FABP, a marker of enterocyte death) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS, an endotoxin, as a marker of gut permeability) in serum were investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology.

The results showed that the trans-kingdom networks were altered in the CL group vs that in the CON group. In the control group, the bacteria and fungi were closely related to each other, gathering in a cluster and forming a more complex network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). There were 154 nodes including 45 fungi and 109 bacteria, and 810 edges; the relative connectedness was 5.26 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, the complexity of the trans-kingdom network in the CL group was dramatically decreased, and the interplay between bacteria and fungi was also weakened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). A total of 110 nodes including 62 fungi and 48 bacteria gathered into clusters in this network. The edges decreased to 357 and the relative connectedness was 3.25 in the CL group network (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We also found that the interplay ratio between fungi in the CL group was 52.10%, which was much higher than that of the CON group (7.53%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All these results indicated that clindamycin treatment not only altered the proportion of bacteria and fungi, but also weakened the trans-kingdom networks, changed the interactions between bacteria and fungi, and resulted in gut microbiome dysbiosis.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Clindamycin weakens the trans-kingdom network construction of gut bacteria and fungi.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The ratio of ITS2/16S at the genus level.

How to effectively limit or reduce Mtb colonization in the host is a potential strategy to prevent this disease transmission and development. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome can affect distant organs via the ‘gut–lung axis’, and gut microbiota dysbiosis is a potential factor inducing respiratory diseases including TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Waldman and Balskus, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2022</xref>).

However, how the gut microbiota affects TB development by the ‘gut–lung axis’ remains unclear.

Our results show that the abundance of <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> was significantly reduced and the abundance of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> was increased in the CL group compared with the CON group. This result is consistent with the previous study which reported that CL is effective in clearing <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">You et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Bacteroidota</italic> is a consortium of many commensal bacterial species responsible for major fermentation processes, glycolipid production, and promoting systemic Th1 immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mazmanian et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The fungi are also important components of the gut microbiome.

They interact with each other and develop complex ecological networks through these interactions. Homeostasis of microbial ecological networks limits pathogen invasion and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lozupone et al., 2012</xref>). The ratio of ITS2/16S rRNA can reflect the diversity and composition structural alterations of the fungi–bacterial microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemoinne et al., 2020</xref>). In general, antibiotics are directed against bacteria and do not affect fungi. However, our data revealed that CL treatment significantly altered the diversity and composition structure of the fungi–bacterial microbiota, and reduced the trans-kingdom network complexity and interaction between bacteria and fungi. These suggested that the alterations of gut bacteria can affect the composition and diversity of fungi. Previous documents had also reported that any changes in gut bacteria would inadvertently cause alterations in the gut fungal community, and targeted fungal interventions would also cause changes in the gut bacterial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sovran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charlet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Tilburg Bernardes et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, gut microbiota should be taken as a whole rather than a single genus to explain the relationship between gut microbiota and associated diseases.</p><p>Since most of the microbes in the gut are non-culturable, the FMT is considered to be an ideal model to study the function of gut microbiota. The success or not of FMT is influenced by many factors, such as host intestinal microbiota, immunity, and genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porcari et al., 2023</xref>). During the FMT, not all microbiota in the donor feces have the same colonization ability in the receptors. Some research has revealed that the colonization success rate of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> is higher than that of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hintze et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, we found that the ratio of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>/<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> in the CL treatment group increased compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, after FMT, the ratio of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>/<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> decreased in the CL-FMT group vs the CON-FMT group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). We speculated that the possible reason for this difference was that the colonization of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> decreased in the CL-FMT receptor group after transplantation. In contrast, the colonization of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> increased, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of <italic>Firmicutes</italic>/<italic>Bacteroides</italic> in the CL-FMT group. However, we considered the gut microbiota as a whole in the analysis of the experimental results. After FMT, we found that 85.11% of bacterial genera and 52.38% of fungi genera present in the CL inocula were successfully transferred to the CL-recipient mice, and 91.45% of bacteria genera and 56.36% of fungi genera in the CON inocula were also successfully transferred to the CON-recipient mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). The trans-kingdom network analyses between bacteria and fungi showed that the trends of the gut microbiome in recipient mice were consistent with those in the donor mice. Therefore, the inconsistent results between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4d</xref> will not affect this study’s findings, and the FMT model established in this study is successful.</p><p>The FMT results revealed that gut commensal bacteria dysbiosis can promote MS colonization in the lungs of mice, but the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. Recent studies have suggested that changes in the ‘gut–lung axis’ are a contributing factor in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado-Peña et al., 2023</xref>.) What is the substance mediating the interaction between the lung and the gut? There have been a variety of results in the different studies. Yang et al. have found that the gut microbiota via modulation of lncRNA-mediated protective immunity against Mtb, and they found <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> directly upregulated expression of lncRNA and promoted anti-TB immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). However, another clinical study on TB found that the expression level of iNOS in the plasma of new-onset pulmonary TB patients was significantly higher than that of healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chinta et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, we found that <italic>Nos2</italic> expression significantly rises in the CL and CL-FMT groups. Hence, we speculated that the gut microbiota may increase MS colonization in mouse lungs by upregulation of <italic>Nos2</italic> gene expression and associated pathways. Lung epithelial cells, as first responders during Mtb infection, have been shown to play an important role in TB pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scordo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ryndak and Laal, 2019</xref>). Our results also confirmed that overexpression of <italic>Nos2</italic> in A549 cells (a human alveolar epithelial cell) can enhance MS colonization in these cells.</p><p><italic>Nos2</italic>, also termed <italic>iNOS</italic>, is a homodimeric enzyme that is induced by immune stimulation in an independent of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> manner and plays an important role in infection, inflammation, immune regulation, and the control of intracellular bacterial pathogen infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravortty and Hensel, 2003</xref>). Compared with <italic>Nos1</italic> and <italic>Nos3</italic>, <italic>Nos2</italic> has the highest efficiency for production NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). NO has direct antibacterial effects and immune-modulating function to intracellular pathogens and was considered a key molecule in controlling pathogens infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravortty and Hensel, 2003</xref>). It has been verified that reactive nitrogen intermediates produced by murine cells could inhibit Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scanga et al., 2001</xref>). The use of <italic>Nos2</italic> knock-out mice and NO synthase inhibitors is impaired in the control of Mtb growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacMicking et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 1995</xref>). However, our data found that the high concentration of NO increased the colonization of MS in A549 cells. This result seems to contradict that NO has antibacterial activity. Some studies have also shown that NO can promote bacterial growth. Gusarov et al. reported that NO increases the resistance of bacteria to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, enabling the bacteria to survive and share habitats with antibiotic-producing microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gusarov et al., 2009</xref>). Cole et al. showed that host cell-derived NO promoted the escape of listerolysin-dependent bacteria from phagocytic vacuoles into the cytoplasm by inhibiting the proton-pumping activity of V-ATPase and delaying phagolysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogdan, 2012</xref>). Another study has shown that the maximal level of NO produced by human macrophages was not bactericidal or bacteriostatic to Mtb, and the number of viable mycobacteria was increased in macrophages that produced NO, and this is correlated with the expression of nitrate reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that intracellular NO synthesized by <italic>Nos2</italic> has dual roles, including bactericidal at high concentrations and promoting bacterial growth at low concentrations.</p><p>ROS are commonly present in various habitats occupied by living organisms and the production of ROS appears as a very ancient host strategy for coping with pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rhen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2017</xref>). ROS has shown potent antimicrobial activity against many pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The accumulation of ROS is required for killing or inhibiting bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2019</xref>). NO interferes with antimicrobial killing by suppressing ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gusarov et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we assess the level of ROS in the overexpression of <italic>Nos2</italic> plasmids A549 cells. The results show that the ROS concentration in A549 cells transfected with <italic>Nos2</italic>-pcDNA3.1 was significantly lower than that in the control A549 and A549 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 empty vector. This suggested that the promotion of bacterial proliferation by <italic>Nos2</italic> is dependent on lower ROS levels. The crosstalk between <italic>Nos2</italic> and ROS has been investigated in other research. Zheng et al. reported that the lower ROS level induced by <italic>Nos2a</italic> significantly inhibited <italic>E. piscicida</italic> proliferation and infection in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). Another study has also shown that <italic>Nos2</italic>-produced ROS have an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the gut microbiota and defense against bacterial translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matziouridou et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, regulating the <italic>Nos2</italic>–ROS pathway may enhance the host’s defense ability against pathogens.</p><p>β-defensin-1 is an antimicrobial peptide, which is mainly produced by various epithelial cells and is an important part of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores Saiffe Farías et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Defb1</italic> is also expressed in the respiratory epithelium cells and protects the airways from respiratory pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>). Previous research has found that <italic>Defb1</italic> has 98% killing activity against active Mtb H37Rv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez et al., 2018</xref>), and also has an effective antibacterial effect against dormant <italic>mycobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the above results, our data revealed that there was a strong negative correlation between <italic>Defb1</italic> gene expression and MS colonization in A549 cells. The present study was mainly performed at the gene level and lacked verification at the protein level. We will verify the role of the <italic>Nos2–Defb1</italic> pathway on MS colonization at the protein levels in future studies.</p><p>Altogether, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the lungs through the ‘gut–lung axis’ is complex and may involve multiple mechanisms, including immune response, metabolic disorders, cytokines, inflammation, etc. However, in the present study, we found that gut microbiome dysbiosis induced by clindamycin disturbs the gut equilibrium between bacteria and fungi, alters the lung transcriptome, and increases <italic>Nos2</italic> expression. Then, the microbiota dysbiosis could enhance the pulmonary colonization of MS in mice by regulating the <italic>Nos2</italic>–NO, <italic>Nos2</italic>–ROS, and <italic>Nos2–Defb1</italic> pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In the future, we need more experiments to explore the relationship between the intestinal microbiome and the <italic>Nos2</italic>-associated pathways in the lung and to further explore new targets for the prevention and treatment of TB.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms of the intestinal microbiome dysbiosis effect on the colonization of MS in the mouse lungs.</title><p>Gut microbiome dysbiosis and gut permeability-increasing disrupt the lung transcriptome, and increase <italic>Nos2</italic> expression through the ‘gut–lung axis’. <italic>Nos2</italic> high expression weakens the intracellular antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory environment by increasing the concentration of NO, decreasing the levels of ROS and <italic>Defb1</italic> in the cells, and promoting MS colonization in the lungs of mice.

First, due to the lack of experimental conditions in our laboratory that meet biosafety standards, we did not choose a wild-type Mtb strain to develop a mouse infection model, which may lead to the failure of the establishment of TB granuloma and other TB pathology icons and these also weaken the clinical significance of this study. Second, alveolar epithelial cells are one of the early contacting cells in Mtb infection, we only select alveolar epithelial cells (A549) to explore the colonization mechanism of intestinal microbiota affecting MS in vivo. This study lacks the choice of Mtb infection target cells–alveolar macrophages as the research object. Hence, future studies need to choose wild-type Mtb to establish animal infection models and alveolar macrophages for in vitro experiments to explore the regulation function of <italic>Nos2</italic> expression on NO, ROS, and Defb1, which will resolve these limitations of the study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the present study reveals that (1) clindamycin treatment induces gut microbiome dysbiosis, disturbs the gut equilibrium between bacteria and fungi, reduces the interactions among bacterial–fungal trans-kingdom, and increases intestinal permeability. (2) The intestinal microbiome dysbiosis alters the lung transcriptome, increases <italic>Nos2</italic> expression, and enhances MS colonization in the lungs of mice. (3) Intestinal microbiota could promote the pulmonary colonization of MS in mice by regulating the expression of NO, ROS, and <italic>Defb1</italic> through <italic>Nos2-</italic>associated pathways, and changing the intracellular antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory environment. Hence, regulating the gut microbiome balance may be a potential strategy for reducing the risks of Mtb infections and transmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>;

After incubation, fluorescence was detected at 485 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission) using a microplate reader. All these analyses were conducted in three replicates. The expression of <italic>Defb1</italic> was detected using RT-qPCR, and the primer sequences of RT-qPCR are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>For microbiome analysis, the bioinformatics data were analyzed using the Majorbio Cloud platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cloud.majorbio.com">https://cloud.majorbio.com</ext-link>). The α-diversity at the genus level was assessed according to the Chao1 and inverse Simpson indices. The β-diversity was calculated by PCoA. A permutational analysis of variance was performed to assess the variation in the taxonomic structure of microbiota communities between groups. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to assess the different structures of microbiota communities between groups. LEfSe analyses were performed to compare different biomarkers between groups. The trans-kingdom network figures were built using the package igraph (version 1.2.6). For transcriptomic analysis, the bioinformatics data were analyzed using the OE Cloud platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.oebiotech.com">https://www.oebiotech.com</ext-link>). Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 <italic>q</italic> value &lt;0.05 and foldchange &gt;2 was set as the threshold for significantly DEGs. Venn diagram and volcano plot of DEGs were performed to explore gene expression patterns. The functional enrichment of the above DEGs was conducted using the GO database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/">http://www.geneontology.org/</ext-link>) and the KEGG (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

If the data did not follow a normal distribution, a non-parametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used to compare the results. One-way analysis of variance was used for three or more groups of data. The graphs were made with GraphPad Prism 8.0 or R package (version 3.6.2). p-values of &lt;0.05 were set as a threshold for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee of Xinxiang Medical University (No. EC-023-098).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>The relative abundance of gut bacteria and fungi at the phylum and genera levels.</title><p>(a) The relative abundance of bacteria in CL and CON groups at phylum levels.

Our aim in this study is to explore the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on the colonization of <italic>M.tb</italic> in the lungs. However, due to the lack of necessary conditions for biosafety in our laboratory, some highly infectious bacteria (such as <italic>M.tb</italic>) are not allowed to be cultured, and establishing the M.tb infection animal model in our laboratory does not meet the requirements of biosafety. Hence, we used the model strain of <italic>M.tb</italic>, M.smegmatis (MS), and established the animal-infected model for exploring the effect of gut microbiota dysbiosis on MS colonization in mice lungs. However, the establishment of MS infected model may not necessarily produce typical TB granulomas and other TB pathology signs. we have discussed the limitations of the current study in the discussion part of the manuscript. The suggested revisions are shown in lines 21-39 of page 15. In future studies, we plan to adopt the reviewer's suggestion and will use a wide-type <italic>M.tb</italic> strain to establish the TB-infected model in the laboratory that has biosafety standards to further verify the results of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The usage of in vitro assays based on A542 to examine the regulation function of Nos2 expression on NO and ROS may not be enough. A542 is not the primary Mtb infection target in the lungs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s comments. Although alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) are not the main target cells of Mtb infection, they are among the cells that are contacted early in <italic>M.tb</italic> infection. Early <italic>M.tb</italic> invasion of AECs is very essential for the establishment of infection (PMID 11479618). AECs are usually the initial site of the lung’s response against <italic>M.tb</italic>. Available literature suggests that freshly isolated AECs are more permissive to <italic>M.tb</italic> growth than macrophages（PMID 33228849. As a cellular reservoir for <italic>M.tb</italic>, AECs are capable of facilitating rapid bacterial growth while potentially escaping recognition by phagocytes in the alveolus. The immune cells such as macrophages are the primary targets of <italic>M.tb</italic> infection, where the <italic>M.tb</italic> survive and proliferate, leading to the formation and maintenance of granulomas. However, AECs are subjected to the same density of infection, and the bacteria invade and replicate in these cells and induce cell apoptosis and necrosis, which is considered a major mechanism implicated in extra-pulmonary dissemination (PMID 12925134, PMID 32849525). Besides their direct barrier role, AECs also directly respond to <italic>M.tb</italic> infection by producing mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial agents (PMID 35017314). Therefore, it is feasible to select alveolar epithelial cell A549 to explore the colonization mechanism of intestinal microbiota affecting <italic>M.tb</italic> in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) They did not examine the lung pathology upon gut dysbiosis to examine the true significance of increased colonization of Mtb.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the results of the lung pathological section in the revised manuscript. The results of lung pathological sections are shown in lines 11-13 of page 4, and Figure S2 of supplement information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Most of the studies are based on MS-infected mouse models with a lack of clinical significance.</p></disp-quote><p>The first and primary condition of any pathogen infection is that the bacteria must invade the host through colonization and multiply in the target organ. This study aimed to investigate the effect of intestinal microbial dysbiosis on the colonization of mycobacterium in mouse lungs. Our laboratory does not meet the biosafety standard for culturing highly infectious bacteria such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. So, we used the <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> as a model strain for <italic>M.tb</italic> to establish the infected mice model in the current research. Although <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is generally considered nonpathogenic, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is closely related to <italic>M.tb</italic> in biochemical characteristics, genetic information, cell structure, and metabolism (PMID 32674978). <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> is regarded as a valuable model organism in the study of <italic>M.tb</italic>, which is widely been used to explore the biological characteristics of <italic>M.tb</italic> such as physiological state, stress response, non-culture state reactivation, antimicrobial activity, and biochemical protection (PMID 32674978). It has also been reported that <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> could be used as a model strain to study the molecular mechanism of interaction between <italic>M.tb</italic> and its host (PMID 30546046, PMID25970481, PMID 29568875). However, in preclinical experimental research, we used <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> as the object of study. Instead of focusing on the pathological changes caused by <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> in the host lungs, we mainly focused on the influence of intestinal microbiota on the colonization of mycobacterium in the lungs and its possible mechanism, which provides a reliable model to study the prevention of early infection and spread of <italic>M.tb</italic> through regulating the intestinal microbiota. It has important clinical significance for the further development of new measures for the prevention and control of tuberculosis. If experimental conditions permit, the establishment of an infected model with wild-type <italic>M.tb</italic> can be used to verify the findings of the present study which may provide important clinical guidelines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Intestinal microbiome dysbiosis increases Mycobacteria pulmonary colonization in mice by regulating the Nos2-associated pathways&quot; by Han et al reported that using clindamycin, an antibiotic to selectively disorder anaerobic Bacteriodetes, intestinal microbiome dysbiosis resulted in Mycobacterium smegmatis (MS) colonization in the mice lungs. The authors found that clindamycin induced damage of the enterocytes and gut permeability and also enhanced the fermentation of cecum contents, which finally increased MS colonization in the mice's lungs. The study showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis up-regulated the Nos2 gene-associated pathways, leading to increased nitric oxide (NO) levels and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and β-defensin 1 (Defb1) levels. These changes in the host's immune response created an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory environment that favored MS colonization in the lungs. The findings suggest that gut microbiota dysbiosis can modulate the host's immune response and increase susceptibility to pulmonary infections by altering the expression of key genes and pathways involved in innate immunity. The authors reasonably provided experimental data and subsequent gene profiles to support their conclusion. Although the overall outcomes are convincing, there are several issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>(1) In Figure S1, the reviewer suggests checking the image sizes of the pathological sections of intestinal tissue from the control group and the CL-treatment group. When compared to the same intestinal tissue images in Figure S4, they do not appear to be consistently magnified at 40x.

We have carefully checked the pathological section in Figure S1 and Figure S5 and added the numerical scale bars to the figure.

The author should explain this discrepancy and discuss its potential implications on the study's findings.</p></disp-quote><p>The success of fecal microbial transfer (FMT) is influenced by many factors, such as host intestinal microbiota, immunity, and genetic factors (PMID 37167953). During FMT procedure, all microbiota of the donor feces do not have the same colonization ability in the recipients. Some research has revealed that the colonization success rate of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> is higher than that of <italic>Firmicutes</italic> [PMID 24637796]. In this study, we noticed that the reason for the difference between Figure 4D and Figure 3B was that during FMT, the colonization of Firmicutes decreased in the Cl-FMT receptor after transplantation, while the colonization of Bacteroides increased, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of <italic>Firmicutes/ Bacteroides</italic> in the Cl-FMT group. However, we considered the gut microbiota as a whole in the present study. After FMT, we found that 85.11% of bacterial genera and 52.38% of fungi genera present in the CL inocula were successfully transferred to the CL-recipient mice, and 91.45% of bacteria genera and 56.36% of fungi genera in the CON inocula were also successfully transferred to the CON-recipient mice, respectively (Figure 4g). The trans-kingdom network analyses between bacteria and fungi showed that the trends of the gut microbiome in recipient mice were consistent with those in the donor mice. Therefore, the FMT model established in this study remains successful. For reviewer clarification, we have added explanations in the discussion part of the manuscript. See lines 8-29 of page 12 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 6, did the authors have a specific reason for selecting Nos2 but not Tnf for further investigation? The expression level of the Tnf gene appears to be the most significant in both RT-qPCR and RNA-sequencing results in Figure 5f. Tnf is an important cytokine involved in immune responses to bacterial infections, so it is also a factor that can influence NO, ROS, and Defb1 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable reviewer’s comment. By analyzing the transcriptome data, we found that there were 8 genes strongly associated with TB infection in the KEGG pathway, including <italic>Nos2</italic>, <italic>Cd14</italic>, <italic>Tnf</italic>, <italic>Cd74</italic>, <italic>Clec4e</italic>, <italic>Ctsd</italic>, <italic>Cd209a,</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>. Then, we performed KO pathway analysis and found that the <italic>Nos2</italic> gene was strongly associated with multiple pathways including “cytokine activity &quot;, &quot;chemokine activity&quot;, and &quot;nitric oxide synthase binding&quot;. Moreover, in a clinical study on tuberculosis, the expression level of <italic>Nos2</italic> in the plasma of patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis was significantly higher than that of healthy people, indicating that <italic>Nos2</italic> is associated with the occurrence of tuberculosis (PMID 34847295). Therefore, we selected <italic>Nos2</italic> as the main target gene in the current study to conduct the correlation pathway analysis. As an important cytokine involved in the immune response to bacterial infection, <italic>Tnf</italic> mentioned by the reviewers may also be a factor affecting the levels of NO, ROS, and Defb1, which provides a new idea for our future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>First, they need to use a true Mtb-infected mouse model to determine the relationship between gut dysbiosis and increased lung infection of Mtb.</p><p>Second, the mechanism by which nos2-mediated NO and ROS production need to be further analyzed in the real Mtb infection process (either in vivo or in vitro).</p><p>Third, Lung pathology should be included in addressing the increased colonization of mycobacteria.

So, we used the <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> as a model strain for <italic>M.tb</italic> to establish the infected mice model in the current research. Although <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is generally considered nonpathogenic. <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> is closely related to <italic>M.tb</italic> in biochemical characteristics, genetic information, cell structure, and metabolism (PMID 32674978). <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> is regarded as a valuable model organism in the study of <italic>M.tb</italic>, and has been widely used to explore the biological characteristics of <italic>M.tb</italic> such as physiological state, stress response, non-culture state reactivation, antimicrobial activity, and biochemical protection (PMID 32674978). It has also been reported that <italic>M.smegmatis</italic> was used as a model strain to study the molecular mechanism of interaction between <italic>M.tb</italic> and its host (PMID 30546046, PMID25970481, PMID 29568875). However, in preclinical experimental research, we mainly focused on the influence of intestinal microbiota on the colonization of mycobacterium in the lungs and its possible mechanism which provides a reliable model to study the prevention of early infection and spread of <italic>M.tb</italic> through regulating the intestinal microbiota.</p><p>(2) In the future, we will establish an infected model with wild-type <italic>M.tb</italic> to verify the mechanism by which nos2-mediated NO and ROS production and promote M.tb colonization.</p><p>(3) We have added the results in the lung pathological section in the revised manuscript. The results of lung pathological sections are shown in lines 11-13 of page 4, and Figure S2 of supplement information.</p></body></sub-article></article>
