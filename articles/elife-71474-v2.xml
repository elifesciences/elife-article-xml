differentiation and metabolism, and may also contribute to sensing mechanical pain by functioning as an ion channel named TACAN. Here we report that expression of TMEM120A is not sufficient in mediating poking- or stretch-induced currents in cells and have solved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human TMEM120A (<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A) in complex with an endogenous metabolic cofactor (coenzyme A, CoASH) and in the apo form. <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A forms a symmetrical homodimer with each monomer containing an amino-terminal coiled-coil motif followed by a transmembrane domain with six membrane-spanning helices. Within the transmembrane domain, a CoASH molecule is hosted in a deep cavity and forms specific interactions with nearby amino acid residues. Mutation of a central tryptophan residue involved in binding CoASH dramatically reduced the binding affinity of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A with CoASH. <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A exhibits distinct conformations at the states with or without CoASH bound. Our results suggest that TMEM120A may have alternative functional roles potentially involved in CoASH transport, sensing, or metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TMEM120</kwd><kwd>coenzyme A</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>mechanosensation</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31925024 and 31670749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhenfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31825014 and 31630090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Bailong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Strategic Priority Research Program of CAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB37020101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhenfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Strategic Priority Research Program of CAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB37030304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological and structural characterizations reveal that a previously proposed ion channel responsible for sensing mechanical pain is insensitive to poking or stretching stimuli for conducting ions and may serve as a coenzyme A-binding protein instead.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Through a fundamental cellular process known as mechanosensation, mechanical forces are converted into electrochemical signals during various physiological processes, such as touch, hearing, pain sensation, osmoregulation, and cell volume regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Anoveros and Corey, 1997</xref>). In the past decades, various types of ion channels involved in sensing and transducing mechanical force signals have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Among them, mechanosensitive channels of large and small conductances (MscL and MscS) serve as emergency release valves on the membrane by sensing and responding to membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Booth and Blount, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haswell et al., 2011</xref>). While members of the MscL family are present in bacteria, archaea, or fungi, and those of the MscS family exist in plants or microbes, they are not found in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Booth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pivetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). Piezo channels are involved in cellular mechanosensation processes crucial for touch perception, proprioception, red blood cell volume regulation, and other physiological functions in animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mousavi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Radin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xiao, 2020</xref>). Moreover, Drosophila NompC from the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family, OSCA/TMEM63 (found in plants and animals) and TMC1/2 (mainly found in animals) from the TMEM16 superfamily, mammalian TREK/TRAAK channels from the two pore-domain potassium (K2P) channel subfamily, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> degenerin channels from the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)/degenerin family also serve as mechanosensitive ion channels with pivotal functions in various mechanotransduction processes of eukaryotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Transmembrane protein 120 (TMEM120) is a family of membrane proteins wide spread in animals and plants, and was originally identified as a nuclear envelope protein through a proteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malik et al., 2010</xref>). Two paralogs of TMEM120 (TMEM120A and TMEM120B) exist in mammals, and they have crucial functional roles in adipocyte differentiation and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batrakou et al., 2015</xref>). Knockout of <italic>Tmem120a</italic> in mice led to a lipodystrophy syndrome with insulin resistance and metabolic defects when the animals were exposed to a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czapiewski et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, TMEM120A has been reported to function as an ion channel involved in sensing mechanical pain and thereby termed TACAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2020</xref>). The protein is expressed in a subset of nociceptors and is associated with mechanically evoked currents in heterologous cell lines. Besides, TACAN protein exhibited nonselective cation channel activity when heterologously expressed in cell lines or reconstituted in liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the previous report that suggested TACAN might function as a high-threshold mechanically activated cation channel responsible for sensing mechanical pain in mice, the mechanism of mechanosensation and ion permeation mediated by TACAN channel remains elusive and awaits further investigation. The molecular basis underlying the functions of TMEM120A in pain sensation and adipocyte differentiation is still unclear. Here we electrophysiologically characterized the ability of TMEM120A in mediating mechanically activated currents in cells and reconstituted proteoliposome membranes, and solved the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human TMEM120A (<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A) at two different conformational states. A striking discovery is revealed on the specific interactions between TMEM120A protein and an endogenous cofactor crucial for energy and fatty acid metabolism, namely CoASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sibon and Strauss, 2016</xref>), which provides important insights into the bona fide cellular functions of TMEM120 family.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional characterizations of TMEM120A</title><p>When expressed heterologously in cell lines including CHO, HEK293T, and COS9, <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A only appeared to cause a pico-ampere level of increase in stretch-induced currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2020</xref>), prompting us to verify the role of TMEM120A in mediating mechanically activated (MA) currents. To exclude any endogenous Piezo1-mediated MA currents, we have chosen the previously reported <italic>Piezo1</italic> knockout HEK293T cells (P1-KO-HEK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>) as our heterologous expression system. Using a piezo-driven blunted glass pipette to mechanically probe the cell membrane under a whole-cell recording configuration, we recorded robust MA currents from the P1-KO-HEK cells transfected with the construct of either Piezo1 or Piezo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). By contrast, similarly to vector-transfected cells, none of the cells transfected with the construct of either mouse TMEM120A (<italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A, with or without C-terminal fusion of fluorescent protein; <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry, with mCherry fused to the C-terminal region of <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A; <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-ires-GFP, <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were translated as two independent proteins not fused to each other, due to the presence of an internal ribosome entry site/ires) or <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry showed poking-induced currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These data suggest that TMEM120A is not sufficient to mediate poking-induced currents. To examine whether TMEM120A might specifically mediate stretch-induced currents as originally reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2020</xref>), we measured stretch-induced currents by applying negative pressure from 0 to −120 mmHg to the membrane patch under either cell-attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>) or inside-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>) patch-clamp configurations. As a positive control, Piezo1 mediated robust stretch-induced currents under both cell-attached and inside-out recording configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>). Consistent with the previous report that human TMEM63a (<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM63a) serves as a high-threshold mechanosensitive channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>), we indeed found that <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM63a-transfected cells reliably showed slowly activated stretch-induced currents, despite the maximal current amplitude being smaller than that of Piezo1-mediated currents (20.4 ± 2.2 vs 64.1 ± 7.4 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). By contrast, under either cell-attached or inside-out patch configurations, none of the <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A- or <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-transfected cells (a total of 57 cells) showed stretch-induced currents, similar to vector-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>). Given that none of the four different versions of TMEM120A constructs (<italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry, <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-ires-GFP, <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry, and GFP-<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A) exhibited poking- or stretch-induced currents in the cells, the lack of TMEM120A-mediated currents is highly unlikely due to the influence of the fusion tags. Thus, under our experimental conditions with the use of Piezo channels and <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM63a as proper positive controls, we conclude that TMEM120A is not sufficient to mediate poking- or stretch-induced currents in P1-KO-HEK cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TMEM120A does not mediate poking- or stretch-induced currents in P1-KO-HEK cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative poking-evoked whole-cell currents from P1-KO-HEK cells transfected with the indicated constructs.

The two monomers of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A proteins are related by a twofold symmetry axis running through their interface and perpendicular to the membrane plane. Each monomer contains an N-terminal soluble domain (NTD) on the cytosolic side and a transmembrane domain (TMD) embedded in a lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The long α-helix (IH1) of NTD intertwines with the symmetry-related one and interacts closely with the shorter one (IH2). IH1, IH2, and their symmetry-related ones in the adjacent monomer collectively form a coiled-coil structure with the long axis running approximately parallel to the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Between NTD and TMD, there is a hinge-like motif (HM) with two long loops and a short amphipathic α-helix positioned near the membrane surface on the intracellular side.

We tested both <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry and <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-ires-GFP and observed neither poking- nor stretch-induced currents. Besides, we also tested both <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry and GFP-<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A (<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A with GFP fused to its N-terminal region) and observed no stretch-induced currents. Thus, the lack of TMEM120A-mediated currents in our studies is not influenced by the presence or absence of a fusion tag (mCherry or GFP) at either the N-terminal or the C-terminal region. In line with the observation, both the N- and C-terminal regions of TMEM120A are suspended in cytosol and distant from the transmembrane domain, so that the fusion tags at the N- or C-terminal region might cause only minimal or no influence on protein function. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the tag prevents the fusion protein from functioning as an ion channel as originally reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2020</xref>. Taken together, we conclude that TMEM120A is not sufficient to form a channel capable of sensing poking or stretching of the cell membrane. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that TMEM120A might only respond to certain forms of mechanical stimuli such as perturbation at the cell-substrate interface, which might require further independent verification. In case that TMEM120A does function as a mechanosensitive channel, the CoASH molecule may serve as a plug to block the intracellular entry and consequently stabilize the channel in a closed state, while the intracellular cavity may become accessible to ions upon dissociation of CoASH molecule from the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). When the channel is further activated by mechanical stimuli applied to the membrane, the constriction site on the extracellular side may open wider for ions to pass through the pore. However, the channel gating mechanism and coupling principle between putative CoASH inhibition and activation by mechanical stimuli during gating cycle would definitively need to be investigated further.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that TMEM120 protein shares structural similarities with a membrane-embedded enzyme named elongation of very long chain fatty acid (ELOVL) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xue et al., 2021</xref>). ELOVLs catalyze a condensation reaction between acyl-coA and malonyl-CoA to produce 3-keto acyl-CoA and release CoASH as well as CO<sub>2</sub> as byproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nie et al., 2021</xref>). Although TMEM120A did not exhibit ELOVL-like enzymatic activity when malonyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA were supplied as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niu et al., 2021</xref>), it is possible that TMEM120A may utilize different substrates or catalyze a reaction distinct from that of ELOVLs if it functions as an enzyme. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the function of TMEM120 is related to incorporation of fatty acids into triacylglycerol, and deficiency of TMEM120 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is associated with a reduction of triacylglycerol level and lipid droplet size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Co-expression of TMEM120A with Piezo2 reduced mechanically activated currents, and it was suggested that TMEM120A may function as a negative modulator of Piezo2 channel activity by modifying the lipid content of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Del Rosario et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, other potential functions of TMEM120A, such as being a membrane-embedded enzyme utilizing CoASH as a substrate or a cofactor, a CoASH transporter or a CoASH-sensing receptor, await to be explored further in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

For nanodisc preparation, membrane scaffold protein 1E3D1 (MSP1E3D1) was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cell, purified through immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and the His-tag was cleaved by the Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease.

Subsequently, the scaffold protein (MSP1E3D1) and bio-beads (100 mg) were added into the column to trigger formation of nanodiscs by removing detergents from the system. The mixture was incubated for 2 hr with constant rotation. Another batch of bio-beads (50 mg) was subsequently added and the mixture was incubate for one more hour. To remove the residual components and empty the nanodiscs (without target protein), the column was mounted vertically on the stand and the solution on the column was separated from the resin through gravity flow.

The <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-nanodisc complex assembled on the Streptactin beads was eluted by applying 5 CV of elution buffer with 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), and Protease Inhibitor Cocktail. The purified nanodisc sample was concentrated with a 100-kDa MWCO concentrator to 3.5 mg/ml through centrifugation at 2500 ×<italic>g</italic>.

The major peak fraction was collected and concentrated to 3.5–4.5 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in a 100-kDa MWCO Amicon concentrator. The purity of the protein sample was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

The Quantifoil 1.2/1.3 μm holey carbon grids (300 mesh, copper) were selected for preparing the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A sample in the detergent, and 200 mesh grids of the same type were used for <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-nanodisc sample.

Cryo-EM images of the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A particles in the detergent were collected on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV.

The total dose on the camera was set to be 60 e<sup>-</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> on the specimen, and each image was fractioned into 32 subframes, which were recorded with a defocus value at a range of −1.2 μm to −1.8 μm. The nominal magnification for the images of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-nanodisc sample was set to be SA22500 in super-resolution counting mode and yielding a physical pixel size of 1.07 Å (0.535 Å super-resolution pixel size). All the images were recorded by using a high-throughput beam-image shift data collection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2019</xref>).

The procedures described below were performed by using cryoSPARC v3.1 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016501">SCR_016501</ext-link>) unless stated otherwise. After manual inspection of the micrographs, 3940 were selected and 230 particles were picked manually from the micrograph and sorted into 2D classes. The best classes were selected and used as references for autopicking procedure. After the process, 3,837,005 particles were autopicked and extracted using a box size of 256 pixels. Six rounds of 2D classification were performed to remove ice spots, contaminants, aggregates, and obscure classes, yielding 269,838 particles for further refinement. The particles were classified into three classes using ab-initio reconstruction, and the reference models were generated by low-pass filtering of the maps of the three individual classes (including one well-resolved and two junk classes) to 20 Å for the subsequent refinement processes. Consequently, 64,716 particles corresponding to the well-resolved class were selected for further refinement. By using the reference model generated from the map of the prior well-resolved class, non-uniform (NU) refinement was performed with <italic>C</italic>2 symmetry imposed and resulted in a 6.2 Å cryo-EM density map.</p><p>In order to improve map resolution, a sequential heterogeneous refinement approach was applied according to the protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In detail, after the NU refinement, heterogeneous refinement with the unbiased reference models of the well-resolved and two junk classes (generated through the previously described ab-initio reconstruction step) was carried out to obtain a better density map. Next, the improved density map was subjected to low-pass processing at 15 Å and 30 Å to generate low-resolution models. They served as the references of resolution gradient for another heterogeneous refinement. Finally, the empty scaffold protein-lipid shell map was generated in Chimera (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link>) by using the volume eraser tool. To obtain a noise-downscaled map, the whole protein-nanodisc complex map was subtracted with the region of peripheral scaffold protein-lipid shell downscaled with a scale factor of 0.5. By using the noise-downscaled map and empty scaffold-lipid shell as references for the next step of heterogeneous refinement, a 4.7 Å map was obtained from 29,085 particles. The above process was the first round of sequential heterogeneous refinement. To enlarge the dataset of good particles, the 269,838 particles produced by 2D classification were divided into nine subgroups, so that the number of particles in each subgroup is similar to the good particles yielding the 4.7 Å map. The good particles were combined with each individual subgroup, the duplicate particles were removed automatically, and every chimeric subgroup was further processed in a second round of sequential heterogeneous refinement. Subsequently, all good particles from each subgroup were combined (and the duplicate particles were removed) for a third round of sequential heterogeneous refinement, yielding a 4.2 Å density map from 93,224 particles. For dataset 2, a similar procedure was applied to yield 389,789 good particles, leading to reconstruction of a map at 3.8 Å. The two datasets of the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-nanodisc sample were merged and subjected to an additional round of 2D classification, the final round of sequential heterogeneous refinement, CTF refinement, and NU refinement with <italic>C</italic>2 symmetry applied.

Particles were picked using Gautomatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang, 2017</xref>) and Topaz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bepler et al., 2019</xref>) programs. Multiple rounds of 2D and 3D classifications were performed to clean up the particles. The first round of 3D classification generated eight classes, and class 7 (21.5%) showed well-resolved structural features including transmembrane helices and intracellular amphipathic helices. A second round of multi-reference 3D classification was then performed to improve the quality of the map, giving rise to a subset of 78.3% particles. The next round of 3D classification was conducted without image alignment, resulting in four classes. A 3D mask covering the protein region was applied to exclude the detergent micelle density. The class 1 (50.5%) and class 4 (14.7%) maps displayed continuous transmembrane and amphipathic helices and thus were selected for further processing. Particles were subsequently imported to cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) and the NU refinement was carried out to yield a map at 4.3 Å resolution.

The cryo-EM densities for the TMD were well defined and provided detailed features for model building and real-space refinement. Register of amino acid residues was guided mainly by the clearly defined densities of residues with bulky side chains such as Trp, Phe, Tyr, and Arg. The density of IL5 (residues 250–263) was insufficient for assignment of the side chains; only the backbone of the polypeptide chain was built for this region. For the N-terminal domain (residues 7–100), some local regions were not well resolved in the cryo-EM map, involving about 40% amino acid residues of the domain.

The initial model of the TMD (residues 123–336) was built by referring to the corresponding domain of the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-nanodisc complex structure. Around 85 residues of the 213 residues in the TMD were tentatively built as alanine residues as there were no side-chain information in the map.

After gel filtration, the concentrated protein at 4.6 mg/ml was dialyzed overnight at 4℃ against 2 l dialysis buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (MedChemExpress, 1 ml 100× stock solution per 150 ml solution), 0.006% GDN, 0.006% CHAPS, and 0.001% CHS. After concentration, the molar concentration of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A monomer was 120 μM and A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> was 0.58, and the molar concentration of W193A mutant monomer was 17.6 μM and A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> was 0.62. Such a low A<sub>260</sub>/A<sub>280</sub> value is close to the value (~0.6) for a pure protein, suggesting that the endogenous CoASH bound to <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A protein is largely removed during the purification process. For the ITC assay, the powder of coenzyme A (sodium salt hydrate; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in the dialysis buffer to a final concentration of 6 mM as the stock solution and then subjected to serial dilution for the specific experimental requirements. All solutions were filtered with a 0.22-μm filter membrane and then degassed prior to use. Measurements of enthalpy change (ΔH°) upon CoASH binding were performed by a MicroCal ITC200 (Malvern). In order to ensure that the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A protein was saturated with CoASH at a reasonable rate, the optimized ratio of protein to CoASH was adjusted to 1:1 (mol:mol). The sample cell was rinsed repeatedly by the dialysis buffer and 350 μl protein sample was loaded carefully into the cell to avoid formation of any bubbles. The injection syringe was filled with 120 μM CoASH solution for wild-type <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A or 17.6 μM CoASH solution for W193A mutant. The experimental temperature was set at 20℃. The total number of injections was 20, and the volume of each injection was 2 μl except that the first injection was of 0.4 μl. The CoASH solution was titrated into the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A protein solution and the mixture was stirred at 700 rpm. The experimental data were analyzed by MicroCal ITC200 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_020260">SCR_020260</ext-link>). The heat change of the last four injections was so weak that the protein was regarded as completely saturated with CoASH despite that the heat produced did not go to zero. Thus, the heat generated by the last injection was subtracted from the heat generated by each injection. As a control, the dialysis buffer was titrated with CoASH under identical experimental conditions, and the weak background heat was also subtracted from the protein-CoASH binding data in the final results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Whole-cell electrophysiology and mechanical stimulation</title><p>The P1-KO-HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>) were grown in poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Electrophysiological recordings normally started about 2 hr later after re-plating the cells. The patch-clamp experiments were carried out with HEKA EPC10 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, the recording electrodes had a resistance of 2–6 MΩ when filled with the internal solution composed of (in mM) 133 CsCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with CsOH), 4 MgATP, and 0.4 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP. The extracellular solution was composed of (in mM) 133 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES (pH 7.3 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. All experiments were performed at room temperature.

Leak currents before mechanical stimulations were subtracted off-line from the current traces. Voltages were not corrected for the liquid junction potential.</p><p>Mechanical stimulation was delivered to the cell during the patch clamp being recorded at an angle of 80° using a fire-polished glass pipette (tip diameter 3–4 μm) as described. Downward movement of the probe toward the cell was driven by a Clampex-controlled piezo-electric crystal micro-stage (E625 LVPZT Controller/Amplifier; Physik Instrument). The probe had a velocity of 1 μm/ms during the downward and upward motion, and the stimulus was maintained for 150 ms. A series of mechanical steps in 1 μm increments was applied every 10 s, and currents were recorded at a holding potential of −60 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell-attached electrophysiology</title><p>Stretch-activated currents were recorded in the cell-attached or inside-out patch-clamp configuration using the HEKA EPC10 and the Patchmaster software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). The currents were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. The recording electrodes had a resistance of 2–5 MΩ when filled with a standard pipette solution consisting of (in mM) 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) (pH 7.3, balanced with NaOH). To maintain the membrane potential near 0 mV, the external solution consisted of (in mM) 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose (pH 7.3 with KOH). All experiments were carried out at room temperature. Membrane patches with a seal resistance of at least 2 GΩ were held at −80 mV and stimulated with 200 ms or 500 ms negative pressure pulses given at either 5 or 10 mmHg steps from 0 to −120 mmHg through the recording electrode using a Patchmaster-controlled pressure clamp HSPC-1 device (ALA-scientific). Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 6 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) and statistical details can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend.

The sample sizes represent the number of cells tested in the whole-cell and cell-attached recordings as well as the inside-out patch configuration. The number of cells tested was determined based on the magnitude of the effect observed and the variance among data points. The sizes were chosen based on the consistency of data across different conditions and multiple experiments. Samples were grouped based on the plasmids transfected into the cells.

The bath and pipette solutions contained 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4). Patch pipettes with resistances of 5–6 MΩ were used, and the patch resistance was increased to ~2 GΩ after the pipette was sealed tightly with the GUV membrane. A negative pressure was applied through a Suction Control Pro pump (Nanion) with a stepwise or linear protocol while data were recorded at a constant holding potential. The data were acquired at 50 kHz with a 0.5-kHz filter and a HumBug 50/60 Hz Noise Eliminator (Quest Scientific), using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA). The Clampfit Version 10.0 (Axon Instruments) was used for data analysis and Igor Pro 6.37A (WaveMetrics; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link>) was used for making the graphs. The sample size represents the number of patches tested in the inside-out recordings. The number of patches tested was determined based on the observation of channel activities upon application of the negative pressure.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The revised manuscript provides even stronger evidence that TMEM120A does not function as a mechanosensitive channel, together with cryo-EM data showing the structure of the protein in two different conformational states in the presence and absence of the metabolic co-factor CoASH. Together, the manuscript suggests a role for TMEM120A in lipid metabolism, opening interesting new paths for further research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TMEM120A contains a specific coenzyme A-binding site and might not mediate poking-or stretch-induced channel activities in cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Andrés Jara-Oseguera as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should mention that the human TMEM120A construct that they used contains a covalently attached C-terminal mCherry tag that was not present in the original publication. Although unlikely, it remains a possibility that the tag prevents the protein from functioning as an ion channel when expressed in heterologous systems. Performing experiments with a construct without the tag would be desirable, but not required.</p><p>2) The methods state that hsTMEM120A was codon-optimized for insect cells (lines 432-434), but electrophysiological experiments were performed in mammalian cells. Were the constructs used in this experiment also codon-optimized for insect cells (rather than the construct used in the original TACAN paper)? This is unclear from the methods (lines 699-700). If so, please briefly discuss this as an alternative explanation for failure to replicate the mechanosensitive function with electrophysiology (i.e., due to poor translation and corresponding low membrane expression) in the discussion.</p><p>3) In Figure 1A-B, in addition to displaying the peak current for each cell, it would be useful to include a traditional displacement-current curve both for Piezos and for TMEMs- this would alleviate any concern that TMEM-transfected cells were not poked to the same depths. Similarly for Figure 1C, in addition to plotting maximal current please include P50 curves- because the authors smartly included a high-threshold channel as a positive control, it would further strengthen their claims to show that even at high pressures, there is no current above background for TMEM120A-B.</p><p>4) The authors should either tone down a majority of their detailed structural observations, or show the experimental density that supports them – this is particularly relevant for the CoASH binding site on Figure 4E, where residue-specific interactions are discussed; Figure 5C and D, where a conformational change is suggested without having shown the density for the loop on the CoASH-bound structure; the extracellular constriction formed by M207, W210, F219 and C310, for which also no density is shown. The depiction of isolated channel fragments as in Figure 3 – Supplement 1 is not helpful for addressing any of the issues described above.</p><p>5) The authors should edit their Introduction to make it more useful for wider audiences, mainly by clarifying that MscL and MscS are absent in animals, and by indicating the types of organisms that express the channels listed on lines 52-57.</p><p>6) A significant part of the Discussion section is dedicated to speculations on how TMEM120A might still function as a mechanosensitive channel in the absence of CoASH block, while the results of the study suggest that it might not even be a channel. It would be equally (or more) important to discuss its putative role in fatty acid metabolism, perhaps by referring to related/similar structures of the proteins with known functions (e.g. ELOVL). With respect to the functional role of TMEM120A, of interest might be recent preprints (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.450322, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.30.450616).</p><p>7) Line 450: please include the amount of membranes used for purification.</p><p>Line 455: please include the amount of Streptactin resin used.</p><p>Line 467: Please include typical yields.</p><p>Line 523: Please use a correct reference for SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2003).</p><p>Line 551: Please describe what served as a reference for NU refinement and how it was generated.</p><p>Line 554 and 556: Since ab initio reconstruction does not require a reference model, it would be unbiased.</p><p>Line 571: Please indicate at what point the duplicated particles were removed, and I would also include this in the processing scheme (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 panel A – please include the number of particles at each stage of the processing workflow for consistency.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) &quot;Despite that TACAN is crucial…&quot; (lines 70-71) – the evidence provided on the Cell paper does not strongly establish a relevance for TMEM120A in nociception. We suggest the authors provide a more nuanced description of the observations made in the 2020 Cell paper, as this would be helpful for readers.</p><p>(2) Line 61: I suggest &quot;exist in mammals&quot;.</p><p>Lines 191 – 193: I am not convinced that comparing TMEM120A structure to other mechanosensitive channels is necessary, as the protein is likely not a channel.</p><p>Line 316: shown</p><p>Line 318: &quot;The drastic difference&quot;</p><p>Line 598: Register</p><p>Figure 5.

In our study, we have tested both <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry and <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-ires-GFP, and observed neither poking- nor stretch-induced currents (Revised Figure 1C, F, G and I). For the <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry construt, <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A is covalently fused to a C-terminal mCherry tag as the reviewer pointed out. On the other hand, for the <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-ires-GFP construct, <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A and GFP were expressed as two independent proteins (not fused to each other) due to the presence of an internal ribosome entry site/ires. The results suggest that the lack of <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-mediated currents is not dependent on the presence or absence of fusion tag. Moreover, we also tested a different construct with GFP fused to the N-terminal region of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A (GFP-<italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A) instead of C-terminal region. The result is similar to those with the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry constructs (Revised Figure 1D-F). Therefore, the lack of TMEM120A-mediated currents is not due to the influence of fusion tags. Besides, the mCherry and GFP proteins are fused to the C- or N-terminal region suspended in cytosol and they are distant from the transmembrane domain. We expected that the influence of the fusion tags on the protein function should be minimal. Accordingly, we reasoned that it is highly unlikely that the tag prevents the fusion protein from functioning as an ion channel if it did behave in the way as originally reported by Beaulieau-Laroche et al. We have included the points in the results and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript (lines 102-107, p5; lines 123-128, p6; lines 363-375, p22-23).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The methods state that hsTMEM120A was codon-optimized for insect cells (lines 432-434), but electrophysiological experiments were performed in mammalian cells.

The <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A-mCherry construct used in whole-cell and cell-attached electrophysiological experiments contains the cDNA amplified from the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A clone in the cDNA library of human ORF 8.1 (a gift from Yulong Li's lab at the Peking University). It is different from the vector with the cDNA of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A codon-optimized for protein expression in insect cell (for cryo-EM, single-channel electrophysiology and ITC experiments). Through gateway reactions, the coding sequence of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A is cloned into the pDEST-mCherry expression vector, resulting in fusion of mCherry at the C-terminus of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A. The cDNA of the <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A was amplified from a mouse cDNA library and subcloned into modified pEG BacMam vectors, yielding two constructs with the coding regions of mCherry-StrepII and ires-GFP fused to the 3’-region of the target gene product respectively (MmTMEM120A-mCherry and <italic>Mm</italic>TMEM120A-ires-GFP). Besides, we have also synthesized the cDNA of <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A (with codons optimized for expression in HEK293 cells) and cloned it into the pcDNA3.1 vector with an upstream GFP-encoding sequence (GFP-HsTMEM120A) for the whole-cell and cell-attached electrophysiology studies. We have added the detailed description of constructs and molecular cloning in the method section of the revised manuscript (lines 531-560, p35-36).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 1A-B, in addition to displaying the peak current for each cell, it would be useful to include a traditional displacement-current curve both for Piezos and for TMEMs- this would alleviate any concern that TMEM-transfected cells were not poked to the same depths. Similarly for Figure 1C, in addition to plotting maximal current please include P50 curves- because the authors smartly included a high-threshold channel as a positive control, it would further strengthen their claims to show that even at high pressures, there is no current above background for TMEM120A-B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive advices. In the revised Figure 1, we have included the displacement-current curves (revised Figure 1B) and pressure-current curves (revised Figure 1E and 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should either tone down a majority of their detailed structural observations, or show the experimental density that supports them – this is particularly relevant for the CoASH binding site on Figure 4E, where residue-specific interactions are discussed; Figure 5C and D, where a conformational change is suggested without having shown the density for the loop on the CoASH-bound structure; the extracellular constriction formed by M207, W210, F219 and C310, for which also no density is shown. The depiction of isolated channel fragments as in Figure 3 – Supplement 1 is not helpful for addressing any of the issues described above.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. To show the cryo-EM densities corresponding to the structural parts mentioned by the reviewer, we have updated Figure 4 to include cryo-EM densities of the CoASH-binding site in panel E. The densities of IL5 loops in the <italic>Hs</italic>TMEM120A structures of CoASH-free and CoASH-bound states are included in Figure 5E, to provide evidences for the structural models shown in Figure 5C and D. Besides, the densities for the four amino acid residues (M207, W210, F219 and C310) forming the extracellular constrict are included in Figure 5−figure supplement 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors should edit their Introduction to make it more useful for wider audiences, mainly by clarifying that MscL and MscS are absent in animals, and by indicating the types of organisms that express the channels listed on lines 52-57.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have included a sentence to state that:</p><p>“While members of the MscL family are present in bacteria, archaea or fungi, and those of the MscS family exist in plants or microbes, they are not found in animals.” (lines 49-51, p3).</p><p>The types of organisms have also been indicated for the various mechanosensitive channels listed in the introduction (lines 54-59, p3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) A significant part of the Discussion section is dedicated to speculations on how TMEM120A might still function as a mechanosensitive channel in the absence of CoASH block, while the results of the study suggest that it might not even be a channel. It would be equally (or more) important to discuss its putative role in fatty acid metabolism, perhaps by referring to related/similar structures of the proteins with known functions (e.g. ELOVL). With respect to the functional role of TMEM120A, of interest might be recent preprints (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.450322, https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.30.450616).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for your insightful suggestion.

The previous version contains an error in the values of Y axis (introduced during data analysis by accident) and has been fixed in the revised version.</p></body></sub-article></article>
