several ribosomal proteins (RPs), such as RPL11 and RPL5, which inhibit MDM2 and activate p53. Inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis and crucial for maintaining cellular guanine deoxy- and ribonucleotide pools needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. It is highly expressed in many malignancies. We previously showed that inhibition of IMPDH2 leads to p53 activation by causing RS. Surprisingly, our current study reveals that Inauzhin (INZ), a novel non-genotoxic p53 activator by inhibiting SIRT1, can also inhibit cellular IMPDH2 activity, and reduce the levels of cellular GTP and GTP-binding nucleostemin that is essential for rRNA processing. Consequently, INZ induces RS and the RPL11/RPL5-MDM2 interaction, activating p53. These results support the new notion that INZ suppresses cancer cell growth by dually targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03077.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03077.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03077.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer develops when cells lose the ability to control their own growth. About half of cancerous tumors carry a dysfunctional version of a protein called p53, while the other half have defects in proteins that are important for p53's production and function. When a healthy cell is exposed to damaging chemicals or agents, the p53 protein triggers responses that are aimed at repairing the damage. However, if these attempts fail, p53 causes the damaged cell to essentially destroy itself.</p><p>As defects in p53-controlled processes cause cells to grow unrestrictedly and can lead to cancer, it is a very attractive target for cancer therapies. Cancer drug developments have focused on both targeting p53 directly and targeting the proteins that work with p53. Two proteins called Mdm2 and SIRT1 are of particular interest. Mdm2 binds to, inactivates, and leads to the degradation of p53. SIRT1 can modify p53 and make it more accessible to Mdm2, and is often found in very high levels in cancer cells.</p><p>In 2012, researchers identified Inauhzin as a small molecule that could potentially be used to treat tumors that still have a functional version of the p53 protein. Inauhzin was thought to work by inhibiting SIRT1, which increases p53 levels—probably through its effects on Mdm2. This restores the cell's ability to control its growth and to die if it is irreparably damaged. However, not all of this small molecule's effects on cells can be explained by its interaction with SIRT1.</p><p>Now Zhang et al., including some of the researchers involved in the 2012 work, have investigated whether Inauhzin also interacts with other proteins in the cell; and Inauhzin was revealed to bind an enzyme called IMPDH2. This enzyme is involved in making GTP—a small molecule that is involved in many important processes in living cells. Zhang et al. demonstrated that Inauhzin's effect on the IMPDH enzyme triggered a response that did not involve the SIRT1 protein, and that ultimately led to a decrease in Mdm2 activity and restored p53 activity.</p><p>Cancer treatments often include a combination of drugs that target different proteins with the goal of reducing the likelihood of a tumor becoming resistant to the treatment. Inauhzin's effect on two different proteins that lead to p53 activation not only increases its potency, but also makes it less likely that drug resistance will develop.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03077.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03077.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Inauhzin</kwd><kwd>p53</kwd><kwd>ribosomal stress</kwd><kwd>IMPDH2</kwd><kwd>nucleostemin</kwd><kwd>MDM2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 172468-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA0954412-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA127724-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA129828-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The small molecule Inauhzin possesses a dual targeting ability, and activates p53 by targeting two enzymes—SIRT1 and IMP dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2)—which are highly expressed in human cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With ∼22 million people living with cancers that are highly associated with alterations of multiple molecules and pathways, it is important to develop a multiple molecules-targeted therapy that can effectively kill cancer cells. The tumor suppressor p53 pathway is one such a target because nearly all cancers show defects in this pathway. Approximately 50% of human cancers have mutations in the TP53 gene itself, while the rest of them harbor functionally inactive p53 proteins, because active p53 can trigger cell growth arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, and/or senescence, which are detrimental to cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>), and impede cell migration, metabolism, and/or angiogenesis. A major mechanism for functional inactivation of p53 is through overexpression of two chief p53 suppressors, MDM2 and MDMX, which work together to inactivate p53 by directly interacting with p53, inhibiting its transcriptional activity and mediating its ubiquitin dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wade et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tollini and Zhang, 2012</xref>). This MDM2/MDMX-mediated p53 degradation is also facilitated by SIRT1, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vaziri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>). SIRT1 is highly expressed in human cancers due to down regulation of another p53 target tumor suppressor called hypermethylated in cancer-1 (HIC-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our previous study identified a small molecule named Inauhzin (INZ) that effectively inhibits SIRT1 activity and induces p53 acetylation, leading to the increase of p53 level and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>). Consequently, INZ induces p53-dependent apoptosis and senescence in various p53-wild type human cancer cells, such as H460, and HCT116 by inducing the expression of p53-dependent transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liao et al., 2012</xref>). INZ markedly inhibits the growth of H460 or HCT116 xenograft tumors, but is not toxic to normal cells and tissues. Also, INZ sensitizes the anti-cancer effect of cisplatin, doxorubicin, or Nutlin-3 (an MDM2 inhibitor) as tested in xenograft cancer models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2012c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al, 2013</xref>). Thus, this small molecule presents as a promising contender for a molecule-targeted anti-cancer therapy. Since its discovery, we have optimized INZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>) and determined additional cellular proteins that INZ might target via a set of biochemical, proteomic, and cell-based analyses. As detailed below, our study unveils inosine monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) as a novel cellular target of INZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of IMPDH2 as a cellular target of INZ</title><p>IMPDH is the key metabolic enzyme supplying guanine nucleotides to a cell as the first and rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP biosynthesis by catalyzing NAD+-dependent oxidation of IMP to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zimmermann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>).

Biotinylated INZ analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were synthesized for these analyses. Here, Biotin-INZ was as active as INZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2012a</xref>), while Biotin-INZ (O) was inactive and thus used as a negative control. Comparison of the most abundant proteins based on normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) in the cells treated Biotin-INZ vs DMSO or Biotin-INZ (O) revealed the high enrichment of IMPDH2 proteins in the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with enriched IMPDH2 peptides shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This result was firmly validated by immunoblot (IB) analysis of the pulled down proteins, as IMPDH2 was specifically brought down with Biotin-INZ, as well as together with our previously identified SIRT1, but not Biotin-INZ (O) or other controls, in both H460 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03077.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of IMPDH2 as a potential target of INZ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of INZ analogs conjugated with Biotin (Biotin-INZ) used for INZ target identification, the oxygen-substituent (Biotin-INZ (O)) as a negative control.

Consistently, the growth inhibition by INZ was compromised as the IC<sub>50</sub> value for INZ in cell growth analysis decreased by almost ∼10-fold when IMPDH2 was knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Knockdown of IMPDH2 in HCT116 cells also conveyed much more significant effect on compromising the cytotoxicity of INZ compared to p53 null HCT116 (HCT116<sup>−/−</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that INZ suppresses cancer cell growth mainly by targeting IMPDH2 in the cells and consequently activating the p53 pathway.</p><p>Although Biotin-INZ was associated with cellular IMPDH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), INZ did not appear to affect the activity of the purified enzyme (date not shown). This discrepancy could be due to differences between the recombinant IMPDH2 in vitro and its native form in cells, as the latter could be regulated via post-translational modifications or partner proteins in cells, or INZ might mimic a nucleoside and be phosphorylated by a kinase in cells to target IMPDH2. These results also suggest that INZ might not directly bind to the active site of this enzyme. These possibilities remain to be addressed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>INZ causes the depletion of nucleostemin and consequent ribosomal stress</title><p>Our previous study showed that inhibition of IMPDH2 activity by MPA leads to RS and consequent p53 activation by reducing the level of nucleostemin (NS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lo et al., 2012</xref>), a nucleolar GTP-binding protein important for rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tsai and McKay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lo et al., 2012</xref>).

Consistently, knocking down RPL5 and RPL11 abrogated INZ-induced p21 and MDM2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that RPL5 and RPL11 are required for INZ-induced p53 activation and apoptosis. Also, ribosome profile analysis followed by IB revealed that INZ significantly increases the levels of ribosome-free RPL5 and RPL11 (fractions 1–10), whereas it markedly reduces the level of polysomes (fractions 37–51) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that INZ could suppress ribosome biogenesis and possibly protein translation. All together, these results demonstrate that INZ can activate p53-dependent apoptosis by interfering with ribosome biogenesis through depletion of NS, causing RS, which then induces the release of ribosome-free RPL11 and RPL5 that bind to MDM2 and consequently inhibit its activity toward p53.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>INZ-mediated GTP depletion by targeting IMPDH2</title><p>Because Inhibition of IMPDH2 reduces cellular GTP level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ji et al., 2006</xref>), and INZ associates with cellular IMPDH2 and reduces nucleolar NS level, consequently causing RS and p53 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1–3</xref>), we then tested if this INZ effect on p53 could be suppressed by supplementing culture media with extra GTP or guanosine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>, addition of either GTP or guanosine to cells significantly, though partially, alleviated the INZ induction of p53 level and activity as measured by IB analysis of p53, Puma and cleaved PARP. This result is well correlated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, showing that INZ markedly reduced the GTP level in H460 cells by 6.3-fold and in HCT116 cells by 3.7-fold, respectively, as measured by HPLC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Pierro et al., 1995</xref>). These results indicate that INZ can reduce cellular GTP level likely by inhibiting IMPDH2 in cells. Indeed, knockdown of IMPDH2 compromised the GTP depletion by INZ treatment in both p53 wild type and p53 null HCT116 cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since it has been shown that NS is very sensitive to cellular GTP level and low GTP level triggers NS re-localization from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, consequently destabilizing it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tsai and McKay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lo et al., 2012</xref>), these results also suggest that it must be by decreasing cellular GTP level that INZ causes NS degradation and consequent RS, leading to p53 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03077.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>GTP or guanosine lessens INZ activation of p53 in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) H460 cells were pretreated with GTP or guanosine for 2 hr before the addition of 2 μM INZ.

IMPDH2 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. INZ reduced the levels of cellular GTP and NS by targeting IMPDH2 (or its complex), resulting in RS that leads to the enhancement of the RPL11/RPL5-MDM2 interaction, consequently MDM2 inactivation and p53 activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03077.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03077.006</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03077-fig4-v1"/></fig></p><p>Cancers are caused by alterations of multiple tumor-associated proteins or genes at the genetic and epigenetic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>), including the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). Thus, targeting multiple proteins of one or more signaling pathways in cancers is necessary for developing a more effective cancer therapy. Several individual SIRT1 or IMPDH2 inhibitors have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcain and Villalba, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). However, dual targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2 by INZ to activate p53 would offer the first paradigm for anti-cancer drug development. Our studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 1–4</xref>) together with previously published findings strongly suggest that INZ effectively activates p53 and suppresses tumor growth in a p53-dependent fashion by targeting SIRT1 and IMPDH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2012b</xref>)). This dual targeting strategy could also explain why INZ can still partially activate p53 in IMPDH2 knockdown or GTP-supplemented cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), although the partial impairment of p53 induction could also be due to the inefficiency of completely knockdown IMPDH2 or the possible non-continuous availability of intracellular GTP throughout the experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cell culture, reagents and antibodies</title><p>Human lung carcinoma H460 and human colon cancer HCT116 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PBS), penicillin, and streptomycin.

In this current study, we mainly focus on a new target of INZ, which is the ribosomal stress (RS)-p53 pathway by inhibiting IMPDH2 in cancer cells. It is possible that INZ inhibits SIRT1 and IMPDH2 in a similar fashion, since both of the enzymes utilize NAD as a cofactor. To prove that INZ can target both pathways by inhibiting SIRT1 and IMPDH2 to achieve maximum cell growth inhibition, we performed INZ dose response experiments in HCT116 cells with double knockdown of SIRT1 and IMPDH2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>, co-depletion of SIRT1 and IMPDH2 displayed an obvious combination effect on suppression of INZ-induced cytotoxicity, compared to single knockdown of either SIRT1 or IMPDH2, as their IC<sub>50</sub> values increased at least 2 fold, from 3.77 to 10.57μM, and 5.20 to 10.57μM, respectively.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>Combination effect of co-depletion of IMPDH2 and SIRT1 on INZ induced cell death. HCT116 cells, transfected with scrambled siRNA (SiControl), IMPDH2 siRNA (SiIMPDH2), SIRT1 siRNA (SiSIRT1) or co-transfected with IMPDH2 and SIRT1 siRNA, were treated with different doses of INZ and cell viability were assessed by WST cell growth assays. IC<sub>50</sub> values are represented as mean ± standard deviation (n=3).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03077-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>B) It had been suggested that INZ might possess p53 independent effects, for example, INZ promotes cell death in the absence of p53 at high concentrations ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liao et al 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al 2012a</xref>), and data not shown). This could be due to other SIRT1's substrates like p73 as we showed in our previous studies. Although there is the existence of other potential protein targets (that are associated with SIRT1 and IMPDH2) for INZ, our results clearly show that this compound at lower doses specifically triggers p53-dependent apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation in both cultured and xenograft tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al 2012c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al 2013</xref>) and data not shown). Indeed, knockdown of IMPDH2 by siRNA conveyed a much more significant effect on compromising the cytotoxicity of INZ in p53 wild type than in p53 null cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>), indicating that the suppression of cell growth by INZ is mainly through the inhibition of IMPDH2 and activation of the p53 pathway.</p><p>C) We used Biotin-INZ (O) for in vitro pull down assay as a negative control to identify additional potential proteins that INZ specifically targets in cancer cells. As compared to the cells treated with Biotin-INZ (O), some specific proteins were pulled down with Biotin-INZ. MS analysis revealed one of them as our previously identified SIRT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al 2012b</xref>) and another as IMPDH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which indicated SIRT1 and IMPDH2 are associated with INZ but not with INZ (O). This was confirmed by immunoblot analysis from both H460 and HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; data not shown). We have modified the text and updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) What are the consequences of INZ interaction with IMPDH2? Where on IMPDH2 does INZ bind? Does it inhibit its enzymatic activity? Is that why the levels of GTP are so dramatically reduced in these cells? Are they similarly reduced in p53 null cell lines? What about normal non-transformed cells? The nature of the interaction between INZ and IMPDH2 remains unclear. Although INZ is implied in the manuscript to inhibit IMPDH2 activity, the RNAi mediated knockdown of IMPDH2 does not replicate the same effects on p53 as INZ treatment. The authors should address this uncertainty and extend the findings on the interaction between the inhibitor and IMPDH2</italic>.</p><p>A) We performed a set of experiments to determine the effect of INZ on IMPDH2 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref>). Indeed, INZ did directly bind to purified IMPDH2 in biotin-avidin pull down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2C-D</xref>). Although we could pull-down IMPDH2 from cell extracts and observed the direct binding between IMPDH2 and INZ using purified proteins, INZ did not affect IMPDH2 activity using the purified enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 3B</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to differences between the native state of IMPDH2 inside cells and the purified recombinant protein, as the former could include post-translational modifications and/or partner proteins. Another possibility is that as the chemical structure of INZ mimics a nucleoside, it could be phosphorylated by a kinase and the phosphorylated form directly inhibits the activity of IMPDH2 in vivo, as a number of nucleosideanalogues (e.g. ribavirin, mizoribine) are known to inhibit IMPDH2 after being monophosphorylated by cellular kinases (Leyssen et al 2005, Stuyver et al 2002a, Stuyver et al 2002b). Our results also suggest that INZ might not directly bind to the active site of the enzyme. Currently, we have found some interesting proteins pulled down by INZ are associated with IMPDH2 via proteomics analyses and biochemical and cell-based assays, and we have also identified the metabolites of INZ by LC-MS/MS. It is possible these metabolites of INZ and newly identified IMPDH2-binding proteins might play a role in the regulation of IMPDH2 activity by INZ. Apparently, the mechanism underlying INZ inhibition of IMPDH2 is more complex than that for INZ inhibition of SIRT1. However, studying this complex possibility would take us much longer time and generate substantial amounts of data that could be useful for another independent manuscript. Therefore, we hope that this reviewer would allow us to put these studies into our future manuscripts.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>INZ binds to IMPDH2, but does not inhibit enzyme activity <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Knockdown of IMPDH2 could compromise INZ effect on the GTP levels in both p53 wild type and null cancer cells. We did not test INZ in normal cells because INZ is much less toxic to normal cells even though they contain WT p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al 2012b</xref>)</p><p>C) The partial knockdown of IMPDH2 by siRNA and the multiple protein targets of INZ, such as SIRT1 and IMPDH2, could explain why knockdown of only IMPDH2 by siRNA does not replicate the same effects on p53 as with INZ treatment. We have repeated siRNA knockdown experiments using another specific siRNA against IMPDH2. The new immunoblots are included in the revised version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the efficiency of knockdown of IMPDH2 is better, the effect on p53 activation by knockdown of IMPDH2 is still not comparable to INZ treatment, indicating INZ targets more than one protein besides IMPDH2.</p><p><italic>More minor comments</italic>:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>: IMZ dramatically induces p53 and Mdm2 but only very modestly increases p21 expression in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>.

The p21 expression rises significantly within 3 h, while p53 expression is noticed only after 6h from the treatment in H460 cell line. This might partially be due to p73 activation by INZ inhibition of SIRT1. Another possibility would be that p53 activity might be activated earlier than the increase of p53 steady state level in response to INZ treatment, leading to the earlier expression of p21. The time point for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is 18h, and the MDM2 expression level is very high at that time point, and consequently, MDM2 mediates p21 degradation decreasing the level of p21. Also, please see our response to point 2 as indicated below.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>: Can the authors explain why there is more p21 upon siRNA knockdown of RPL11 and RPL5 in DMSO treated cells than in INZ treated cells with these siRNAs while the opposite is seen with Mdm2 protein under the same conditions</italic>?</p><p>In DMSO treated cells, the elevation of p21 level is not through transcriptional activation, because the p53 level is reduced upon RP knockdown. Therefore, the p21 expression in these cells may be regulated at the post-translational level. Many mechanisms are responsible for the regulation of p21 protein level; for example, our group and others found that MDM2 could degrade p21 independently of p53 (Jin et al 2003, Zhang et al 2004), which may partially explain the reason why p21 level in lane 2 is lower than lane 1. However, we cannot rule out other possibilities, as RPs are essential proteins, and knocking down any of them is potentially able to cause other defects. These experiments are basically designed to test whether RPs are required for INZ-induced activation of the p53 pathway. Thus we assessed the expression of two typical p53 target genes, p21 and MDM2, which indeed demonstrates that RPs are required for INZ-induced p53 activation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>A: The data with GTP and guanosine are a bit strange in that phosphorylated nucleotides are generally not taken up by intact cells.

The evidence that exogenous phosphorylated nucleotides can be actively transported across the cell membrane of intact cells is indicated in the formation of phosphoproteins inside the cells (Amir-Zaltsman and Salomon 1989, Guo et al 1999, Piacentini and Niroomand 1996). For example, in labeling experiments, cells are initially placed in a specific medium designed to deplete the nucleotide pools, followed by addition of radioactive labeled 32P-ATP or GTP (or other nucleotide), leading to labeling of intracellular DNA or proteins. The mechanism is associated with the active transport by transporters of ATP or GTP located on the cell membranes (Amir-Zaltsman and Salomon 1989, Lelong et al 1992, Lelong et al 1994, Piacentini and Niroomand 1996, Wieland et al 1993).</p><p>To demonstrate that this is true to this reviewer, we also confirmed the uptake of GTP by cells using LC-MS.

This is probably one of the reasons that IMPDH2 siRNA could not reach the same effect as INZ in p53 activation.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) What is the effect if IMPDH2 depletion on the growth of cells without INZ treatment (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>)?

The depletion of cellular GTP level and the growth inhibition by IMPDH2 depletion is much more modest in p53 null cells compared to p53 wild type cells.

Unfortunately, we failed to equalize the amount of MDM2 level with the addition of MG132. We then performed a reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment using L11 antibody. Anti-L11 antibodies pulled down same amount of L11 in all samples, but much more MDM2 was co-immunoprecipitated with L11 antibodies in INZ treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
