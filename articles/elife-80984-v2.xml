ubiquitous. They can be generated by circadian oscillators, which produce daily rhythms in physiology and behavior, as well as by developmental oscillators such as the segmentation clock, which periodically produces modular developmental units. Here, we show that the circadian clock controls the timing of late-stage floret development, or anthesis, in domesticated sunflowers. In these plants, up to thousands of individual florets are tightly packed onto a capitulum disk. While early floret development occurs continuously across capitula to generate iconic spiral phyllotaxy, during anthesis floret development occurs in discrete ring-like pseudowhorls with up to hundreds of florets undergoing simultaneous maturation. We demonstrate circadian regulation of floral organ growth and show that the effects of light on this process are time-of-day dependent. Delays in the phase of floral anthesis delay morning visits by pollinators, while disruption of circadian rhythms in floral organ development causes loss of pseudowhorl formation and large reductions in pollinator visits. We therefore show that the sunflower circadian clock acts in concert with environmental response pathways to tightly synchronize the anthesis of hundreds of florets each day, generating spatial patterns on the developing capitulum disk. This coordinated mass release of floral rewards at predictable times of day likely promotes pollinator visits and plant reproductive success.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most organisms, from plants to insects and humans, anticipate the rise and set of the sun through an internal biological timekeeper, called the circadian clock. Plants like the common sunflower use this clock to open their flowers at dawn in time for the arrival of pollinating insects.</p><p>Sunflowers are composed of many individual flowers or florets, which are arranged in spirals around a centre following an age gradient: the oldest flowers are on the outside and youngest flowers on the inside. Each day, a ring of florets of different developmental ages coordinates their opening in a specific pattern over the day. For example, petals open at dawn, pollen is presented in the morning, and stigmas, the female organs that receive pollen, unfold in the afternoon. This pattern of flowering, or floret maturation, is repeated every day for five to ten days, creating daily rhythms of flowering across the sunflower head. Previously, it was unclear how florets within each flowering ring synchronize their flowering patterns to precise times during the day.</p><p>To find out more, Marshall et al. analysed time-lapse videos of sunflowers that were exposed to different day length and temperature conditions. Sunflowers opened a new floret ring every 24 hours, regardless of the length of the day. In all three day-length scenarios (short, middle, long), the development of the florets remained highly coordinated. Even flowers kept in the dark for up to four days were able to maintain the same daily growth rhythms. This persistence of daily rhythms in the absence of environmental cues suggests that the circadian clock regulates the genetic pathways that cause sunflowers to flower. However, when sunflowers whose circadian rhythms were delayed relative to the sun were placed out in a field, the sunflowers flowered later and thus attracted less pollinators.</p><p>Marshall et al. show that the circadian clock is important for regulating flowering patterns in sunflowers to ensure their successful pollination. A better understanding of the interplay between pollinators, flowering plants and their environment will provide more insight into how climate change may affect pollination efficiency. By identifying the genes and pathways underlying flowering patterns, it may be possible to develop breeds that flower at the optimal times of day to promote pollination. This could help mitigate the effects of climate change and declining populations of pollinators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Helianthus annuus</italic></kwd><kwd>external coincidence model</kwd><kwd>anthesis</kwd><kwd>spiral phyllotaxy</kwd><kwd>rhythms</kwd><kwd>floral organs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1759942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harmer</surname><given-names>Stacey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000199</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA-D-PLB-2259-H</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harmer</surname><given-names>Stacey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The circadian clock acts with light response pathways to tightly synchronize daily rhythms in maturation of hundreds of florets in sunflower, promoting timely visits by pollinators and creating ring-like patterns on developing heads.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>From the earliest stages of cellular differentiation to reproductive maturity, spatio-temporal regulation of developmental transitions plays an important role in biological success. In some cases, internal temporal rhythms are used to spatially organize a body plan. For example, in vertebrate embryos a molecular ‘segmentation clock’ acts at regular intervals to divide the developing body axis into discrete blocks of cells that later differentiate into individual somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richmond and Oates, 2012</xref>). In plants, the regular spacing of lateral roots along the length of the primary root axis is controlled by a ‘root clock’ that generates a temporally oscillating developmental signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xuan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus in both plants and animals, internal body clocks can generate serially repeated organs. These types of clocks are distinct from the circadian oscillator, the biological clock found in most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosier and Hurley, 2021</xref>). Circadian clocks coordinate development on daily and seasonal time scales. In both plants and animals, the circadian clock can integrate environmental cues such as day length and temperature to time the transition to reproductive stages to the appropriate season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikegami and Yoshimura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>). On a diel scale, the circadian clock can coordinate developmental processes with environmental transitions associated with the earth’s rotation, such as leaf movement in plants, eclosion in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and conidiation in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Larrondo and Canessa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClung, 2019</xref>). However, a role for the circadian clock in the spatial patterning of development has not previously been reported.</p><p>Circadian clocks in eukaryotes are cell-autonomous systems made up of transcriptional-translational feedback loops that create rhythms of gene expression to regulate biological timing. Circadian rhythms, biological processes regulated by the circadian clock, meet several fundamental criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rensing and Ruoff, 2002</xref>). First, they are stably entrained to environmental cues. Second, they persist in free-running environmental conditions. Third, circadian rhythms are temperature compensated such that they maintain a uniform period over a range of ambient temperatures, in contrast to the general rule that the rate of enzymatic processes changes with temperature. In addition, the circadian clock gates certain biological processes so that responsiveness to environmental cues is time-of-day dependent. For example, studies in humans show the timing of drug treatment can be critical to creating an effective therapeutic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruan et al., 2021</xref>). A functioning circadian clock whose biological rhythms match that of the environment provides a fitness advantage for many organisms, including plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodd et al., 2005</xref>), animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emerson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spoelstra et al., 2016</xref>), bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ouyang et al., 1998</xref>), and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koritala et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One important way the circadian clock promotes fitness is by controlling timing of reproductive development, for example, by allowing organisms to distinguish between the long and short days of different seasons. In plants, the circadian system mediates the effects of day length during the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, usually referred to as flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Imaizumi and Kay, 2006</xref>). The circadian clock also regulates daily aspects of floral development, for example, coordinating daily rhythms in scent emission and floral opening and closing with pollinator activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenske et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muroya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yon et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, the circadian clock is implicated in the uniform eastward orientation observed in mature sunflower plants; this eastward orientation was shown to enhance both male and female reproductive fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atamian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creux et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Domesticated sunflower is an excellent model system to study the temporal regulation of floral development. Sunflowers are members of the Asteraceae, a highly successful family comprised of about 30,000 distinct species that are widely dispersed around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funk et al., 2009</xref>). Asteraceae are characterized by the arrangement of individual florets together in a complex, compressed inflorescence called the capitulum. Individual florets are arranged on the capitulum disk in spiral patterns, a classic type of phyllotaxis observed in many plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These phyllotactic spirals, called parastichies, are generated by the precise specification of floral primordia, first at the outer rim and then moving into the center of the capitulum disk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In domesticated sunflower, specification of the hundreds or even thousands of floret primordia found on a single capitulum takes approximately 10–14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marc and Palmer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer and Steer, 1985</xref>), followed approximately 20 days later by the onset of anthesis, or floral opening, of the first florets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindström and Hernández, 2015</xref>). Anthesis of all florets on a capitulum head typically occurs over 5–10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seiler, 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Architecture of the sunflower capitulum.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A sunflower capitulum before onset of anthesis, with obvious clockwise and counter-clockwise parastichies (Pr) of individual florets.

Instead, discrete developmental boundaries are observed with obvious rings of florets at distinct stages of anthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Each ring, or pseudowhorl, undergoes anthesis on successive days. While previous studies examined the effects of hormones and environmental factors on the timing of development of florets within a pseudowhorl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baroncelli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lobello et al., 2000</xref>), the mechanisms governing the conversion of the continuous spiral pattern of development seen early in floral development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to the ring-like patterns seen during anthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) have not been explored.</p><p>Here, we investigate the timing of floral organ development in various environmental conditions. We find that temperature-compensated daily rhythms in development of both male and female floral organs, and the formation of pseudowhorls, persist when flowers are maintained in constant environmental conditions in the absence of light. However, both daily rhythms in development and the formation of pseudowhorls are lost in constant light: late-stage floret maturation occurs continuously along parastichies, with negative impacts on pollinator visits. Importantly, the effects of light on floret development are time-of-day-dependent. Together, these data indicate that late-stage floret development is regulated by the circadian clock. Field experiments reveal that the timing of anthesis affects visits by pollinating insects, thus linking circadian control of floral maturation with plant reproductive success. We propose that pseudowhorls are produced in response to an external coincidence mechanism, in which developmentally competent florets undergo reproductive transitions only when they receive environmental cues at the appropriate time of day. Our data suggest a role for the circadian clock in the spatial as well as temporal control of sunflower development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>During anthesis the pattern of development changes from continuous to discrete</title><p>The phyllotactic spirals of florets, or parastichies, on sunflower capitula represent continuous age-gradients with the first-specified florets on the outside edge of the capitulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marc and Palmer, 1981</xref>). Each disc floret is an individual flower with an epigynous ovary that holds a corolla tube of fused petals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Within the corolla tube is the fused anther tube, subtended by five filaments, collectively forming the stamen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, at the center of the floret is the style and stigma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which we will together call the style. Although early floret development occurs continuously across the capitulum, anthesis does not. Local synchronization of floret development at this developmental stage converts the obvious spiral arrangement of florets on immature capitula into a ring-like pattern of pseudowhorls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), marking a transition from a continuous to discrete pattern of development. This can be seen most clearly in the abrupt transition in ovary lengths between one pseudowhorl and the next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), with the longer ovaries of florets undergoing anthesis causing the protrusion of their corollas above those of immature florets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies described daily patterns in sunflower floret anthesis, with a single floret releasing pollen the day before the stigma of this floret is receptive to pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Putt, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neff and Simpson, 1990</xref>). Before anthesis all reproductive organs are enclosed within the corolla tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – I). As anthesis begins, the corolla tubes of multiple florets within a pseudowhorl coordinately rise above the capitulum surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>) driven by ovary growth rather than expansion of the corolla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Next, rapid elongation of anther filaments causes anther tube protrusion above the corolla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baroncelli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lobello et al., 2000</xref>). In this staminate stage of anthesis, pollen is released within the anther tube and is then pushed up and out by the rapid growth of the style through the anther tube soon after dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – III). Continued style elongation pushes the stigma beyond the anther tube to initiate the pistillate stage of anthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – III). This plunger-style mechanism of pollen presentation is an ancestral feature of the Asteraceae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffrey, 2009</xref>). The stigmas then unfold and become receptive to pollen the day after pollen release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The temporal and spatial separation between pollen release and stigma presentation in sunflowers promotes cross-fertilization across the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patterson, 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Pseudowhorls are due to coordinated daily rhythms in floret anthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth kinetics of floral organs in a single pseudowhorl for plants grown in LD|25°C with dark from ZT 16–20.5.

Plants were maintained in light-dark cycles and constant temperature. Florets within a single pseudowhorl were dissected every 15–30 min over 24 hr and individual organ lengths measured. Ovary elongation was observed first, starting near the time of lights off and continuing for approximately 10 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baroncelli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lobello et al., 2000</xref>), we found that stamen elongation commenced approximately 8 hr after lights off, driven by an approximately 2.5× increase in anther filament length over 5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Anther tubes, like corolla tubes, did not elongate during this time frame. Stamens reached maximal length at time 28, due to filament elongation, and later shrank due to filament collapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – III). Styles initiated rapid elongation 1 hr after anther filaments, with growth continuing over 11 hr until they reached ~2× their original length and grew past the stamens. Thus, the obvious discrete phases of anthesis visible on whole capitula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>) are driven primarily by the consecutive and highly coordinated elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles within each pseudowhorl.</p><p>We next investigated the effects of different environmental conditions on the dynamics of floret development. We generated time-lapse movies of sunflowers undergoing anthesis taken at 15 min intervals and scored observable patterns of growth as proxies for the detailed organ measurements described above. We first examined growth kinetics in capitula undergoing anthesis in long-day conditions reminiscent of a summer day (16 hr light, 8 hr dark, and constant 25°C (LD|25°C [16 hr:8 hr])). A new pseudowhorl of florets underwent anthesis every 24 hr, with ovary swelling initiating in the late night, stamen elongation visible from late night to soon after dawn, and conspicuous style elongation occurring in the latter part of the day and early night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Times of ovary, stamen, and style growth were highly coordinated across pseudowhorls and flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The mean midpoint of visible ovary growth occurred before dawn at zeitgeber time (ZT) 22.9 (with the time of lights on defined as ZT 0), followed by the mean midpoint of stamen growth at ZT 1.3, and the mean midpoint of style growth before dusk at ZT 12.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Similar experiments were carried out for plants exposed to shorter (LD|25°C [12 hr:12 hr]) or longer (LD|25°C [19.5 hr:4.5 hr]) photoperiods. Similar daily rhythms of anthesis were observed in all three conditions, with the phases of organ growth relative to dawn changing only slightly with different night lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In all three photoperiod conditions, the timing of floret development within pseudowhorls was highly coordinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) with a stable phase relationship between all organs.

developmental coordination within each pseudowhorl is quite remarkable given that the initiation of floret primordia along each phyllotactic spiral of a parastichy occurs continuously over many days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore examined the timing of ovary, stamen, and style growth within a pseudowhorl along separate parastichies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). While the number of florets per parastichy within a pseudowhorl varied, growth of the three different organs occurred at almost the identical time for all florets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Ovary lengths were also measured along individual parastichies at ZT 2, a time when ovary growth within a pseudowhorl is complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The lengths of ovaries within a pseudowhorl along a parastichy were similar to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>), but there was a large step-down in length compared to ovaries of pre-anthesis florets in the same parastichy. Previous studies showed that the large changes in ovary size and filament length during anthesis are due to rapid cell expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lindström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindström and Hernández, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lobello et al., 2000</xref>). The remarkable synchronization of cell elongation and organ growth during anthesis, despite the age difference of florets along each parastichy, suggests some master regulator coordinates anthesis within each pseudowhorl.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Daily rhythms in floret development persist in constant dark conditions and are temperature-compensated</title><p>The precise daily timing of sunflower anthesis suggested that the circadian clock might be involved in this process. To test this, we examined the development of sunflower capitula maintained in constant dark and temperature.

However, style elongation rates were very slow in DD|25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) such that style growth in one pseudowhorl continued even after florets in the subsequent pseudowhorl began anthesis. This resulted in almost continuous style elongation across the capitulum. The immediate slowing of style but not ovary or stamen elongation upon transfer to constant darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggests that different regulatory pathways control growth of these organs. However, the daily rhythms in initiation of growth of all three types of organs in constant darkness suggest a general role for the circadian clock in the control of anthesis.</p><p>Circadian-regulated processes are characterized by their relative insensitivity to temperature variation across a physiologically relevant range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenham and McClung, 2015</xref>). We therefore determined the free-running periods for ovary and stamen developmental rhythms in sunflowers maintained in constant darkness at 18°C, 25°C, or 30°C. Across the three different growth conditions, the estimated periods for cycles of ovary development were not statistically different while the estimated period for stamen development was slightly but significantly longer at 30°C, suggesting modest overcompensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, within each temperature, the estimated periods of ovary and stamen growth were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

We therefore examined whether the effects of light and darkness on sunflower anthesis are time-of-day dependent by applying a short 4.5 hr dark period at different times of the subjective day or night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and assessing the effects on the spatial and temporal regulation of floret development.

However, when the onset of darkness occurred during the subjective day, different effects were observed for ovaries compared to stamens and styles. In pseudowhorl 2, the first pseudowhorl undergoing development in the new light conditions, ovary elongation began at the expected time but with a slow growth rate that continued until the next period of darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore examined whether multiple periods of darkness during a 24 hr period would affect the timing of floret anthesis within pseudowhorls. We first exposed sunflowers to four equal periods of darkness and light every 24 hr, LDLD|25°C (6 hr:6 hr:6 hr:6 hr).

Pollinator visits closely tracked the timing of pollen release, with insects observed on jet lagged inflorescences approximately 1.5 hr later than on control inflorescences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The overall number of pollinator visits to the jet lag plants was significantly lower than those to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We continued to monitor these plants on their second day in the field. Consistent with the rapid re-entrainment of sunflowers in the growth chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), pollen release of the jet lag and control plants was coordinated with local dawn and there was no significant difference in pollinator visits to the experimental and control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since we previously showed that greater numbers of morning pollinator visits to sunflower inflorescences are correlated with greater siring success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creux et al., 2021</xref>), these data implicate circadian control of anthesis in plant reproductive fitness.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many aspects of floral physiology, including flower opening and scent production, vary across a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloch et al., 2017</xref>). In a few cases, such as petal opening and closing in <italic>Kalanchoë blössfedliana</italic> and flower movements in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, the circadian clock has been shown to regulate these diel rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bünsow, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yon et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that daily rhythms in the development of floral organs in sunflower persist in constant environmental conditions, are temperature-compensated, and exhibit a time-of-day specific response to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We therefore conclude that the circadian clock controls floral development in sunflower to ensure release of pollen soon after dawn and the emergence of styles and stigmas late in the day. Although style elongation is largely complete near the end of the first day of floret anthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baroncelli et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), stigmas do not become receptive to pollen until the following morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Putt, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neff and Simpson, 1990</xref>). This temporal separation between release of pollen and stigma receptivity is thought to reduce self-pollination and is prevalent throughout the Asteraceae family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffrey, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We found that elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles are all under circadian regulation, but respond differently to environmental cues. For example, transfer to constant light caused a complete inhibition of anther filament elongation, significantly slowed ovary expansion, but had no significant effect on style elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, transfer to constant darkness slowed style elongation considerably but had only modest effects on growth of ovaries and anther filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The strong inhibition of style elongation in constant darkness may help explain why rhythms in style emergence were less robust than those of ovary and anther growth in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Responses of the different organs to temperature were also distinct: temperature cycles slowed ovary expansion and had no effect on anther filament growth in either constant darkness or light. In contrast, temperature cycles slowed style elongation rates in constant darkness but not constant light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with our previous field studies that showed modest changes in ambient temperature affected style but not anther filament elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creux et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, the different sensitivities of floral organs to light and temperature suggest they may be regulated by distinct growth regulatory pathways. This is consistent with studies in other plants, which revealed that different hormones regulate the growth of male and female reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marciniak and Przedniczek, 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the molecular pathways controlling elongation of anther filaments and styles in sunflowers are likely different, we demonstrate that their common regulation by the circadian clock results in the fast and near-synchronous release of pollen a few hours after dawn. Intriguingly, many bee- and butterfly-pollinated Asteraceae species release pollen in the morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budumajji and Raju, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hipólito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neff and Simpson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valentin-Silva et al., 2016</xref>) while at least one bat-pollinated member of the family releases pollen in the early night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amorim et al., 2021</xref>). Since a delay in the timing of pollen release relative to dawn reduces pollinator visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–H</xref>) and negatively affects male reproductive success in sunflower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creux et al., 2021</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that clock regulation of late-stage floret development may be widespread in the Asteraceae. Identification of the mechanisms by which the circadian system coordinates the growth of male and female floral organs to promote timely pollen release will be of great interest.</p><p>The ecological and evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family, estimated to contain ~10% of angiosperm species, is attributed in part to their compressed inflorescences that act together as single false flowers to attract pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mandel et al., 2019</xref>). In sunflowers, the individual disk floret primordia are first initiated on the outer perimeter of the very large, flat head meristem and subsequent primordia are initiated following a centripetal pattern to generate the characteristic spiral pattern of immature florets seen across the disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marc and Palmer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer and Steer, 1985</xref>). Recent experimental and modeling studies in gerbera daisies attributed formation of this spiral pattern to short-range interactions between spatially close initia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, our work suggests that the ring-like pattern of pseudowhorls that emerges during anthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>) is generated by the action of the circadian clock on florets across the capitulum disk, with loss of synchronized daily rhythms in anthesis in constant light and temperature leading to loss of pseudowhorl formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of sunflower anthesis patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Developmental patterns observed when sunflowers undergo anthesis in different environmental conditions. Pre-anthesis, the apparent pattern of florets on a capitulum, is a continuous age gradient with spiral phyllotaxy (left panel). During anthesis in both normal light/dark cycles and in constant darkness, the capitulum transitions to a discontinuous age gradient of florets in which rings of florets, or pseudowhorls, undergo synchronized daily rhythms of development (top right panel). In constant light conditions, however, the capitulum maintains a continuous age gradient of floret development. Ovaries and styles grow, but stamens do not (bottom right panel). (<bold>B</bold>) Speculative model for transition of floret development from age-dependent continuous gradients to organization into discrete pseudowhorls that undergo coordinated anthesis. After anthesis, florets comprising pseudowhorl 1 send an unknown signal (dashed line) to younger florets, creating a permissive state for the transition to anthesis. In order to respond to this signal, younger florets must both (1) be developmentally competent and (2) be exposed to a sufficient period of darkness during the subjective night (as determined by the circadian clock). Florets younger than pseudowhorl 2 do not elongate floral organs until the post-anthesis state of pseudowhorl 2, floret developmental status, environmental cues, and the circadian clock allow transition to anthesis and the generation of the next pseudowhorl.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80984-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>How do florets of different developmental ages temporally coordinate anthesis to generate pseudowhorls? We propose that a type of external coincidence model is at work, analogous to the mechanisms underlying photoperiodic control of the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in many plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pittendrigh and Minis, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yanovsky and Kay, 2003</xref>). In our experiments, developmentally competent immature florets respond to a period of darkness that falls during the subjective night and is at least 4.5 hr long by undergoing the growth events that lead to anthesis (rapid ovary expansion followed by the rapid onset of anther filament and then style elongation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This is conceptually similar to photoperiodic control of flowering in short day plants such as rice, in which light at night inactivates a clock-regulated transcription factor that promotes the transition to flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Izawa et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although the molecular processes underlying light and circadian control of floral organ growth are not currently known, we speculate that they could involve circadian control of transcription coupled with light regulation of protein activity. For example, transcription factors with a nighttime phase of circadian gene expression but that are degraded in the light might promote growth of floral organs. In constant darkness, the activity of these factors would oscillate and drive near-normal anthesis rhythms. In constant light, or if light occurred during the subjective night, the abundance of these proteins would decrease and anthesis would be slow and uncoordinated across the capitulum disk. A similar mechanism has been shown to underlie the circadian and photoperiodic control of hypocotyl elongation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunihiro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nozue et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that local signals may also contribute to the coordination of floret anthesis across the capitulum disk. We found that imposition of dark treatments during the subjective day delayed anthesis by close to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>), at which point normal rhythmic patterns of anthesis resumed after entrainment to the new light conditions. However, pseudowhorls that developed after these delays contained the same number of florets as those found on plants that did not experience delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that signaling may occur between florets in adjacent pseudowhorls to control the onset of anthesis. This might be a positive cue from post-anthesis florets to promote development of the next pseudowhorl, or a negative cue from pre-anthesis florets to inhibit development of nearby florets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Plants are generally considered diurnal organisms and often have more robust circadian rhythms in constant light than in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Michael et al., 2008</xref>). We were therefore surprised to find robust rhythms of anthesis in conditions of constant temperature and darkness but not constant temperature and light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similar observations have been made in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and in many animals, with circadian rhythms observed in constant darkness but not in constant light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschoff, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sargent et al., 1966</xref>). An interesting question for further study is whether in constant light molecular rhythms are present in sunflower florets but developmental rhythms are masked, or whether the floral circadian clock is arrhythmic in this condition. The very rapid resetting of the different phases of organ growth to new light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests the latter may be true.</p><p>Another interesting question is why florets of different developmental ages undergo coordinated anthesis to generate pseudowhorls. It was reported that the foraging activity of both honeybees and native bees on sunflower heads is positively correlated with the number of florets undergoing anthesis at any given time, and that seed set is strongly correlated with the number of bees foraging on heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeGrandi-Hoffman and Watkins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neff and Simpson, 1990</xref>). In the case of the highly social honeybees, hive members communicate via a dance language to quickly reallocate the numbers of foragers sent to different food sources based on resource availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Visscher and Seeley, 1982</xref>). Plants treated with constant light so that floret anthesis was not coordinated across the capitulum disk were much less attractive to pollinating insects than were control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>), presumably due to the lack of pollen release and/or the uncoordinated development of florets across the capitulum disk. We speculate that both factors have an effect, and that the coordinated release of floral rewards by the hundreds of florets undergoing anthesis within a pseudowhorl each morning may be a mechanism to enhance attractiveness to pollinators and thus promote reproductive success.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HA412 HO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">US Department of Agriculture, US National Plant Germplasm System</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PI 603993</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/search">https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/search</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Raspberry pi cameras and computers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Raspberry Pi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NoIR V2 cameras, 3 Model B computers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">low cost, small computers and cameras used for time-course image capture<break/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wingscapes Timelapse Cam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wingscapes.com">https://www.wingscapes.com</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WCT-00121</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">weatherproof camera used for time-course image capture</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R, base package</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R, tidyverse package</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_019186">SCR_019186</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R, circular package</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circular/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/circular/index.html</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003005">SCR_003005</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioDare2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk">https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sunflower floret development imaging and scoring</title><p>Sunflower seeds of HA412 HO (USDA ID: PI 603993) genotype were planted into small pots of soil (Sunshine Mix #1, Sun Gro Horticulture) and germinated with a plastic lid in a PGV36 growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) at 25°C with 16 hr light (provided by metal halide and incandescent lamps, 300 μmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) and 8 hr darkness per day. Plants were watered with nutrient water containing an N-P-K macronutrient ratio of 2:1:2. Two weeks after sowing, seedlings were transplanted to 2-gallon pots with 1 scoop of Osmocote fertilizer (SMG Brands). Approximately 60 days after sowing, sunflower capitula entering anthesis in their first pseudowhorl were transferred to an PGR15 growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; 200 μmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> provided by metal halide and incandescent lamps) to image floret development under the indicated environmental conditions. Transfer to experimental conditions occurred at ZT 0. Sunflower stalks and capitula were taped to bamboo stakes (to avoid capitulum moving out of the camera frame). Raspberry Pi NoIR V2 cameras were mounted on Raspberry Pi 3 model B computers (Raspberry Pi, Cambridge, UK); cameras were fitted with LEE 87 75×75 mm<sup>2</sup> infrared (IR) filters (Lee Filters, Andover, England). Computers were programmed to take a photo every 15 min. Infrared LEDs (Mouser Electronics, El Cajon, CA, USA) were programmed to flash during image capture so that the capitula were visible in the dark without disrupting plant growth. Sunflowers were imaged immediately upon transfer to experimental conditions, and through anthesis of all florets in the capitulum. The 15 min interval images were analyzed sequentially in a stack on ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). For each image, the ovaries, stamens, and styles were scored for a change in size from the previous image. Ovary growth was seen as corolla tube swelling above the immature capitulum surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). Late-stage anther filament elongation was observed starting from when the corolla tube cracked open to reveal the stamen tube until its full extension above the corolla surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – II, 1G). Late-stage style elongation was observed starting with the visible extrusion of pollen out of the top of the anther tube and ending with the style fully extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> – III, 1G).

Seeds were germinated and grown for 3 weeks in a PGV36 growth chambers (Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) as described above, at which point they were transferred to a field site. Before the start of anthesis plants were transferred to either a PGV36 or a PGR15 growth chamber (Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) for either 2 days for LL|28°C and Control A plants, or 1 week for jet lag and Control B plants. Controls were maintained in chambers with light, temperature, and humidity cycling in coordination with the local average daily forecast for the following week. Constant light plants were maintained at a constant 28°C, with 300 μmol m<sup>–2</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> provided by metal halide and incandescent lamps. Jet lagged plants were entrained to the same conditions as the control plants but with a 3 hr phase delay. Plants were transferred to the field just before anthesis of the second or third pseudowhorl, just after dawn in the case of the constant light experiment and 1 hour before dawn for the jet lag experiment. In the jet lag experiments, florets that had opened on previous days were removed with forceps to limit the pollinator recruitment signals to florets developing on the day of the experiment. Pots were arranged so the capitula faced east and stems were secured to bamboo poles for imaging. Images were taken at 5 min intervals using BirdCam 2.0 cameras (Wingscapes). Pollinator visits were scored using ImageGlass (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imageglass.org/">https://imageglass.org/</ext-link>).

The authors nicely illustrated floral development patterns in domesticated sunflower. In particular, during anthesis, discrete developmental zones, namely pseudowhorls, are established, and hundreds of florets simultaneously undergo maturation in each psudowhorl, which is under the control of the circadian clock. The flower development is temperature-compensated and also involves circadian gating of light/dark response.

The major trait that the authors examined in this paper is the elongation of cells. Several molecular components are known to be involved in cell elongation, such as cell wall modification enzymes and osmotic pressure regulators. It could be interesting whether the diurnal rhythm of floral development in each organ is correlated with the transcript levels of cell wall modification enzymes in the organ.

I have a set of specific recommendations that I hope the authors find useful to improve their study:</p><p>1. Please consider alternative interpretations of the coincidence model, as suggested in the &quot;public review&quot; section of my review.</p><p>2. Plots of the temporal clustering of specific developmental processes are used frequently in the study (e.g. Figure 2B, Figure 3A, etc.).

Please can some further explanation or justification for these ovals be presented within the legends of relevant figures.</p><p>3. In the section from lines 127-152, please set out specifically which mechanisms you consider to be continuous development and which you consider to be discrete developmental processes. This is suggested by the title of the subsection, so it would be helpful to link each paragraph to one of these ideas a little more explicitly (e.g., &quot;Therefore, this subset of developmental processes can be considered continuous….&quot;). I think it could help an unfamiliar reader.</p><p>4. Within lines 156-168, the authors discuss anther filament length. This does not appear to be measured in Figure 2A. Is filament length inferred from anther tube length? This reviewer is not familiar with the botanical detail of flower development, so it would be helpful for readers in a similar position to have a little more explanation of this in this section of the results.</p><p>5. The phase stability of each of the developmental processes under different photoperiods provides strong evidence for circadian regulation. The authors might have missed the opportunity to point that out to readers.</p><p>6. On lines 269-270, the authors state that entrain might occur quickly in the capitula, without any point of reference to other systems. I am not convinced it is any faster than for Arabidopsis, but perhaps a broader comparison could be helpful to back up this claim.</p><p>7. On lines 426-428, the authors discuss their findings in relation to light conditions that permit circadian rhythms. There are examples beyond Neurospora of rhythms that are conditional upon constant darkness (e.g. examples in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, rodents) that are worth mentioning. I tend to agree that this is unusual for plants- though there are some unusual examples (the rhythm of delayed chlorophyll fluorescence in wheat, from Anthony Hall's lab, being one example).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80984.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two critical issues should be addressed.</p><p>(1) Molecular mechanism underlying circadian control of floral development should be proposed.

We draw analogies with Arabidopsis PIF4 and PIF5 transcription factors, which regulate elongation growth of hypocotyls and petioles. Transcription of these factors is regulated by the circadian clock, while their protein stability is regulated by light. A similar mechanism may underlie circadian and light regulation of the elongation of ovaries, anther filaments, and styles in sunflower.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Ecological relevance of the spatiotemporally coordinated floral development should be addressed.

First, we investigated the attractiveness of sunflowers maintained in constant light conditions to pollinating insects. We found that growth in constant light, which disrupts the synchronous development of florets to form pseudowhorls, led to flowers that were much less attractive to pollinators than those grown in normal light/dark cycles. Next, we examined the importance of the timing of anthesis. We found that plants entrained so that anthesis was delayed several hours relative to dawn received significantly fewer insect visits than control plants. Together, these experiments demonstrate that appropriate circadian and environmental regulation of floral development are key to optimize visits by pollinating insects and are thus implicated in male reproductive fitness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study by Marshall et al. demonstrates the role of the circadian clock in spatiotemporal regulation of floral development.

We agree that it is entirely plausible that continuous light masks circadian clock-controlled rhythms in floral organ development; in our view, this is a restatement of the external coincidence model. We argue that in developing sunflowers, a circadian clock-regulated process controls elongation of floret organs. Normal development depends upon a dark period of at least 4.5 hours occurring during the subjective night. In constant light conditions, or early in reentrainment when the dark period occurs during the subjective day, normal development is inhibited. This model is analogous to the photoperiodic control of flowering time in short-day plants, in which light perceived during the subjective night inhibits the floral transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
