(HBV) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00049.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00049.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00049.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Liver diseases related to the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) kill about 1 million people every year, and more than 350 million people around the world are infected with the virus. Some 15 million of these people are also infected with the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is a satellite virus of HBV, and this places them at an even higher risk of liver diseases, including cancer. The viruses are known to enter liver cells by binding to receptors on their surface before being engulfed.</p><p>Both HBV and HDV have outer coats that consist of three kinds of envelope proteins, and a region called the pre-S1 domain in one of them is known to have a central role in the interaction between the viruses and the receptors and, therefore, in infecting the cells. However, the identity of the HBV receptor has remained a mystery. Now Yan et al. have identified this receptor to be sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide. This protein, known as NTCP for short, is normally involved in the circulation of bile acids in the body.</p><p>In addition to humans, only two species are known to be susceptible to infection by human HBV and HDV—chimpanzees and a small mammal known as the treeshrew. Yan et al. started by isolating primary liver cells from treeshrews, and then used a combination of advanced purification and mass spectrometry analysis to show that the NTCP on the surface of the cells interacts with the pre-S1 domain in HBV.</p><p>The authors then performed a series of gene knockdown experiments on liver cells of both human and treeshrew origin: when the gene that codes for NTCP was silenced, HBV infection was greatly reduced. Moreover, they were able to transfect HepG2 cells—which are widely used in research into liver disease, but are not susceptible to HBV and HDV infection—with NTCP from humans and treeshrews to make them susceptible. Similarly, although monkeys are not susceptible to HBV, replacing just five amino acids in monkey NTCP with their human counterparts was enough to make the monkey NTCP a functional receptor for the viruses.</p><p>In the past, basic research into HBV and the development of antiviral therapeutics have both been hindered by the lack of suitable in vitro infection systems and animal models. Now, the work of Yan et al. means that it will be possible to use NTCP-complemented HepG2 cells for challenges as diverse as fundamental studies of basic viral entry/replication mechanisms and large-scale drug screening. It is also possible that HBV and HDV infection might interfere with some of the important physiological functions carried out by NTCP, so the latest work could also be of interest to medical scientists working on other diseases related to these infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

with human hepatitis B virus (HBV) worldwide. Over 350 million people currently are chronically infected and are at high risk for progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, or cancer. More than 50% of liver cancers worldwide are attributed to HBV infection. HBV-related liver diseases remain a major public health problem, causing approximately 1 million deaths per year. Individuals coinfected with HBV and HDV are at greater risk for rapid progression and severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lavanchy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>). Despite its enormous medical and social relevance, progress in HBV research has been impeded by the lack of understanding of HBV entry by which the virus specifically infects human liver cells. HBV is an enveloped virus containing a small genome of 3.2 kb of partially double-stranded DNA encoding four overlapping reading frames. The HBV envelope consists of the small (S), middle (M), and large (L) envelope proteins, which are multiple transmembrane spanners sharing the same C-terminal domain corresponding to the S protein but differing at their N-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heermann et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeger et al., 2007</xref>). HDV is a small satellite RNA virus of HBV carrying all three HBV envelope proteins and can only propagate when coexisting with HBV. The mechanism of viral entry of HDV is believed to be similar to that of HBV, and HDV has been used as a surrogate for studying HBV infection at the entry level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrera et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sureau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>). The L protein and integrity of S protein are critical for HBV and HDV infections. The pre-S1 domain of the L protein is a key determinant for entry of both HBV and HDV and is believed to mediate viral interaction with the cellular receptor(s) on hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gripon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Seyec et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chouteau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchet and Sureau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Duff et al., 2009</xref>). Although a number of HBV receptor candidates have been reported in the past, none has been confirmed to be functional in supporting viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glebe and Urban, 2007</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00049.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developing photoreactive peptide ligands and an antibody for identifying pre-S1 binding partner(s) by zero distance cross-linking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of HBV envelope proteins and N-terminal peptides of pre-S1 domain.

PTHs were incubated with HDV at 16°C for 4 hr and followed by extensive wash; bound virions were quantified by qRT-PCR for virus genome RNA copy, and the data are presented as percentage of virus binding, the binding of WT virus was set as 100%.

Left: PTHs were pre-incubated with peptides at indicated concentrations at 37°C for 1 hr and then inoculated with HDV virus. Viral infection was examined by measuring viral RNA in infected cells with qRT-PCR 6 days post-infection (dpi). Data are presented as percentage HDV infection. Right: peptides at indicated concentrations were added to PTHs before HBV inoculation. The cell culture medium was replenished every 2 days. Secreted viral antigen HBeAg was measured by ELISA on 6 dpi, and the data are presented as percentage of that in the absence of peptides. (<bold>E</bold>) Antibody 2D3 recognizes residues 19–33 of pre-S1. Peptide NC36 (aa 4–36 of pre-S1, NLSVPNPLGFFPDHQLDPAFGANSNNPDWDFNP) conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was the immunogen peptide for generating mouse mAb 2D3. Binding activity of 2D3 with full-length pre-S1 protein was measured by ELISA in the presence of competition peptides at indicated concentrations.

Leu<sub>11</sub> is 100% conserved among HBV genotypes, and the 14th residue is a phenylalanine in most genotypes but a leucine in some HBV strains of genotypes F and G.

AAV8-HBV is a recombinant adenovirus-associated virus containing a 1.05× overlength HBV genome, for which viral entry is mediated by AAV8 capsid instead of HBV envelope proteins. AAV8-HBV infection of PTHs can nevertheless transduce the HBV genome into cells and lead to subsequent HBV viral antigen expression. NTCP knockdown did not affect AAV8-HBV infection in PTHs, as shown by the kinetics of HBeAg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lower-right). This result shows that NTCP has no effect on post-entry steps of HBV infection.</p><p>We next examined the effect of silencing human NTCP on HBV and HDV infections in human hepatocytes. Human hepatoma cell line HepaRG is the only cell line known to date to be susceptible to HBV and HDV infections upon differentiation into a mixture of hepatocyte-like and biliary-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gripon et al., 2002</xref>). HepaRG differentiation requires a lengthy cell culture procedure, including maintaining undifferentiated cells for 2 weeks before induction, followed by induction with corticoids and DMSO for another 2–4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gripon et al., 2002</xref>). The NTCP mRNA level was low in HepaRG cells before induction when examined on days 5 and 10 after initial plating, but increased dramatically when the cells differentiated after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper-left). To examine if the acquired hNTCP expression on differentiated HepaRG cells is required for HDV and HBV infections, the cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting hNTCP. About 70% HDV infection was reduced by hNTCP knockdown as indicated by decreased levels of HDV viral RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, upper-right). Similarly, HBV infection was also inhibited as indicated by significantly reduced HBeAg at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower-left), as well as viral RNAs including the 3.5 kb RNA for HBV pre-C and pregenome RNA (pgRNA) and HBV total RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower-right) quantified at the end of the experiment. We further validated the critical role of hNTCP on HBV infection in PHHs, the natural host of the virus. Consistently, knockdown of hNTCP significantly reduced HBV infection, which was correlated with the NTCP mRNA knockdown efficiency. Both viral antigens and viral RNAs were decreased in cells transfected with hNTCP-specific siRNAs but not with the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate NTCP as a common key cellular receptor component necessary for HBV and HDV infections of hepatocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NTCP expression renders nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to HDV and HBV infections</title><p>We then investigated the ability of NTCP to render nonsusceptible cells susceptible to viral infection. NTCP mRNA expression is low in human hepatocarcinoma cell lines that are not susceptible to HBV or HDV infection. The levels of NTCP mRNA in Huh-7 and HepG2 cells were about 10,000 times lower than that in primary human and <italic>Tupaia</italic> hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We first examined if NTCP expression renders Huh-7 susceptible to HDV infection. Human NTCP-transfected Huh-7 cells supported HDV infection with an efficiency comparable to that of PTHs; nearly 10% of cells were infected as shown by staining of the HDV delta antigen that mainly locates in cell nuclei, whereas Huh-7 cells transfected with a vector plasmid allowed no HDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, the infection could be blocked by known HBV entry inhibitors, such as pre-S1 lipopeptide and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), demonstrating a genuine infection of HDV mediated by HBV envelope proteins on these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). HDV RNAs, including antigenomic RNA that is only produced during HDV replication, rapidly increased over time in the infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, the infection efficiency correlated with both the inoculation dose of HDV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and the expression level of hNTCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). HDV also infected HepG2 cells transiently transfected with hNTCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as a cell line established by G418 selection of HepG2 cells after hNTCP transfection, which expresses hNTCP stably and could be readily stained by the FITC-pre-S1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00049.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>NTCP expression confers Huh-7 susceptibility to HDV infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NTCP mRNA expression level in the indicated cell lines and primary hepatocytes.

HepG2 cells transiently transfected with either tsNTCP- or hNTCP-supported HBV infection as evidenced by continuous secretion of HBeAg over time and accumulation of HBV replicative intermediate viral RNAs in the infected cells. The entry inhibitor Myr-59 blocked the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). More efficient HBV infection was achieved on stable HepG2-hNTCP cells with about 5–10% of the cells being infected as revealed by intracellular staining of HBsAg, whereas there was no HBV infection in the parental HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). HBV infection in the HepG2-hNTCP stable cells was further evidenced by the continuously increased production of HBeAg during the testing period. HBV entry inhibitors, in particular the Myr-59 peptide and 17B9, efficiently inhibited the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The infection efficiency as evidenced by HBV total and 3.5 kb RNA levels correlated with the inoculation dose. Moreover, the formation of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is a replicative intermediate and transcriptional template for production of viral RNAs, was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To further demonstrate that the replicative intermediates of HBV were synthesized de novo in HepG2-hNTCP cells after infection, we performed additional time course experiments. HBV viral replicative intermediates, including cccDNA, the 3.5 kb HBV RNA, as well as the total HBV RNA in the HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP cells were quantified at different time points. The cccDNA became detectable at 24 hr post-infection. It markedly increased at day 3 post-infection and maintained a relatively stable level for the rest of the time points examined, whereas the formation of HBV cccDNA was completely abolished if entry inhibitor Myr-59 was included with the initial virus inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Consistently, HBV RNA levels of the 3.5 kb transcript and the total HBV transcripts in the infected HepG2-hNTCP cells gradually increased during first several days of infection and reached a steady level after day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

As shown by intracellular staining of HBV core antigen (HBcAg) on day 8 post-infection, about 10% HepG2-NTCP cells were infected at multiplicities of genome equivalents (mge) of 100, which is comparable to the efficiency of HBV infection of PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to PHHs, HepG2-NTCP cells propagate in cultures, thus the actual infection efficiency of HepG2-NTCP cells may be more likely than not underestimated by the observed end-point HBcAg staining. We also compared the levels of secreted HBeAg and intracellular viral RNAs in these two types of cells infected with three inoculation doses. The level of secreted HBeAg from HepG2-NTCP appeared to be higher than that in PHHs from two donors, whereas the levels of viral RNAs per nanogram of total cell RNA in both infected cell types are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This may be partially explained by their different abilities in propagation and supporting viral replication and protein expression that would require more detailed studies.</p><p>Efficient HBV infection of PHHs or HepaRG cells in vitro normally requires high dose of virus inoculums, and only limited progeny viruses are produced after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gripon et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gripon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehm et al., 2005</xref>). To assess viral particles released from HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells, we first quantified viral DNA in the medium collected at different time points after the infection. As indicated by drastic decline of viral DNA level on day 4 post-infection, the majority of residual viruses from inocula were removed by changing the medium and washing during the first few days of infection. The levels of viral DNA in the media resulted from the ongoing infection during days 4–13 post-infection were low (equivalent to ∼1% of input viral DNA copies) despite significant amount of HBeAg secretion during this period. Similarly, only low levels of viral DNA were detected in the medium from HBV-infected PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>, right). It is reasonable to speculate that some host factors that are lacking in cell cultures might be needed for efficient viral particles formation or releasing; or some cellular factors in cultures may hinder these processes during infection. The culture medium collected from infected HepG2-NTCP cells was subsequently tested for infection of PHHs. In line with the low HBV viral DNA level in the medium inoculum, very low number of intracellular HBV total RNA copies were detected in PHHs on day 13 post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), indicating that only very limited HBV infection might have occurred, which may be attributed to the low multiplicity of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Residues 157 to 165 of hNTCP are critical for pre-S1 binding and viral infections</title><p>We finally investigated the molecular determinants of NTCP for HBV and HDV infections. Crab-eating monkey (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) NTCP (mkNTCP) shares high protein sequence identity with hNTCP (96.3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, mkNTCP neither supports HDV infection nor pre-S1 peptide (Myr-59) binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the known narrow species specificity of the virus. We then made a series of human NTCP variants to cover all the different amino acids between hNTCP and mkNTCP. In each variant, two or a few residues were mutated to their mkNTCP counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas most mutations did not significantly interfere with Myr-59 binding or HDV infection, alteration of five residues of hNTCP between aa 157–165 and its monkey counterpart (from <underline>KG</underline>I<underline>VI</underline>SLV<underline>L</underline> to <underline>GR</underline>I<underline>IL</underline>SLV<underline>P</underline>, distinct residues are underlined) completely abolished Myr-59 binding and the ability to support HDV infection. Remarkably, replacing the motif of aa 167–156 in mkNTCP with the corresponding human residues converted mkNTCP to an efficient receptor for HDV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). All the NTCP variants tested were examined for NTCP expression, and comparable levels of cell surface expression were confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similar to HDV, HBV infection was also abolished on HepG2 cells expressing hNTCP carrying monkey-like mutations, <underline>GR</underline>I<underline>IL</underline>SLV<underline>P</underline>, while mkNTCP-bearing human residues <underline>KG</underline>I<underline>VI</underline>SLV<underline>L</underline> within the motif of aa 157–165 largely restored HBV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

By performing a series of virological analyses, we showed that silencing NTCP expression markedly inhibited viral infection of HBV and HDV in <italic>Tupaia</italic> as well as human hepatocytes. Exogenous expression of NTCP rendered nonsusceptible human hepatoma cells susceptible to the viral infections. The authentic viral infections in cells complemented with NTCP were shown by the kinetic analyses of several markers of viral infections, in particular the quantification of newly synthesized viral replicative intermediates. Moreover, the NTCP-rendered infections were blocked by known entry inhibitors. NTCP residues 157 to 165 were identified to be critical for pre-S1 binding and viral infections. These data clearly demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV.</p><p>Identification of cellular receptor(s) of HBV and HDV has been challenging. In our study, we utilized a short peptide ligand, WT<sub>b</sub>, which was originated from the known receptor-binding domain of the L protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glebe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gripon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engelke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulze et al., 2010</xref>), but with specially designed properties suitable for photo-cross-linking and tandem purification. Two photo-leucines were incorporated into the critical receptor-binding region of WT<sub>b</sub> without interfering with its receptor-binding activity, which allowed highly specific zero distance cross-linking of its direct binding partner(s) but not other neighboring molecules. A biotin moiety of WT<sub>b</sub> facilitated purification of the complex of WT<sub>b</sub> and its binding partner(s) by streptavidin beads. An mAb, 2D3, was developed to recognize WT<sub>b</sub> on an epitope outside the receptor-binding site, serving as a highly specific tool for detection as well as additional affinity purification of the complex. Thus, the binding partner(s) was first cross-linked by WT<sub>b</sub>, and then purified by using streptavidin and 2D3 beads in tandem. The covalent interaction between the WT<sub>b</sub> ligand and its partner(s) enabled a purification process under high-stringency conditions, and efficient isolation was achieved irrespective of the nature of the binding partner(s) even if it is a membrane protein(s) with multiple transmembrane domains, like NTCP identified here.</p><p>NTCP (<italic>Slc10a1</italic>) is the founding member of the SLC10 family of solute carrier proteins. It is a hepatic Na<sup>+</sup> bile acid symporter and is responsible for cotransportation of sodium and bile acids across cellular membranes to maintain the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagenbuch and Meier, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stieger, 2011</xref>). NTCP is a multiple transmembrane glycoprotein presumed to span the cellular membrane up to 10 times with small extracellular loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mareninova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). It is mainly expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stieger, 2011</xref>), consistent with the liver tropism of HBV and HDV. NTCP localizes to the sinusoidal (basolateral) plasma membrane of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stieger et al., 1994</xref>), a location that fits well with its receptor role for blood-borne HBV and HDV. Whereas HBV first attaches to hepatocytes mainly through heparan sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schulze et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leistner et al., 2008</xref>), our data demonstrate that the interaction between NTCP and L protein of HBV is highly specific, and NTCP is crucial for productive viral entry of hepatocytes. Consistent with previous reports on primary cultures of rat hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rippin et al., 2001</xref>), NTCP expression rapidly decreased over time in cultured PTHs after isolation. This may at least partially explain the observations that primary hepatocytes typically remain susceptible to HBV infections in vitro for only a few days after isolation from liver tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gripon et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seeger et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>NTCP is functionally conserved in mammalians, but protein sequences of NTCP vary among species, which is likely to contribute to the narrow species tropism of viral infection. Strikingly, despite the high level of protein sequence homology between human and monkey NTCP, the later did not support HBV and HDV infection. Replacing a small motif of aa 157–165 of mkNTCP with the corresponding hNTCP residues converted mkNTCP to a receptor for pre-S1 binding as well as HDV and HBV infection. Further studies are warranted to determine if and how NTCP contributes to the species specificity of HDV and HBV infection in other species. It also remains to be determined if other molecule(s) additional to NTCP contributes to the cellular entry of HBV and/or HDV as a coreceptor(s) or receptor component(s), and if other host factors such as the microenvironment or architecture of hepatocytes in liver, or soluble blood components like those that have been shown to involve in infections of other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shayakhmetov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morizono et al., 2011</xref>), contribute to HBV and/or HDV infection.</p><p>Expression and subcellular distribution of NTCP are precisely regulated under physiological conditions. NTCP accounts for most, if not all, hepatic Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent bile acid transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stieger, 2011</xref>). NTCP expression is low and inversely correlated with the degree of dedifferentiation of cancer cells in human hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kullak-Ublick et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zollner et al., 2005</xref>) and the severity of HBV-related liver cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Kim, 2007</xref>). The newly discovered role of NTCP as an entry receptor for HBV and HDV raises interesting questions regarding its involvement in viral pathogenesis. Identification of NTCP as a functional receptor for HBV and HDV advances our understanding of their entry into host cells and may lead to new prevention and treatment strategies against these viruses and related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation and culture of primary <italic>Tupaia</italic> hepatocytes (PTHs)</title><p>Adult tree shrews (<italic>Tupaia belangeri chinensis</italic>) were housed in a <italic>Tupaia</italic> animal facility at the National Institute of Biological Science, Beijing.

Viral DNAs other than cccDNA, including single-stranded and relaxed circular DNAs, were degraded prior to amplification by treatment of the DNA templates with plasmid-safe adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent deoxyribonuclease DNase (Epicentre Technologies). In brief, HBV-infected cells were lysed for 4 hr at 65°C in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% SDS) supplemented with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) and followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. A total of 250 ng of the extracted DNA was digested with 5–10 units plasmid-safe DNase in a 50 μl volume for 8 hr at 37°C followed by DNase inactivation at 70°C for 30 min. 2 μl of the 50 μl reaction was then added to 20 μl of a real-time PCR reaction. Amplification of 735 bp cccDNA product was conducted by denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, 62°C annealing for 25 s, and 72°C elongation for 45 s. HBV cccDNA copy numbers were calculated with a standard curve from plasmid with known nucleic acid quantities. The detection limit for cccDNA is ∼10 copies cccDNA per reaction (equivalent to 10 ng of total cell lysate DNA). Real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq kit on an ABI Fast 7500 real-time system instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>PTH cDNA library construction, deep sequencing of <italic>Tupaia</italic> transcriptome, and bioinformatics analysis of Illumina deep sequencing-determined transcriptome</title><p>Primary <italic>Tupaia</italic> hepatocytes were isolated as described above. PTH mRNA was purified from 10 μg of total RNA using Oligo-dT magnetic beads. The mRNA was fragmented into small pieces by incubation with divalent cations at 94°C for exactly 5 min. The first strand cDNA was synthesized using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with fragmented mRNAs. RNA template was then removed by RNase H, and double-stranded cDNA was prepared with DNA polymerase I. cDNA with blunt ends was created by T4 DNA polymerase and Klenow DNA polymerase and an ‘A’ base was subsequently added to the 3′ end of the blunt phosphorylated DNA fragments by Klenow fragment (3′ to 5′ exo minus). The cDNA was then ligated with adapters and then ran on a 2% agarose gel. The fragments with a size range from 200 ± 25 bp were purified, followed by amplification using the manufacturer's primers. The PCR products were then purified using QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen), quantified and diluted for cluster generation and deep sequencing. The 72-cycle pair-end sequencing was performed with Sequencing Kits (Version 5) on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina, San Diego, United States).

L-photo-leucine contains a photoactivatable diazirine ring, irradiation of UV light at 365 nm induces a loss of nitrogen of the diazirine ring, and yields a reactive carbene group with short half-life for covalent cross-linking at nearly zero distance. For tandem purification, WT<sub>b</sub> or N9K<sub>b</sub> at indicated concentrations was applied to ∼1 × 10<sup>7</sup> hepatocytes plated on collagen-coated dishes. Cells were cross-linked by UV irradiation and then washed to remove residual free peptides and subsequently lysed with 1 ml radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA, pH 7.4) buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).

The evidence in support of this conclusion includes: a) RNAi of NTCP in the virus-susceptible PTH and PHH cells reduced the virus infection; b) expression of NTCP in HBV non-permissive cell lines render these cells sensitive to HBV and HDV infections; c) swapping experiments showed that grafting of just 9 amino acids of human NTCP into monkey NTCP converts the monkey protein into a functional HBV/HDV receptor; d) The permissiveness of various cell lines to HBV/HDV infection correlates very well with the expression levels of NTCP; e) cross-linking experiments suggest that NTCP binds to the pre-S1 domain of the L envelope protein. The discovery of NTCP as the long-sought receptor for HBV and HDV is a major advance in the field and will have a large impact on both basic and clinical research in viral hepatitis.</p><p>This paper may be improved by addressing the following points:</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the viruses released from Huh7-NTCP or HepG2-NTCP could infect primary human hepatocytes (PHH).

If so, what's the infectious titer</italic>?</p><p>To address this question, we performed new experiments. We found inoculation of primary human hepatocytes with the culture medium collected from HBV infected NTCP-expressing HepG2 cells only led to very limited infection on PHHs. This very low level of 2<sup>nd</sup> round infection was likely due to limited viral particles released from infected HepG2-NTCP cells. Indeed, only small amount of viral DNA was detected in the culture medium from the infected cells up to 13 days post primary infection. This is similar to HBV infection of PHHs. It has been known that HBV virion release from infected primary hepatocytes in culture is inefficient [1,2], only a level of less than 1% input virions could be detected in the culture medium at the maximum of HBV replication on PHH [2]. In our own experiments, the viral DNA level in culture medium is comparable between infected PHH and HepG2-NTCP cells: in both cultures, a level equivalent to ∼1% of input viral genome copies was detected. We included these data in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that some host factors that are lacking in cell cultures <italic>in vitro</italic> might be needed for efficient viral particles formation or releasing; or some cellular factors in these cultures may hinder these processes during infection. Further studies are required to understand how the interactions between host cells and HBV viruses control the multiple steps of viral propagation and spreading after primary viral entry. The description for the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> was added in the Results section.</p><p><italic>2) Only 5–10% of stable HepG2-hNTCP cells were infected with HBV. How does this compare to primary human hepatocytes? An explanation for this low infection efficiency should be provided</italic>.</p><p>To compare the efficiency of HBV infection on HepG2-hNTCP cells and PHHs, we performed side-by-side experimental tests in which HepG2-hNTCP and PHHs from two independent donors were inoculated with same doses of HBV viruses, respectively. The results are shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, with text added in the Results section. By staining intracellular HBV core antigen (HBcAg) on day 8 post infection (dpi 8), we estimated that about 10% of HepG2-hNTCP cells were infected at multiplicity of genome equivalents (mge) 100. For the two PHHs, the infection efficiency was up to ∼5% and ∼10%, respectively. HepG2-NTCP cells but not PHHs propagate in cultures, thus the actual infection efficiency of HepG2-hNTCP cells may be underestimated by the observed infection using HBcAg staining at the endpoint of infection. Nevertheless, the infection efficiency in HepG2-NTCP cells is comparable to PHHs of good quality at the same infection dose under the conditions tested. It has been reported that up to 5% of PHHs could be infected <italic>in vitro</italic> at ∼80 mge [3], more efficient infection on primary hepatocytes required HBV of thousands mge [3,4]. This is in contrast to the <italic>in vivo</italic> infection of HBV in chimpanzees, for which much lower HBV mge is sufficient [5]. It is possible that the microenvironment and architecture of hepatocytes in liver or other host factors, such as soluble ones in blood or other co-receptor/entry components that are lacking or lost in cultures, may also contribute to the efficiency of HBV infection.</p><p><bold>References:</bold></p><p>1 Gripon, P. et al.
