The opposing ends of these cylindrical polymers exhibit distinct properties, with the plus end growing and shrinking stochastically. MTs establish the polarity of cells and serve as tracks for positioning and trafficking intracellular components. They could also form complex machineries. One example is the mitotic apparatus enabling accurate segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. These actions require harnessing MT dynamic instability and the involvement of a wide array of accessory proteins and various post-translational modifications (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Song and Brady, 2015</xref>). Not surprisingly, MTs are the target of natural toxins, such as Taxol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weaver, 2014</xref>), and a number of herbicides (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>). Notably, biotic and abiotic stresses alter plant MTs, while Taxol exacerbates stress-induced maldevelopment of seedlings (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oda, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepler, 2016</xref>). Yet the mechanisms underlying stress-induced changes of MTs and the broad implications remain elusive.</p><p><italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> is uniquely suited for addressing these issues. The unicellular fresh water green alga has signature features of both animal and plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merchant et al., 2007</xref>). Like animal cells, it has motile flagella that contain stable MT bundles. Like typical plant cells, the alga is equipped with vacuoles, chloroplast, and dynamic cortical MTs that serve as tracks for the delivery of the enzymes which synthesize the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paredez et al., 2006</xref>). Curiously, its MT system appears susceptible to environmental changes. Its flagella sever readily when the aqueous environment changes suddenly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lefebvre et al., 1978</xref>); reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Quarmby, 2009</xref>). The best characterized stimulus is pH shock. Organic acid, such as acetic acid (HA) diffuses across the plasma membrane and then becomes ionized. The resulting acidification in the cytosol triggers nearly simultaneous influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which signals flagella amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quarmby, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hilton et al., 2016</xref>). Cortical MTs become fewer and shorter, detected by immunofluorescence and biochemistry 5 min after pH shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While live cell imaging will be ideal for revealing these acid-induced responses with higher spatial and temporal resolution, autofluorescence from photosynthetic pigments in chloroplast obscures commonly used fluorescent reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rasala et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, we succeeded in revealing dynamic cortical MTs by taking advantage of the new fluorescent protein, NeonGreen (NG) that is 2.7 X brighter than EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>), and the relative abundant plus end-binding protein, EB1, as the NG carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>EB1 plays central roles in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Su et al., 1995</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar and Wittmann, 2012</xref>). Its N-terminal domain preferentially binds to the lattice among tubulins at the plus end of MTs, whereas its C-terminal domain can associate with a wide array of proteins. The two domains operate in concert to accelerate MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vitre et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>) and recruit various+ TIP effector proteins that function at the plus end. In live cell imaging, fluorescent EB1 exhibits a comet pattern seemingly leading the plus end of nascent growing MTs, where tubulins transition from the GTP state to the GDP state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zanic et al., 2009</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gardner et al., 2013</xref>). As such fluorescent EB1 has been commonly used to report newly generated growing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piehl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matov et al., 2010</xref>). However, binding to the GDP zone increases in a number of scenarios (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tirnauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldspink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tortosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sayas and Ávila, 2014</xref>). What causes the switch remains uncertain.</p><p>Using EB1-NG as a reporter, we captured in real time unexpected changes in EB1-NG patterns and MT dynamics signaled through H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. The remarkable sensitivity and the distinct responses in wild type (WT) cells and mutants shed critical insight on the divergence of the MT system, pH regulated processes and the vulnerability of organisms subjected to environmental stresses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EB1-NG reports remarkable sensitivity of the MT system in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic></title><p>Flagellated <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells in interphase contain two mature basal bodies (BBs) and two probasal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, top panel) that are templated on mature BBs. Each of mature BBs that are derived from centrioles following cell division nucleates the assembly of the axoneme, a MT-based scaffold that drives the rhythmic beating of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dutcher and O'Toole, 2016</xref>). Four rootlet MT bundles (thick lines) arrange in a cruciate pattern positioning BBs at the apical end and the other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mittelmeier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Picariello et al., 2014</xref>). These MT bundles consisting of more than two acetylated stable MTs. In contrast, cortical MTs (thin lines) are singular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horst et al., 1999</xref>) and highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). Under widefield fluorescence microscopy EB1-NG expressed at the level of endogenous EB1 from a genomic construct does not reveal stable MTs except the flagellar tip where plus ends of axonemal MTs undergo turnover continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, plus ends of growing cortical MTs appear like the typical comets observed in other eukaryotic cells. Comets emerged from four spots underneath flagella, corresponding to BBs (bottom panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>). As shown from the top, side and rear views of cells, comets of nascent cortical MTs travel along the contour of the cell body toward the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, white arrowhead; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Near the pole comets vanish presumably when MTs stop growing or switch to the shrinking phase. The pattern appears similar in cells resuspended in the commonly used Tris Acetate Phosphate (TAP) culture medium or 10 mM HEPES buffer (containing 5 mM Na<sup>+</sup>).</p><p>The birth of new comets from BBs appeared stochastic. We did not measure the birth rates, hindered by substantial fluctuations and the narrow apical area. Instead we analyzed comet length and speed from the side view. Line scans along the lengths of comets show the typical feature of EB1 comets - the brightest spot corresponds to the area where tubulins are primarily at the transitional state, slightly behind the leading edge of plus ends with GTP-tubulins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The distribution of comet speeds shows that MT growth rates varies nearly two folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The dataset from cells in the TAP medium (black bars) skews toward the slow end relative to the Na<sup>+</sup>/HEPES dataset (hatched bars). The average velocities are signifantly different (Mann-Whitney U test, p&lt;0.001), at 5.8 ± 0.26 and 7.9 ± 0.42 μm/sec respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which are within the normal range measured in diverse eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Curiously, in some long recordings, comets suddenly gave way to a bird cage-like pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f1</xref>, top panel; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref> ) as if all cortical MTs were revealed by anti-tubulin immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dymek et al., 2006</xref>). Comets returned automatically after ~1 min (middle and bottom panels). This unpredictability suggests that this pattern is caused by fluctuated intracellular conditions. When cells gradually flattened by the coverslip, MTs also became visible as a broken bird cage with comets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f2</xref>, top panel, t1; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). However, comets disappeared after ~100 s (bottom panel, t2). Interestingly, after a 30 s dark period, comets returned upon excitation light was switched back (t3). Simply alternating the dark and light period replicated the disappearance and return of comets (t4 and t5). These observations demonstrate that <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> MT system is sensitive to certain signals; and suggests that excitation illumination creates a condition that is unfavorable for MT dynamics, but is reversed in the dark. As illumination opens channelrhodopsins that conduct a number of cations and Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nagel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2003</xref>); reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hegemann and Berthold, 2009</xref>), we hypothesize that changes of electrolyte concentrations modulate the MT system in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. We test this on WT cells and mutant cells with more stable MTs under a number of treatments. Considering the light sensitivity, EB1-NG was imaged with wide field microscopy using minimal light intensity.

Recording started after 100 mM HA was injected into the opposite side and cells stopped flowing. This design that decelerated the acidification process captured the events as HA diffused across the field and into cells that were being recorded. However, the precise exposure time was uncertain; HA concentrations increased gradually, deflagellation was less effective; and not all cells were acidified to the same degree at the same time.

After wash with 10 mM pH7 HEPES, comets re-appeared at the BB area within ~45 s and MT dynamics resumed (b3-b5). Thus, HA exposure elicits the disappearance of EB patterns either by perturbing EB-MT interplays or causing cortical MTs to pause or disassemble. New dynamic MTs re-form rapidly after HA is washed away.</p><p>Diffusion chambers in which the acidification process occurred gradually allowed us to capture another unexpected phenomenon before comets vanish. A broken bird cage pattern with a few MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, left and middle panel, black arrowhead) and comets (white arrowheads) appeared before the disappearance at a time designated as 78 s (right panel). To decipher the disappearance, we analyzed digitally enhanced recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, top panels). As shown in two representative cells, overall EB1 signals were fading with time, which could be due to photobleaching, pH sensitivity of fluorescent proteins, disassociation of EB1 or system-wide MT disassembly. Some MTs clearly underwent endwise resorption (arrowheads). Kymographs tracking plus ends of prominent MTs in two rare still cells show that, as expected, comets disappear before the resorption of the respective MT. Measurements of the slopes show that the initial shortening speeds for these two events are 8 and 13 μm/min but decelerate toward the BB area. These speeds revealed by EB1-NG are in line with the averaged 10 ± 3 μm/min shortening speed of cortical MTs in cultured tobacco cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixit and Cyr, 2004</xref>), faster than kinesin-13 catalyzed shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>), and slower than the maximal shortening speed (30 μm/min) of MTs assembled from purified tubulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Brien et al., 1997</xref>). Statistics of shortening speed was not analyzed because of few motionless cells and few shortening MTs with a definitive plus end. Tubulin reporters will be more appropriate for shortening analysis.</p><p>As for cells with EB1 signals detected in the cell body and flagella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) simultaneously, comets (white arrowheads in left panel) vanished first (middle panel) before flagella (arrow) were amputated (right panel). EB1 signals remained at the BB area but were static (black arrowhead). Contrary to deflagellation within seconds upon HA perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>), the deflagellation in the diffusion chamber takes more than one minute due to gradual acidification. Thus, when cells are exposed to HA, shank binding increases, comets disappear, endwise resorption becomes evident and then flagella become amputated. These events do not require the contents unique to TAP media. Flagellar regeneration was not assessed because both chambers were not suitable for the long regeneration process. The sequential events occurring in the diffusion chamber are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>.</p><p>Lowering intracellular pH elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevents MT formation and promotes MT disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Weisenberg, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Brien et al., 1997</xref>). To differentiate whether HA-induced changes are due to H<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we first raised [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> without adding HA. Calcium ionophore A23187 did not trigger deflagellation or evident changes in the MT system in our hands. This is not surprising since A23187 cannot elicit consistent effects in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood and Levin, 1983</xref>). So we simply raised [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>. Perfusions of either HA or CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, leading to deflagellation, although the latter is less efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). WT cells resuspended in 30 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/HEPES appeared agitated, suggesting entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, top panel). However, flagella remained attached (arrows) and comet activity was robust. When cells were resuspended in 75 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>/HEPES solution (right panel), cells shed flagella (arrows). Comets already disappeared, while static EB1 signals remained at the BB area (arrowhead). Thus, the outcomes elicited by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> and ≥ 20 mM HA are similar.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HA-induced phenomena with reduced concentrations and in a tubulin mutant</title><p>To dissect HA-induced phenomena, we treated WT cells with less concentrated HA. As shown in two top view images taken 40 s apart immediately after resuspension in 5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), all WT cells had motile flagella and had a dynamic, rather than still, bird cage pattern in which MTs shrink or grow with a comet, as if the entire MT system were revealed by fluorescent tubulins and fluorescent EB1 simultaneously. The side view images recorded 22 secs apart revealed endwise resorption of a shrinking MT (arrowhead). Only a few resorbing MTs were captured in cells resuspended in 7.5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, right panel). This still cell allows us to plot the kymograph, which shows a tapered endwise resorption with the initial shortening speed of 4 mm/min. All MT patterns and comets disappeared in cells resuspended in 10 mM HA. Therefore, low [HA] increases EB1 shank-binding, rendering the bird-cage pattern. As HA concentrations increase, MTs stop growing and comets are lost. As resorption continues, perhaps even at a hastening pace, comet and bird cage patterns vanish. The 5 mM HA experiment partially replicates the light-induced sporadic transient appearance of the bird cage pattern in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, f1).

Chelation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by pretreatment of cells with buffered 10 mM EGTA did not hinder these changes, whereas pH3, 10 mM HCl did not elicit any responses.

To exacerbate electrolyte imbalance, we extended HA exposure, assuming that accumulated H<sup>+</sup> ions from a lengthy exposure would be replaced with other cations. As expected, EB1 patterns were absent except for the static signal at the BB area in cells resuspending in pH3, 10 mM HA/double distilled water (ddw) for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, left panel). After wash with Na<sup>+</sup>/HEPES in a perfusion chamber, dynamic EB1 signals emerged at the BB area after ~50 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, cell I in right panel). Interestingly, nascent MTs were not adorned with a typical comet. Compared to the bird cage pattern, they appeared thicker, fewer and nearly uniformly decorated, as if plus end tracking EB1 stayed behind growing MTs. In cells recorded at a later period (cell II and III, between 60–159 s; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), MT growth decelerated, especially between 109–159 s. The late events became unclear due to photobleaching from continuous illumination. In the recordings started 180 s after wash, all dynamic processes stopped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, left panel), as illustrated by two nearly identical images taken 20 s apart of two representative cells (cell I and II, right panels). Notably, some static fibers split, or had more than one comet aligned in tandem (arrowheads). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that nascent MTs generated after HA bath and wash are abnormal, perhaps with a propensity to nucleate ectopically, branching or growing on top of the other piggy-backing as bundles. Kymographs comparing three representative MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, top panels) with growing MTs in the untreated control cells (bottom panels) confirm that EB1 signals reach near the BB area in cells recovering from HA bath. MT growth rates, shown by the slopes, fluctuate but are mostly slower than those in untreated control cells. Overall the rates decline until MT growth stops. Thus, compared to the numerous, thin, dim MT fibers in the transient bird cage pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), MTs formed in the recovery phase after HA bath were fewer, thicker, shorter, brighter and long-lived.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26002.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>HA bath and a subsequent wash induced long-lived yet reversible changes to the MT system.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Static EB1 signals remained at BBs after cells were resuspended in 10 mM pH3 HA for 5 min (left panel).

To test this, we resuspended WT cells in 10 mM, pH8 EGTA buffered by NaOH (final ~21 mM Na<sup>+</sup>). Concentrated EGTA and EDTA are classical tools for creating permeable cell models perhaps by Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation or other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miller, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tazawa and Shimmen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikawa and Suzaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Prachayasittikul et al., 2007</xref>). However, EGTA at this concentration does not influence polymerization of MTs from purified tubulins in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olmsted and Borisy, 1975</xref>). As expected, thick EB1-decorated MTs formed after cells were resuspended in Na<sup>+</sup>/EGTA for 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, left panels). Thick MTs appeared static after 10 mins and were cold-resistant. In contrast, cells resuspended in KOH-buffered EGTA had vibrant comet activities (right panels). However, cells quickly burst, indicating the perturbed plasma membrane. Given the effect of Na<sup>+</sup> but not K<sup>+</sup> on the MT cytoskeleton, EGTA solutions used in the other experiments were buffered by KOH.</p><p>To simplify the treatment, we tested several concentrations of NaCl. Compared to the growing MTs with typical comets in control cells resuspended in the HEPES buffer, in HEPES with 55 mM NaCl, MTs were still growing but with longer comets as shown in fluorescent imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> panel I) and modest tapering of comet intensity in the linescan plot (panel II). The distribution of comet velocity (panel III) and the average velocity (panel IV) showed that [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> at this level only slightly reduced MT growth rate (two-tailed p-value=0.0497, &lt;0.05). Therefore, high [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> still could raise [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>, increasing the time EB1 spent at the plus end and thus comet lengths. MT growth is also sensitive to [Na<sup>+</sup>] but less than EB1 plus end binding. For cells resuspended in 150 and 200 mM [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> for 5 min, flagellar motility ceased. In most cells, comets vanished, although static EB1 signals remained at the BB area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), as in 75 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). However, some cells still contain thick fibers (top panel), a signature of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced changes.</p><p>Together, these results show that the MT system undergo a range of changes as a function of [Na<sup>+</sup>]. Frozen thick MTs caused by 21 mM Na+/EGTA or by 5 mM Na<sup>+</sup>/HEPES wash following an HA bath or may be triggered by less than 21 mM [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> respectively due to passive diffusion through the EGTA-permeabilized membrane or by H<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> exchange.

In contrary, few or no EB1-decorated thick MT fibers caused by 150–200 mM [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> or 75 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> suggest that MTs disassemble at the concentrations that deem hypertonic for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Correlations of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced changes in the MT system and cell division</title><p>Salt stress triggers an array of responses in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, including inhibited multiplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Perrineau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Takouridis et al., 2015</xref>). The consequence of Na<sup>+</sup>-induced changes in the MT system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) could be assessed by cell division that requires a dynamic MT system. In typical synchronized liquid cultures, mother cells undergo 1–3 rounds of cell division during the dark period, each forming a sporangium with multiple daughter cells enclosed in the mother cell wall. Daughter cells are released before the light period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kubo et al., 2009</xref>). To test this, aliquots of cell cultures were harvested at 8 PM right before the dark period. After resuspension in fresh media with increasing concentrations of NaCl, all tubes were kept in the dark until the light period. Sporangia and single cells were counted every two hours until 8 AM and at 5 PM. Sporangia ratios were inversely related to NaCl concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The peak period was also delayed for 100 mM samples. No sporangia were observed in 200 mM samples. A repeated experiment for fluorescence imaging confirmed the trend, and showed no comets or EB1-decorated MTs in 200 mM samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). As in 55 mM Na<sup>+</sup>/HEPES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), comets lengthened in 55 and 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup>/TAP, but a linescan plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, left panel) showed that the lengthening degrees appeared similar. Mean comet speeds (right panel), 8.38 ± 0.345 μm/min and 7.79 ± 0.628 μm/min respectively for 55 and 100 mM samples, were not significantly different (two-tailed t test, p=0.385), but faster than 6.41 ± 0.241 μm/min for 0 mM samples (two-tailed t test, p&lt;0.001 for 0 mM and 55 mM samples; Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.05 for 0 mM and 100 mM samples). Thus, absence of comets and decorated MTs is consistent with blocked proliferation of cells exposed to 200 mM NaCl. However, the similar comet lengths and comet speeds for the 55 and 100 mM NaCl group do not correlate with differences in the numbers of dividing cells and the delay. We did not test whether cell division was inhibited when MTs froze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a–b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a–b</xref>), since the effects from HA bath- or EDTA-assisted increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> last only one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) or perturbs the plasma membrane respectively.

Among heightened shank binding, diminished comet activity, paused MT growths, and MT shortening, the bird cage pattern of shank binding is the most sensitive, elicited reliably by 5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The recovery occurs either within a minute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) or protractedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>), depending on the exposure duration and wash solutions. Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not required for the HA-induced changes, since they still occur after K<sup>+</sup>/EGTA treatment. However, we cannot rule out the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from intracellular storages and other signaling pathways.</p><p>Although the pH of [HA]<sub>ex</sub> that triggers these changes is ~3.4, we expect that the resulting intracellular pH is higher than 6.3. Firstly, HA-induced changes in diffusion chambers appear before deflagellation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) that occurs at pH6.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun and Hegemann, 1999</xref>). Secondly, the swiftness and reversibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>) indicate that these changes are not triggered by apoptotic pathways, commonly induced by a drop of 0.3–0.4 unit from normal intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lagadic-Gossmann et al., 2004</xref>), which is 6.8 for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the bird cage pattern could be transiently triggered merely by illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f1</xref>) that may open H<sup>+</sup>-selective channels. Conversely, comets return to compressed cells when illumination is turned off for 30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f2</xref>); or return within ~45 s after HA is washed away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that a slight imbalance of pH homeostasis is sufficient to elicit immediate changes in algal MT system.</p><p>Although pH affects proteins’ ionization and thus their functions and protein-protein interactions in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hepler, 2016</xref>), we speculate that the MT system is particularly sensitive to declining pH because of the acidic isoelectric points of tubulins and EB1. For example, the respective pI of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>α-tubulin, β-tubulin and EB1 is 5.01, 4.82, and 5.7. A decrease of pH from the resting level will make these proteins less negatively charged, especially at their C-terminal acidic tails that are central to MT-accessory protein interplays and the targets of various post-translational modifications (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Song and Brady, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rovini et al., 2013</xref>). The resulting decreased repulsion could explain increased affinity of EB1 to GDP-tubulin, leading to nearly immediate appearance of the bird cage pattern in WT cells exposed to 5 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) or in <italic>tub2</italic> cells exposed to 10 mM HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>). As pH decreases further, additional changes in protein conformation may inhibit the growth of MTs and EB1 binding to plus ends, leading to comet reduction or ultimate disappearance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Changes elicited by Na<sup>+</sup></title><p>The responses elicited by slight increases in [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> are distinct in pattern and pace. Contrary to instant appearance of H<sup>+</sup>-elicited bird cage pattern with fine, individual MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), as Na<sup>+</sup> continues rising, comets lengthen; cortical MTs undergo ectopic nucleation, splitting, bundling, decelerate and stop eventually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The slower pace of low-Na<sup>+</sup>-induced responses are likely due to low Na<sup>+</sup> permeability. The direct switch from lengthening comets to MT resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7b and c</xref>) suggests that NaCl alone cannot raise [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> incrementally.

Similar Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent responses emerge faster following a HA bath – in 45–180 s in various wash solutions containing only 5 mM Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a</xref>), suggesting accelerated rise of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> due to the activity of Na<sup>+</sup>/ H<sup>+</sup> exchangers to remove accumulated H<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pittman et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, by simply relying on limited passive diffusion through the normal plasma membrane, the rise in [Na<sup>+</sup>] may be the most modest in 55–100 mM [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub> that is sufficient to increase comet length but only slows down MT growth rate slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7b and c</xref>). Based on the incremented responses, rather than all-or-none responses to a threshold, we speculate that algal MT system changes as a function of [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>.

This highlights the selective sensitivity of the algal MT system to Na<sup>+</sup> and rules out mere ionic effects.

The similar outcomes caused by distinct ions and obvious shrinkage of the cell body at even higher concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> suggest that hypertonicity is involved.

This mimics the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects in vitro. Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocks MT formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Weisenberg, 1972</xref>), whereas 0.5–0.6 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> - in the absence of MAPs - could increase shortening incidence and accelerate shortening speed of MTs beyond 150 μm/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karr et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Brien et al., 1997</xref>).

For example, kinesin-13 becomes phosphorylated for more than 20 min following pH shock to catalyze MT endwise disassembly to provide tubulins for flagellar regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the heightened enzyme-mediated MT depolymerization maybe occurs primarily after HA is washed away, and cannot be reported by EB1-NG. Similarly, osmotic or salt stresses activate an atypical tubulin-kinase and phospholipase D, triggering disassembly or reorganization of plant MT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhonukshe et al., 2003</xref>). For yeast, sorbitol hypertonicity induces frozen MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robertson and Hagan, 2008</xref>) and the recovery in 38 min involves a stress-induced MAP kinase. Similar paradigms may be responsible for the resumption of MT dynamic in HA-bathed algae that takes ~55 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).</p><p>The electrolyte sensitivity of algal MT system is contrary to the perceived stable MT system in interphase mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lieuvin et al., 1994</xref>) that have 140 mM [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, and 140 mM [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pohl et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, we cannot elicit any obvious changes of EB1-EGFP patterns in mammalian epithelial cells by compression or illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matov et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> promote tubulin polymerization, with 160 mM Na<sup>+</sup> as the optimal condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olmsted and Borisy, 1975</xref>). Different cation sensitivities could be due to sequence divergence.

This study also shows that proliferation is also partially inhibited at 55 and100 mM at least within 24 hr. Although division events are fewer and delayed at 100 mM compared to that at 55 mM, comet lengths and speeds were similar at these two conditions. Perhaps cell division at ~100 mM NaCl is inhibited by additional reactions that may or may not relate to the MT system. Changes occurring below 200 mM may be adapted faster, perhaps simply by metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Husic and Tolbert, 1986</xref>). Intracellular acidification followed by immersions in buffers with merely 5 mM Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) may mimick changes in natural environments.</p><p>Acidity and salinity are key factors affecting the biota. They vary drastically, often seasonally, among freshwater ecosystems, influenced by a combination of climate changes, biogeochemistry, episodic storm surges, snow melts and anthropological activities (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sullivan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herbert et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, pH following a downpour could decrease by one pH unit and to ~4.5 for typical watersheds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feeley et al., 2013</xref>). Dissolved organic carbons, such as permeant HA, are a major contributor to local acidification, reaching up to mM levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monteith et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Porcal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zuo et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, acidification caused by acid rains from air pollution primarily in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sullivan, 2000</xref>) and by the projected increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Raven and Caldeira, 2005</xref>) will also shift the equilibrium toward permeant neutral acids and favor intracellular acidification.</p><p>Salinity-dependent effects on <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) typify the inverse relationship of salinity and species diversity; and the exceptional vulnerability to salinity of microalgae and zooplanktons that are at the bottom of the food chain (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herbert et al., 2015</xref>). The sub- or hypo-saline level of 55 mM Na<sup>+</sup> that perturbs alga’s MT system and cell division is readily exceeded by Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in numerous inland and coastal wetlands throughout the world from intrusion of seawater (~469 mM Na<sup>+</sup>), rising of saline ground water and mining effluent discharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herbert et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, deicing road salt for traffic safety is transforming pristine water bodies in North America, especially urban riverways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corsi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dugan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2017</xref>). For example, Cl<sup>-</sup>, a standard salinity indicator, exceeded 24 mM (860 mg/L), the acute criteria for aquatic life established by United States Environmental Protection Agency, in more than 55% of tested sites at the Milwaukee river basin, a major estuary of the Great Lakes, and was as high as 315 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corsi et al., 2010</xref>). It is of interest to test how current criteria affect algal cell biology acutely and chronically, and whether this could forecast the feasibility of the ultimate goal in restoring natural reproduction of aquatic animals.</p><p>While current concerns about rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> largely center on extracellular acidification and hindered shell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Waldbusser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzer et al., 2016</xref>), this study suggests that the concerns should be extended to intracellular acidification, rising salinity and the MT system. Seemingly harmless rises in salinity in conjunction with chronic mild acidification or a temporary acid surge may poise to threaten the vulnerable unicellular organisms via a perturbed MT system, reshape aqueous landscapes and drive evolution.</p><p>Electrolyte-induced rapid changes in the MT system may be applicable to land plants and even particular mammalian cells. Like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, land plant model systems subjected to salt stress, osmostress, or biotic stresses exhibit growth inhibition, MT bundling and heightened sensitivity to microtubule-stabilizing Taxol (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhonukshe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shoji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hashimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oda, 2015</xref>). The similarity comports with their common cortical MTs and a great homology of the non-flagellar proteins in the MT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dymek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pedersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Merchant et al., 2007</xref>; reviewe by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardiner, 2013</xref>). MT changes induced by various abiotic stresses, including salt, have prompted an interesting proposition that the MT system is an abiotic sensor of plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haswell and Verslues, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">2011b</xref>). However, it remains contentious whether the changes of MTs are instead the consequence of salt stress signaling. The EB1-reported scaled responses that seem proportional to [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> and the speed of manifestations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) in fresh water algae strengthen the possibility that plant MT system is an upstream player in the salinity signaling pathways, if not the very sensor. In line with this, channel-linked MTs are integral to osmolarity signaling transduction in mammalian osmosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prager-Khoutorsky et al., 2014</xref>). Using the experimental strategies developed in this study, it is possible to investigate quantitatively the diverged mechanisms of eukaryotic MT systems in sensing and responding to salt stresses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> strains and culture</title><p>The wild type strain CC-124 and a β-tubulin mutant <italic>tub2-1</italic> (formerly <italic>col<sup>R</sup>4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolduc et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schibler and Huang, 1991</xref>) were from <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> Resource Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chlamycollection.org/">http://www.chlamycollection.org/</ext-link>).

Subsequently, HA/TAP was replaced by a flush of 200 μl TAP. The entire process was recorded in two consecutive live-stream clips. For this long recording duration, excitation light intensity was reduced to 25% with a neutral density filter. For HA pulse in a diffusion chamber, 40 μl cells in 5 mM pH7.4 Na<sup>+</sup>/HEPES was placed at one side of a diffusion chamber underneath a 40X objective lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A live-streaming video was recorded following the injection of 20 μl 100 mM pH2.8 HA through the Vaseline wall to the opposite side of the chamber. For HA bath, a cell pellet from 50 μl liquid culture was resuspended in 50 μl 10 mM pH3 HA. An aliquot of 10 μl cell mixture was placed on a cover slip. The cell-loaded cover slip was inverted to create a perfusion chamber. After a total 5 min exposure to HA, HA was flushed away with an aliquot of 200 μl-indicated fluid and then a video was recorded. To test MT cold lability after recovery from HA bath, a perfusion chamber with treated cells was chilled by ice for 3 min. A video was taken immediately afterwards, ~20 s after the chamber was removed from ice. For assessing Na<sup>+</sup> effects on cell division, right before the onset of the dark cycle at 8 PM, cells pelleted into a 15 ml conical tubes from 30 ml liquid cultures were resuspended with 8 ml TAP media supplemented with NaCl of the concentration as indicated. Triplicates were prepared for each concentration. The tubes were wrapped in aluminum foil and placed horizontally in the dark room. Under a red safelight, a 500 μl aliquot taken from each tube every two hours until 8:00 AM was fixed with 500 μl 4% glutaraldehyde. A final sample was fixed at 5 PM. A 10 μl aliquot of fixed cells was observed under a 40X objective in an Olympus compound microscope. Numbers of single cells and sporangia were counted in randomly selected fields. More than 500 cell particles were counted for each tube and each time point. The entire experiment was repeated for live fluorescent imaging. A 10 μl aliquot from each tube at each time point were recorded with live streaming as described. Each treatment was repeated at least twice in each experiment.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;H<sup>+</sup>- and Na<sup>+</sup>- elicited swift changes of the microtubule system in the biflagellated green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Junmin Pan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper demonstrates, for the first time, in vivo visualization of cytoplasmic microtubule dynamics in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Using a EB1-neon-green fluorescent probe, the authors measure how microtubule dynamics change as a function of changing external ionic conditions.

We learned that fresh water streams, ponds and lakes vary drastically, and often seasonally, in ionic compositions, organic acids (dissolved organic carbons) and pH due to storm surges, biogeochemistry, climate changes and anthropological activities, such as air pollution and road salting. Therefore, data from one waterbody cannot be truly representative. Instead, we discuss how our data are quantitatively relevant to the pressing acidification and salinization of aquatic environments. We believe that such comparisons are appropriate, interesting and important to concerned global citizens.

For example, kinesin-13 becomes phosphorylated for more than 20 min following pH shock to catalyze MT endwise disassembly to provide tubulins for flagellar regeneration (Wang et al., 2013). Thus, the heightened enzyme-mediated MT depolymerization maybe occurs primarily after HA is washed away, and cannot be reported by EB1-NG.
