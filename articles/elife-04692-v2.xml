Malaria is caused by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites, which are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes. When a mosquito bites a human, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva. The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver, infects liver cells and multiplies within those cells without causing any noticeable symptoms. After remaining silent in the liver for weeks or months, the now abundant parasite ruptures the host liver cell, re-enters the bloodstream, and begins infecting red blood cells. If another mosquito bites the infected individual and takes a blood meal, the parasite moves into the mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues.</p><p>There are several species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that are known to cause malaria. The most widely studied species is <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, which also causes one of the deadliest types of malaria. However, another <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species called <italic>P. vivax</italic> is the most widely distributed species and, despite being less virulent than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, is particularly dangerous because it causes recurring malaria.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>P. vivax</italic> has the ability to form hypnozoites: a dormant form of the parasite that can remain inside liver cells for long periods of time, sometimes for years. The reservoir of <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites can regularly populate the bloodstream with the infectious form of the parasite, triggering relapses of malaria. Even if an individual suffering a relapse receives prompt treatment to clear parasites in the blood, more parasites may emerge from the liver and cause new blood-stage infections.</p><p>White et al. developed a mathematical model to help understand how <italic>P. vivax</italic> is transmitted. Unlike many of the established models of malaria transmission, the new model accounts for the reservoir of <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites in the liver, and assumes that hypnozoites in the reservoir either die, or are activated and enter the bloodstream, at a constant rate. This produces patterns that closely match how often relapses occur in patients. White et al. go on to predict that although many infected people have few or no hypnozoites in their liver, some have many hypnozoites, and these people are more likely to suffer from malaria relapses. This suggests that if the initial treatments given to malaria sufferers incorporate additional drugs that kill the hypnozoites in the liver, then it may be possible to substantially reduce the extent of <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04692.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04692.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>vivax</kwd><kwd>relapse</kwd><kwd>mathematical</kwd><kwd>model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Population Health Scientist Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mueller</surname><given-names>Ivo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Karl</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Battle</surname><given-names>Katherine E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>Simon I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mathematical models of the build-up and depletion of the hypnozoite reservoir in the liver can inform the design of treatment strategies for preventing <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> relapse infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The study of the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria has a rich history, with a theoretical foundation based on the Ross-Macdonald models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">malERA Consultative Group on Modeling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reiner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), a class of mathematical models describing the transmission of a pathogen between human and vector hosts. In the case of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the parasite has a reservoir in both the human host and the <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, with transmission occurring when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a human. Ross-Macdonald models have provided insights into the dynamics of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission resulting in valuable guidance for historical and contemporary malaria control programmes, most notably the large reductions in transmission that are achievable if the lifespan of the mosquito is reduced through vector control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macdonald, 1952a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macdonald, 1952b</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the extensive theory of the mathematical epidemiology of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria has been comparatively neglected. This is in spite of <italic>P. vivax</italic> being the geographically most widely distributed species of malaria in the world, causing in the region of 80–300 million clinical episodes every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mueller et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gething et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> models are not applicable to <italic>P. vivax</italic> as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) which give rise to relapsing infections—one of the defining characteristics of the biology and epidemiology of <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mueller et al., 2009a</xref>). In natural transmission settings relapses are often undistinguishable from re-infections from new mosquito bites or recrudescences of existing blood-stage infections. When the origin of renewed parasitemia following primary <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection is unknown, it can be classified as a recurrent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver, but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chamchod and Beier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roy et al., 2013</xref>) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dezoysa et al., 1991</xref>). Relapse patterns and their implications for transmission have also been investigated using statistical distributions for the time to first relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lover et al., 2014</xref>). Here we advance on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of <italic>P. vivax</italic>.</p><p>When a <italic>P. vivax</italic> infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a human, sporozoites are injected into the skin and migrate to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes and develop into either actively dividing schizonts or dormant hypnozoites. The development of actively dividing schizonts may lead to a primary blood-stage infection and potentially clinical malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). Hypnozoites will lie dormant in the liver for weeks to years before activating to initiate new blood-stage infections. The biological mechanisms regulating the activation of hypnozoites remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mueller et al., 2009a</xref>), although a number of triggers for relapses have been proposed, including fever caused by other pathogens such as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanks and White, 2013</xref>) and exposure to <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hulden and Hulden, 2011</xref>).</p><p>There is considerable geographical variation in the timing and frequency of <italic>P. vivax</italic> relapse infections, with strains from tropical areas having an average time to first relapse of 3–6 weeks and long-latency strains from temperate areas relapsing within 6–9 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lover and Coker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle et al., 2014</xref>). Beyond the first relapse, periodic patterns in multiple relapses from a single mosquito bite have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2011</xref>). For example, following a single infection with a tropical strain of <italic>P. vivax</italic> the time until next relapse has been observed to increase with each successive relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berliner et al., 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2011</xref>). In contrast, temperate strains are associated with a long latency period until first relapse (of the order of 6 months) followed by short intervals between successive relapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coatney et al., 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hankey et al., 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2011</xref>). A descriptive epidemiology of <italic>P. vivax</italic> relapses will thus require estimation of three key quantities: (i) the time to first relapse, (ii) the number of relapses per primary infection, and (iii) the duration of hypnozoite carriage.</p><p>In this manuscript, a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate. This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria. We use this model to provide qualitative insights into the relative contribution of relapses to <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission and illustrate the consequences for controlling <italic>P. vivax</italic> with vector control and anti-malarial drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Within-host relapse model</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the best fit within-host relapse model to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of <italic>P. vivax</italic>: South America, South East Asia and Melanesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle et al., 2014</xref>).

This model predicts notable dose-dependency with increased numbers of hypnozoites associated with a greater number of relapses and shorter time to first relapse. Following the long latency to first relapse in temperate strains, the interval between subsequent relapses is considerably shorter. The within-host model assumes that hypnozoites act independently of each other, and hence the time to next relapsing hypnozoite is exponentially distributed. In particular we do not predict periodicity between relapsing hypnozoites (in the absence of external triggers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanks and White, 2013</xref>]). If the simulated data are censored such that relapses occurring within 14 days of a previous relapse remain undetected (due to either prophylaxis by blood-stage anti-malarials or the presence of parasites from an existing infection) then there is an apparent periodicity in detected relapses. The observed periodicity of relapses will be determined by the duration of prophylactic protection and not via the biological mechanisms considered here. The periodicity in detected relapses is most evident for large numbers of hypnozoites with the period being determined by the assumed duration of prophylactic protection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, as has been previously argued, periodicity in relapses could also be attributable to a cycle of fevers initiating hypnozoite activation which in turn cause new blood-stage infections and malaria-associated fevers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White, 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04692.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sample relapse patterns for tropical and temperate strains of <italic>P. vivax</italic>.</title><p>A relapse is assumed to be undetected if it occurs within 14 days of a detected relapse.

The model represents a baseline scenario with constant hypnozoite activation and death in the absence of external triggers. The role of triggers such as fever can be tested for in detail with data on the timing and peak temperatures of episodes of febrile illness.</p></boxed-text><p>A key assumption in the proposed model is the constant activation of hypnozoites. This implies that relapses can occur immediately after primary <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection, in contrast to suggestions that the first relapse does not occur until 2–3 weeks later. The best evidence on early relapses comes from treatment efficacy studies where patients treated for <italic>P. vivax</italic> are followed for recurrent infection for 42 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>). Except in cases with documented chloroquine resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2014</xref>), recurrent infections are rarely observed prior to day 14, however the inclusion of long-lasting anti-malarials in treatment regimens provides prophylaxis during this period making detection of parasites unlikely. In a recent study of the slowly eliminated drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tarning et al. (2014)</xref> tested a model where relapses occur in bursts every 3 weeks, but it arguably provided no better fit to the data than a model of constant hypnozoite activation. Testing the hypothesis of constant activation would require follow up of patients treated with rapidly eliminated artemisinin monotherapy, a challenging proposition given the concerns over artemisinin resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashley et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the model captures the key drivers of the dynamics of <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission, it is a simplified representation subject to a number of limiting assumptions. The potential role of triggers of hypnozoite activation such as febrile illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shanks and White, 2013</xref>) are not accounted for. There is no heterogeneity or seasonality in transmission, and no age structure. Incorporation of the acquisition of natural immunity into the model will be particularly important for settings with high transmission intensity where immunity has a role in regulating blood-stage infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). It is assumed that all individuals infected with blood-stage parasites are capable of transmitting to mosquitoes. Similar to the corresponding <italic>P. falciparum</italic> models, incorporation of these factors would change the quantitative predictions of the model, but not its qualitative behaviour.</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasite prevalence (<italic>Pf</italic>PR and <italic>Pv</italic>PR) are the most widely reported and best validated metrics of malaria transmission from epidemiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gething et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gething et al., 2012</xref>) providing measurements of the proportion of individuals with detectable blood-stage parasites. In settings with similar levels of <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission, the model predicts <italic>Pv</italic>PR to be greater than <italic>Pf</italic>PR due to the additional blood-stage infections arising from relapses. However, this does not agree with empirical observations which find <italic>Pf</italic>PR to be similar to or greater than <italic>Pv</italic>PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Snounou and White, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2009b</xref>). This is most likely explained by the rapid acquisition of immunity to <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koepfli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>) the low detectability of <italic>P.</italic> vivax blood-stage infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris et al., 2010</xref>), and the longer durations of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood-stage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molineaux et al., 2001</xref>) not captured in the model. Furthermore, the additional <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasite reservoir in the liver means that <italic>Pf</italic>PR and <italic>Pv</italic>PR are not directly comparable metrics. Thus if a parasitological survey indicates similar parasite prevalence, a greater control effort will be required to reduce <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission than to reduce <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission because of the additional infections emerging from the hypnozoite reservoir. The model described here allows the proportion of individuals harbouring hypnozoites to be estimated given metrics such as <italic>Pv</italic>PR. The number of hypnozoites per person is predicted to be over-dispersed with some individuals with intensely infected livers and most carrying few or no hypnozoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Estimates of the prevalence and intensity of hypnozoite infection will be dependent on both the uncertainty in the measurable data and the model assumptions.</p><p>Vector control with ITNs or IRS, and treatment with effective anti-malarial drugs are the cornerstones of malaria control efforts targeting the parasite in the vector and the human host, however they are predicted to have different effects on <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission. Vector control interventions that increase mosquito mortality are expected to cause greater reductions in <italic>Pf</italic>PR than <italic>Pv</italic>PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as higher levels of <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission can be maintained with fewer mosquito bites. This has been observed in both Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sattabongkot et al., 2004</xref>) and Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coura et al., 2006</xref>) where increased vector control has caused greater reductions in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> than <italic>P. vivax</italic>.</p><p>First-line treatment of new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or ACTs is predicted to cause moderate reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The addition of primaquine to first-line treatment regimens is expected to cause large reductions in <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood-stage prevalence, as individuals with the most intense hypnozoite infections are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment and hence have their hypnozoites eliminated. The potential to simultaneously target parasite reservoirs in the blood and liver may turn the cause of <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites' robust transmission into its Achilles' heel.</p><p>In <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> co-endemic regions, heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito bites may cause associations between <italic>P. falciparum</italic> fevers and the risk of future <italic>P. vivax</italic> relapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douglas et al., 2011</xref>). Thus the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> may also reduce <italic>P. vivax</italic> transmission. In addition to inclusion in first-line treatment regimens, primaquine can also be administered as part of mass drug administration (MDA) programmes. In treatment-reinfection studies of Papua New Guinean children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betuela et al., 2012</xref>; Robinson et al., unpublished), mass administration of drugs such as chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine successfully cleared <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood-stage infections but rapid recurrence of infection was observed during follow-up—most likely due to relapses. The addition of primaquine to the treatment regimen caused large reductions in the rate of recurrent infections.</p><p>Although primaquine treatment clears the hypnozoite reservoir, it requires a difficult 14 day treatment regimen, and is not without risk due to vulnerability to haemolytic toxicity among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howes et al., 2013</xref>). Individuals should thus be tested for G6PD deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) before the administration of primaquine.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Prabhat Jha (Senior editor), Mark Jit (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Two of the reviewers have agreed to reveal their identity: Philip McQueen and Laith Yakob.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and I felt that your report was interesting and addressed an important public health issue. The technical details were well-described despite being complex. The reviewers were mainly concerned with the plausibility of the biological assumptions behind the relapse model. Hence we expect you to either provide rigorous justification, or to modify, the following assumptions (perhaps by a closer examination of the existing data):</p><p>1) Relapses: The likelihood function (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10 equ11">equations 10-11</xref>) assumes that the relapse status of individual patients is known (I_j=0 or 1). However, the Results section discusses the importance of undetected relapses (relapses within 14 days of an earlier relapse) in producing an apparent periodicity in the temporal pattern of relapses, implying that I_j=0 during monitored time but is really equal to 1. If the effect of undetected relapses is expected to be a small correction for clinically relevant values of N and so can be ignored, then you need to state and justify that assumption in your formulation of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10 equ11">equations 10-11</xref>.</p><p>2) Constant activation of hypnozoites in the liver: this does not appear to be consistent with evidence. If activation starts immediately, then it would not fit the 3 week intervals for tropical P. vivax after rapidly eliminated drugs. It also does not explain time clustering of relapse intervals or heterologous genotypes in relapses.</p><p>3) Constant death of hypnozoites: this implies random invasion that may well not be true.</p><p>4) In addition to these biological assumptions, the reviewers did not feel that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> showed any obvious periodicity in relapses. The argument would be strengthened by using more formal methods to establish this, e.g. plotting the distribution of relapses for large N (to visually establish multi-modality), and/or estimating the spectral density of the time series.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04692.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The responses to the comments below and the ensuing changes to the manuscript should provide additional evidence for the plausibility of the biological assumptions.</p><p><italic>1) Relapses: The likelihood function (</italic><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10 equ11">equations 10-11</xref><italic>) assumes that the relapse status of individual patients is known (I_j=0 or 1).

We assume that a relapse can go undetected if it is suppressed by prophylaxis due to treatment of a previous infection or if it cannot be detected due to existing parasites. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> it was assumed that if a hypnozoite was predicted to activate within 14 days of a previous infection, then the subsequent relapse would go undetected.</p><p>This point has prompted an additional clarification in the manuscript, namely that not every activating hypnozoite will correspond to a relapse. For example if two hypnozoites activate within a few days of each other then only one relapse would be counted. An adjustment to the axis labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref> has been made to reflect this, with the axis now reading number “number of relapsing hypnozoites” instead of “number of hypnozoites”.</p><p>Note that the likelihood in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ10 equ11">equations (10-11)</xref> are for the first relapse only and so avoid the problem of a second relapse going undetected due to a previous relapse.</p><p>The text has been modified to clarify these points.</p><p><italic>2) Constant activation of hypnozoites in the liver: this does not appear to be consistent with evidence. If activation starts immediately, then it would not fit the 3 week intervals for tropical P. vivax after rapidly eliminated drugs. It also does not explain time clustering of relapse intervals or heterologous genotypes in relapses</italic>.</p><p>To our knowledge there are no published studies of follow-up for recurrent <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections after rapidly eliminated anti-malarial drugs. Douglas <italic>et al</italic> review studies of the follow-up for recurrent <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections after the administration of ACTs, but in all cases the rapidly eliminated artemisinin component was administered alongside a partner drug with a longer half-life.</p><p>Chloroquine, which is slowly eliminated, is still widely used to treat <italic>P. vivax</italic>. In Battle <italic>et al</italic> several of the studies reviewed reported recurrent infections at day 14 despite the use of chloroquine. In areas with documented chloroquine resistance, Price <italic>et al</italic> report that treatment failure (defined via detectable parasites) occurs at a median of 14 days (range 3 to 28) days following chloroquine. However, the early detection of parasites could be due to either rapidly relapsing hypnozoites or the failure of chloroquine to eliminate all circulating blood-stage parasites.</p><p>Finally, in a recent study of the slowly eliminated drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), Tarning <italic>et al</italic> find recurrent <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections at day 14. A model where <italic>P. vivax</italic> recurrent infections occur in 3 week pulses is fitted to the data but it arguably provides no better fit than a model of constant activation of hypnozoites.</p><p>To properly test the hypothesis that relapses can occur in the first 2 to 3 weeks after primary infection would require treatment of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections with artemisinin without a long-lasting partner drug and follow-up for recurrent low density infections. A new paragraph has been added to the discussion to reflect the points made here in response to the reviewers’ comment.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglas <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)</xref> Artemisinin combination therapy for <italic>vivax</italic> malaria. <italic>Lancet Inf Dis.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battle <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> Geographical variation in <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> relapse. <italic>Malaria Journal.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> Global extent of chloroquine-resistant <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>: a systematic review and meta-analysis. <italic>Lancet Inf Dis.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tarning <italic>et al.</italic> (2014)</xref> Population pharmacokinetics and antimalarial pharmacodynamics of piperaquine in patients with <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria in Thailand. <italic>CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol.</italic></p><p><italic>3) Constant death of hypnozoites: this implies random invasion that may well not be true</italic>.</p><p>Once a hypnozoite is established in a liver hepatocyte, it is assumed to not invade other hepatocytes.

The argument would be strengthened by using more formal methods to establish this, e.g. plotting the distribution of relapses for large N (to visually establish multi-modality), and/or estimating the spectral density of the time series</italic>.</p><p>This point is well taken. The plot below shows simulated patterns of relapses (tropical phenotype) for large N, ranging from 30 up to 200. For N = 200 there is a near constant activation of hypnozoites (red and grey triangles). However after censoring for undetected relapses (due to prophylaxis or existing parasitemia) the detected relapses (red triangles) appear periodic with period ∼ 14 days. This pattern is also evident for N = 30, 50, 100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-04692-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of the manuscript has been revised (now N=5, 10, 50 over a 12 month period) to more clearly show the periodic pattern.</p><p>A spectral analysis with simulated data would show increasing evidence of periodicity with increasing N. For very large N the period will approach 14 days. The period between consecutive relapses will be longer for smaller N. We believe that a full presentation of this analysis would go beyond the scope of what can be easily communicated to a wide audience.</p></body></sub-article></article>
