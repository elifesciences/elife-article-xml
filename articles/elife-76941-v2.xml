codons occurs in both natural and synthetic systems. What constraints contributed to the universal adoption of a triplet codon, rather than quadruplet codon, genetic code? Here, we investigate the tolerance of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genetic code to tRNA mutations that increase codon size. We found that tRNAs from all 20 canonical isoacceptor classes can be converted to functional quadruplet tRNAs (qtRNAs). Many of these selectively incorporate a single amino acid in response to a specified four-base codon, as confirmed with mass spectrometry. However, efficient quadruplet codon translation often requires multiple tRNA mutations. Moreover, while tRNAs were largely amenable to quadruplet conversion, only nine of the twenty aminoacyl tRNA synthetases tolerate quadruplet anticodons. These may constitute a functional and mutually orthogonal set, but one that sharply limits the chemical alphabet available to a nascent all-quadruplet code. Our results suggest that the triplet codon code was selected because it is simpler and sufficient, not because a quadruplet codon code is unachievable. These data provide a blueprint for synthetic biologists to deliberately engineer an all-quadruplet expanded genetic code.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetic code expansion</kwd><kwd>tRNA</kwd><kwd>directed evolution</kwd><kwd>quadruplet codon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Söll</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3R35GM122560-05W1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Söll</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AI145181-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeBenedictis</surname><given-names>Erika Alden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 DK102669-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014229</institution-id><institution>MIT Media Lab</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alfred P Sloan Research Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Philanthropy Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Reid Hoffman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esvelt</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although the genetic code uses three DNA base pairs to encode one amino acid, it is surprisingly tolerant to four-base codons, which can be used to incorporate nine of the twenty amino acids without any protein engineering.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genetic code is determined by a combination of tRNAs and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARSs). Codons are dictated by the three bases in the center of the anticodon loop of each tRNA, which undergo Watson-Crick base pairing to an mRNA transcript during translation, enabling accurate codon recognition. The correspondence between codons and amino acids – one tRNA isoacceptor class for each canonical amino acid – is dictated by the 20 AARSs which specifically recognize bases (identity elements) in the tRNAs, and attach the cognate amino acid onto only the CCA 3’ terminus of the cognate tRNA. The aminoacylation process is exquisitely accurate, enabling high-fidelity protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reynolds et al., 2010</xref>). Anticodon mutations frequently alter or abolish selective charging with the cognate amino acid because most AARSs rely on bases in the anticodon to identify the cognate tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giegé et al., 1998</xref>). However, certain natural anticodon mutations generate ‘suppressor’ tRNAs that insert their cognate amino acid in response to 5’-UAG-3’ stop codons pairing with its 5’-CUA-3’ anticodon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eggertsson and Söll, 1988</xref>). Frameshift suppression, in which quadruplet tRNAs (qtRNAs) ‘suppress’ a +1 frameshift mutation can also arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riddle and Carbon, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roth, 1981</xref>); that is, qtRNA-Gly-GGGG can decode the four-base codon 5’-GGGG-3’ in mRNA transcripts using the 5’-CCCC-3’ anticodon. In the presence of efficiently aminoacylated qtRNAs, the ribosome is capable of translation with individual non-canonical stop or quadruplet codons within an otherwise all-triplet transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunkelmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Torre and Chin, 2021</xref>). If individual quadruplet codon translation is known to arise through simple point insertions, what functional constraints, if any, prevent the natural or synthetic evolution of an all-quadruplet genetic code?</p><p>These origin-of-life questions have newfound importance to engineering with the advent of genetic code expansion technology. An expanded all-quadruplet genetic code would offer 256 total codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Torre and Chin, 2021</xref>), including hundreds of free codons that could be assigned to non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), valuable chemical additions to the genetic code that enable improved protein therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutchins et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the efficiency of quadruplet translation can be so high that as many as four unique quadruplets can be translated within one transcript to incorporate natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeBenedictis et al., 2021</xref>) or non-canonical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunkelmann et al., 2021</xref>) amino acids site-specifically. These inspiring results raise the question: is it possible to create an all-quadruplet genetic code? Such a code would presumably require the ability to incorporate the 20 canonical amino acids directed by quadruplet codons. Might the necessary translation components be easily derived from existing tRNAs and AARSs?</p><p>To investigate these questions, we present a comprehensive study of whether tRNAs in general (from all 20 isoacceptor classes) can decode diverse quadruplet codons in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (we examined 57 of the 256 possible quadruplet codons). We systematically explored whether quadruplet codon translation can arise through simple point insertions in each of the tRNA anticodon loops, or through mutation of many bases in the anticodon. We then used directed evolution to determine how often additional mutations throughout the tRNA can improve translation of the resulting qtRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, we characterized the fidelity quadruplet codon translation. Remarkably, we found that 12/20 isoacceptor classes of tRNAs can be readily converted to selectively charged qtRNAs, as confirmed with mass spectrometry. The efficiency of quadruplet decoding is often low, but can frequently be improved by accumulating additional mutations along the sides of the anticodon loop. Most of the resulting qtRNAs selectively incorporate a single amino acid in response to a quadruplet codon. Our results identify some of the barriers limiting the adoption of quadruplet codons by natural evolution, and present 9/20 qtRNAs necessary to synthetically create an all-quadruplet expanded genetic code.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evolution of quadrupelt tRNAs.</title><p>We studied whether tRNAs can arise through simple changes to the anticodon followed by additional mutations accumulated during evolution.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76941-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of qtRNAs through point insertions</title><p>Many known examples of frameshift suppressors contain single base insertions in the anticodon that convert a triplet tRNA into a qtRNA. We initially tested whether tRNAs can evolve into qtRNAs through simple point insertions. We selected 21 endogenous <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNAs, one cognate tRNA for each canonical amino acid and the initiator methionine tRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Materials and methods – ‘tRNA scaffold selection’), to serve as ‘scaffolds’ into which we introduced anticodon point insertions. We tested two point insertion locations: if the original tRNA decodes the triplet codon ‘XYZ’, we created a qtRNA that decodes ‘XYZZ’ and a qtRNA that decodes ‘XYYZ’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These anticodon patterns preserve the nature of the bases in the anticodon loop, which most AARSs use to recognize the cognate tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giegé et al., 1998</xref>), and are found in known qtRNAs, such as sufD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riddle and Carbon, 1973</xref>) (qtRNA<sup>Gly</sup><sub>GGGG</sub>) and sufG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O’Connor, 2002</xref>) (qtRNA<sup>Gln</sup><sub>CAAA</sub>). Throughout this paper, for ease of comparison to standard triplet codon tables, we use qtRNA<sup>three letter scaffold</sup><sub>four letter DNA codon</sub> nomenclature to refer to qtRNAs; for example, a serine qtRNA bearing a 5’-UCUA-3’ anticodon is referred to as qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TAGA</sub>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Engineering qtRNAs with codon patterns.</title><p>(A) We measured quadruplet tRNAs (qtRNAs) that might arise through point insertions in the anticodon loop.</p><p>Each qtRNA is based upon a tRNA from the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> genome that serves as a ‘scaffold’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We tested two quadruplet codon patterns: a tRNA decoding the triplet codon ‘XYZ’ to a qtRNA decoding the quadruplet codon ‘XYZZ’ or ‘XYYZ’. In instances in which XYZZ and XYYZ are the same, the qtRNA is depicted on the XYZZ graph. We use ‘qtRNA’-‘three letter scaffold’-‘four letter codon’ nomenclature to refer to qtRNAs; for example, a serine qtRNA bearing a 5’-UCUA-3’ anticodon that recognizes 5’-UAGA-3’ in mRNA transcripts is referred to as qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TAGA</sub>. (<bold>B</bold>) We measured qtRNAs using a luciferase readthrough assay. Measurements are taken kinetically and normalized to culture density, and efficiency is reported relative to luminescence produced by a wildtype (WT), all triplet luciferase transcript. qtRNAs that are statistically &gt;0 are annotated with their one-sample t-test p-value: 0.033(*), 0.0021(**), 0.0002(***), &lt; 0.001(****). fMet qtRNAs are measured with a luciferase reporter bearing a quadruplet codon at residue 1; all others are measured with a quadruplet codon at residue 357 of luxAB.

First, to measure the quadruplet codon translation efficiency, we used a luciferase readthrough assay (Materials and methods – ‘Luciferase readthrough assay’). This reporter contains a single quadruplet codon at permissive residue 357 of <italic>luxAB</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/ETNcpJ/sOCa">DeBenedictis et al., 2021</ext-link>); failure to decode the quadruplet codon leads to premature termination, whereas successful four-base decoding results in full-length luxAB translation and luminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Seven of the twenty ‘XYZZ’-decoding qtRNAs (qtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CGTT</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Gln</sup><sub>CAGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Gly</sup><sub>GGGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>fMet</sup><sub>ATGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Pro</sup><sub>CCGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TCGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Thr</sup><sub>ACGG</sub>) and two of the ‘XYYZ’-decoding qtRNAs (qtRNA<sup>Gln</sup><sub>CAAG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Pro</sup><sub>CCCG</sub>) functionally decode a quadruplet codon during translation. The frequent functionality of the XYZZ codon pattern may be due to flexibility in synthetase recognition at the third position of the codon, which is frequently a wobble base pair. Next, we quantified the toxicity of qtRNA expression by comparing the growth defect (Materials and methods – ‘Growth defect’) of cultures with qtRNA expression induced or suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The qtRNAs fall into several categories: those that exhibit no fitness defect such as the naturally occurring and highly functional qtRNA<sup>Gly</sup><sub>GGGG</sub>; those that exhibit severe fitness defects and effectively halt bacterial growth upon induction such as qtRNA<sup>Ala</sup><sub>GCCC</sub>, and those that moderately slow bacterial growth. The translation efficiency and growth defect of qtRNAs depends upon more than just the interaction with the cognate AARS: AlaRS, LeuRS, and SerRS are all tRNA synthetases that do not interact with the anticodon loop of their cognate tRNA, yet qtRNAs derived from these scaffolds exhibit a range of behaviors depending upon the new anticodon. For example, qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TCCG</sub> exhibits high growth defect, while qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TCGG</sub> exhibits no growth defect and modest quadruplet translation efficiency. Together, these data show that a third of the 20 isoacceptor classes have access to single base insertions that enable modestly functional quadruplet codon translation, however, other point insertions create qtRNAs that do not functionally decode quadruplet codons or incur large growth defects when expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evolution of qtRNAs through anticodon replacement</title><p>Next, we tested whether tRNAs could evolve into qtRNAs through whole anticodon replacement, as might occur during recombination or more intense mutagenesis. Antibiotic selection markers have previously been used to identify functional qtRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magliery et al., 2001</xref>). We applied an equivalent approach based on the use of an M13 bacteriophage tail fiber pIII as a selection marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeBenedictis et al., 2022</xref>). In this selection scheme, a qtRNA is encoded on the genome of a ΔpIII M13 bacteriophage. Phage are challenged to infect bacteria bearing a plasmid that encodes pIII containing a quadruplet codon at permissive residue 29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bryson et al., 2017</xref>). Functional qtRNAs are capable of producing full-length pIII and thus phage progeny, while nonfunctional qtRNAs result in production of truncated pIII and thus no further phage.</p><p>For each of the 20 representative <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA scaffolds used above, we created a 256-member qtRNA library containing degenerate anticodons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Materials and methods – ‘Phage library primer design’, ‘Phage library cloning’). We selected eight quadruplet codons of interest, focusing on codons for which at least one functional qtRNA was already known that could act as positive control. We selected for functional qtRNAs from these libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Materials and methods – ‘pIII-based selection of NNNN anticodon libraries’) to identify qtRNAs that decode the eight quadruplet codons of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). High final phage titers after selection indicate the presence of a functional qtRNA, and we selected 69 putative qtRNAs that exhibit high final phage titer for further characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We used plaque assays (Materials and methods – ‘Phage plaque assays’) to isolate clonal phage variants and determined the anticodon of each highly selected variant with Sanger sequencing. We found that for most variants, the qtRNA agrees with the quadruplet codon in the reporter at all four positions, or the first three positions of the codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), in agreement with previous findings on quadruplet codon crosstalk with fourth-base mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>). We found that qtRNAs identified by this phage-based assay are also functional in the luciferase assay. These results demonstrate that most tRNA scaffolds are capable of supporting quadruplet codon translation through whole anticodon replacement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Selection for functional qtRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We created quadruplet tRNAs (qtRNA) libraries using degenerate primers to randomize the four bases in the anticodon.

The emergence of these anticodons suggests that these isoacceptor classes favor quadruplet codons that are related to their natural triplet codon, and demonstrates that qtRNA evolution depends upon the sequence context of relevant ORFs.</p><p>Together, these experiments identified functional qtRNAs involving four or fewer mutations for 18/20 isoacceptor classes. For the remaining two isoacceptor classes, Met and Asn, we systematically tested additional codons and found that qtRNA<sup>Met</sup><sub>AGGG</sub> and qtRNA<sup>Asn</sup><sub>AGGA</sub> both exhibit weak quadruplet codon translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, every isoacceptor class can give rise to qtRNAs capable of decoding quadruplet codons during protein translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Directed evolution of qtRNAs</title><p>Having found that qtRNAs that functionally decode quadruplet codons can arise generally through just a few mutations, we sought to understand other factors that may prevent more widespread use of quadruplet codons. Many qtRNAs were quite inefficient in translation: the presence of a single quadruplet codon in an mRNA transcript can reduce total protein yield to less than 3% relative to an all-triplet mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Mutations at the anticodon loop sides of the qtRNAs have been observed to improve translation efficiency for TAGA-qtRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeBenedictis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeBenedictis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niu et al., 2013</xref>). Triplet tRNAs are known to exhibit patterns that relate the bases in the anticodon loop sides to the bases in the anticodon itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yarus, 1982</xref>), and similarly benefit from anticodon loop side mutations after anticodon replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleina et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Raftery and Yarus, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cervettini et al., 2020</xref>).

We identified 15 libraries that exhibit no selective pressure, 12 libraries that strongly enrich a single library member, like qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TAGA</sub>, and an additional 11 libraries exhibit strong enrichment for library members with a specific base at one or two positions, but not all three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). For several of these libraries, we used a luciferase readthrough assay to measure the fold change activity when mutations to bases 32, 37, and 38 are introduced. In most cases, introduction of these mutations substantially increases quadruplet codon translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>We were curious whether there are overall trends in the identity of optimal anticodon loop sides for efficient quadruplet codon translation. The optimal library member is not determined by the scaffold or codon independently, indicating that the mechanism by which these mutations improve quadruplet codon translation does not improve the qtRNA’s interaction with its respective AARS. Among the libraries there was a prominent preference for A37, a base known to be associated with reading frame maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agris, 2004</xref>). Additionally, C32 A37 T38 and T32 A37 G38 appear often among libraries that exhibit strong preference for a single library member. The presence of modified nucleotides is especially important at two sites: position 34, the first base of the anticodon, and position 37, the nucleotide downstream of the anticodon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agris, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosjean and Westhof, 2016</xref>).

These qtRNAs would be unlikely to be selected in a natural system due to their inability to produce full-length protein efficiently. Eight qtRNAs are selectively acylated with the amino acid cognate to the original scaffold (qtRNA<sup>Arg</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Gln</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Glu</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>). Four qtRNAs selectively incorporate Arg, rather than the amino acid cognate to the scaffold (qtRNA<sup>Asp</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Ile</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Trp</sup>, qtRNA<sup>Val</sup>). Two qtRNAs that are charged with the cognate amino acid as well as promiscuously charged with Arg (qtRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and qtRNA<sup>Met</sup>). All 14 of these qtRNAs might be selected by a natural system to rescue a frameshift mutation. The 12 qtRNAs that are selectively charged might be further selected as components of an all-quadruplet genetic code.</p><p>These data highlight the plasticity of AARS recognition for altered codons, both in nucleobase composition and size. The presence of a quadruplet anticodon presumably distorts the structure of the anticodon binding domain, which is a major identity element for many AARSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giegé et al., 1998</xref>). How much distortion will the enzyme functionally accept, and/or will recognition of the additional base lead to mischarging with a different amino acid? Of the eight qtRNAs that retained the cognate specificity, tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> are known as naturally occurring functional frameshift suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Riddle and Carbon, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sroga et al., 1992</xref>); we confirm that they are selectively charged by the cognate AARS. Together with tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>, our results show that <italic>E. coli</italic> GlnRS, GlyRS, and ProRS recognize the first three bases of the quadruplet anticodon, and are capable of charging qtRNAs despite the increased anticodon size. Correct charging of qtRNAs derived from qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup> is expected, as <italic>E. coli</italic> SerRS does not interact with the anticodon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biou et al., 1994</xref>). A striking result is the correct charging of qtRNA<sup>Glu</sup><sub>CGGT</sub> and qtRNA<sup>Phe</sup><sub>CGGC</sub> by their respective <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA synthetases, as their triplet anticodon sequence is unlike that of the quadruplet anticodon. However, in both cases all other known critical identity elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giegé et al., 1998</xref>) are present in the tRNA scaffold. This suggests that the major recognition feature, the anticodon, can be outweighed by the sum of the other identity elements, creating in some cases an avenue for anticodon evolution.</p><p>Finally, why did we observe acylation of multiple qtRNAs with arginine? ArgRS is responsible for synthesis of a family of Arg-tRNAs needed for the recognition of six codons, including tRNAs that differ at both the first and last position of the anticodon. As a consequence, the identity of just one anticodon position is invariant (C35). Examination of the qtRNAs charged with Arg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) shows that all satisfy this anticodon identity element, causing widespread promiscuous charging with Arg, even for qtRNAs that lack other known argRS identity elements such as A20, which is absent in qtRNA<sup>Asp</sup><sub>CGGC</sub> and qtRNA<sup>Val</sup><sub>CGGC</sub>. For this reason, the presence of promiscuous ArgRS substantially increases the probability that tRNA point insertions in diverse scaffolds will result in an aminoacylated qtRNA.</p><p>Taken together, we found that in the majority of cases, qtRNAs exhibit properties that would render them evolutionarily favored building blocks: they are selectively charged by a single amino acid and incorporate that amino acid in response to their quadruplet codon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Compiled trends in nascent qtRNA evolution</title><p>In total, we characterized 116 different qtRNAs based on 20 tRNA scaffolds that decode 20 unique quadruplet codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Most prominently, we tested several qtRNAs that compete with the arginine codons AGG and found 18/20 to be functional. Further, we characterized the amino acid incorporated during translation and found that in 4/4 cases arginine is the dominant amino acid inserted. Together, these data indicate that the anticodon is a strong identity element for ArgRS, which charges tRNAs with arginine-like anticodons regardless of matching of other putative identity elements like A20 or A/G73. We also found that several isoacceptor classes were especially resistant to accepting a quadruplet anticodon. For example, 9/10 qtRNA<sup>Asn</sup> species tested were nonfunctional. Only qtRNA<sup>Asn</sup><sub>AGGA</sub> exhibits weak activity and is likely charged with arginine. This suggests that AsnRS does not tolerate expanded anticodons. Similarly, qtRNA<sup>Ile</sup> and qtRNA<sup>Met</sup> only tolerate arginine-like anticodons. Interestingly, we also found that certain isoacceptor classes do not tolerate new anticodons even when this would not be predicted from known identity elements. For example, qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TCGG</sub> and qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>GCAT</sub> are both nonfunctional, even though SerRS does not interact with the anticodon loop of its cognate tRNA. The function of these qtRNAs may instead be governed by interaction with other enzymes that add chemical modifications.</p><p>To be used as part of a genetic code, qtRNAs must be capable of operating together with minimal crosstalk. We selected 10 qtRNAs and measured crosstalk between members of this set, revealing a high degree of orthogonality: each qtRNA is specific for its own four-base codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present a comprehensive study of whether tRNAs can be altered to functionally decode quadruplet codons. Our results show that quadruplet decoding is a remarkably universal phenomenon: every tRNA we tested is capable of exhibiting weak quadruplet decoding activity with four or fewer mutations. Additionally, weak quadruplet decoding requires very few mutations in many cases. For example, a single point insertion in the anticodon is sufficient to generate functional qtRNAs for 7/20 isoacceptor classes.</p><p>The tRNA anticodon is a major recognition element for many tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giegé et al., 1998</xref>). Thus we were surprised to find nine different AARSs (ArgRS, GluRS, GlnRS, GlyRS, HisRS, PheRS, ProRS, SerRS, TyrRS) that selectively charged the cognate qtRNA, creating the opportunity for amino acid and codon-diverse all-quadruplet peptide translation. The diversity of codons that can be recognized by qtRNAs can easily enable codon-selective translation, as we demonstrate with a miniature all-quadruplet genetic code composed of 10 orthogonal qtRNAs based on unique isoacceptor classes. Together, these results demonstrate that qtRNAs capable of amino acid-selective efficient translation of quadruplet codons can arise during evolution.</p><p>However, our study identifies several factors that may have prevented universal adoption of an all-quadruplet code. First, we find that some qtRNAs exhibit strong fitness defects which prevent them from being maintained and accumulated in genomes. Second, additional mutations outside the anticodon are often required for efficient translation, reducing the probability that efficient qtRNAs would arise by chance. Such mutations may affect identity elements of the tRNA modifying enzymes that chemically alter the bases surrounding the anticodon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hori, 2014</xref>); similar patterns have been observed for canonical triplet tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yarus, 1982</xref>). Finally, only some AARSs are amenable to altered codon sizes for some amino acids: 12/20 modern <italic>E. coli</italic> AARSs are intolerant, inefficient, or promiscuous with qtRNAs. In particular, AARSs that arose later during evolution may be more finely tuned to precise anticodon base recognition and thus less tolerant of anticodon mutations or expansion. A nascent all-quadruplet code would initially have access to only the limited chemical vocabulary of the nine AARSs that are most amenable to quadruplet codon translation, decreasing the likelihood that valuable quadruplet-ORFs might arise naturally and be selected. Similarly, as evolution progressed, the translation apparatus would have been under increasingly strong selection favoring increased fidelity of translation to support a genetic code with an increased number of codons, making it increasingly difficult for an all-quadruplet codon code to arise. Finally, studies have shown that ORFs can also arise de novo from non-coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>) and that random ORFs can rapidly evolve into functional proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keefe and Szostak, 2001</xref>), offering an avenue for gene birth in a different codon size should the appropriate qtRNAs be available. However, given that the canonical genetic code only includes 20 or 21 amino acids, even though there are 64 codons, suggests that there is little natural selective pressure to expand the genetic code to a much larger number than the currently known canonical amino acids. Together, these factors contribute to the absence of naturally occurring quadruplet codon codes, despite the frequency with which individual quadruplet translation components can arise through evolution. We expect that naturally occurring instances of qtRNAs or quadruplet codon codes would arise even less frequently than other non-canonical genetic codes in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shulgina and Eddy, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although these factors explain the absence of naturally occurring all-quadruplet genetic codes, our results offer a blueprint for deliberately engineering an expanded all-quadruplet genetic code. While there is much current interest in the detailed aspects of quadruplet decoding on the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), more work is needed to understand the hurdles a mRNA quadruplet codon encounters on its way through the ribosome. In addition, tRNA modification of the anticodon loop may be crucial to endow the anticodon with the flexibility needed to efficiently pair with the quadruplet codon in the ribosome environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosjean and Westhof, 2016</xref>). Our work was not designed to contribute to mechanistic understanding. Instead, we aim to survey the empirical properties of qtRNAs. Our data have revealed exactly which triplet codons can be reassigned to quadruplet codons without compromising amino acid selectivity: an initial all-quadruplet code will be composed of nine selectively charged qtRNAs from this study (qtRNA<sup>Gln</sup><sub>CAGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Pro</sup><sub>CCGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Phe</sup><sub>CGGC</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Glu</sup><sub>CGGT</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Gly</sup><sub>GGGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>TCGG</sub>, qtRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>AGGG</sub>, and either qtRNA<sup>Tyr</sup><sub>TAGA</sub> or qtRNA<sup>His</sup><sub>TAGA</sub>).</p><p>Further, the flexibility of AARSs suggests that anticodon re-engineering may be a viable strategy for reassignment of the additional 11 canonical amino acids to quadruplet codons. We and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishnakumar et al., 2013</xref>) have observed that ArgRS is a major source of promiscuous charging; refactoring or replacing this ArgRS may be broadly valuable for enabling reassignment of arginine-like codons; that is, enabling selective charging of qtRNA<sup>Ala</sup><sub>AGGG</sub>. A primary limitation of quadruplet codon translation is competition with the canonical triplet tRNAs, resulting in toxicity and low translation efficiency. To overcome this major limitation, strategies such as CCA tail engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Samaha et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Terasaka et al., 2014</xref>), or ribosome engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neumann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmied et al., 2018</xref>) to reject triplet codons, will be essential for creating an all-quadruplet genetic code. Additionally, current qtRNAs are known to crosstalk with four-base mismatched codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeBenedictis et al., 2021</xref>), and engineering to eliminate this behavior will be required to fully utilize the expanded codon set. Re-engineering the majority of endogenous tRNA synthetases is a considerable engineering investment, but advances in protein engineering likely make this task not more onerous than current genetic code expansion techniques, which require years of iterative whole genome synthesis and assembly to free up a large number of codons.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gerald F Joyce (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers were quite positive about the work, but each has made several suggestions for improvements of the manuscript (see reviews below). It is particularly important that you provide a clearer distinction between what you hope to achieve in the future and what you have actually achieved in this study. It was agreed that multiplexing with several 4-based codons will be challenging especially when competing with 3-base decoding. The efficiency of 4-base decoding is very low even with some improvements through directed evolution.</p><p>We believe that the main message is that the genetic code is surprisingly tolerant to quadruplet codons across the board. We do want to see the primary mass spec data rather than a bar graph summary. This data could be deposited in PRIDE or similar databases. It is a requirement for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> that these be provided as extended data. We also suggest that a discussion of what needs to be improved, specific aminoacylation, better handling of decoding, faster translocation, etc., should be included in the paper to achieve the dream of 256 codons.

Intro: ' including hundreds of free codons that could be assigned to noncanonical amino acids' this is not correct, none of them are open as all of these codons would compete with triplet de-coding of normal reading frames.</p></disp-quote><p>In the abstract and introduction we are referencing a concept that has been popularized in the literature (i.e. Reprogramming the genetic code, Chin, 2021) that an all-quadruplet codon code could be created that is selective for quadruplet codons. We agree that the literature has been light on a clear discussion of exactly what would be necessary to achieve an all-quadruplet codon code. In this manuscript, we tackle the question, how do you incorporate all 20 canonical amino acids?</p><p>Competition with triplet codons is certainly a second big hurdle. Mechanistically, this might be achieved in several ways, including evolving the ribosome to reject triplet codons, or creating a separate pool of ribosomes and tRNAs using CCA tail engineering. We have added this to the discussion:</p><p>“A primary limitation of quadruplet codon translation is competition with the canonical triplet tRNAs, resulting in toxicity and low translation efficiency. To overcome this major limitation, strategies such as CCA tail engineering, or ribosome engineering to reject triplet codons, will be essential for creating an all-quadruplet genetic code.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Those “non-functional” qtRNAs are marked with an ‘X’ in Figure 6A. In addition, we tested many “functional” qtRNAs that <italic>do</italic> exhibit luminescence above background. They are indicated with a filled square in Figure 6A. There is at least one filled square in each column because we found at least one functional qtRNA based on a tRNA scaffold from every isoacceptor class.</p><p>The full statement in the paper is correct, “In total, every tRNA scaffold we tested is capable of supporting quadruplet codon translation given appropriate four-base codon choice (that is, in Figure 6A each column has at least one filled square).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. ' other point insertions create qtRNAs that do not functionally decode quadruplet codons' would a different codon context show some of these tRNAs to be functional?</p></disp-quote><p>Throughout the paper, we experimented with several different reporter genes that place the quadruplet codon of interest in a different mRNA context, including luxAB, sfGFP, and pIII. We found that the amount of quadruplet decoding activity was correlated between these reporters, for example, compare Figure 4D (pIII context) with Figure 4E (luxAB context). We did not happen to identify any qtRNAs that were functional in one context but not another, although we did identify qtRNAs that interact with an unexpected area of the transcript as in Figure 3F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. 'functional quadruplet translation will launch synthetic efforts to assemble a 256-amino acid genetic code.' 256 codons does not provide 256 AAs, what will be the redundancy of the quadruplet code? An expanded discussion on this point would improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion on this point, which now reads:</p><p>“A primary limitation of quadruplet codon translation is competition with the canonical triplet tRNAs, resulting in toxicity and low translation efficiency. To overcome this major limitation, strategies such as CCA tail engineering<sup>31,32</sup>, or ribosome engineering<sup>33</sup> to reject triplet codons, will be essential for creating an all-quadruplet genetic code. Additionally, current qtRNAs are known to crosstalk with four-base mismatched codons<sup>9</sup>, and engineering to eliminate this behavior will be required to fully utilize the expanded codon set.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
