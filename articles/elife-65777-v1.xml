Immune cells naturally differ in their sensitivity to IL-2 due to cell type and activation state-dependent expression of receptors and signaling pathway components. To probe differences in IL-2 signaling across cell types, we used structure-based design to create and profile a series of IL-2 variants with the capacity to titrate maximum signal strength in fine increments. One of these partial agonists, IL-2-REH, specifically expanded Foxp3+ regulatory T cells with reduced activity on CD8+ T cells due to cell type-intrinsic differences in IL-2 signaling. IL-2-REH elicited cell type-dependent differences in gene expression and provided mixed therapeutic results: showing benefit in the in vivo mouse dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model of colitis, but no therapeutic efficacy in a transfer colitis model. Our findings show that cytokine partial agonists can be used to calibrate intrinsic differences in response thresholds across responding cell types to narrow pleiotropic actions, which may be generalizable to other cytokine and growth factor systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokine signaling</kwd><kwd>immunology</kwd><kwd>IL-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-AI051321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18-12973S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>Marek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1656518</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glassman</surname><given-names>Caleb R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A panel of interleukin-2 partial agonists designed to exploit distinct immune cell response thresholds enabled selective activation of regulatory T cells in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokines are secreted factors that regulate diverse aspects of cell physiology through assembly of cell surface receptors and induction of the JAK-STAT signaling cascade. Cytokines are highly pleiotropic due to broad expression of receptor components on diverse cell types. In vivo, pleiotropy is managed by local cytokine secretion and differential expression of receptor subunits and signaling pathway components depending on cell type and activation state. The actions of a single cytokine on multiple cell types has limited both basic understanding of cell type-dependent cytokine activity in vivo and therapeutic interventions that rely on the systemic administration of cytokine. Thus, new approaches are needed to limit cytokine pleiotropy in order to understand basic aspects of cytokine biology across cell types and develop improved therapeutic modulators of cytokine signaling.</p><p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a classical pleiotropic cytokine that signals through a heterodimeric receptor formed by IL-2 receptor beta (IL-2Rβ, CD122) and common gamma chain (γ<sub>c</sub>, CD132) expressed on T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatakeyama et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takeshita et al., 1992</xref>). Cells can further enhance their sensitivity to IL-2 by expression of the non-signaling subunit, IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα, CD25) which sensitizes cells to IL-2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cosman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leonard et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nikaido et al., 1984</xref>). Although IL-2 was originally described as a T cell stimulatory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgan et al., 1976</xref>), mice deficient in IL-2 or the IL-2 receptor were found to develop severe autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadlack et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sadlack et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Willerford et al., 1995</xref>). This seeming paradox was resolved by the finding that IL-2 signaling is critical for maintenance of regulatory T cells (Tregs) which play an important role in suppressing immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontenot et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, transfer of Tregs was shown to inhibit autoimmune syndrome in IL-2Rβ-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malek et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, IL-2 acts as a central regulator of immunity by supporting both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.</p><p>While many immune cells express components of the IL-2 receptor, cell types differ in their requirements for and sensitivity to IL-2 signaling. NK cells express high levels of IL-2Rβ and respond to both IL-2 and the related cytokine, IL-15 which shares signaling receptors IL-2Rβ/γ<sub>c</sub> with IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giri et al., 1994</xref>). Naïve T cells express low levels of IL-2 receptor components and thus are relatively insensitive to IL-2 stimulation until after upregulation of IL-2 receptor components following activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Au-Yeung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leonard et al., 1985</xref>). Unlike naïve T cells, Tregs constitutively express IL-2Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sakaguchi et al., 1995</xref>) and are further sensitized to IL-2 by miR-155-dependent repression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). These differences in cell type sensitivity create threshold effects where low doses of IL-2 activate Tregs without inducing signaling on naïve T cells and NK cells while high doses of IL-2 activate both Tregs as well as naïve T cells and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grinberg-Bleyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsuoka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2015</xref>); however, exploiting this phenomenon clinically has been difficult due to a narrow therapeutic window between pro- and anti-inflammatory IL-2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pham et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous attempts to overcome IL-2 pleiotropy and target signaling to distinct cell populations have focused on differential expression of IL-2 receptor components. Antibodies against IL-2 that favor binding to IL-2Rα expressing cells (JES6-1) can potentiate Tregs by sterically blocking interactions between IL-2Rβ and IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spangler et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, IL-2 muteins with reduced affinity for IL-2Rβ have been used to increase dependence on IL-2Rα and enhance Treg selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khoryati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shanafelt et al., 2000</xref>). While using ligands to target differences in receptor expression provides some amount of cell type selectivity, cells employ diverse mechanisms to regulate IL-2 sensitivity.</p><p>To probe intrinsic differences in IL-2 signaling across cell types, we took an unbiased and structure-based approach by generating a series of IL-2 muteins with reduced affinity for γ<sub>c</sub>, which we surmised would modulate the stability of the heterodimeric signaling complex and serve to ‘titrate’ signal strength. We then systematically characterized their cell type specificity in vivo. Functionally, these IL-2 variants exhibit partial agonism, eliciting a submaximal response at saturating concentrations of cytokine. We identified an IL-2 mutein, IL-2-REH (L18<underline>R</underline>, Q22<underline>E</underline>, Q126<underline>H</underline>), that induces proliferation of Foxp3+Tregs with reduced activity on NK cells and CD8+ T cells. This mutein showed increased dependence on IL-2Rα expression and decreased capacity to overcome negative regulation by SOCS1, thereby mirroring two key features of IL-2 sensitivity in Tregs, constitutive expression of IL-2Rα and miR-155-mediated suppression of SOCS1. Expanded Tregs retain suppressive capacity in vitro and improved recovery in the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model of inflammatory bowel disease. These results demonstrate that cell type-intrinsic differences in IL-2 signaling can be exploited by partial agonists to generate new cytokines with reduced pleiotropy and improved therapeutic properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL-2 receptor partial agonists control STAT5 signaling by modulating receptor dimerization</title><p>IL-2 signaling is initiated when IL-2 first binds to IL-2Rβ, following recruitment of γ<sub>c</sub>, which results in trans-phosphorylation of JAK1/JAK3, and activation of STAT5 and other pathway components. To systematically probe the relationship between receptor dimerization and downstream signaling, we targeted residues in IL-2 that make contact with γ<sub>c</sub> in order to modulate the efficiency of receptor heterodimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This mutational strategy has the advantage of capping maximal signaling (Emax) by weakening the recruitment of γ<sub>c</sub>, the final step of IL-2 receptor assembly. We selected mutations on IL-2 that form contacts with γ<sub>c</sub> and installed these mutations in a variant of IL-2 with high affinity for IL-2Rβ, super-2 (H9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levin et al., 2012</xref>), which effectively ‘clamps’ IL-2Rβ and reduces dependence on IL-2Rα such that the Emax for the mutants are determined by the efficiency of γ<sub>c</sub> recruitment into the complex. For this and subsequent experiments, IL-2 variants were expressed with an N-terminal mouse serum albumin (MSA) tag to aid expression and extend half-life in vivo. A panel of H9 variants with L18R, Q22E, and variable amino acid substitutions at Q126 were tested for STAT5 signaling in YT cells, an IL-2 responsive human NK cell line, by phosphoflow cytometry. This mutational strategy yielded a panel of IL-2 partial agonists characterized by reduced maximal STAT5 phosphorylation at saturating doses of cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The diversity of response profiles from these IL-2 muteins indicates that changes to a single amino acid side chain can modulate the full range of induction of intracellular signaling, from 100% E<sub>max</sub> to essentially no activity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure-based design and biophysical characterization of IL-2 receptor partial agonists.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complex (PDB: 2B5I).

Based on the mutational strategy used, we expect IL-2 partial agonists to reduce receptor dimerization due to weakened interactions with γ<sub>c</sub>. To monitor receptor dimerization, we used dual-color single-molecule particle co-tracking of IL-2Rβ and γ<sub>c</sub> in the plasma membrane of living cells by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. HeLa cells were transfected with IL-2Rβ and γ<sub>c</sub> fused to an N-terminal nonfluorescent GFP variants mXFPm and mXFPe, respectively. These GFP variants were orthogonally labeled with anti-GFP nanobodies ‘minimizer’ (MI) conjugated with Rho11 and ‘enhancer’ (EN) conjugated with DY647 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Receptor dimerization was quantified by assessing co-tracking individual Rho11 and DY647 molecules. Under these conditions, IL-2Rβ and γ<sub>c</sub> show minimal co-diffusion in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>), indicating that the receptors are monomeric. Addition of H9 caused an increase in co-diffusion, consistent with ligand-induced dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). As predicted, H9-REH and H9-REK showed reduced receptor dimerization relative to H9 as measured by co-tracking of IL-2Rβ and γc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm that reduced receptor dimerization was the result of impaired interactions with γ<sub>c</sub>, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure binding of IL-2Rβ and IL-2 muteins to immobilized γ<sub>c</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Precomplexed cytokine and IL-2Rβ were used in these assays as the affinity of IL-2 for γ<sub>c</sub> is too weak to measure directly. H9-REH, H9-REK, and H9-RETR had reduced γ<sub>c</sub> binding relative to H9, indicating the reduced receptor dimerization observed in cells is due to impaired interactions with γ<sub>c</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>For preliminary characterization, IL-2 variants with enhanced affinity for IL-2Rβ were used to facilitate comparison of partial agonists; however, this strategy may direct activity of IL-2 muteins toward NK cells in vivo due to their high levels of IL-2Rβ expression. To eliminate this potential source of bias, we expressed γ<sub>c</sub> binding muteins in the context of wild-type human IL-2 (IL-2-REH, IL-2-REK, and IL-2-RETR) and confirmed their effects on STAT5 signaling compared to wild-type IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The IL-2 receptor partial agonist IL-2-REH specifically increases the frequency and number of regulatory T cells in vivo</title><p>To determine the cell type specificity of IL-2 partial agonists in vivo, we took advantage of the strong proliferative effect of IL-2 by assessing the frequency of immune cell populations following cytokine treatment. 30 μg doses of MSA-fused cytokine were administered to C57BL/6J mice on days 0, 3, and 6 prior to analysis on day 7.

Wild-type and IL-2Rα-deficient cells were co-cultured at a 1:1 ratio in IL-2 or IL-2-REH for 72 hr, and changes in the frequency of IL-2Rα-expressing cells were used as a readout of IL-2Rα dependence. When cultured in IL-2, cells remained roughly at their input ratios, suggesting a negligible contribution of IL-2Rα expression. In contrast, co-culture in IL-2-REH produced an enrichment in IL-2Rα-expressing cells suggesting knockout cells were reduced in their capacity to respond to IL-2-REH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>).</p><p>In addition to constitutive expression of IL-2Rα, Tregs are further sensitized to IL-2 signaling by miR-155 dependent suppression of SOCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). As SOCS1 acts as a negative regulator of IL-2 signaling by inhibiting JAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liau et al., 2018</xref>), we reasoned that SOCS1 expression may disproportionately inhibit signaling in response to IL-2-REH, which induces lower levels of receptor dimerization relative to wild-type IL-2. To determine the impact of SOCS1 on STAT5 signaling, we transduced CTLL-2 cells with lentivirus encoding SOCS1 along with a GFP expression marker. Wild-type and SOCS1 overexpressing cells were mixed, stimulated with IL-2 or IL-2-REH, and the ratio of pSTAT5 signaling in SOCS1 expressing cells relative to wild-type CTLL-2s was quantified.

Under these conditions, Tregs were able to suppress colitis; however, this was inhibited by administration of IL-2-REH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Interestingly, this was not due to an inability of IL-2-REH to expand Tregs as elevated Treg frequency was observed in cytokine-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Similarly, IL-2-REH was able to stimulate Tregs as measured by expression of activation markers IL-2Rα, GzmB, and ICOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). These findings suggest that Treg expansion at later time points does not correlate with disease protection in the transfer model of T cell colitis; however, an important caveat is that the high frequency of responding T cells in this case may not reflect the typical circumstance during inflammatory disease progression. Furthermore, the IL-2Rα-selectivity of IL-2-REH may simultaneously activate IL-2Rα+CD8+ T cells in inflammatory lesion, providing an opposing effect to therapeutic benefit from the Treg expansion.</p><p>To determine if systemic treatment with IL-2-REH could provide therapeutic benefit during an ongoing immune response, we used the DSS-induced colitis model, treating mice with IL-2, IL-2-REH, or the previously described IL-2Rα selective IL-2 mutein, IL-2-N88D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>), starting on day 3 at the onset of DSS-induced weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Previously, the cytotoxic effector molecule, granzyme B (GzmB) has been implicated in the suppressive activity of Tregs through killing of antigen presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2007</xref>).

The countervailing effects of IL-2 to both activate and suppress the immune response is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis but has hampered basic understanding of IL-2 activity on different cell types in vivo and limited the clinical utility of cytokine administration. Here, we identify an IL-2 agonist which specifically expands a preexisting population of regulatory T cells due to differences in IL-2 receptor expression and signaling pathway intermediates. The mechanistic principles we demonstrate here for determining cell type selectivity of IL-2 partial agonists can likely be generalized to other cytokine and growth factor systems that signal through dimeric receptors.</p><p>This mechanism-based approach taken here differs from previously reported IL-2 muteins with attenuated binding to IL-2Rβ and thus increased dependence on IL-2Rα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khoryati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peterson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shanafelt et al., 2000</xref>). Here, the strategy of systematically altering the affinity of IL-2 for γ<sub>c</sub> to generate IL-2 variants with submaximal signaling at saturating concentrations of cytokine is conceptually analogous to modulation of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by partial agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pliska, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shukla, 2019</xref>). Unlike GPCR which undergo ligand-induced confirmational changes, cytokine receptor signaling depends largely on receptor dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Engelowski et al., 2018</xref>). We find that modulating the affinity of IL-2 for its receptor can shift the monomer-dimer equilibrium and promote distinct levels of intracellular signaling. Importantly, these effects are highly dependent on expression of receptor subunits such that IL-2 muteins which fail to signal on one cell population act as full or partial agonists on others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The affinity of IL-2 for IL-2Rβ predominantly impacts the dose sensitivity of cytokine signaling rather than the maximal response such increased cytokine concentration can compensate for reduced IL-2Rβ affinity. The approach we have taken here in which we modulate the interaction between IL-2 and γ<sub>c</sub> is less dependent on cytokine concentration and has the capacity to alter receptor dimerization even at saturating concentrations of cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Cell type-specific signaling through IL-2Rβ/γ<sub>c</sub> is not unique to engineered cytokines. Indeed, IL-2 shares signaling receptors IL-2Rβ and γ<sub>c</sub> with IL-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Giri et al., 1994</xref>). Despite exhibiting very similar signaling on CD8+ T cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ring et al., 2012</xref>), IL-2 and IL-15 have many divergent biological functions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lodolce et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). Differences in IL-2 and IL-15 have been attributed to unique receptors, IL-2Rα and IL-15Rα, which play important roles in determining cell type specificity of cytokine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waldmann, 2006</xref>). In contrast to IL-2 and IL-15, partial agonists achieve cell type selectivity through a distinct mechanism, relying on different thresholds for IL-2 signaling across cell types rather than unique alpha receptors to achieve biological specificity.</p><p>This mechanism of functional diversification through altered receptor dimerization shares some features with type I interferons (IFNs), a large class of cytokines that signal though receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Despite the use of a shared receptor complex, type I IFNs play nonredundant roles in antiviral immunity by modulating the strength of receptor dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ng et al., 2015</xref>). While IL-2 and IL-15 are the only natural ligands of the IL-2Rβ/γ<sub>c</sub> receptor complex, we show here that additional IL-2 receptor agonists with divergent biological behavior can be generated by systematically altering receptor binding. This strategy relies on intrinsic differences in cytokine sensitivity that can be exploited by designed cytokine variants to satisfy thresholds on certain cell types but not others. As many cytokines use differences in receptor expression and signaling pathway components to achieve cell type selectivity, this approach may be more generally applicable to other pleiotropic cytokines.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Constructs encoding mouse serum albumin (MSA, amino acids 19–608) fused to wild-type or mutant human IL-2 (amino acids 21–153) were cloned into the pAcGP67a vector (BD Biosciences) with an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and a C-terminal 6xHis tag.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Michael L Dustin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The elegant protein engineering and novelty of the IL-2 weak agonist development is appreciated by all reviewers. However all reviewers concurred that it would be better to test the in vivo function of the IL-2REH expanded Treg and in vivo IL-2REH effects on colitis development in a transfer colitis model, as opposed to the DSS model.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

Another essential experiment is to test lower doses of IL-2 as indicated by reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Bottom of page 6- the description of the single molecule tracking experiment to investigate receptor dimerisation is not clear. It seems that they have expressed β and common γ chains with the same GFP mutant, but them somehow tagged them with different dye labelled nano bodies and then tracked these on the surface to track movement of heterodimers. The authors need to better explain how β and common γ chains are selectively labelled- there must be some difference in the GFP tags or this would/could not work. The term co-locomotion is unconventional as it suggests that the receptors are self-propelled on the surface of the cell. It should be possible to determine if the motion is diffusive and then co-diffusion. If there is an active component it would more typically be referred to as transport. Locomotion is a term more reserved for movement of cells.</p><p>Bottom of page 9- The way the authors refer to recipient and donor seems is written as if it refers to the mice, rather than the recipient (endogenous CD25+ and CD25-) or donor (CD25-) cells. The authors just need to clarify that it’s the cells they are referring to. The logic of the experiment is otherwise sound.</p><p>Bottom of page 13- they state that IL-2 REH mirrors two key features of IL-2 sensitivity in Treg. It’s not clear if &quot;mirrors&quot; is the correct term here. Would a better term be &quot;exploits&quot; in selective expansion of Treg in the steady state.</p><p>The authors use a DSS colitis model, which is not a classical autoimmune colitis, but more of a transient barrier disruption leading to inflammation that is influenced by T cells, but not directly T cell mediated as transfer colitis model. The in vivo results would be greatly clarified by repeating these points with the transfer colitis model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Many years ago, the laboratory of Chris Garcia embarked into a powerful research line under the general concept of &quot;separating&quot; the different functions of IL-2 from adverse effects as well as, more recently, the differential effects on regulatory T cells (Treg) and effector T cells and NK cells.</p><p>For example, some years ago the authors described that IL-2 activity was greater on CD25HI cells (e.g. Treg) in the presence of JES6-1, and greater on CD25LO cells (e.g. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) in the presence of S4B6. JES6-1 and S4B6 are two different anti-IL-2 antibodies.</p><p>Chris Garcia's lab also was involved in the generation of several IL-2 muteins, in which the Il2 gene was mutated to improve IL-2 binding to CD122. This generated an IL-2 molecule that was relatively more capable of expanding CTL than Treg, a &quot;superkine&quot; that was, at the time, sought after by cancer immunologists.</p><p>In their laboratory's current iteration, Dr. Garcia and co-workers added a number of mutations that weaken the binding to IL2Rg (CD132/Common gc). Their successful structural predictions led to IL-2 muteins that display reduced STAT5 phosphorylation at saturating mutein doses. This manuscript is another useful attempt to understand the differential effects of IL-2, and the practical implications.</p><p>Of the shown IL-2 muteins, IL-2-REH is the one with highest phospho-STAT5-inducing activity. It is also the one that induces the highest expansion of Treg cells. Comparatively with IL-2, IL-2-REH is a better inducer of Treg expansion and a poor inducer of CTL expansion and gene expression. Other muteins may have too low an activity on IL-2 receptor to trigger any of the IL-2 functions. The dependence of IL-2-REH on IL2ra for signaling was shown by a number of independent ways, and is convincing.</p><p>1. This is not an issue unique to this paper, but it is unclear why IL-2, but, to some degree also IL-2-REH, cause splenomegaly with granulocytosis. Granulocytes don't express IL-2 receptors, so why are they recruited so early and in such high numbers? There must be a very powerful proinflammatory signal produced by NK cells or conventional T cells in response to IL-2. If IL-2-REH is to become a therapy, it would require repeated administration, and, perhaps, it would induce granulocytosis as well in a chronic setting. The readers will benefit from a discussion on this topic.</p><p>2. Does IL-2-REH induce IL2ra expression in conventional CD4 cells and CD8 T cells, as does IL-2? The blasts used in Figure 5 are not generated using IL-2 muteins, and IL2ra did not make it to the top 30 genes in Figure 4, so I can't tell. If IL2ra expression is induced by IL-2-REH in conventional T cells, wouldn't one expect that, after a brief delay, IL-2-REH would lead to the proliferation of conventional T cells as well?</p><p>3. It is important to characterize the duration of Treg increase (also quality) in vivo, much beyond day 7 post IL-2-REH treatment beginning.</p><p>4. From the early Foxp3 days, it was apparent that there is a subset (10-20%) of Foxp3+ Tregs that are CD25-low, in a continuum pattern. In Dr. Garcia's data, both the IL-2 and IL-2-REH expanded Tregs express higher surface IL2ra than the untreated cells or H9-REH-treated cells. Unless the effect is short-lived, the level (MFI) of surface IL2ra expression attained in each case may be correlating with the functionality of the Tregs, and could be another important parameter to consider for suppression of autoimmune disease in vivo.</p><p>5. I don't understand the result in Figure 5H, left panel. SOCS1 inhibits IL-2 signaling, but, in this experiment, overexpression of SOCS1 does not appear to have any effect on STAT5 phosphorylation when IL-2 was added. Do CTLL-2 cells express so much intrinsic SOCS1, that overexpression becomes irrelevant? Perhaps the reverse experiment (Socs1 knockdown) should have been attempted. How are the basal levels of SOCS1 in Tconv and Treg, and how does IL-2 and IL-2-REH affects SOCS1 expression?</p><p>6. The DSS Colitis experiment is somewhat disappointing. While IL-2-REH drives a striking increase of Treg in mLN and of Foxp3+Gzmb+ cells the colonic tissue, the level of protection from disease is not striking. What other variables could be participating in the amelioration? Perhaps another colitis model, such as the adoptive transfer model (also called the Powrie model), might be beneficial, as it would even test the stability of the transferred Tregs in host mice that did not receive IL-2 or IL-2 muteins.</p><p>My conclusion is that this is an important contribution, but some experiments that are easy to perform could add valuable information to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>First paragraph of the introduction lacks references.</p><p>Page 3 Line 14: &quot;severe&quot;</p><p>Page 6 line 12: It is not clear what RETR is.</p><p>Figure 1 and S1: S1 pSTAT5 MFI shows that human IL-2 saturates the pSTAT5 at 100 nM while H9 (high affinity variant for IL-2Rb) saturates it at 102 nM. This seems to contradict with the justification of the use of H9 instead of WT IL-2. However, towards the end of the Results section H9 is more properly described and referenced as &quot;IL-2 variant with high affinity for IL-2Rb and reduced dependence on IL-2Ra (Levin et al.,2012)&quot;. This should come upfront at Figure 1 for clarity. Also, although it is a minor point, if there are TIRF and SPR data for WT IL-2, they can replace the H9 data in Figure 1 or be added to Supplementary Figure 1 as IL-2Ra dependency of REH variants may account for some differences in those readouts too.</p><p>Figure 2 and S2: In Figure 2 A-D and S2 B-F, PBS injected spleen percentages add up to more than 100% while the total numbers don't match the T and B percentages. The graphs may come from different experiments, so authors should clarify the mismatches and replace the graphs.</p><p>Figure 2 would also benefit from showing a decrease in the total numbers of Foxp3-CD4<sup>+</sup> effector cells in complementary to the increase in Treg #. IFNγ production of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can also be added to the supplementary figures.</p><p>P8 Line 14: &quot;increased cytotoxicity&quot; instead of &quot;increase cytotoxicity&quot;</p><p>Figure 3-4-5: Well-performed experiments with clear findings.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>The data presented by the authors are promising, albeit brief. In the colitis model, although IL-2-REH treated mice displayed faster and greater recovery, especially at later time points, findings may be reflective of the IL-2 dose administered. DSS colitis is a chemical injury model that represents the physiology of mucosal healing in human ulcerative colitis, however it is inferior to CD45RBhi CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis model in the way it represents the contribution of effector and regulatory T cells.</p><p>In order to reach a fair conclusion about the therapeutic effect of IL2-REH on colitis, it should also be compared to lower doses of IL-2. The in vitro findings provided in Figure 5 supplement 1 suggest that the negative effects of IL-2 can be alleviated or at least matched to that of IL2-REH at low IL-2 doses. Figure 5 supplement 1 indicates that minimum IL-2 dose (100 nM) that provides maximum pSTAT5 signaling in Tregs doesn't induce signaling in any of the effector cells except for the CD4 blasts. Therefore, a more ideal approach for characterizing the therapeutic effects of IL2-REH in vivo should involve comparison of different IL-2 and IL-2-REH doses in CD45RBhi CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis model. In such a system, the activity of CD45RBlow CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory cells can be tested with or without IL-10 blockade, however blockade experiment is not crucial.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Calibration of cell-intrinsic Interleukin-2 response thresholds guides design of a regulatory T cell biased agonist&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two of the original reviewers.</p><p>You have used structure based design to create IL-2-REH, a partial agonist that can promote preferential expansion of Treg in vivo. Testing IL-2-REH in two models of auto inflammatory disease- the DSS and transfer colitis models- you have found protection in the DSS model, but not the transfer colitis model, despite increase Treg numbers.

The point that IL2REH can promote proliferation, yet not improve the clinical outcome in the model is an important point for the field and should be included in the final paper.</p><p>1. Incorporate the transfer colitis data on Treg expansion and clinical scores in a supplemental figure and discuss the implications for the advance in selective Treg expansion, but remaining challenges to translate this into clinical impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have evaluated IL-2-REH in a different colitis model and tested a range of doses in the DSS model. The results support the ability of IL-2-REH to selectively expand Treg, but the clinical scores in the transfer colitis model were worse with IL-2-REH, even as Treg expansion was increased. The authors have addressed a number of minor issues in the text and added additional discussion that improve the manuscript. The authors have addressed a challenge related to selective expansion of Treg in vivo, but the limitation is that expansion of Treg may not be sufficient, in all cases, to achieve remission of inflammatory disease.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>While the authors have spent praiseworthy effort on revising the key points raised by reviewers, some points require further clarification and revision. Because of the marginal effects of both IL-2 and IL-2-REH in DSS colitis and slightly disease-exacerbating potential of IL2-REH in the adoptive transfer colitis model, one should be extra cautious to mention the therapeutic effects of this particular IL-2 mutein in colitis. One of the reasons for the unexpected outcome in transfer colitis might actually be due to the timing of initial cytokine dose (day 24) which could have tipped the balance off towards effector activation. Therefore, it would be useful to share transfer colitis data with readers adding also a relevant statement into Discussion section stating the reservations about therapeutic effects of IL-2-REH, at least in the colitis models tested.</p><p>I agree that the transfer colitis model, while powerful, is unlikely to show differences between untreated and cytokine treated groups given the data presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 2. However, instead of replacing it with DSS-induced colitis model that only shows some marginal effect and in vitro suppression assays one should rather consider titrating the transferred CD45RBlo/Foxp3.GFP numbers down in transfer colitis setting. This may provide some room for Treg expansion and the effects of cytokine treatment may be visible if a regimen with earlier cytokine doses is adapted. Furthermore, the in vitro suppression assay graph in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 is insufficient without a &quot;No Treg&quot; control to evaluate the degree of suppression in the Treg+ groups.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65777.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

In the reviewer’s suggested experiment, T cell transfer colitis, disease is induced by homeostatic proliferation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, an effect that is suppressed by co-transfer of regulatory T cells. Classic experiments by Fiona Powrie’s group use expression of CD45RB to identify naïve cells (CD45RB<sup>hi</sup>) which are transferred alone or in conjunction with CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> cells, of which the CD25+ Treg fraction is critical (Read et al., 2000). In our hands, Tregs account for 40-50% of CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> cells in untreated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Given the abundance of Tregs among CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> population, we would expect that Tregs from PBS, IL-2 and IL-2-REH all to induce similar levels of disease suppression since, importantly, we have shown that IL-2-REH expanded Tregs retain their suppressive capacity in vitro (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), but that their suppressive capacity does not exceed that of Treg cells expanded by IL-2.</p><p>For these reasons, we feel that T cell transfer colitis experiments using IL-2-REH expanded Tregs will provide limited additional value beyond the data presented in current Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 showing that IL-2-REH expanded Tregs retain suppressive capacity.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of Foxp3 in CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> and CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> cells.</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD3+CD4<sup>+</sup>) from spleen of B6-Foxp3<sup>EGFP</sup> mice were gated on CD45RB expression based on a previously established protocol (Ostanin et al., 2009).

The effect of IL-2REH during the colitis induction by Teff of Teff + Treg.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed transfer colitis experiments in which CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> cells were co-transferred with or without Tregs and mice were dosed with IL-2-REH at the onset of weight loss. For these experiments, we only administered IL-2-REH to mice which received Tregs as we have previously shown that IL-2-REH does not induce the differentiation of Tregs from Tcons (Figure 2A-C). Under these conditions, IL-2-REH expands Tregs but does not provide a therapeutic benefit (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B/C). In fact, IL-2-REH administration at this late time point exacerbated disease, likely by a small degree of potentiation of CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> cells which become activated (CD25+) during colitis induction. We do not think the lack of therapeutic efficacy in this experiment compromises the message of the paper or the value of IL-2REH as a new class of mechanism-based Treg potentiators with possible utility in autoimmune diseases. In the clinical situation IL-2REH will be administered systemically, as we did for the DSS model.</p><p>More generally, we wish to emphasize that our collective findings in the paper were more to highlight a new class of cell-selective IL-2 analogs, and the concept of exploiting cell type intrinsic response thresholds by cytokines in vivo, which certainly has therapeutic relevance as we have shown, but the paper falls far short of definitive proof of IL-2REH utility as a drug for autoimmune disease. Indeed, the clinical utility of Treg expansion by any means for treating autoimmunity, remains to be determined. We could make minor text modification to the manuscript to better balance the conceptual advances with the clinical implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another essential experiment is to test lower doses of IL-2 as indicated by reviewer 3.</p></disp-quote><p>The dose of IL-2 used in the DSS colitis experiments (5mg of MSA-hIL-2, every 2 days) is similar to that used in low-dose IL-2 regimes for the treatment of diabetes in NOD mice when adjusted for the molecular weight of albumin (Grinberg-Bleyer et al., 2010). However, we have also performed DSS experiments at even lower doses of IL-2 similar to those used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (He et al., 2020). Administration of ultra-low-dose IL-2 does not provide a therapeutic benefit in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).

In the revised manuscript, we have included a more detailed description of this approach in the method section and main text (Page 6, lines 18-21) as well as Figure 1C-D and the corresponding part of the figure legend.

Given that we see similar suppression of Tcon proliferation by Tregs isolated from PBS, IL-2 and IL-2-REH treated mice and that Tregs already represent a high proportion of CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> cells in untreated mice, we would not expect to see differences between groups using the T cell transfer colitis model with pre-expanded Tregs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Many years ago, the laboratory of Chris Garcia embarked into a powerful research line under the general concept of &quot;separating&quot; the different functions of IL-2 from adverse effects as well as, more recently, the differential effects on regulatory T cells (Treg) and effector T cells and NK cells.</p><p>For example, some years ago the authors described that IL-2 activity was greater on CD25HI cells (e.g. Treg) in the presence of JES6-1, and greater on CD25LO cells (e.g. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) in the presence of S4B6. JES6-1 and S4B6 are two different anti-IL-2 antibodies.</p><p>Chris Garcia's lab also was involved in the generation of several IL-2 muteins, in which the Il2 gene was mutated to improve IL-2 binding to CD122. This generated an IL-2 molecule that was relatively more capable of expanding CTL than Treg, a &quot;superkine&quot; that was, at the time, sought after by cancer immunologists.</p><p>In their laboratory's current iteration, Dr. Garcia and co-workers added a number of mutations that weaken the binding to IL2Rg (CD132/Common gc). Their successful structural predictions led to IL-2 muteins that display reduced STAT5 phosphorylation at saturating mutein doses. This manuscript is another useful attempt to understand the differential effects of IL-2, and the practical implications.</p><p>Of the shown IL-2 muteins, IL-2-REH is the one with highest phospho-STAT5-inducing activity. It is also the one that induces the highest expansion of Treg cells. Comparatively with IL-2, IL-2-REH is a better inducer of Treg expansion and a poor inducer of CTL expansion and gene expression. Other muteins may have too low an activity on IL-2 receptor to trigger any of the IL-2 functions. The dependence of IL-2-REH on IL2ra for signaling was shown by a number of independent ways, and is convincing.</p><p>1. This is not an issue unique to this paper, but it is unclear why IL-2, but, to some degree also IL-2-REH, cause splenomegaly with granulocytosis. Granulocytes don't express IL-2 receptors, so why are they recruited so early and in such high numbers? There must be a very powerful proinflammatory signal produced by NK cells or conventional T cells in response to IL-2. If IL-2-REH is to become a therapy, it would require repeated administration, and, perhaps, it would induce granulocytosis as well in a chronic setting. The readers will benefit from a discussion on this topic.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the expansion of granulocytes upon systemic IL-2 administration is most likely a secondary effect induced by NK cell or T cell secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This effect is greatly attenuated with IL-2-REH such that there is not a significant difference in granulocyte frequency or number following REH administration. We have updated the text to discuss this point (Page 8, lines 7-10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Does IL-2-REH induce IL2ra expression in conventional CD4 cells and CD8 T cells, as does IL-2? The blasts used in Figure 5 are not generated using IL-2 muteins, and IL2ra did not make it to the top 30 genes in Figure 4, so I can't tell. If IL2ra expression is induced by IL-2-REH in conventional T cells, wouldn't one expect that, after a brief delay, IL-2-REH would lead to the proliferation of conventional T cells as well?</p></disp-quote><p>Expression of <italic>Il2ra</italic> is more strongly induced by IL-2 than IL-2-REH in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Consistent with this effect, IL-2Ra surface expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3- cells was elevated by IL-2 but not IL-2-REH (Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and response to point 4 below). Given that our in vivo experiments last from 3-7 days and we do not observe significant expansion of conventional cells with IL-2-REH, we think it unlikely that IL-2-REH induces sufficient expression of IL-2Ra to enhance sensitivity of conventional T cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>Il2ra</italic> in CD8+ T cells following 4-hour stimulation with 200nM cytokine.</title><p>Reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) were normalized to unstimulated CD8+ T cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65777-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Following dosing of cytokine on day 0, 3 and 6, Tregs remain elevated for three days followed by contraction back to baseline levels 1 week after cessation of cytokine administration.

From the early Foxp3 days, it was apparent that there is a subset (10-20%) of Foxp3+ Tregs that are CD25-low, in a continuum pattern. In Dr. Garcia's data, both the IL-2 and IL-2-REH expanded Tregs express higher surface IL2ra than the untreated cells or H9-REH-treated cells. Unless the effect is short-lived, the level (MFI) of surface IL2ra expression attained in each case may be correlating with the functionality of the Tregs, and could be another important parameter to consider for suppression of autoimmune disease in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that IL-2 and IL-2-REH elicit increased IL-2Ra expression on Tregs. Despite these differences, Tregs from cytokine treated mice were similar in their suppressive capacity to Tregs from untreated mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Instead, the major effect of IL-2-REH appears to be expansion of Tregs rather than increased suppressive capacity on a per-cell basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I don't understand the result in Figure 5H, left panel. SOCS1 inhibits IL-2 signaling, but, in this experiment, overexpression of SOCS1 does not appear to have any effect on STAT5 phosphorylation when IL-2 was added. Do CTLL-2 cells express so much intrinsic SOCS1, that overexpression becomes irrelevant? Perhaps the reverse experiment (Socs1 knockdown) should have been attempted. How are the basal levels of SOCS1 in Tconv and Treg, and how does IL-2 and IL-2-REH affects SOCS1 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>The observation that SOCS1 overexpression does not inhibit IL-2 signaling in CTLL-2 cells may be due to the fact that CTLL-2 cells depend on IL-2 signaling for survival. Previously, CTLL-2s have been characterized to be low in SOCS1 expression through a transcriptional repression mechanism (Gregorieff et al., 2000). Our results suggest that the level of SOCS1 achieved by overexpression is sufficient to suppress IL-2-REH signaling but not IL-2 signaling.</p><p>These experiments were designed to test the role of SOCS1 in suppression of IL-2-REH signaling as Tregs have previously been shown to express low levels of SOCS1 through a micro-RNA dependent mechanism (Lu et al., 2009). To the authors second question about the effects of cytokine on SOCS1 expression, we see that IL-2 induces <italic>Socs1</italic> expression in both Tregs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following 4-hour stimulation with 200nM cytokine while REH induces <italic>Socs1</italic> selectively in Tregs although to a lesser extent than seen with REH (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B/C). Given the acute nature of the stimulations used in Figure 5H-I, we think that feedback is unlikely to explain these results, however, induction of SOCS1 by IL-2 may serve to inhibit STAT signaling in vivo where cytokines are administered over a longer time scale.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>Socs1</italic> in Tregs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following 4-hour stimulation with 200nM cytokine.</title><p>Reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) were normalized to unstimulated cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65777-resp-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The DSS Colitis experiment is somewhat disappointing. While IL-2-REH drives a striking increase of Treg in mLN and of Foxp3+Gzmb+ cells the colonic tissue, the level of protection from disease is not striking. What other variables could be participating in the amelioration? Perhaps another colitis model, such as the adoptive transfer model (also called the Powrie model), might be beneficial, as it would even test the stability of the transferred Tregs in host mice that did not receive IL-2 or IL-2 muteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments on the effects of IL-2-REH in the DSS-induced colitis model. While IL-2-REH does not prevent induction of weight loss, these experiments show that IL-2-REH is capable of expanding Tregs in the context of an inflammatory response and reducing disease severity as measured by histological score and body weight. As mentioned in our response to ‘essential revision #1’, we feel that the transfer colitis model, while powerful, is unlikely to show differences between untreated and cytokine treated groups given the high prevalence of Tregs among CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> cells in naïve mice. For this reason, we think that the DSS-induced colitis model and in vitro suppression assays shown in Figure 6 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 better capture the effects of IL-2-REH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My conclusion is that this is an important contribution, but some experiments that are easy to perform could add valuable information to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their constructive suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>First paragraph of the introduction lacks references.</p><p>Page 3 Line 14: &quot;severe&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6 line 12: It is not clear what RETR is.</p></disp-quote><p>A description of H9-RETR has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 and S1: S1 pSTAT5 MFI shows that human IL-2 saturates the pSTAT5 at 100 nM while H9 (high affinity variant for IL-2Rb) saturates it at 102 nM.

However, towards the end of the Results section H9 is more properly described and referenced as &quot;IL-2 variant with high affinity for IL-2Rb and reduced dependence on IL-2Ra (Levin et al.,2012)&quot;. This should come upfront at Figure 1 for clarity. Also, if there are TIRF and SPR data for WT IL-2, they can replace the H9 data in Figure 1 or be added to Supplementary Figure 1 as IL-2Ra dependency of REH variants may account for some differences in those readouts too.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more complete description of super-2 (page 6, line 1). The use of super-2 for initial characterization was to account for differences in EC50 between IL-2 and partial agonists (compare Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These differences are likely due to a high level of cooperativity in the binding of IL-2Rb and gc (Wang et al., 2005). The biochemical data looking at receptor dimerization was performed in the absence of IL-2Ra to focus on the impact of gc-interface mutations on IL-2 receptor dimerization. In these cases, super-2 is necessary to allow comparison of partial agonists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 and S2: In Figure 2 A-D and S2 B-F, PBS injected spleen percentages add up to more than 100% while the total numbers don't match the T and B percentages.

As explained in our response to ‘essential revision #3’, the 5mg dose of MSA-IL-2 used in these experiments is similar to that used previously to assess low-dose IL-2 in treatment of non-obese diabetic mice when adjusted for the molecular weight of albumin (Grinberg-Bleyer et al., 2010). We have further characterized the impact of ultra-low dose IL-2 on DSS-induced colitis, however, we do not find enhanced benefit at 1mg or 0.2mg of MSA-IL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The text has been updated to include an explanation of the dosing strategy used in the DSS experiments (page 14, lines 17-19).</p><p>While we agree with the reviewer that the role of Tregs in the T cell transfer colitis model has been well established, the high frequency of Tregs among CD45RB<sup>lo</sup> cells in naïve mice means that IL-2-REH is unlikely to provide additional benefit relative to Tregs from PBS treated mice.

The in vitro findings provided in Figure 5 supplement 1 suggest that the negative effects of IL-2 can be alleviated or at least matched to that of IL2-REH at low IL-2 doses. Figure 5 supplement 1 indicates that minimum IL-2 dose (100 nM) that provides maximum pSTAT5 signaling in Tregs doesn't induce signaling in any of the effector cells except for the CD4 blasts. Therefore, a more ideal approach for characterizing the therapeutic effects of IL2-REH in vivo should involve comparison of different IL-2 and IL-2-REH doses in CD45RBhi CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell transfer colitis model. In such a system, the activity of CD45RBlow CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory cells can be tested with or without IL-10 blockade, however blockade experiment is not crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, the dose of IL-2 used in the DSS-colitis experiments (5mg of MSA-IL-2 every other day) is similar to the previously established ‘low dose IL-2’ used for the reversal of non-obese diabetes when adjusted for the molecular weight of albumin fusion (Grinberg-Bleyer et al., 2010) and the text has been updated to include this information (page 14, lines 17-19).

Because of the marginal effects of both IL-2 and IL-2-REH in DSS colitis and slightly disease-exacerbating potential of IL2-REH in the adoptive transfer colitis model, one should be extra cautious to mention the therapeutic effects of this particular IL-2 mutein in colitis. One of the reasons for the unexpected outcome in transfer colitis might actually be due to the timing of initial cytokine dose (day 24) which could have tipped the balance off towards effector activation. Therefore, it would be useful to share transfer colitis data with readers adding also a relevant statement into Discussion section stating the reservations about therapeutic effects of IL-2-REH, at least in the colitis models tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a more complete discussion of the in vivo effects of IL-2-REH specifically and Treg expansion more generally would be of use. To this end, we now present the transfer colitis data in Figure 6 —figure supplement 2 and discussion of differences in DSS and transfer colitis models (page 16 lines 19-22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree that the transfer colitis model, while powerful, is unlikely to show differences between untreated and cytokine treated groups given the data presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 2. However, instead of replacing it with DSS-induced colitis model that only shows some marginal effect and in vitro suppression assays one should rather consider titrating the transferred CD45RBlo/Foxp3.GFP numbers down in transfer colitis setting. This may provide some room for Treg expansion and the effects of cytokine treatment may be visible if a regimen with earlier cytokine doses is adapted. Furthermore, the in vitro suppression assay graph in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 is insufficient without a &quot;No Treg&quot; control to evaluate the degree of suppression in the Treg+ groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that under conditions of limiting Tregs, IL-2-REH may be able to provide Treg expansion such that colitis is suppressed. Indeed, this was the aim of the transfer colitis in Figure 6—figure supplement 2. We used a 1:30 CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> to Treg ratio, however, Tregs were still suppressive even at this low ratio. While we agree that optimization of the transfer colitis model may demonstrate the efficacy of IL-2-REH treatment under conditions of limiting Tregs or with altered timing, we feel that the scope of these experiments is beyond that of the current study.</p><p>To the reviewers second point, a “No Treg” control was included in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 (see upper FACS plots) but for clarity we have now included a dashed line in the plot to indicate the CellTrace Violet dilution in the absence of Tregs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
