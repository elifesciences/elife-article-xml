cells. In ExM, samples are embedded in a swellable polymer gel to physically expand the sample and isotropically increase resolution in x, y, and z. The maximum resolution increase is limited by the expansion factor of the gel, which is four-fold for the original ExM protocol. Variations on the original ExM method have been reported that allow for greater expansion factors but at the cost of ease of adoption or versatility. Here, we systematically explore the ExM recipe space and present a novel method termed Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) that, like the original ExM method, requires no specialized equipment or procedures. We demonstrate that TREx gels expand 10-fold, can be handled easily, and can be applied to both thick mouse brain tissue sections and cultured human cells enabling high-resolution subcellular imaging with a single expansion step. Furthermore, we show that TREx can provide ultrastructural context to subcellular protein localization by combining antibody-stained samples with off-the-shelf small-molecule stains for both total protein and membranes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>super-resolution</kwd><kwd>expansion microscopy</kwd><kwd>sub-organelle imaging</kwd><kwd>immunofluorescence</kwd><kwd>light microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Spinoza Prize</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Consolidator Grant 819219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapitein</surname><given-names>Lukas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohar</surname><given-names>Boaz</given-names></name><name><surname>Eddison</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Tillberg</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) is a new method for 10-fold physical expansion of specimens in one round of gel embedding, enabling nanoscale imaging of antibody stains and ultrastructural detail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Expansion microscopy (ExM) circumvents the diffraction limit of light microscopy by physically expanding the specimen four-fold in each dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>). Expansion is achieved by chemically anchoring proteins and other biomolecules directly to a hyper-swelling gel, followed by aggressive proteolysis to enable uniform swelling of the gel material. While other super-resolution approaches are not readily compatible with thick tissue slices and require specialized optics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</xref>), fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rust et al., 2006</xref>), or software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gustafsson, 2000</xref>), ExM is compatible with any microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), including other super-resolution modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Halpern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), and performs well in both cultured cells and thick tissue slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>). Assuming sufficiently high labeling density, the resolution increase of ExM depends on the expansion factor of the gel recipe used. Recently, ExM variants have been described that seek to improve resolution by increasing the expansion factor. For example, iterative ExM (iExM) uses sequential embedding in multiple expansion gels to achieve 15Ã and greater expansion but requires a complex sequence of gel re-embedding, link cleaving, and fluorophore transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2017</xref>), limiting its broad adoption.</p><p>The expansion factor of the gel itself can be improved by decreasing the concentration of crosslinker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okay, 2009</xref>), usually bisacrylamide (bis), although this is generally at the expense of the mechanical integrity of the gel. For example, reducing the bis concentration in the original ExM recipe from 1.5 to 0.25 mg/mL produces an approximately nine-fold expanding gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>, SF5), but these gels are too soft to hold their shape under the force of gravity. As a result, they are difficult to handle without breaking and display nonuniform expansion. This tradeoff of expansion versus gel mechanical integrity has not been explored in a quantitative or systematic way.</p><p>Another gel recipe variant, using a high concentration of the monomer dimethylacrylamide (DMAA), has enough crosslinking through side reactions and polymer chain entanglement that the crosslinker can be omitted entirely, producing ~10-fold expansion in one step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Truckenbrodt et al., 2018</xref>). This recipe has been used to expand cultured cells and thin cryosectioned tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Truckenbrodt et al., 2019</xref>), but reportedly requires rigorous degassing to remove oxygen prior to gelation, making it laborious to use. Moreover, expansion of thick tissue slices (&gt;50 Âµm) has not been demonstrated using this method. Thus, a robustly validated and easily adoptable method that is compatible with multiple sample types and enables single-step expansion well over 4Ã without compromising gel integrity is lacking.</p><p>Here, we explored the expansion gel recipe space in a systematic manner, assessing the limits of single-round expansion using reagents and methods that would be familiar to labs already performing ExM. For any given choice of recipe parameters (monomer concentrations, gelation temperature, initiator concentration, etc.), varying the crosslinker alone yielded a family of recipes whose expansion factor and mechanical quality vary smoothly from high-expanding, mechanically unstable to low-expanding, tough gels. A range of crosslinker concentrations was tested for each family because the optimal crosslinker concentration may vary by family. From this exploration, we generated Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx), an optimized ExM method that allows for robust 10-fold expansion in a single step. We show that TREx can be used to expand both thick tissue slices and adherent cells. It is compatible with antibodies and off-the-shelf small-molecule stains for total protein and membranes. Together, we show that TREx enables 3D nanoscopic imaging of specific structures stained with antibodies in combination with cellular ultrastructure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To systematically explore the expansion recipe space, we developed a streamlined approach for synthesizing dozens of gel recipes and characterizing their mechanical quality in parallel. For every set of gel recipe parameters (component concentrations and gelation temperature, listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we define a recipe family as the set of recipes generated by varying the crosslinker (bisacrylamide) concentration. For each family, we tested five recipes with crosslinker concentrations log-spaced from 1000 to 10 Âµg/mL, plus one with zero crosslinker. We also included the original ExM recipe, with 0.15% (1500 Âµg/mL) crosslinker. For each recipe, we cast three gel specimens, expanded them fully in water, and measured the expansion factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that resistance to deformation under the force of gravity was a good proxy for the more subjective judgment of ease of gel handling. We measured gel deformation by placing a semicircular punch from each gel upright on its curved edge and allowing the gel corners to deflect under the force of gravity. We defined the deformation index as the vertical displacement of each gel corner, divided by the gel radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which ranges from 0 (for gels that do not deform) to 1 (for gels that deform freely under their own weight). We manually calibrated this measurement, finding that deformation indices between 0 and 0.125 corresponded to gels with excellent ease of handling, 0.125â0.25 corresponded to acceptable ease of handling, and anything higher than 0.25 was unacceptable. While not as theoretically informative as elastic modulus and yield strength measurements, this measurement can be repeated and extended to new gel recipes by any lab developing expansion methods, without access to specialized equipment. We plotted the deformation index for each gel as a function of its expansion factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) to directly assess the tradeoff between expansion and mechanical quality.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) gel recipe.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parameters of gel recipe families explored, including component concentrations and gelation temperature.

Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>, reducing the crosslinker to 300 Âµg/mL increased the expansion to ~9Ã, below which the gels fail to form consistently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, purple). We next characterized a high-monomer recipe family (family B) inspired by the 4Ã-expanding Ultra-ExM recipe from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>, which found that a higher monomer concentration relative to the original ExM recipe was necessary for high-fidelity preservation of the shape of centrioles. This was offset with a lower crosslinker (bisacrylamide) concentration of 0.1% (1000 Âµg/mL) to achieve 4Ã expansion. Indeed, for this high-monomer family of recipes, expansion as a function of crosslinker concentration was shifted leftward compared to standard ExM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, blue). As the crosslinker was decreased below 30 Âµg/mL, the increase in expansion factor saturated around 11.5Ã. The deformation index versus expansion factor curve for the high-monomer family ran below that for standard ExM, indicating that for a given expansion factor the high-monomer gel holds its shape better than the corresponding standard ExM gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, blue).</p><p>Compared with standard ExM, this high-monomer family uses a higher concentration of radical initiator and accelerator to trigger polymerization (5 mg/mL each of APS and TEMED, versus 2 mg/mL in standard ExM). We found that this high initiation rate causes gels to form within minutes at room temperature (RT). Because the rates of initiation and polymerization increase with temperature, it is likely that specimens are not fully equilibrating to the gelation temperature of 37Â°C before the onset of gelation, introducing a potential source of experimental variability. This rapid gelation makes the gelation chamber assembly step more time sensitive and presents challenges for adapting the technique to thick tissue slices as thick tissue slices require extra time for the gelation solution to diffuse throughout the sample prior to polymerization. Therefore, we also tested the same high-monomer recipe family but with initiator and accelerator reduced to 1.5 mg/mL (family C). The expansion versus crosslinker curve for this family was similar to family B for high crosslinker concentrations but displayed a slightly greater slope. Unlike family B, the expansion factor did not saturate upon decreasing the crosslinker concentration. Instead, the expansion factor continued to increase to 13Ã expansion at 10 Âµg/mL crosslinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red), with zero-crosslinker gels failing to form. Family C enables 10-fold expansion without sacrificing acceptable gel mechanical quality (30 Âµg/mL bis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red), and without the faster, less controlled gelation kinetics of family B.</p><p>The recipe families explored above (B, C) feature a high fraction of sodium acrylate relative to acrylamide. Acrylate drives expansion of the gel but comes in widely varying purity levels and, in some cases, causes tissue to shrink. This macroscopic tissue shrinkage is modest compared to the gel expansion but may not be uniform at all scales. We therefore tested an alternative recipe family (D) with higher acrylamide to acrylate ratio (2.1:1). Increasing the acrylamide to acrylate ratio did not change the expansion factors appreciably at a given crosslinker concentration, suggesting that the swelling effect of acrylate saturates at high concentrations. At the maximum expansion factor of ~10, the deformation behavior was comparable to family C. We chose to proceed with family D due to its lower acrylate content.</p><p>We further tested an elevated gelation temperature of 50Â°C (family E) in an attempt to increase the initiation rate without introducing premature gelation as seen in recipe family B. Compared to family D, the expansion factors were around 15% higher at 100 Âµg/mL (6Ã) and 300 Âµg/mL crosslinker (9Ã), but gelation failed at lower concentrations, leaving family D as the family with a higher maximum expansion factor (i.e., 10Ã at 30 Âµg/mL bis). The deformation versus expansion curve for family E was similar to the other high-monomer recipe families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green), but was found to be sensitive to processing details, such as the gelation chamber construction and placement within the incubator. This suggests that premature gelation prior to equilibrating at the higher temperature reduces the replicability of this recipe family.</p><p>Considering all five recipe families, family B (high acrylate and high APS/TEMED) displayed the lowest deformation index for a given expansion factor. Family D (high acrylamide and low APS/TEMED) displayed similar performance, with the deformation index remaining well within the acceptable range for expansion factors up to 10. In handling high-expanding (&gt;8Ã) gels from all recipe families, we found that while those from the standard ExM family (A) were extremely prone to fragmentation, those from any of the high-monomer families could be handled more easily (and even dropped from a height of several feet) without breaking. Because the reduced initiator concentration of family D results in a slower and more controlled polymerization rate, and because we preferred a lower acrylate content, we chose this recipe family to proceed to biological specimen expansion. We found that the exact expansion factor varied for different specimens and gelation chamber geometries but could readily be adjusted by fine-tuning the crosslinker concentration. We thus recommend that users test gels with a range of crosslinker concentrations between 30 and 100 Âµg/mL to find a suitable recipe for their specimen preparation. We name the resulting method Ten-fold Robust Expansion (TREx) microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Subcellular imaging of specific proteins and cellular ultrastructure in thick brain slices</title><p>In electron microscopy, nonspecific stains for proteins and membranes are commonly used to provide structural detail at high spatial resolution. Recently, the use of nonspecific NHS ester protein stains and other small-molecule probes has been combined with ExM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MâSaad and Bewersdorf, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Expansion allows visualization of intracellular detail in such densely stained samples, which would otherwise be too crowded to lead to meaningful contrast. These applications have the promise to bring together the advantages of light microscopy (specific staining using antibodies and volumetric imaging) with the advantage of seeing cellular context typically provided by electron microscopy. Because TREx reaches single-step expansion factors at which small-molecule stains are expected to be useful, we set out to explore this idea further.</p><p>We applied the inexpensive, green-emitting dye BODIPY-FL NHS (total protein stain; see Materials and methods) after expansion with TREx to demonstrate total protein distribution in thick (100 Âµm) slices of mouse brain cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>). The neuropil region outside the cell somas contained a rich profusion of fibers and structures visible in sharp relief. The nucleus of each cell was easily identified, with especially strong staining in nucleoli-like structures. Surrounding each nucleus, the nuclear envelope could be identified, with particularly dense total protein stain on the side facing the nucleus. The nuclear envelope was punctuated by heavily stained spots that span the envelope, consistent with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset). Within the cytosol, several organelles were marked by either heavy inner staining with a dim border or weak inner staining.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) in mouse brain tissue slices.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mouse brain tissue (cortex) expanded using TREx, stained for total protein content with BODPIY-FL NHS, and imaged by confocal microscopy.

We tested a range of anchoring strengths by varying the concentration of the acryloyl-X SE (AcX) anchoring molecule applied prior to gelation. This was done in combination with two reduced disruption methods: proteinase K applied at one-tenth that of the original ExM method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, top row) and a high-temperature, protease-free denaturation treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ku et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zwettler et al., 2020</xref>) similar to that employed in Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, bottom row). The protease-free treatment enabled greater protein retention but at the cost of incomplete expansion. This could be offset through reduced AcX concentration, though this was not clearly superior to high AcX followed by proteolysis, indicating a general tradeoff between protein retention and gel expansion (see Materials and methods). We chose a hybrid approach with moderate AcX anchoring and low-concentration proteinase K digestion followed by high-temperature denaturation to proceed.</p><p>We next tested whether antibodies, applied to the tissue using a standard immunofluorescence procedure before embedding, were also retained in the TREx gel. We stained mouse brain cortex tissue for Bassoon (a marker for both excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic active zones), Homer (a marker for the excitatory postsynaptic apparatus), and VGAT (a vesicular GABA transporter in the presynaptic compartments of inhibitory synapses). After staining and anchoring with AcX, tissue was expanded with TREx and imaged by light sheet microscopy. Numerous putative excitatory synapses were observed at high density, with clearly separated Bassoon and Homer pre- and postsynaptic staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>). Because of the excellent axial resolution, TREx allowed us to quantify the separation of Bassoon and Homer in 3D, regardless of the angle of the synapse with respect to the imaging plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found an average separation of 1.17 Âµm Â± 0.52 Âµm (mean Â± SD, 583 synapses), which, when corrected for expansion, is consistent with previous reports in cultured neurons that estimated the synapse separation between 90 and 130 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glebov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wiesner et al., 2020</xref>). Compared with Bassoon and Homer, VGAT had a more extended staining pattern, consistent with the known distribution of synaptic vesicles throughout presynaptic boutons. Elaborately shaped compartments with dense VGAT staining were seen with multiple synaptic release sites marked by Bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, these release sites were not paired with the excitatory postsynaptic marker Homer. In addition, spatial correlation was observed in excitatory synapses between Homer and Bassoon, reflecting the transsynaptic alignment reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hruska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

To examine this, we explored the nanoscale isotropy of TREx by imaging NPCs, which have a highly stereotyped and well-characterized structure. The NPC constituent protein nucleoporin 96 (NUP96) appears in a ring structure with a 107 nm diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thevathasan et al., 2019</xref>). NPCs have recently been explored as a reference structure for super-resolution microscopy methods, including ExM in combination with other super-resolution methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pesce et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thevathasan et al., 2019</xref>). For the conventional 4â5Ã expansion approach, this revealed that the diameter of the NPC was 14â29% smaller than expected from the macroscopic expansion of the gel. We used the NUP96-GFP homozygous knock-in cell line from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thevathasan et al., 2019</xref> to study the quality of nuclear pore expansion using TREx with well-validated anti-GFP antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). After expansion with TREx, individual NPCs were uniformly retained and clearly visible using diffraction-limited confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). An antibody against NUP153 similarly demonstrated individual NPCs but with less complete NPC coverage compared with the antibody stain against the NUP96-GFP tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The macroscopic gel expansion factor was 9.5Ã, suggesting an expected NPC size after expansion of 107 nm Ã 9.5 = 1.02 Âµm. We used a semi-automated approach to determining the diameter of 60 NPCs randomly chosen from three nonadjacent cells and found the size after expansion to be 939 nm Â± 90 nm (mean Â± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This is about 8% smaller than expected based on the macroscopic expansion of the gel and implies a local expansion factor of 8.8Ã, or 92% of the expected 9.5Ã.

Measurement lengths between pairs of points after expansion were compared to the distance expected given uniform expansion, and the average fractional deviation plotted as a function of measurement length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). For a large tiled acquisition of 42 fields of view from one gel (~650 Ã 750 Âµm after expansion), the measurement error was found to be a constant fraction (3.2% Â± 1.7%) of the measurement length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We used the similarity transform to calculate the overall expansion factor of the entire imaged area and found it to be 9.4Ã, consistent with the expansion expected for the whole gel.

For membranes, a custom-synthesized membrane probe compatible with the ExM process has been shown to visualize membranes in fixed brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karagiannis et al., 2019</xref>). This probe relies on a peptide-modified lipid tail that intercalates in target membranes and provides opportunities for anchoring to the gel through D-lysines in its peptide sequence. We asked whether the commercially available membrane-binding probe mCLING could also be used for membrane staining and gel anchoring. mCLING has been developed as a fixable endocytosis marker consisting of a fluorophore and a short polypeptide group with one cysteine and seven lysines coupled to a palmitoyl membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Revelo and Rizzoli, 2016</xref>). Due to the presence of multiple lysines, we hypothesized that mCLING would be compatible with standard ExM anchoring through AcX. While the standard protocol for mCLING delivery relies on active endocytosis in living cells, we tested whether mCLING would stain intracellular membranes more uniformly when added to fixed cells, which would have the added benefit of not perturbing intracellular membrane trafficking by long incubation in live cells. To test this, we fixed activated Jurkat T cells, incubated the fixed cells with mCLING overnight, and proceeded with the TREx protocol. We found that mCLING efficiently intercalates in both the plasma membrane and internal organelles and is retained following our standard anchoring procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) can be used to visualize the ultrastructure of cellular membranes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volumetric render of Jurkat T cell activated on anti-CD3-coated coverslip fixed and stained using mCLING.

As in electron microscopy, where distinct morphologies are used to identify organelles, we could clearly identify different organelles based on mCLING, suggesting that it could be used for automated segmentation of organelles. Indeed, we found that mitochondria could be readily segmented using a trainable Weka segmentation algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arganda-Carreras et al., 2017</xref>). While the resolution of subcellular structures is limited by the density of mCLING moieties in the membrane, the efficiency of crosslinking to the gel, and the maximum expansion factor, we found that TREx allows sufficient single-step expansion to resolve individual mitochondrial cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which are known to be as closely spaced as 70 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stephan et al., 2019</xref>). Although mCLING is membrane impermeable in live cells (due to multiple positively charged amino groups), it readily stained fixed and unpermeabilized cells following extended incubation. Because this approach does not require labeling live cells and is expected to reduce differences in uptake efficiency between intracellular compartments, we used this approach in all subsequent experiments.</p><p>We next tested if mCLING could also be used to visualize membranes in more complex cell types. To test this, we used differentiated Caco-2 cells grown to form an epithelial monolayer. Using TREx, we could expand the entire monolayer and visualize membranes using mCLING (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâH</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4âvideo 2</xref>). The advantage of optical, volumetric imaging is underscored by the fact that we can easily render one dataset in several ways, either resembling scanning electron microscopy to highlight volumetric surface morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) or transmission electron microscopy to explore single planes in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). For example, we were able to resolve the elaborate interdigitated cell-cell junctions that could previously only be clearly appreciated using electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drenckhahn and Franz, 1986</xref>), as well as resolve individual microvilli as hollow membrane protrusions within the dense brush border. To underscore the significant resolution increase of TREx compared to standard ExM, we incubated expanded TREx gels with solutions of increasing ionic strength to shrink the gel back to ~4.5Ã the size of the pre-expanded gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). When the 10Ã and 4.5Ã expanded gels were imaged, dense brush borders of differentiated cells could only be resolved in the 10Ã gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To validate the expansion factor, we quantified the diameter of individual microvilli as these have been thoroughly characterized with EM with a diameter of ~100 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crawley et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we found an average diameter of 1.08 Â± 0.16 Âµm (n = 12,339 from 12 cells, N = 3), which, corrected for an expansion factor of 10, is within 8% of the value from electron microscopy. Together, these data illustrate the robustness of TREx in expanding multiple cell types and show how the increased expansion factor combined with a commercially available membrane stain provides rapid volumetric insights into the elaborate membranous architecture of cells.</p><p>Previously, we used ExM to study the three-dimensional organization of microtubules in neurons and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hooikaas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jurriens et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katrukha et al., 2021</xref>). In these experiments, cells were typically pre-extracted with detergent and glutaraldehyde to reduce background, followed by paraformaldehyde fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tas et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that the increased expansion of TREx would dilute the soluble tubulin background, resulting in a relative boost in signal over background and eliminating the need for pre-extraction to enable high-resolution imaging of microtubules in combination with membranes. To test this, we fixed cells without pre-extraction, treated them with mCLING, stained for tubulin, and imaged the stained cells both before and after expansion with TREx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, second panel). Expanded cells retained high-quality anti-tubulin antibody signal exhibiting high contrast relative to the cytosolic background.

Because small-molecule stains like mCLING do not rely on subsequent antibody amplification we reasoned that this decrease in linkage error should be reflected in the apparent size of subcellular structures. To test this, we quantified the diameter of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tubules that were stained by both mCLING and GFP-Sec61Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Indeed, we observed an average tubule diameter of 0.79 Â± 0.1 Âµm for mCLING, which, corrected for 10-fold expansion, is consistent with the previously published range of 60â100 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shibata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shibata et al., 2006</xref>), while the anti-GFP signal from the same tubules is broadened to an average diameter of 0.93 Â± 0.1 Âµm.

Thus, TREx facilitates high-resolution three-dimensional mapping of specific cytoskeletal and membranous structures in combination with markers that provide ultrastructural context.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether TREx using general membrane stains could be combined with general protein stains and/or antibody stains. U2OS cells transfected with GFP-Sec61Î² were fixed, treated with mCLING, stained for GFP, and expanded with TREx followed by the NHS stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Because we performed the NHS stain after disruption, we used high-temperature denaturing disruption rather than proteolytic digestion. We found that secondary antibodies that had been used to stain GFP before gelation withstood this disruption step. We observed a clear degree of overlap between mCLING and NHS, especially in the dense perinuclear region, but we could also identify distinct features of each stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, bottom). These results demonstrate that general stains for membranes and proteins can be combined with antibody-based labeling to reveal specific proteins in their ultrastructural context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We developed TREx in order to expand biological specimens 10-fold in a single round of expansion, without specialized equipment or procedures. In developing this method, we established a framework for assessing gel recipes operating near this apparent limit of single-round expansion. We found that the mechanical performance of gel recipes, that is, resistance to deformation versus gel expansion factor, varies smoothly with changes in crosslinker. For all high-monomer (~3 molar total acrylamide and acrylate) gel recipe families, the relation between expansion factor and crosslinker concentration fell close to a common curve. The high radical initiation rate of family B enabled gelation without the inclusion of a crosslinker, suggesting that side reactions and polymer entanglement in these conditions create sufficient network crosslinks to form a gel. Gel deformation measurements plotted versus expansion factor, though less precise, also show high-monomer recipe families falling close to a common curve. Compared to the high-monomer families, the original ExM recipe family is less resistant to deformation for a given expansion factor and expands more for a given crosslinker concentration. The factor determining gel properties is not crosslinker concentration in the gel recipe per se, but rather the density of effective crosslinks formed between neighboring polymer chains in the gel. This suggests that the original, low-monomer recipe less efficiently incorporates crosslinker molecules as network crosslinks. This may be because the resulting lower rate of chain extension allows incorporated crosslinker molecules to be re-reacted by the same polymer chain before they can react with neighboring polymers.</p><p>While the expansion factor of the original ExM recipe can be tuned by varying the crosslinker concentration, it has been shown that increasing the monomer content is required to maintain nanoscale isotropy using centrioles as a convenient standard reference structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>). Considering gel quality versus expansion factor alone, the high-monomer recipe family B derived from the U-ExM recipe allows for a 10-fold expanding gel (at crosslinker concentration of 30 Âµg/mL) with a low deformation index of 0.13. However, the high radical initiation rate used in this family (5 mg/mL APS and TEMED) results in fast gelation. This increases the time sensitivity of mounting the specimen in the gelation chamber and adds an additional challenge for adapting the method to thick tissues, which require extended incubation in the gelation solution. Recipe families C and D solve this problem by reducing initiation rates at a slight expense of mechanical performance compared with family B. Like family B, family C has a high acrylate content, which might contribute to imaging artifacts due to shrinkage of the sample prior to gelation and inconsistent acrylate purity. Family D reduces the acrylate content by half while retaining similar mechanical performance to family C, especially in the 10-fold expansion regime. Finally, with family E we explored whether increasing the gelation temperature to 50Â°C would produce the improved mechanical performance of family B (through increased temperature-dependent radical initiation) without premature gelation at RT. However, we found that this reduced the expansion factor and increased susceptibility to experimental variation. Therefore, we based our TREx recipe on recipe family D. The exact crosslinker concentration that produces 10-fold expanding gels can vary due to differences in gelation chamber design, so we recommend that each lab test a range of crosslinker concentrations between 30-60 ppm using their choice of specimen, gelation chamber, and incubator.</p><p>We applied TREx to mouse brain tissue slices stained either for specific targets with antibodies, or for total protein distribution with NHS ester dyes. Single-round 10-fold expansion with TREx followed by total protein staining was sufficient to reveal densely packed axons and dendrites running through the neuropil, while individual organelles could be resolved within the neuronal soma. The nuclear envelope, along with presumptive NPCs, was also clearly resolved. The correct relative localizations of pre- and postsynaptic markers and presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles stained with standard immunofluorescence were also retained in TREx-expanded tissue slices. For this characterization, we used a hybrid disruption approach incorporating reduced proteinase K digestion followed by high-temperature denaturation. We adopted this hybrid approach because we had noticed that sometimes the reduced protease treatment alone produces underexpanded nuclei while the protease-free treatment alone produced underexpanded synapses. In general, a higher degree of anchoring requires higher disruption strength to achieve full expansion on the macroscopic level. Further application-specific optimization may be beneficial, given the heterogeneity of biological tissue. For applications where maximizing total protein retention is not a priority, we recommend simply using a high concentration of proteinase K (e.g., 1:100 dilution, overnight).</p><p>We validated the nanoscale isotropy of TREx by comparing the size of well-characterized subcellular structures to values from literature. These include NPCs, ER tubules, CCPs, and microvilli. In the case of NPCs, the conventional 4Ã expansion approach yielded an NPC diameter 14â29% smaller than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pesce et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thevathasan et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that protein-dense complexes may resist full expansion. Using TREx, the average NPC diameter was 8% smaller than the expected value. Further optimization of anchoring and disruption conditions may improve expansion uniformity for protein-dense structures such as NPCs. The widths of CCPs, ER tubules, and microvilli measured with TREx are reasonable, given the variation in previously measured sizes of these structures or different staining and imaging modalities. Notably, we observed the broadening of apparent ER tubule width due to antibody linkage error compared to direct membrane labeling with mCLING.</p><p>In addition to nanoscale isotropy, we characterized the overall expansion isotropy by comparing microtubules before and after expansion, finding expansion-induced measurement errors on average 3.2% of a given measurement length. Although these errors do not saturate at sub-100 Âµm distances as they do for lower-expanding gels, the nanoscale fidelity over short length scales is in line with previous expansion methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tillberg et al., 2016</xref>) and accumulation of nanoscale deformation over longer distances is not a limiting factor for most biological applications. For experiments that would require lower long-distance deformations, we expect these deformations could be reduced through optimized gel handling and mounting.</p><p>We further demonstrated the utility of TREx for the study of cell biology through combinations with several staining modalities in cultured cells, prepared in several culture formats. After a single round of expansion with TREx, the commercially available membrane stain mCLING was able to clearly resolve the internal structure of mitochondria and the detailed pattern of plasma membrane ruffling in activated Jurkat T cells. While these structures would be readily resolved with electron microscopy of mechanically sectioned cells, we were able to do so in the context of complete cells, enabling detection and automated segmentation of mitochondria clustered followed T cell activation. Caco-2 cells grown on permeable filters were also successfully stained with mCLING and expanded with TREx to reveal the detailed structure of epithelial microvilli and membrane interdigitations at the contacts of neighboring cells. These structures had previously been known from electron microscopy but were now imaged with ease in the context of entire cell monolayers. Successful application of TREx to filter-cultured Caco-2 cells further demonstrates the robustness of TREx because we had repeatedly failed to cleanly recover epithelial cultures using standard ExM. We speculate that this may be due to the increased robustness of TREx to interactions between the silicone filter material and the gelation process. This robustness is further demonstrated by its adoption in other biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gros et al., 2021</xref>) including in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ozkan et al., 2021</xref>) and primary cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nijenhuis et al., 2021</xref>), and by its superior mechanical properties as measured by traditional materials characterization methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In U2OS cells, TREx retained anti-tubulin antibody stain with high efficiency, maintaining continuous microtubules with high signal-to-noise ratio after expansion. Moreover, we demonstrate that this specific labeling can be combined with total membrane labeling (mCLING) to reveal close appositions between microtubules and various organelles including ER and presumptive mitochondria. We also combined mCLING with total protein labeling (NHS ester dye), finding that the staining patterns were similar in their overall contours, albeit with some clear differences, such as the presence of presumptive NPCs in the NHS ester channel. It has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sim et al., 2021</xref>) that highly hydrophobic NHS ester dyes exhibit strong contrast for cytosolic organelles while highly hydrophilic NHS ester dyes strongly stain the nucleus. The moderate hydrophobicity dyes that we used (BODIPY-FL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2013</xref>] and Alexa Fluor 594 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>]) exhibit both nuclear staining and contrast for cytosolic organelles. The strong overlap between NHS ester and mCLING stains is likely due to a combination of the reactivity of NHS esters towards unreacted lysines in the mCLING molecule and hydrophobic interactions that boost the reaction rate between the dye and proteins in membrane-rich organelles.</p><p>In summary, by systematically exploring the ExM recipe space, we established a novel recipe using standard ExM reagents that has been rapidly adopted by other labs. TREx allows for 10-fold expansion of both thick tissue slices and cells in a single expansion step and has applications in tissue and high-resolution subcellular imaging. Importantly, TREx of antibody-stained samples can be combined with off-the-shelf small-molecule stains for both membranes and total protein to localize specific proteins in their ultrastructural context.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 488</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 150077;

Four strips of 250-Âµm-thick adhesive silicone material (DigiKey Cat# L37-3F-320-320-0.25-1A), ~ 3 mm wide and running the width of the slide, were adhered to the slide to partition it into three separate chambers, each ~12 mm wide. A plus-charged glass slide was placed over the silicone strips to form the top of the gelation chamber and held in place with tape. Two sides of each chamber were open to air, providing a convenient fill port for adding ~100 ÂµL of monomer solution after chamber construction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Gel synthesis and characterization</title><p>Sodium acrylate was made by neutralizing acrylic acid (Sigma, 147230) with NaOH until the pH reached the range of 7.5â8. Initial neutralization (until pH ~7) was done with 10 N NaOH on ice and using a fume hood. Neutralization was done in a volume of water calculated to yield a final concentration of 4 M sodium acrylate. The gel recipes for each family contained 1Ã phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the amounts of acrylamide (Sigma, A4058), sodium acrylate, and initiator (APS, Sigma, A3678) indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Each gel recipe contained the same amount of TEMED (Sigma, T7024) as APS. For each recipe family, gelation solution with crosslinker withheld (but including APS and TEMED) was premixed on ice, in one tube for each recipe family. This solution was then split into six tubes and mixed with serial dilutions of crosslinker (bisacrylamide, Sigma, M1533) to yield complete gelation solution with final crosslinker concentrations (in Âµg/mL) of 1000, 300, 100, 30, 10, and 0. Complete gelation solution was pipetted into gelation chambers and incubated at 50Â°C for 1 hr (family E) or 37Â°C for 2 hr (families AâD). Gels were then cooled for 15 min at RT and chamber tops carefully removed. Gels typically remained stuck exclusively to the top (plus charged) slide. Samples of each gel were taken with a 6 mm biopsy punch, taking care to avoid material within ~2 mm of the chamber edges (to avoid oxygen exposure from air or silicone material during gelation). Excess gel was scraped away with a razor blade. A few drops of distilled water were pipetted onto each gel to help release them from the glass slide. Each 6 mm gel specimen was gently released from the slide with a razor blade, placed in a 9 cm Petri dish and expanded by washing with excess water 2 Ã 15 min followed by 2 Ã 1 hr. Diameters of expanded gels were measured and divided by 6 mm to obtain the expansion factor. A semi-circle 25 mm in diameter was punched from each gel using a cookie cutter. Semi-circular gel punches were placed in a plastic tray, which was stood up on end so that the gel stood upright on its curved side, allowing the flat edge to deform under the force of gravity. Each gel was photographed, with a ruler positioned for scale. Using ImageJ, each top edge was described by seven manually chosen points, which were then fit to a circle. This best-fit circle was used to calculate the vertical deviation of the gel corners, which was divided by the gel radius to obtain the deformation index.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>TREx gelation solution</title><p>Sodium acrylate was either purchased (Sigma, 408220) or made by neutralizing acrylic acid as described above.

Monomer solution may be aliquoted and stored at â20Â°C, but must be thawed at RT and vortexed before use to redissolve any acrylamide crystals that may have precipitated at low temperature before freezing. Fully dissolved monomer solution may be kept on ice for up to several hours before crystallization occurs. 4HT, TEMED, and APS were added to monomer solution to produce gelation solution directly before use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tissue experiments</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Fixation and antibody staining</title><p>Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 4% formaldehyde in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4.

Approximately 200 Î¼L of gelation solution was placed into the gelation chamber, which was sealed with a 22-mm-square #2 coverslip. The completed gelation chamber was placed at 37Â°C for 1 hr to complete gelation. The chamber was disassembled and the gel carefully trimmed with a curved scalpel into a right trapezoid shape centered around the pre-gelation imaged area. The trimmed trapezoid was photographed with a ruler for scale, quickly to avoid shrinking due to evaporation, and recovered into PBS. The gel was then digested with proteinase K (NEB, P8107S) diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 3 hr at RT and washed in PBS 4 Ã 30 min. Digested gels were placed into disruption buffer (5% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and incubated at 80Â°C for 3 hr followed by rinsing in 0.4 M NaCl and washing 2 Ã 30 min in PBS. Disrupted gels were expanded fully with several washes in deionized water, photographed again with a ruler for scale, and imaged with a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope with Ã40/1.1 NA water immersion objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The gel size before and after expansion was measured from the gel photographs. The centers of 60 randomly chosen NPCs in three nonadjacent cells were identified manually and saved as an ROI list in ImageJ.

Radial intensity distributions were loaded into MATLAB for further processing. A Gaussian distribution was fit to a window in the middle of each profile, and the center of the Gaussian was taken as the radius of the corresponding NPC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Wild-type, transfected, and T cell experiments</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Jurkat T cells (clone E6.1) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium w/ L-glutamine (Lonza) supplemented with 9% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For T cell activation, 18 mm #1.5 coverslips (Marienfeld, 107032) were coated with poly-D-lysine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A3890401), washed with PBS and incubated overnight at 4Â°C with a mouse monoclonal anti-CD3 (clone UCHT1, STEMCELL Technologies, #60011) 10 Î¼g/mL in PBS. Cells were spun down for 4 min at 1000 rpm and resuspended in fresh, prewarmed RPMI 1640 medium, after which cells were incubated on the coated coverslips for 3 min prior to fixation. U2OS and COS7 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 9% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. U2OS cells were transfected with GFP-Sec61Î² (Addgene, 15108) using FuGENE6 (Promega). Caco2-BBE cells (a gift from S.C.D. van IJzendoorn, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 9% FBS, 50 Âµg/ÂµL penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine. For imaging, cells were seeded on 6.5 mm Transwell filters (3470; Corning) at a density of 1 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> and cultured for 10â12 days to allow for spontaneous polarization and brush border formation.

The similarity part was used to find the macroscopic expansion factor, while the residual elastic part was used to calculate the measurement error as follows. A MATLAB script was used to calculate the measurement error for all pairs of points in the image as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref> by finding the magnitude of the difference between the displacement vectors for each pair of points in the residual elastic deformation field.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xiaoyu Shi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is an interesting and substantial advance in the field of expansion microscopy to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers made constructive suggestions about how the manuscript can be improved with further discussion/clarification, some additional analysis. In particular:</p><p>1) Multiple reviewers felt that the paper would benefit from showing more zoomed-in views of many of the images to better demonstrate the enhanced resolution and quality of the images.</p><p>2) There were multiple questions about the use of NHS-dyes, justification for the specific choice of the NHS-dye or demonstration of whether other NHS-dyes are appropriate. In addition, questions arose about overlap of NHS-dyes with mCLING.</p><p>3) A better quantification of the local expansion factors for various organelles will improve the paper's impact.</p><p>4) Please note that during the consultation session, Reviewer 1 noted the following in response to the first comment of Reviewer 3 regarding distortion:</p><p>Reviewer #3 pointed out that the microtubule distortions seem larger than earlier published values from Chen 2015 or Tillberg 2016. &quot;I hadn't inspected that closely in my initial review, so I took a moment to do so now.</p><p>In Chen 2015 and Tillberg 2016 the distortion plots rise quickly and sort of plateau, whereas in Damstra the distortion plot is sort of linear. So comparing the older and newer results will depend on where you look. At longer distances like 20um, Damstra has ~750nm RMS error, Chen 2015 has ~250nm RMS error, and Tillberg 2015 has ~220nm RMS error. At shorter distances like 2.5um, Damstra has around 100nm RMS error, Chen 2015 has ~120nm RMS error, and Tillberg 2016 has ~90nm RMS error.</p><p>My take on this is the following. Damstra shows comparable RMS error at shorter distances (arguably the more important regime for a super-resolution technique) but more distortion at longer distances. It is not particularly concerning to me, but Damstra could consider commenting on this as suggested by reviewer #3 including mentioning whether the 42 fields of view used to create the distortion plot were from a single gel/preparation or from multiple gels/preparations. &quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 179-181 and Methods â Synaptic distance: Please clarify if the distance between the pre- and post-synapses are measured in 3D images or 2D projection. The 3D images should provide more accurate measurement. The authors should measure the 3D distance.</p><p>Line 378: Why had the authors repeatedly failed to cleanly recover epithelial cultures using standard ExM?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The measurement error due to distortions induced by the gel expansion process was quantified using tubulin imaging, which is an ideal way of measuring this issue. However, while the authors indicate that the error &quot;is in line with previous expansion methods (F. Chen et al., 2015; Tillberg et al., 2016)&quot;, this does not seem to be precisely the case. The error seems almost 10-fold greater than the Chen et al., 2015 paper, and 4-5 fold greater than in the Tillberg et al., 2016 paper. Also, it is unclear how representative the error shown in Figure 3G is. How many images, from different fields and gels, were analyzed here?</p><p>2) It seems like many of the images show low-zoom views of the expanded samples, where little can be seen in terms of details. How continuous are the microtubules shown in Figure 3? High-zoom views would be useful.</p><p>3) Similar to the previous comment, there is surprisingly little detail to be seen in the active zones and postsynaptic densities from Figure 2B-C. In principle, with 10-fold expansion one should be able to observe nanomodules or domains within both the presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic density (e.g. Hruska et al., Nat Neurosci, 2018).

The reviewers made constructive suggestions about how the manuscript can be improved with further discussion/clarification, some additional analysis. In particular:</p><p>1) Multiple reviewers felt that the paper would benefit from showing more zoomed-in views of many of the images to better demonstrate the enhanced resolution and quality of the images.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more zoomed-in high resolution views of microtubules, microtubules interacting with mitochondria and ER, close ER associations with mitochondria and other membranous organelles, close association of clathrin coated pits and microtubules, zooms of nuclear pore complexes, and zooms of synapses in mouse brains showing sub-synaptic domains of Bassoon and Homer (additions can be found in Figure 3, 5 and Figure 2 â Figure Supp. 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There were multiple questions about the use of NHS-dyes, justification for the specific choice of the NHS-dye or demonstration of whether other NHS-dyes are appropriate. In addition, questions arose about overlap of NHS-dyes with mCLING.</p></disp-quote><p>For cultured cells, we used AlexaFluor594-NHS (which is spectrally similar to Atto594-NHS, demonstrated extensively in pan-ExM<sup>1</sup>) and for tissue we used the inexpensive, green emitting BODIPY-FL-NHS. The reaction mechanism of the NHS-ester moiety with primary amines should not be affected by the identity of the dye attached to the NHS, but according to Sim et al.,<sup>2</sup> the reaction efficiency is apparently modulated by non-covalent interactions between the dye and its protein targets in a way that is mainly influenced by the hydrophobicity of the dye. We have updated the Discussion section to reflect this information from the literature, and how it relates to our dyes, Alexa594 and BODIPY-FL:</p><p>âSim et al. (Sim et al., 2021) have shown that highly hydrophobic NHS ester dyes exhibit strong contrast for cytosolic organelles while highly hydrophilic NHS ester dyes strongly stain the nucleus. The moderate hydrophobicity dyes that we used (BODIPY-FL (Zanetti-Domingues, Tynan, Rolfe, Clarke, and Martin-Fernandez, 2013) and AlexaFluor594 (Hughes, Rawle, and Boxer, 2014)) exhibit both nuclear staining and contrast for cytosolic organelles.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A better quantification of the local expansion factors for various organelles will improve the paper's impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We have further validated our method by quantifying the width of ER tubules for both antibody labeling and direct labeling by mCLING intercalation. The ER tubule diameter obtained falls within the previously published range, and we show that we have sufficient resolution to visualize the effect of linkage error on ER tubule diameter (i.e. difference between mCLING and indirect immuno-labeled Sec61-GFP). Moreover, we have included a quantification of clathrin-coated pit (CCP) diameter and microtubule M-profiles, two other benchmarkes for super resolution microscopy. These additions can be found in Figure 3 and Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please note that during the consultation session, Reviewer 1 noted the following in response to the first comment of Reviewer 3 regarding distortion:</p><p>Reviewer #3 pointed out that the microtubule distortions seem larger than earlier published values from Chen 2015 or Tillberg 2016. &quot;I hadn't inspected that closely in my initial review, so I took a moment to do so now.</p><p>In Chen 2015 and Tillberg 2016 the distortion plots rise quickly and sort of plateau, whereas in Damstra the distortion plot is sort of linear. So comparing the older and newer results will depend on where you look. At longer distances like 20um, Damstra has ~750nm RMS error, Chen 2015 has ~250nm RMS error, and Tillberg 2015 has ~220nm RMS error. At shorter distances like 2.5um, Damstra has around 100nm RMS error, Chen 2015 has ~120nm RMS error, and Tillberg 2016 has ~90nm RMS error.</p><p>My take on this is the following. Damstra shows comparable RMS error at shorter distances (arguably the more important regime for a super-resolution technique) but more distortion at longer distances. It is not particularly concerning to me, but Damstra could consider commenting on this as suggested by reviewer #3 including mentioning whether the 42 fields of view used to create the distortion plot were from a single gel/preparation or from multiple gels/preparations. &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the text to reflect that the fractional error over short distances is comparable to previous findings with expansion methods, while the absolute error does not saturate until greater distances in the case of TREx, and that the 42 fields of view are tiles of one image from one specimen. We agree with reviewer #1, that for the vast majority of applications, the fidelity over sub-cellular distances is more important than over large distances.</p><p>Concerning the long-range distortions, these could come from two sourcesâgel handling (extrinsic) and gel heterogeneity (intrinsic). Distortions of the first type could be due to stresses applied while mounting the gel on poly-L-lysine coated glass surfaces. We have attempted to disentangle these contributions by studying a case combining both worse-case and best-case extrinsic distortion. We expanded a large (2.5x5mm) portion of cultured U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1a</xref>, just gelled, before disruption/expansion) and instead of immobilizing the gel by sticking it down with poly-lysine, we simply allowed it to rest with its short side in contact with the side of a petri dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1b</xref>, after expansion). In this case, the side against the wall experiences maximum extrinsic distortion while the other side, far away from this stress, should experience minimum extrinsic distortion. We carried out nonrigid registration from the post- to the pre-expansion image and found that indeed the distortion was greatest at the bottom (Petri dish-contacting) edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1c</xref> , deformation field). The measurement error calculated over the entire gel was a non-saturating proportional error on the order of 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1d</xref>, measurement error). The deformation at the edge appears to propagate up to several mm along the length of the gel.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of gel deformation over long distances.</title><p>(A) Cultured U2OS cells just after gelation and (B) after full expansion, with an FFT-based short pass filter applied to reduce variation in illumination across imaging fields.

At the free edge, errors saturate at ~1 Âµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1e</xref>, blue), while closer to the distorted edge errors more closely resemble the non-saturating result found for the whole gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1e</xref> , red and yellow). Thus, the measurement error profile varies from point to point in the gel, and extreme extrinsic distortions can propagate far away from the source of the distortion. For the rare applications where nanoscale precision over macroscopic distances is required, more development will be required to minimize these extrinsic errors by optimizing gel handling and mounting, but this is beyond the scope of the present work. These considerations were added to the discussion in the paper.</p><p>Finally, in the course of doing these follow-up experiments, we discovered that omitting permeabilization prior to gel embedding (i.e. when not doing such a step during immunostaining) leads to sporadic failures. We now include in the text that permeabilization must be included even if there is no antibody staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 179-181 and Methods â Synaptic distance: Please clarify if the distance between the pre- and post-synapses are measured in 3D images or 2D projection.

In short, we speculate the increased robustness of TREx is less affected by interference from the silicone filter on the gelation process, likely due to the increased monomer content.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The measurement error due to distortions induced by the gel expansion process was quantified using tubulin imaging, which is an ideal way of measuring this issue. However, while the authors indicate that the error &quot;is in line with previous expansion methods (F. Chen et al., 2015; Tillberg et al., 2016)&quot;, this does not seem to be precisely the case. The error seems almost 10-fold greater than the Chen et al., 2015 paper, and 4-5 fold greater than in the Tillberg et al., 2016 paper. Also, it is unclear how representative the error shown in Figure 3G is. How many images, from different fields and gels, were analyzed here?</p></disp-quote><p>We address this in modifications to the text and new data described in detail in response to essential point 4, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It seems like many of the images show low-zoom views of the expanded samples, where little can be seen in terms of details. How continuous are the microtubules shown in Figure 3? High-zoom views would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this in our response to essential point 1, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Similar to the previous comment, there is surprisingly little detail to be seen in the active zones and postsynaptic densities from Figure 2B-C. In principle, with 10-fold expansion one should be able to observe nanomodules or domains within both the presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic density (e.g. Hruska et al., Nat Neurosci, 2018). Could the image acquisition be improved, to enable the description of such synaptic elements?</p></disp-quote><p>Additional insets with line profiles across synapses were added to Figure 2 â Supp. Figure 1b to illustrate example synapses with non-uniform distribution of the PSD and its pre-synaptic active zone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The issue of optimized imaging applies also to the nuclear pore images in Figure 3. The type of image provided by the authors is superior to the 4x-expansion images provided in previous publications (e.g. Thevathasan et al., Nat Methods, 2019), but does not reach the quality of previous STED or STORM images of these structures (see the same publication as mentioned above), albeit the resolution enhancement should be higher in the current manuscript. Could the authors use a higher magnification objective, thereby showcasing the entire potential of their technology?</p></disp-quote><p>The limiting factor on NPC image quality appears to be the density of signal retention rather than the imaging resolution. We agree that this is an important issue for the field to address, but it would not be improved by increasing the resolution of imaging and is outside the scope of the present work.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
