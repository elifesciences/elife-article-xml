While select TEs have been co-opted in host genomes to have function, the majority of these elements are epigenetically silenced by DNA methylation in somatic cells. However, some TEs in mice, including the Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) subfamily of retrotransposons, have been shown to display interindividual variation in DNA methylation. Recent work has revealed that IAP sequence differences and strain-specific KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) may influence the methylation state of these IAPs. However, the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of interindividual variability in DNA methylation still remain unclear. Here, we report that sequence content and genomic context influence the likelihood that IAPs become variably methylated. IAPs that differ from consensus IAP sequences have altered KZFP recruitment that can lead to decreased KAP1 recruitment when in proximity of constitutively expressed genes. These variably methylated loci have a high CpG density, similar to CpG islands, and can be bound by ZF-CxxC proteins, providing a potential mechanism to maintain this permissive chromatin environment and protect from DNA methylation. These observations indicate that variably methylated IAPs escape silencing through both attenuation of KZFP binding and recognition by ZF-CxxC proteins to maintain a hypomethylated state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>variable methylation</kwd><kwd>transposons</kwd><kwd>IAPs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK112041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schones</surname><given-names>Dustin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA220693</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schones</surname><given-names>Dustin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variably methylated retrotransposons have an underlying sequence that allows them to escape KAP1-mediated silencing and recruit ZF-CxxC proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sequences derived from transposable elements (TEs) make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourque et al., 2018</xref>). TEs are silenced by both histone modifications and DNA methylation to prevent these elements from having deleterious impact on the host genome. Certain TEs, however, can escape silencing and behave as sites of interindividual epigenetic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolinoy et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gunasekara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hernando-Herraez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reiss et al., 2010</xref>). These loci have been reported to be sensitive to environmental stimuli such as diet and exposure to toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dolinoy et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rosenfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Waterland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Waterland and Jirtle, 2003</xref>), although this field remains an area of active research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertozzi et al., 2021</xref>). The well-most studied metastable epiallele is present in the Agouti viable yellow mouse, where genetically identical mice display phenotypic diversity that manifests as a range of coat colors and susceptibility to obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rakyan et al., 2002</xref>). This variable coat color has been linked to the methylation state of a novel insertion of an Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) retrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolinoy et al., 2010</xref>). Variable methylation of this IAP contributes to variable transcription of the <italic>agouti</italic> gene across all tissues and variation in coat color, hyperphagia and hyperinsulinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rakyan et al., 2002</xref>). These observations in the Agouti viable mouse model highlights the impact of variable methylation of TEs on phenotypic outputs. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of these variably methylated TEs is important to further our understanding of non-Mendelian phenotypic variability and epigenetic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ecker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ecker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tejedor and Fraga, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recent work profiling interindividual epigenetic variability in mice identified roughly 50 loci that are variably methylated in a manner similar to the IAP that drives the agouti mouse phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). The majority of these variably methylated loci are IAP retrotransposons (VM-IAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faulk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). IAPs are silenced in a sequence-specific manner by KRAB-domain containing zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluccio et al., 2018</xref>). KZFPs recruit KAP1, also known as TRIM28, which, in turn, recruits repressive protein complexes to deposit H3K9me3 and DNA methylation at these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ecco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ecco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schultz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Turelli et al., 2014</xref>). While this has been thought to happen primarily in embryonic stem cells, recent work has demonstrated that KZFPs and KAP1 regulated TEs in somatic cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ecco et al., 2016</xref>). KZFPs have evolved in clusters through imperfect gene duplication and spontaneous mutations that can allow for the recognition of novel TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kauzlaric et al., 2017</xref>). Over time, TEs can mutate and escape from KZFP targeted silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Imbeault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kauzlaric et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>). It has been proposed that these KZFPs are engaged in an evolutionary arms race with TEs to maintain their silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>IAPs have an unusually high CpG content that is more similar to CpG islands (CGIs) than to the rest of the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). CGIs are generally hypomethylated and can recruit ZF-CxxC proteins, which help maintain a permissive chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clouaire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van de Lagemaat et al., 2018</xref>). Notable CxxC domain containing proteins include CFP1, which is a subunit of the SET1 complex that deposit H3K4me3, and TET1/TET3, which are responsible for the active removal of methylation from CpG dinucleotides to maintain a hypomethylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Williams et al., 2011</xref>). Mammalian genomes in general have an underrepresentation of CpG dinucleotides as a result of deamination at methylated cytosines over evolutionary time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan and Miller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crayle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 1994</xref>). The ârichnessâ of CpG dinucleotides at IAPs is potentially due to the fact these elements are more recent additions to the genome that have yet to undergo âevolutionaryâ deamination at methylated CpG dinucleotides. It has been previously shown that recently evolved CpG dense TEs have the potential to be hypomethylated when there is no targeted suppression of these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ward et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on this evidence, we postulated that variably methylated CpG dense IAPs can have sequence variants that allow for partial escape from KZFP-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faulk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>) and subsequently be bound by ZF-CxxC proteins, thereby preventing stable repression. Focusing on the IAPLTR1 subfamily identified as IAPLTR1_Mm in RepBase,, we performed multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical clustering of these elements and confirmed that the VM-IAPs have a unique sequence that is distinct from other IAPLTRs. These IAPLTRs have altered KZFP binding and diminished KAP1 recruitment. Relative to silenced IAPs â that are found in gene poor regions or proximal to tissue specific transcripts â we find that VM-IAPs are over-represented proximal to constitutively expressed genes. Importantly, we find that CpG dense TEs (regardless of subfamily) have increased recruitment of ZF-CxxC proteins such as CFP1 and TET1 in the absence of KZFP-mediated silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IAP sequence influences KZFP recruitment and establishment of variable methylation</title><p>Recent work has identified novel VM loci, which are largely IAPs of the IAPLTR1 and IAPLTR2 subfamilies, across tissues in C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). IAPLTR1 and IAPLTR2 are among the most evolutionarily recent IAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2010</xref>) As KZFPs are responsible for silencing IAP elements in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluccio et al., 2018</xref>), we examined if the previously identified VM-IAPs have shared sequence variants that could allow for escape from KZFP-mediated silencing at both the LTR and internal element. While many older IAPs have lost their internal elements over time, many IAPLTR1 and IAPLTR2, which among the most evolutionarily recent IAPLTRs, flank an IAPEz-int (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stoye, 2001</xref>). We performed multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical clustering of all LTRs belonging to the IAPLTR1 and IAPLTR2 subfamilies that were greater than 300 bps long using the ETE3 pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016</xref>). This analysis treated all LTRs independently, regardless of whether the LTR was a solo LTR or part of an ERV. We also performed multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical clustering the first 150bps of IAPEz-ints flanked by either IAPLTR1 or IAPLTR2 elements, which has previously been show to recruit the KZFP Gm14419 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>).

We aligned all ChIP-seq libraries to the mm10 genome with multimapping, but allowed no SNPs, as we were specifically interested in identifying which sequences the KZFPs could bind (see Materials and methods for details). We identified that clade 1 IAPLTR1 elements have evidence of binding by ZFP989 and Gm21082, while clade 2 IAPLTR1 elements have evidence of binding by ZFP429 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Both clades have evidence of KAP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). When profiling KZFP and KAP1 occupation at the IAPEz-int variants, we observed that clade Î³ elements displayed the weakest Gm14419 binding and the lowest KAP1 signal compared to clades Î± and Î² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Additionally, we observed that IAPLTR2s can flank either clade Î± or Î² IAPEz-ints, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>), while IAPLTR1s can flank any IAPEz-int, including IAPEz-int clade Î³ elements that have decreased KAP1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Previous studies have identified that CTCF enrichment, a protein involved in regulating chromatin architecture, has been bound at these VM-IAPs when hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). However, as CTCF binding motifs appear to be present at both VM-IAPs and silenced IAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmer et al., 2020</xref>) we examined whether genomic context had an impact on the establishment of variable methylation at the VM-IAPs. We used proximity of the IAP to constitutively expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2017</xref>) and ENCODE annotated enhancer elements from any cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore et al., 2020</xref>) as our proxy for a euchromatic environment (see Materials and methods for details). We found that 83 % of the VM-IAPLTR1s were within 50 kb of a constitutively expressed gene, while the remaining 17 % of VM-IAPLTR1s were less than 1 kb from an annotated enhancer element. In contrast, only 12 % of the non-VM IAPs were proximal to a constitutively expressed gene and 7 % were proximal to an enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Clade 3 VM-IAPLTR1s were more likely to be proximal to a constitutively expressed gene than other clade 3 IAPLTR1s regardless of the FPKM or distance profiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6</xref>). This indicates that while sequence allows these elements to have the potential to become variably methylated, VM-IAPs are present in a permissive chromatin environment to escape being silenced, as heterochromatin spreading from neighboring loci may drive silencing of these elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conservation of IAPs between mouse strains</title><p>IAP elements are a potential source of novelty between mouse strains and VM-IAPs in particular have been shown to be highly polymorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gagnier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">NellÃ¥ker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebollo et al., 2020</xref>). In order to investigate the relationship between IAP sequence, potential for variable methylation and conservation across strains, we leveraged structural variant differences between mouse strains identified by the Sanger mouse genome project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keane et al., 2011</xref>). We found that clade 3â4 IAPLTR1s, which have the lowest KAP1 binding of the IAPLTR1 clades and IAPEz-int clade Î³ elements are more polymorphic across mouse strains than the other clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, we found that IAPLTR2 clade 1 elements, which are more prone to be variably methylated, are more likely to be polymorphic across mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>). Thus, IAPs that have diminished KZFP recruitment are more likely to be polymorphic between mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1âfigure supplement 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>IAPs that have loss of KZFP binding are bound by the ZF-CxxC containing proteins TET1 and CFP1</title><p>It has previously been reported that IAPLTR1s and IAPLTR2s have a significantly higher CpG density than the genomic average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). Given the prevalence of variable methylation at these elements, we wanted to assess the relationship between CpG content and variable methylation directly. For each TE subfamily, we profiled the CpG density of all LTRs (see Materials and methods for details) and the percentage of elements that were variably methylated using the previously identified list of VM-TEs in C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that TE subfamilies with a higher average CpG density had a larger percentage of elements that are variably methylated, with IAPLTRs being the most CpG dense and having the largest percentage of variably methylated elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The CpG content of VM-IAPLTR1s and VM-IAPLTR2s is similar to non-VM-IAPLTR1s and VM-IAPLTR2s, indicating that high CpG content alone is not sufficient to induce variable methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As CpG dense loci are capable of being recognized and bound by ZF-CxxC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>), we examined the ability of ZF-CxxC proteins to bind to IAPLTR1s. Utilizing a publicly available ChIP-seq dataset for the ZF-CxxC-domain containing protein TET1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2018</xref>), we identified increased TET1 binding at clade3 IAPLTR1s elements, which contains the most variably methylated elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We furthermore profiled CpG methylation of VM-IAPLTRs in <italic>Tet1</italic> knockout (KO) and <italic>Tet1/Dnmt3a</italic> double knockout (DKO) mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu et al., 2018</xref>) and found that VM-IAPs displayed a significant increase in CpG methylation in the <italic>Tet1</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This increase in methylation is reversed when both <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Tet1</italic> are knocked out in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We also profiled the recruitment of another ZF-CxxC protein, CFP1, using existing CFP1 ChIP-seq data from C57Bl/6 mice and observed CFP1 binding appears to be specific to VM-IAPLTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As CFP1 is a subunit of the SET1 complex responsible for depositing H3K4me3, we examined publicly available H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data from B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2012</xref>) to determine if H3K4me3 is enriched at VM-IAPs. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>), we observed that VM-IAPs were more likely to ben enriched for H3K4me3 compared to non-variable IAPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). De novo motif discovery applied to VM-IAP sequences furthermore revealed known recognition sequences for ZF-CxxC proteins such as CFP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). ZF-CxxC protein binding has been shown to protect the underlying DNA from methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>).

It has been proposed that genomes are locked in an âevolutionary arms raceâ between endogenous retrovirus and KZFPs to maintain proper silencing of the genome. The variable methylation observed at IAPs could be the result of the IAPs winning this âbattleâ. We observed that VM-IAPs have unique sequence variants that allow them to have diminished KZFP recruitment. This provides an explanation to previous works that identified sequence biases for variably methylated IAPs in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faulk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). We also found that IAPs with the same sequence variants as the VM-IAPs are more likely to be polymorphic between individual mouse strains. Interestingly, we find that the IAPLTRs flanking the âmasterâ IAP that has been proposed to be responsible for an expansion of IAPs in C3H/HeJ mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebollo et al., 2020</xref>) has the same sequence as the clade 3 IAPLTR1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Together this implies that these VM-IAPs may be more active in certain mouse strains and may be propagating due to a lack of repression.</p><p>Our work also highlights the potential importance of CpG density in the silencing of the endogenous retroviruses. We observed that VM-IAPs have recruitment of ZF-CxxC proteins. In the absence of targeted silencing, CpG-dense TEs have the potential to become hypomethylated and recruit ZF-CxxC proteins, while CpG poor TEs remain methylated. As TEs can lose CpG density over time, the observation that the CpG rich TEs have the potential for reactivation supports the idea that deamination of methylated loci could be one means for driving permanent silencing of TEs over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Based on our results, we propose a model that VM-IAP loci are established as a result of partial KZFP mediated silencing at CpG dense TEs, which can then be protected from silencing through recruitment of ZF-CxxC containing proteins such as TET1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This potentially results in a stochastically silenced locus, which is then inherited by all tissues during development. Together our work has significant implications in furthering our understanding of how TEs can alter both the genomes and epigenomes of mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Trim29<sup>+/D9</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blewitt et al., 2005</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:3821610">MGI:3821610</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Haploinsufficient for <italic>Trim28</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6129S-Tc(HSA21)1TybEmcf/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock No: <bold>010801</bold> (JAX)(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:010801">IMSR_JAX:010801</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2 Mb of a freely segregating human fragment of Chr21</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit Polyclonal anti-CFP1 antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ABE211(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10806210">AB_10806210</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CUT&amp;RUN(1:50 dilution)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K4me3Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab8580(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_306649">AB_306649</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChIP-seq(2 Âµg antibody per25 Âµg chromatin)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Multiple sequence alignment and hierarchical clustering</title><p>IAPLTR1_Mm, IAPLTR2_Mm, and IAPEz-int elements were defined by RepeatMasker (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_012954">SCR_012954</ext-link>) (Smit, AFA, Hubley, R &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smit et al., 2010</xref>) in the mm10 genome.

Focusing on variably methylated IAP copies (VM-IAPs) in the mouse, the authors show that escapees share sequence variations that alter KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) binding and KAP1 recruitment, proximity to expressed genes and high CpG content. Analysis of human retrotransposons in a human KZFP-free mouse cell line recapitulates some of these observations. The authors propose that ZF-CxxC proteins play a role in establishing permissive chromatin at retrotransposons that harbor high CpG content and weak KZFP binding. Although correlative, these findings open the path for further mechanistical demonstration. The paper is of interest to readers in the field of epigenetics, genome biology and transposable elements.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanisms regulating interindividual epigenetic variability at transposable elements&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Todd S Macfarlan (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers all agreed on the interest of the question and the significance and robustness of the analyses, even though the conclusions may not be entirely novel in some places. They also raised the requirement for 1- providing improved method description, 2-performing additional bioinformatic analyses, 3- not overinterpreting correlative data, 4- discussing previous literature. Please refer to the main three points further expanded below to prepare your revisions, and please consult the detailed points raised by the reviewers, for further modification, editing and discussion in a point-by-point rebuttal.</p><p>1) More information is needed regarding the Material and Methods. This is key to understand how the data were treated in terms of bioinformatic analyses: i) precise everywhere it is required whether unique or multiple mapping was used, ii) precise whether 5'LTR and/or 3'LTR were used for LTR alignment when referring to full length VM-IAP copies, iii) considering the strain-specificity of some VM-IAPS and KZFP controllers, when relying on public mouse datasets, specify from which mouse strain they come from. The same mouse strain should ideally be used throughout the study.</p><p>2) Additional bioinformatic analyses are needed to strengthen the paper:</p><p>â plot KAP1 across IAPLTR2 sequences and over IAPEz internal sequence (reviewer #4).</p><p>â in VM versus non-VM comparisons, please use a random set of sequences to compare the same number of sequences (the number of VM-IAPs being overwhelmingly smaller compared to other categories of IAPS (non-VM, others)) (reviewer #3).</p><p>â use GTEX human liver methylation instead of the HepG2 cell line WGBS dataset (reviewer #2).</p><p>â from their CPF1 CandR in wildtype liver, the authors should analyze the level of CPF1 binding at VM-IAPs specifically, as they did for H3K4me3 (from public B cell dataset).</p><p>4 â Data are only correlative as this stage. VM-IAPs are less bound by KAP1/KZFP, but whether this lower recruitment is key to the VM status would need to be genetically tested: by modifying the KZFP binding site of a unique VM-IAP to convert towards weaker or stronger binding. Similarly, whether CFP1 presence on VM-IAPs was not demonstrated here to be causative of the VM-IAP status. IAPs that fail to be protected by KZFPs may just be accessible to all DNA binding proteins. It would require testing whether KAP1 or KZFP loss leads to CFP1 recruitment and then test if CPF1 is required for the VM status in mice. Considering the amount of time and work that these approaches would require, they are not requested within the frame of this revision. However, without formal demonstration, the authors should balance their discussion, and acknowledge that their data provide correlative, not causative, evidence, and should be treated as such. Reviewer #4 listed several instances where the text should be toned down.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall I think this could be a good manuscript if more emphasis was put on precision and an extensive description of patterns observed, as well as a more detailed analysis and a balanced discussion of the CPF1 results and their meaning for our mechanistical understanding of VM-IAPs and other epistable epialles. In addition to the points mentioned in the public review:</p><p>â I think the title is not supported by the content of the article and should be modified to something more neutral that showcases the novel findings but does not overplay them. There is no new 'mechanism' in this article, but a few correlations and observations, some of which could suggest future research avenues to prove if they play a mechanistical role. Similarly, claims of the same nature in the abstract, results and Discussion sections should be toned down.</p><p>â Much of my problems with the current manuscript have to be with the interpretation of the CPF1 findings â in my view there is absolutely no reason to think there is a mechanistical link between VM-IAP status and CPF1. Derepressed elements being now bound by various factors because they are accessible is not surprising and does not imply any causality with the VM status.</p><p>â As described in the public review, a clear description of what strains which dataset comes from is imperative, as KZFPs and young IAPs can be strain specific.</p><p>â the 'IAPLTR#' nomenclature should be changed to IAP LTRs #.</p><p>â 'euchromatic environment' should be changed to 'proximity of expressed genes' or a similar definition. There can be pockets of local repression close to expressed genes.</p><p>â less than 1 kb from an annotated enhancer elementâ¦ in what cell type(s)? What is the genome distribution of these elements â is there one every 10 kb, which is possible if the database from all cell types was used (which would not be relevant at all)? Some kind of enrichment calculation should be performed instead.</p><p>â sentence starting at line 131: I see no support for such a strong statement, even if the above point is clarified. There is enrichment for sure but it is not exclusive, which is implied here with 'must'.</p><p>â Figure 1: Why only IAPLTR1s, and not show IAPLTR2s?</p><p>â line 137: 'intact' is most probably not correct here â these all have their full open reading frames with no mutations?</p><p>â line 142-145: wrong definition of the grey sections â these are gaps, not sequence with no homology.</p><p>â provide justification for using only the first 150 bps of IAPEz-ints â repression from KZFPs can have a longer range than a single nucleosome.</p><p>â line 181: 'least conserved' is potentially misleading â is it that they were lost in other strains, or that they are new a few related strains? 'conserved' implies the former, while I think here it is the latter. Should be changed elsewhere in the text and in figure legends (for example 2C) to something more precise.</p><p>â Figure 2A: IAPEz-clade # should be IAPEz-int clade #.</p><p>â Figure 2B: is there no clade 3-4 LTRs associated with IAPLTR2s?</p><p>â Figure 2C: again, why no mention of LTR2s?</p><p>â Figure 2C: 'cade' instead of 'clade' in a few spots.</p><p>â Figure 2C: This one is overall confusing â are clade 2, 3 and 4 never associated with IAPEz-Int? Figure 2B show that they are, and the legend should reflect this, as now this gives the impression that they are solo LTRs given the lack of annotation following the initial presence of it.</p><p>â line 224-225: this is backward logic, there's no such demonstration. It should be precised that 'in the absence of repression from KZFPs, IAPs are capableâ¦'</p><p>â Figure 3A: 'Mouse ERVs LTRs', in both the figure and the text.</p><p>â Figure 3A: The use of the CpG Score metric is puzzling me â why restrict it to 'the 200 bp window with the densest CpG'? This is never explained â why not use the full element?</p><p>â line 245: comparing to random sampling of the genome does not make any sense â compare instead to non variably methylated loci of the same TE family (or families).</p><p>â Figure 4: be careful in calling 40 million year old elements 'young' â the timescale between mouse and human-specific elements is very different.</p><p>â Use GTEx liver methylation instead of in addition to the HepG2 datasets.</p><p>â line 285: what tissue was used from the Tc1 mice? Erythroblasts just the same? The expression of KZFPs is also tissue specific, this comparison should be made in ES cells where DNA methylation patterns are established.</p><p>â line 322: The sentence is completely unsupported by the data.</p><p>â Figure 6B: please compare to the genome-wide distribution of TEs â is it surprising to find that proportion of Mus-specific elements?</p><p>â Figure 6D: the use of random sampling of non-responsive TEs is not adequate â compare with random sampling from the same families where you see increased expression.</p><p>â The discussion should be rewritten to take into account the above comments â as of now, much of the CPF1 section is not supported by the data.</p><p>â provide version numbers for all software and databases used.</p><p>â justify the use of bowtie1 in some cases, and bowtie2 in others. Use a single pipeline is preferred.</p><p>â Bowtie2 to map RNA-seq is not appropriate as it does not take splicing into account â please use a RNA-seq specific mapping strategy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should state the number of copies they are referring to (the VM-IAPs). It seems to me that there is a small number of variably methylated IAPs and this is such a tiny number that reinforces the idea that most IAPs are silenced, and only a few are able to escape silencing. This discussion strengthens the fact that is not only a matter of IAP sequence, but also context, and potentially strain as the authors suggest in the conclusion. Finally, this would put into context the idea that the IAPs are &quot;winning this arms race&quot;.</p><p>Since the authors are using clusters of IAP sequences, it would be interesting to estimate the age of such clusters and their relationship. This would imply discussing other articles that have previously classified IAP sequences (for instance 10.1002/mc.20576), and even taken into account their methylation level (10.1186/1471-2164-14-48), and potentially their CpG density.</p><p>As stated by the authors, 93% of VM-IAPLTR1s are full length sequences, so I wonder how LTRs stemming from the same copy were treated? Are both included in the analysis? Also, of these 93% FL copies, what are the differences in sequence/methylation/binding KZFP/KAP1 etc, between the two LTRs? Are there any FL copy that has different sequences at their LTR and therefore different chromatin state? Previous articles have shown that LTRs bearing the same sequence can have different methylation/chromatin state depending on their distance to nearby genes. Can the authors include this observation in their discussion?</p><p>I don't understand the consensus mapping for ChIP-seq for the ZFPs, while the KAP1 ChIP-seq is done on individual IAPLTR1 element (is this uniquely mapping reads?). From the methods, I understand that the ChIP-seq reads are mapped to the mm10 genome, and then the enrichment for each base is translated to a consensus in order to illustrate as a heatmap in Figure 1? Are these uniquely or multimapped reads? These methods should be stated clearly.</p><p>In order to associate chromatin environment and VM-IAP state, the authors demonstrate that VM-IAPs are enriched within 50Kb of constitutively expressed genes. This distance seems very large for me, and I wonder how the authors have decided to chose it. Finally, In the Elmer et al., article, where the VM-IAP set is chosen, there is a valid association between CTCF and variably methylated IAP copies. In my opinion this shows how the chromatin environment is associated with VM-IAP state. The authors should discuss this in their manuscript.</p><p>The four wild-derived mouse inbred strains from Nellaker et al., ((CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, WSB/EiJ and SPRET/EiJ)) have disproportionate numbers of ERV TEV calls (see Figure 1c from their paper), which could be associated with false positive calls in those species. It would be more stringent to remove these strains from this analysis, in order to have a conservation estimation between lab strains.</p><p>Given that VM-IAPs are a smaller set than all the other IAPs, comparisons stating enrichment or &quot;more likely&quot;, should take into account these differences. For instance, on Figure 3 D or E, the &quot;other IAPs&quot; or &quot;non-VM&quot; should be a random set that has the same number of copies as the &quot;VM&quot; set.</p><p>In the transchromosomic mouse, the authors show that human TE derived CpG islands are hypomethylated due to lack of KZFP that would silence such TEs.

In the related pre-print, but not the manuscript, one can zoom into the pdf to observe the sequences, but it is very hard to identify actual sequence changes and where they reside. A detailed file in the supplement or zoom ups of the exact sequence changes referred to would be helpful.</p><p>â The logic of the sentence in line 154f is not obvious &quot;As the majority of IAPLTR2s exist as solo LTRs this indicates that these elements can be repressed through binding of KZFPs to the IAP internal sequence&quot;.

They also raised the requirement for 1- providing improved method description, 2-performing additional bioinformatic analyses, 3- not overinterpreting correlative data, 4- discussing previous literature. Please refer to the main three points further expanded below to prepare your revisions, and please consult the detailed points raised by the reviewers, for further modification, editing and discussion in a point-by-point rebuttal.</p><p>1) More information is needed regarding the Material and Methods. This is key to understand how the data were treated in terms of bioinformatic analyses: i) precise everywhere it is required whether unique or multiple mapping was used, ii) precise whether 5'LTR and/or 3'LTR were used for LTR alignment when referring to full length VM-IAP copies, iii) considering the strain-specificity of some VM-IAPS and KZFP controllers, when relying on public mouse datasets, specify from which mouse strain they come from. The same mouse strain should ideally be used throughout the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank that the reviewers for raising these points. In the revised manuscript:</p><p>1. We have elaborated on unique vs. multimapping approaches for all analyses. Briefly, we used only uniquely mapped reads in all analyses except for the analysis of KAP1 and KZFP binding at different sequence clades (Figure 1). The KAP1 and KZFP ChIP-seq datasets were unable to map uniquely to these highly repetitive loci. However, given that we were interested in determining which KZFPs, and KAP1, can bind to which clades, multimapped reads are appropriate. Bowtie1 with the -m 1 option was used for unique alignments and Bowtie2 with default settings was used where multimapping was required. This was done as bowtie1 has a higher true positive rate for uniquely mapped single end reads than bowtie2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6935493/. This has been more thoroughly explained in the methods of the revised manuscript (see page 19, âAlignment of existing ChIP-seq dataâ).</p><p>2. We used both 5â and 3â IAPLTRs for all multiple sequence alignments and hierarchical clustering. All elements with the same sequence had the same KZFP binding profile regardless of their position relative to the IAPEz-int. We have attempted to make this more clear in the revised manuscript (see page 5, line 109).</p><p>3. We have included more information about the mouse strains used for each dataset. (see page 24, âAvailability of data and materialsâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional bioinformatic analyses are needed to strengthen the paper:</p><p>â plot KAP1 across IAPLTR2 sequences and over IAPEz internal sequence (reviewer #4).</p><p>â in VM versus non-VM comparisons, please use a random set of sequences to compare the same number of sequences (the number of VM-IAPs being overwhelmingly smaller compared to other categories of IAPS (non-VM, others)) (reviewer #3).</p><p>â use GTEX human liver methylation instead of the HepG2 cell line WGBS dataset (reviewer #2).</p><p>â from their CPF1 CandR in wildtype liver, the authors should analyze the level of CPF1 binding at VM-IAPs specifically, as they did for H3K4me3 (from public B cell dataset).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank that the reviewers for suggesting these analyses to strengthen the manuscript. In the revised manuscript:</p><p>1. We have reworked Figure 1 to show KAP1/KZFP binding profiles for IAPLTR2s (see Figure 1 âfigure supplement 4) and IAPEz-ints (see Figure 1A).</p><p>2. We have compared the VM-IAPs to: (1) a random set of loci and (2) a random selection of non VM-IAPLTRs (see Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3) and observed that the VM-IAPs have increased H3K4me3 relative to both of these.</p><p>3. We have changed the HepG2 methylation data to human liver methylation data (see Figure 4). We observe the same trends with the human liver data as we saw with the HepG2 methylation profiling.</p><p>4. We profiled CFP1 binding at VM-IAPs using an existing CFP1 ChIP-seq dataset from C57BL/6 mice (see Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2). The CFP1 CUTandRUN profiles that we generated from the WT and <italic>Trim28 D9/+</italic> mouse livers were in an FVB background, so we used the existing data from C57BL/6 mice to keep the strains consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 â Data are only correlative as this stage. VM-IAPs are less bound by KAP1/KZFP, but whether this lower recruitment is key to the VM status would need to be genetically tested: by modifying the KZFP binding site of a unique VM-IAP to convert towards weaker or stronger binding. Similarly, whether CFP1 presence on VM-IAPs was not demonstrated here to be causative of the VM-IAP status. IAPs that fail to be protected by KZFPs may just be accessible to all DNA binding proteins. It would require testing whether KAP1 or KZFP loss leads to CFP1 recruitment and then test if CPF1 is required for the VM status in mice. Considering the amount of time and work that these approaches would require, they are not requested within the frame of this revision. However, without formal demonstration, the authors should balance their discussion, and acknowledge that their data provide correlative, not causative, evidence, and should be treated as such. Reviewer #4 listed several instances where the text should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, the language has been toned down throughout the paper.

It seems to me that there is a small number of variably methylated IAPs and this is such a tiny number that reinforces the idea that most IAPs are silenced, and only a few are able to escape silencing. This discussion strengthens the fact that is not only a matter of IAP sequence, but also context, and potentially strain as the authors suggest in the conclusion. Finally, this would put into context the idea that the IAPs are &quot;winning this arms race&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have altered figures (see Figure 1C and Figure 1âfigure supplement 5) to more clearly state the number of IAPs with are variably methylated compared to the total population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors are using clusters of IAP sequences, it would be interesting to estimate the age of such clusters and their relationship. This would imply discussing other articles that have previously classified IAP sequences (for instance 10.1002/mc.20576), and even taken into account their methylation level (10.1186/1471-2164-14-48), and potentially their CpG density.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and agree that this is an interesting question. Previous studies, such as the suggested paper (10.1002/mc.20576), have observed that âolderâ TEs have a higher sequence divergence from the consensus sequence. Interestingly, we observed that the clade 3-4 elements have a higher sequence divergence from the consensus IAPLTR1 sequence, but that these elements are more polymorphic and potentially younger.</p><p>This is an area of interest for future research. Additionally, we did not observe any major differences in CpG content between the IAPLTR1 sequence clades.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As stated by the authors, 93% of VM-IAPLTR1s are full length sequences, so I wonder how LTRs stemming from the same copy were treated? Are both included in the analysis? Also, of these 93% FL copies, what are the differences in sequence/methylation/binding KZFP/KAP1 etc, between the two LTRs? Are there any FL copy that has different sequences at their LTR and therefore different chromatin state? Previous articles have shown that LTRs bearing the same sequence can have different methylation/chromatin state depending on their distance to nearby genes. Can the authors include this observation in their discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have elaborated on how we treated these elements in the text (see page 5, line 105).</p><p>Briefly, we treated 5â and 3â LTRs the same during the clustering analysis. We found that both the 5â and 3â LTRs have same KZFP binding profile. Additionally, all FL-IAPs have IAPLTRs belonging to the same clades flanking the internal element, so differences in the 5â and 3â sequence do not appear to be responsible for any changes in VM status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't understand the consensus mapping for ChIP-seq for the ZFPs, while the KAP1 ChIP-seq is done on individual IAPLTR1 element (is this uniquely mapping reads?). From the methods, I understand that the ChIP-seq reads are mapped to the mm10 genome, and then the enrichment for each base is translated to a consensus in order to illustrate as a heatmap in Figure 1? Are these uniquely or multimapped reads? These methods should be stated clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion.

For instance, on Figure 3 D or E, the &quot;other IAPs&quot; or &quot;non-VM&quot; should be a random set that has the same number of copies as the &quot;VM&quot; set.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have compared our results using both a smaller selection of other IAPs and compared them to a random selection of loci in the genome (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3). We have also moved the H3K4me3 results to the supplement as this has been observed in Bertozzi <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the transchromosomic mouse, the authors show that human TE derived CpG islands are hypomethylated due to lack of KZFP that would silence such TEs. I wonder what is the extent of hypomethylation in TEs that are not CpG-rich? It would strengthen the authors argument to show that non-CpG rich TEs are highly methylated (I hope I didn't miss something here though!).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added the non-CpG rich TEs to the main figure to show that the high CpG density appears to be necessary for the hypomethylation (Figure 4B-C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>How the conclusions of this paper could be strengthened:</p><p>â To establish that the identified sequence variants are causal to diminished KZFP recruitment and increased CxxC domain containing protein recruitment, motifs could be called in the sequence variants and identified motifs could be deleted and KZFP and CxxX domain containing protein recruitment profiled to assess if the proposed competition between KZFP and CxxC is dependent on the sequence variant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To begin to address this point, we have improved our profiling of the IAPLTR sequences. We highlight the region with the greatest KZFP recruitment and compare the sequences for each clade to the previously determined KZFP binding motif (see Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3). However, we believe that this is an area for future exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â As decreased Kap1 recruitment is central to the conclusions of the paper, the authors should provide Kap1 coverage heatmaps for the IAP regions in Figures S1.6 and 2.A. This data could support the conclusion that sequence clades confer altered KAP1 mediated silencing for IAP elements by expanding the observation for IAPLTR1 to IAPLTR2 elements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have included the KAP1 heatmaps for IAPLTR1, IAPLTR2, and IAPEz-int elements (see Figure 1 and Figure 1 âfigure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â To strengthen the claims of the paper in respect to mouse VM-IAPs, the authors could assess CFP1 binding by ChIP-seq or cutandrun (which they did successfully in human) in previously used available mouse embryonic stem cell lines and mice that lack mouse-specific KZFPs and no longer repress VM-IAPs (see Bertozzi 2020 and Wolf 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We agree that it would be interesting to determine whether we can observe an increase of CFP1 recruitment in the absence of KZFP silencing. We believe that this should be further explored in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â To test if genetic context indeed causes VM, the authors could e.g. remove and ectopically insert a VM-IAP to a different context to test if VM is lost.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting idea that could experimentally confirm that location impacts the establishment of a VM-IAP and hope to explore this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Line 121 'While sequence has been shown to be a factor in the establishment of variable methylation' Please add a reference (Bertozzi et al., for example) to the experimental evidence supporting this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for missing this. We have now included this citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors could consider more directly comparing human and mouse data by performing CFP1 cutandrun or ChIP-seq (that the lab successfully performed in Tc1 liver) also in mouse instead of H3K4me3 as a proxy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We profiled existing CFP1 ChIP-seq data from C57BL/6 mice and observed that there is an enrichment of CFP1 signal at the VM-IAPs (see Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2). However, we moved the H3K4me3 results to the supplement, as we find the TET1 occupation and the methylation changes in <italic>Tet1</italic> KO mESCs to be more important to the overall story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How the presentation of the data could be improved:</p><p>â Given that the sequence features distinguishing IAPLTR1 and 2 elements that are or are not variably methylated are a main claim of the paper, the authors should consider providing more reader-friendly sequence information for the observed sequence changes that correlate with diminished KZFP recruitment (e.g. in Figure S1.1 and also for internal seq in S2.1). In the related pre-print, but not the manuscript, one can zoom into the pdf to observe the sequences, but it is very hard to identify actual sequence changes and where they reside. A detailed file in the supplement or zoom ups of the exact sequence changes referred to would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have included a more reader friendly version of the IAPLTR sequence variants (see Figure 1 âfigure supplement 2). We have also included a zoomed in image of the loci with increased KZFP binding (see Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3), in addition to the previously annotated KZFP binding motif.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The logic of the sentence in line 154f is not obvious &quot;As the majority of IAPLTR2s exist as solo LTRs this indicates that these elements can be repressed through binding of KZFPs to the IAP internal sequence&quot;. Why does it follow from existing as solo LTR that the LTR can be repressed via KZFP binding to the internal sequence? Figure S1.7 does not help understand this point. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have reworked this entire section to improve the clarity and flow of the section ( see the section on âIAP sequence influences KZFP recruitment and establishment of variable methylationâ in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Figure 2C: the authors could consider showing conservation of all VM-sequences individually (given there are not so many) in the supplement in addition to the whole clade.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. This is not included as it has been previously reported in Kazachenka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018. We were looking to expand upon their work to see if all elements with shared sequence variants were also more likely to be more polymorphic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â In some cases, the manuscript would benefit from toning down statements about causality, when only correlation is assessed (see public review). Further examples include:</p><p>â Figure 1 heading &quot;Sequence and chromatin context influence the establishment of a VM-IAPLTRs.&quot; The figure shows that VM-IAPs occur in a different chromatin context (less Kap1, more close to constitutively expressed genes and regulatory elements), but not that this context influences variable methylation.</p><p>â Relating to the same Figure in 107f: &quot;these results demonstrate that sequence can be a contributing factor in the establishment of VM-IAPs&quot;. More appropriate would be &quot;these results suggest that sequence could be a contributing factor in the establishment of VM-IAPs.</p><p>â Relating to the same Figure the header in Line 120 'chromatin environment can influence establishment of VM-IAP'. More appropriate would be 'correlates with a distinct chromatin environment'.</p><p>â Line 198 'IAPs that have loss of KZFP binding have recruitment of the ZF-CxxC containing proteins TET1 and CFP1' while data supporting this statement is shown in the Tc1 mouse model, the data in this section for mouse is correlative. It does support presence, rather than 'recruitment' of the ZF-CxxC domain containing proteins.</p><p>â Line 253f 'our results highlight the potentially conserved importance of high CpG density in the establishment of variable methylation' The human data does not show that CpG density establishes LTR12C elements as variably methylated. It shows that LTR12C elements that are variably methylated are also CpG dense.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions.
