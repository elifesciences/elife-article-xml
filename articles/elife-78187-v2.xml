reactions such as idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (iDILI). Here, we describe the generation of HepG2-derived transmitochondrial cybrids, to investigate the impact of mtDNA variation on mitochondrial (dys)function and susceptibility to iDILI.

The mitochondrial function of each was assessed at basal state and following treatment with compounds associated with iDILI; flutamide, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and tolcapone, and their less toxic counterparts bicalutamide and entacapone utilizing ATP assays and extracellular flux analysis.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Whilst only slight variations in basal mitochondrial function were observed between haplogroups H and J, haplogroup-specific responses were observed to the mitotoxic drugs. Haplogroup J showed increased susceptibility to inhibition by flutamide, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and tolcapone, via effects on selected mitochondrial complexes (I and II), and an uncoupling of the respiratory chain.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study demonstrates that HepG2 transmitochondrial cybrids can be created to contain the mitochondrial genotype of any individual of interest. This provides a practical and reproducible system to investigate the cellular consequences of variation in the mitochondrial genome, against a constant nuclear background.

Although it is rare (19.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants), it is a major cause of drug withdrawal due to its associated morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leise et al., 2014</xref>). DILI can be broadly divided into two categories, idiosyncratic and intrinsic injury. iDILI is characterized by a complex dose-response relationship, a lack of predictivity from the primary pharmacology of a drug, and significant inter-individual variation. This means that, despite being less common than intrinsic injury, iDILI can be argued to have far greater economic and personal costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fontana, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the mechanisms implicated in the onset of DILI. This is supported by the fact that 50% of drugs with a black box warning for hepatotoxicity also contain a mitochondrial liability, with many associated specifically with iDILI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dykens and Will, 2007</xref>). It is hypothesized that mitochondria may be an important source of the inter-individual variation that underpins susceptibility to iDILI. Specifically, mitochondria contain their own genome, mtDNA, which is distinct from nuclear DNA. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mtDNA are often inherited together forming haplogroups, defined as groups of people with a common mitochondrial DNA lineage that shares distinct patterns of mitochondrial SNPs. Not only have associations between specific haplogroups and mitochondrial function been determined, but haplogroups have also been associated with specific adverse drug reactions and drug efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2021a</xref>). However, in in vitro research, the presence of a variable nuclear genome makes clear relationships with mitochondrial genotype difficult to define. In previous research, we have circumvented this issue by using freshly isolated platelets as a model system, demonstrating that mitochondrial genotype-specific responses to drugs are present at the haplogroup level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ball et al., 2021</xref>). However, such an approach is not practical for reproducible mechanistic toxicology or preclinical screening studies due to issues of inter-individual and day-to-day variability, as well as sample availability. Therefore, alternative hepatic models are required to probe the effect of mitochondrial genotype on the onset of iDILI.</p><p>Despite limitations regarding physiological relevance, HepG2 cells remain valuable as one of the most commonly used preclinical cell lines for the in vitro assessment of DILI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weaver et al., 2020</xref>). One of the drawbacks of their use in detecting iDILI is, as a homogenous cell line they do not represent inter-individual variation, including within the mitochondrial genome. The importance of assessing the role of inter-individual variation on patient susceptibility to adverse drug reactions is well recognized, and the potential role of mtDNA variants could prove vital in drug development and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Penman et al., 2020</xref>). However, this area remains under-researched due to previously mentioned limitations in the current in vitro models and the economic and practical limitations of recruiting patients for clinical trials. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new strategies to explore the links between mtDNA and iDILI, whilst also enabling inter-individual variation to be accounted for at the preclinical stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fermini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe the generation and testing of transmitochondrial cybrids (herein referred to as cybrids) as a reproducible in vitro model of personalized mtDNA variation. Cybrids are typically produced by the fusion of enucleated cells (cytoplasts) or anucleate cells (e.g. platelets) with cells that have been depleted of their mtDNA (rho zero [Ï0] cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King and Attardi, 1989</xref>). When cybrids are generated using the same population of Ï0 cells, fused with anucleate cells harboring different mtDNA variants, the effects of mtDNA can be assessed against a stable nuclear background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Penman et al., 2020</xref>). Excitingly, the inclusion of mtDNA variation made possible using HepG2 cybrids may offer an enhanced preclinical prediction of iDILI, by helping to reveal the mechanistic basis of differences associated with mtDNA variants. However, to date, there have been no reports of the generation of cybrids from a HepG2 p0 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bale et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This study aimed to generate a panel of HepG2 transmitochondrial cybrids, and utilize them in a proof of principle study, to investigate the effect of mtDNA variants upon mitochondrial function and susceptibility to drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite the acknowledged limitations of the HepG2 model, they remain an important mainstay of pharmaceutical preclinical testing for hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weaver et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, their conversion into cybrid cells is highly relevant and useful to both the pharmaceutical industry and academic research. Ten distinct populations of HepG2 cybrids were created using platelets from 10 healthy volunteers of known haplogroup; five cell lines containing each containing a different haplogroup H genome and five containing different haplogroup J genome. Haplogroup H was selected for study as it is the most common haplogroup in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eupedia, 2016</xref>). Haplogroup J, on the other hand, is less common in the UK but is characterized by non-synonymous mutations in regions of the mitochondrial genome that encode respiratory complex I. Although no studies have specifically reported on iDILI and mitochondria haplogroup, haplogroup J is also reported to be more susceptible to mitochondrial toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghelli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Oven and Kayser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eupedia, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strobbe et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The effects of mtDNA variation on drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction were assessed by the treatment of cybrids with a panel of compounds with a known clinical association with DILI and proven mitochondrial liabilities; flutamide, 2-hydroxyflutamide, and tolcapone. The non-hepatotoxic structural counterparts bicalutamide and entacapone were also investigated for comparison. Flutamide, a non-steroidal antiandrogen for the treatment of prostate cancer, has a boxed warning for hepatotoxicity and is a known inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coe et al., 2007</xref>). 2-hydroxyflutamide, is the primary human metabolite of flutamide and is a known inhibitor of both respiratory complexes I and II. In humans, the rapid first-pass metabolism of flutamide results in much higher maximum serum concentrations of 2-hydroxyflutamide than its parent compound (4400 nM vs 72.2 nM). However, HepG2 cells have a limited expression of many of the enzymes required for xenobiotic metabolism, including cytochrome P450 1A2, which is the primary route for the generation of 2-hydroxyflutamide. Therefore, in addition to the parent compound, the cybrids were also dosed directly with 2-hydroxyflutamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sison-Young et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ball et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, tolcapone, a catechol-o-methyl transferase inhibitor used to treat Parkinsonâs disease, was withdrawn due to cases of liver failure and is a known uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olanow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benabou and Waters, 2003</xref>; Olanow and Watkin.)</p><p>Generating a panel of personalized transmitochondrial cybrids offers a novel and unique in vitro model for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, allowing us to begin to map the functional effects of mitochondrial genotype.

This may arise from the recruitment of only healthy volunteers for this study, with no clinical phenotype of mitochondrial dysfunction. However, importantly, the recruitment of such healthy volunteers is representative of the clinical situation, as individuals who experience iDILI tend not to display a pre-existing phenotype of mitochondrial dysfunction before treatment. The authors also recognize that due to this, the concentrations of drugs used were higher than the reported C<sub>max</sub> of the compounds (flutamide C<sub>max</sub> â 72.2 nM, 2-hydroxyflutamide C<sub>max</sub> â 4.4 ÂµM, bicalutamide 1.7 ÂµM, tolcapone 16.5 ÂµM, and entacapone 3.9 ÂµM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schulz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cockshott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Khetani et al., 2013</xref>).

Complex I and II-driven maximal respiration were significantly greater in haplogroup J cybrids (complex I mean difference 2.46 pmol/min/ug protein, 95% CI [0.4, 4.53], p=0.021; complex II mean difference 2.97 pmol/min/ug protein, 95% CI [0.9, 5.04], p=0.006). Whereas complex III â and IV-driven respiration was not significantly different between haplogroups H and J. Unlike complex I, complex II is entirely encoded in the nuclear genome, therefore, this difference in activity is unexpected. However, it has been noted that the introduction of the foreign mitochondrial genome into cybrids, can lead to the initiation of retrograde responses to the nucleus primarily via calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amuthan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). Such a regulatory feedback loop may not only lead to changes in the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteome but also potentially enhance the biogenesis of the respiratory machinery, which could explain this result. It should also be noted that these haplogroup-specific differences in complex activity are in contrast to overall oxidative phosphorylation parameters seen at basal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This may arise due to technical differences in the methodology - complex activity is measured in an uncoupled system with access to excess fuel, as opposed to the coupled system for basal bioenergetic measurements. Alternatively, it may be that the rate of activity through the latter complexes (III and IV), which demonstrate no differences between haplogroups, is rate-limiting for basal oxidative phosphorylation. However, whatever the reason, this phenomenon has been previously reported in the work of Strobbe et al, using transmitochondrial cybrids of haplogroups H, J, T, U, and K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strobbe et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Subtle haplogroup-specific changes in mitochondrial respiration were induced by treatment with flutamide</title><p>Flutamide was selected as a paradigm hepatotoxin that induces mitochondrial dysfunction via inhibition of the electron transport chain. Previous work has demonstrated that conditions of an acute metabolic switch, i.e., galactose-media, are required to circumvent the Crabtree effect and reveal the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by flutamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ball et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, these experiments were performed in galactose media. As expected, a substantial, concentration-dependent decrease in ATP was evident when cybrids were treated with â¥33 M flutamide, however, this decrease was not significantly different between haplogroup H and J cybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Greater SRC is linked to protection against mitotoxicants, and, therefore, the larger SRC observed in haplogroup H may indicate a potential for haplogroup-specific protection against injury by flutamide.

Specifically, basal respiration and proton leak showed a rapid dose-dependent increase, followed by decreases in ATP-linked respiration and SRC, before decreasing due to toxic effects. However, no differences were apparent between haplogroup H and J in any of the bioenergetic parameters measured. However, here again, it is noteworthy that there is a disconnect between the effect of haplogroup at the level of cellular ATP content and specific bioenergetic parameters but, in the case of tolcapone, this manifests in the opposite way to the findings for flutamide and 2-hydroxyflutamide, where haplogroup-specific effects were only evident in bioenergetic parameters and not cellular ATP content. This demonstrates that haplogroup-specific effects can vary across assays and are dependent upon the compound under evaluation and its mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, tolcapone is a chemical uncoupler that binds and transports protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane by simple diffusion, in the same manner as carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP). As such, the subtle inter-individual differences in bioenergetic phenotype between the cybrid cells may be immaterial. These results suggest that mitochondrial haplogroup may also influence other cellular pathways, post-uncoupling, that are not directly linked to oxidative phosphorylation, and it may be these that then lead to haplogroup-specific differences in cellular ATP content. Such pathways could include the induction of compensatory mechanisms for mitochondrial protection, which mitigate against reductions in cellular ATP such as an increase in mitochondrial mass, biogenesis, and changes to rates of mitochondrial fusion and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valera-Alberni and Canto, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The results from this study offer important insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the onset of iDILI in certain individuals.

However, maximal OCR, and the linked parameter SRC, showed an increase at lower concentrations before ATP-linked respiration is decreased.

However, limitations in clinical study design, in combination with conflicting findings, mean that the importance of mtDNA variation to toxicity remains unclear. Moreover, research using most cell models is complicated due to the presence of the nuclear genome. In our previous work using freshly isolated human platelets, to circumvent the influence of the nuclear genome, it was demonstrated that mitochondrial genotype-specific responses to drugs are present at the haplogroup level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ball et al., 2021</xref>). These preliminary studies suggested that individual mitochondrial genotypes may play a role in influencing patient susceptibility to adverse drug reactions and indicate the need for further research. Such new knowledge is essential in the preclinical arena, to address the current lack of translatability between the identification of a compound with a mitochondrial liability and understanding its potential to induce toxicity in humans. Therefore, in this research, a panel of transmitochondrial cybrid cell lines was created as âpersonalized models,â in which each cell line contains a distinct mitochondrial genotype against a stable HepG2 nuclear background. Importantly, these studies demonstrate for the first time that transmitochondrial cybrids can be created in HepG2 cells to contain the mitochondrial genotype of any individual of interest. In addition, they provide a practical and reproducible system to investigate the molecular and cellular consequences of variation in the mitochondrial genome. Thus this panel offers a novel, and unique in vitro model of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity that will allow us to begin to map the functional effects of mitochondrial genotype. Due to their potential value to other researchers and in preclinical testing, we are happy to collaborate and share our cells and have plans to deposit them with a commercial vendor. However, a caveat should be noted, that the process of generating these cells, particularly the use of ethidium bromide and PEG, has the potential to introduce additional cellular changes in addition to the intended effects upon the mitochondrial genome. In mitigation, in this study all cells have been treated in the same way, minimizing inter-cell line variation. Furthermore, the advantage of using anucleate cells as mitochondrial donors removes the need for a further manipulation to chemically enucleate a donor cell.</p><p>This research provides new evidence for the role of mitochondrial genotype in the onset of idiosyncratic ADRs. It has shown that haplogroup J cybrids display an increased susceptibility to tolcapone-induced decrease in ATP and to mitochondrial dysfunction induced by 2-hydroxyflutamide, which supports previous findings on the increased sensitivity of haplogroup J to mitotoxicants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strobbe et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, it provides quantitative evidence that inter-individual variation in mitochondrial genotype can be a factor in determining sensitivity to mitochondrial toxicants. It should be noted that idiosyncratic responses in DILI are likely due to several small variations coming together to push an individual over the toxicity threshold. The fact that mitochondrial haplogroup could be one such small difference is very much worthy of note. Here, we have focussed on only two haplogroups, which are close phylogenetic relations. In addition, all platelet donors were healthy volunteers, with no known clinical diagnoses of mitochondrial disease. Therefore, this proof-of-concept paves the way for future studies examining differences across more phylogenetically diverse haplogroups and sub-haplogroups. One limitation of the current study is the high levels of variability encountered when grouping different sub-haplogroups as a major haplogroup population, i.e. H vs J. Therefore, additional studies should focus on creating several panels of cell lines of the same sub-haplogroups, each derived from a different individual, to gain insight into whether this variation has a genetic or experimental basis. Additionally, focused investigations could utilize platelets from individuals who have experienced iDILI, individuals with mitochondrial disease, or other potential susceptibility factors. Such studies may reveal more pronounced differences in the mitochondrial response to hepatotoxic drugs and strengthen the evidence for the importance of examining mtDNA in pharmacogenetic investigations. Future developments should also focus on adapting the cybrid model to cell types that can better recapitulate complex liver architecture and are potentially more metabolically competent e.g., HepaRG cells or iPSC-derived cells, to enhance in vivo applicability. It would also be of interest to test the amenability of cybrids to 3D spheroidal culture to further improve in vivo relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaskell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang and Eglen, 2017</xref>). However, in our study, the lack of CYP P450 enzymes was considered an advantage as we could separately study the effects of the parent drug, flutamide, and its major metabolite 2-hydroxyflutamide.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has established a novel, in vitro model that provides a preclinical representation of the interindividual variation underpinning iDILI, thereby offering much greater translatability to clinical scenarios compared with the current, homogenous preclinical models. These proof-of-principle studies have provided evidence that mitochondrial genotype is a factor determining individual susceptibility to hepatotoxins that target the mitochondria. Therefore, these established lines should be utilized for future in-depth characterization and testing of additional putative hepatotoxic compounds to shed further light on the impact of mitochondrial DNA variation on (idiosyncratic) drug-induced liver injury as well as establishing the potential importance of the mitochondrial genome in personalized medicine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>All forms of DMEM were purchased from Life Technologies (Paisley, UK).

This was continued until a Ï0 cell population was observed. All cells were tested monthly to ensure an absence of mycoplasma contamination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Generation of HepG2 transmitochondrial cybrids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of HepG2 transmitochondrial cybrid generation.

Briefly, cells were incubated (1 hr, 37 Â°C, 0% CO<sub>2</sub>) before the replacement of culture medium with 175 ÂµL of unbuffered Seahorse XF base medium supplemented with glucose (25 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), pre-warmed to 37 Â°C (pH 7.4). Following an equilibration period, measurements were taken to establish a basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) before the acute injection of each of the five test compounds (7.8â500 ÂµM). Following compound injection, a mitochondrial stress test consisting, of sequential injections of oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor; 1 ÂµM), FCCP (uncoupler; 0.5 ÂµM), and rotenone/antimycin A (complex I/III inhibitors, respectively; 1 ÂµM each), was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7-2"><title>Respiratory complex assays</title><p>Please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salabei et al., 2014</xref> for a detailed description of this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salabei et al., 2014</xref>).

Following a basal measurement (no equilibration period) of three cycles of mix (30 s), wait (30 s) and measure (2 min), flutamide or 2-hydroxyflutamide (or MAS buffer for determination of basal complex activity) was injected followed by a mitochondrial stress test as detailed previously, only each measurement cycle was 3 min rather than 6 min.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In total, 10 distinct cybrid cell lines (five distinct haplogroup H cell lines, and five distinct haplogroup J cell lines) were generated, one from each recruited volunteer. Each population was tested as an independent experiment (n=1), therefore, giving a total of n=5 for each cybrid cell line/volunteer. Each independent experiment contained a minimum of three technical replicates.</p><p>Platelets were provided to the investigator blinded to haplogroup, to avoid bias; therefore, cybrid generation, experiments, and subsequent data analyses were performed on cybrids for which the haplogroup was unknown. Unblinding occurred at the stage at which datasets were combined to enable the subsequent statistical comparison of haplogroup H vs haplogroup J.</p><p>Parameters for comparison were predefined to discourage statistical bias during analyses. These were, for both the assessment of mitochondrial function and drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction: basal, maximum, and ATP-linked respiration, spare respiratory capacity, proton leak, and complex I-IV activity.</p><p>All statistical analysis was conducted in R version 4.2.0. Each dataset was analyzed using a linear mixed model with the subject fitted as a random effect and the haplogroup fitted as a fixed effect. The dose-response relationship within each haplogroup was modeled using a polynomial to degree 3 and fitted to the log10 concentration. The untreated group was also included and given a concentration of log10(1). The exception to this was in the model fitted to assess the effect of flutamide and 2-hydroxyflutamide upon respiratory complex I and II where a polynomial to degree 2 was used as the experiments only contained five concentrations. Post-hoc tests were then obtained from the fitted models to compare the mean response between the two haplogroups. For the models with the fitted polynomials, this comparison was made at the mean concentration i.e., in the middle of the fitted dose-response curve.

They propose that the production of such cell models has the potential to be representative of mitochondrial genome diversity across the population and their findings provide evidence that these mechanisms could play a role in individual susceptibility to hepatic adverse drug reactions. Although the results from their work only show modest differences between the haplogroups tested, this work is valuable to the field as it provides clear evidence that mtDNA variation influences susceptibility to drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. For many years the link between mtDNA and adverse drug reactions has been postulated by leaders in the field, and I believe that the publication of this work will enable rapid expansion in this area of research. Furthermore, the repurposing of transmitochondrial cybrid cells for studying drug safety brings a powerful new tool to toxicological research which could find utility in academia, and as the authors suggest, drug development. Overall, the data is robust and well analysed and the interpretations and conclusions made by the authors are appropriate.</p><p>2) In this work, the authors have generated several novel cell lines, each with distinct mitochondrial DNA content, to investigate whether individual variation in mitochondrial genotype can influence susceptibility to hepatotoxicity. The novelty of this model is its creation from HepG2 cells making it not only practical and reproducible but also relevant to preclinical testing during drug development. The results from this work indicate that variation in the mitochondrial genome does play a role in susceptibility to some hepatotoxins, but that this is a complex relationship that may only be one small factor in predisposing an individual to risk of an adverse drug reaction. In this report, only two classes of compounds are examined in the transmitochondrial cybrids, and the results from these suggest that these mechanisms are highly compound-specific. Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate whether the same mechanisms would be evident across a wider variety of compounds. Another major limitation comes from the lack of diversity of mitochondrial haplogroups that are represented in the cybrids, which are made up of only haplogroup J and H. These two haplogroups are close phylogenetic relations. The addition of more diversity in the panel to increase phylogenetic coverage may uncover greater differences. Finally, the findings would be more robust, if transmitochondrial cybrids were created from different individuals, but of the same haplogroup subclade to see if the same effects would be replicated.</p><p>Overall summary - for many years the link between mitochondrial DNA and adverse drug reactions has been postulated by leaders in the field, and despite caveats mentioned above, this work provides a first proof of principle that this is a contributing factor and provides novel methodology and tools to enable this area of research to expand. Specifically, the repurposing of transmitochondrial cybrid cells for studying drug safety brings a powerful new tool to toxicological research which could find utility in academia, and as the authors suggest, drug development.</p><p>Specific feedback to the authors.</p><p>There are several points that the authors should consider:</p><p>1) The process of creating the HepG2 rho(0) cells using ethidium bromide has the potential to not only deplete mitochondrial DNA, but also damage genomic DNA. Have the authors any data to support the fidelity of the original HepG2 cell line? Furthermore, does the whole process (rho (0) generation and repopulation with mtDNA) have the potential to introduce differences between the cell lines so they no longer maintain the consistent HepG2 parental cell background that is essential for this model to be useful?</p><p>2) As a tumour-derived cell lineHepG2 cells suffer from a lack of physiological relevance. They contain low levels of both phase I and II drug-metabolising enzymes, transporters, and secondary structures. This limits the translatability of any findings to humans and also makes them unsuitable for testing any compounds where a metabolite of the drug is required for toxicity. Why did the authors not produce these models in a more physiologically relevant system e.g. HepaRG cells.</p><p>3) Are the test concentrations used in the manuscript relevant for the in vivo concentrations in man? The authors should provide these Cmax concentrations in the manuscript. This is important if this model is to be useful during preclinical development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78187.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

However, despite these limitations, HepG2 cells remain an important mainstay of pharmaceutical preclinical testing for hepatotoxicity as long as the parameters of their âfit-for-purposeâ are clearly defined. Therefore, their use in this study is appropriate. Moreover, due to the widespread use of HepG2 cells in preclinical toxicity testing, their conversion into cybrid cells is both highly relevant and useful to both the pharmaceutical industry and academic research, see our previous publication (Nature Reviews in Drug Discovery, 2020, PMID: 31748707). This statement has been included in the manuscript (pg 4, lines 17 â 20). Additionally, cybrid cells cannot be generated in the âgold standardâ model for drug-induced liver injury, primary human hepatocytes, as these do not undergo division and rapidly de-differentiate over a 24 h period, see our previous publication (Arch Toxicol, 2017, PMID: 27039104).</p><p>Concerning whether it is appropriate to use 2-hydroxyflutamide to recapitulate the in vivo effects of hydroxyflutamide, it should be noted that the 2-hydroxy flutamide used in this study is structurally identical to the endogenous, CYP-mediated 2-hydroxylated metabolite. Specifically, upon administration, flutamide undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, primarily by conversion to 2-hydroxyflutamide via cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2), followed by glucuronidation before excretion. It is known that following a single 250 mg dose of flutamide, its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is 72.2 nM, yet the Cmax of 2-hydroxyflutamide is 4.4 Î¼M (PMID: 3169114). Flutamide is considered to be a pro-drug for 2-hydroxyflutamide. Therefore, given the identical chemical structures, and lack of any contrary literature upon this point, we disagree with this comment that âThe effects of Hydroxyflutamide, the metabolic product on mitochondrial function are not the same as the effects of flutamide hydroxylated in cells by the action of endogenously expressed CYPs.â We have previously published using this in vitro model (Tox Sci, 2016, PMID: 27413113). It should be noted that the lack of CYP enzymes in this model allows us to specifically separate toxic mechanisms due to the parent compound and the major hydroxy metabolite. This point has been included in the revised manuscript (pg 5, lines 2 â 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another important drawback is that the analysis is strictly dependent on respiratory flux analysis.

Using two haplogroups with unknown mtDNA contents is not sufficient. One needs to generate cell lines containing multiple levels of mtDNA under the same nuclear DNA background.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to provide further clarification on this point. We have supposed that by âmtDNA contentsâ, the reviewer is referring to a need to quantify absolutely the mtDNA copy number within each cybrid cell line, and not the whole mitochondrial genome sequence which we do have for each of the cybrid cell lines created. We believe that this line of enquiry, looking at mtDNA content, is out of scope for the research presented herein, which aims to evaluate whether specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, and/or haplogroups, may play a contributory role in determining individual susceptibility to mitotoxins. That said, in our most recent projects utilising the cybrid cells we have quantified mtDNA content, and no significant differences in mtDNA levels were apparent at a basal level. Additionally, it is our experience that mtDNA content (in terms of copy number) is highly temporally variable. Finally, with regards to the additional suggestion to manipulate mtDNA levels in the cybrid cells, to further manipulate the mtDNA levels in these cybrid cells following their already extensive modification would not add to the scientific understanding of how specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, and/or haplogroups, contribute to individual susceptibility to mitotoxins.</p><p>In addition, we would like to point out that H and J are each a dataset which is comprised of distinct cybrid cell lines (5 haplogroup J cybrid lines and 5 haplogroup H cybrid lines) not a single cell line from each, which may have been assumed by the reviewer. Our newly created figures (refer to point 2.2) more clearly show the results from each cell line, rather than as a single average (mean) value. We believe that this represents the data and its variability more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Line 87: Is haplogroup J more strongly linked to iDILI than haplogroup H?

He advised us that our previous analysis was not optimal due to its dependence on multiple comparisons, which reduced power. Therefore, we have reanalysed all data sets using a linear mixed model with the subject fitted as a random effect and the haplogroup fitted as a fixed effect. The dose-response relationship within each haplogroup was modelled using a polynomial to degree 3 or degree 2, as appropriate, and fitted to the log10 concentration. Post-hoc tests were then obtained from the fitted models to compare the mean response between the two haplogroups. For the models with the fitted polynomials, this comparison was made at the mean concentration i.e. in the middle of the fitted dose-response curve. See updated methodology (pg 33, lines 1 â 10).</p><p>Not only has this alternative analysis revealed additional relationships, but the figures now graphically represent the variation within each haplogroup as each cybrid cell is now plotted as a separate point on the graphs.</p><p>We believe that this further analysis has strengthened the interpretation and conclusions of the dataset and improved the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 535: text should be moved above the figure.</p><p>Line 544 Table: Looks like a formatting issue pushed some blank table space to the next page.

For example, specifically, the cloning of HepaRG cells is not possible since any deviation from the recommended cell densities can induce the transformation of cells.
