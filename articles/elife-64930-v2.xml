donor for nearly all cellular methylation events. Cells regulate intracellular SAM levels through intron detention of MAT2A, the only SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. The N<sup>6</sup>-adenosine methyltransferase METTL16 promotes splicing of the MAT2A detained intron by an unknown mechanism. Using an unbiased CRISPR knock-out screen, we identified CFI<sub>m</sub>25 (NUDT21) as a regulator of MAT2A intron detention and intracellular SAM levels. CFI<sub>m</sub>25 is a component of the cleavage factor Im (CFI<sub>m</sub>) complex that regulates poly(A) site selection, but we show it promotes MAT2A splicing independent of poly(A) site selection. CFI<sub>m</sub>25-mediated MAT2A splicing induction requires the RS domains of its binding partners, CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 as well as binding sites in the detained intron and 3´ UTR. These studies uncover mechanisms that regulate MAT2A intron detention and reveal a previously undescribed role for CFI<sub>m</sub> in splicing and SAM metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sam homeostasis</kwd><kwd>intron retention</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>METTL16</kwd><kwd>nudt21 cfim25</kwd><kwd>MAT2A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1915-20170325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM127311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM127311-S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flaherty</surname><given-names>Juliana N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scarborough</surname><given-names>Anna M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tu</surname><given-names>Benjamin P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The 3'-end formation complex CFIm regulates S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) homeostasis by promoting the splicing of the SAM synthetase transcript, MAT2A.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the universal methyl donor, essential for the methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins that regulates most cellular functions. Humans express a single SAM synthetase, encoded by the gene <italic>MAT2A</italic>, in nearly every tissue except the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murray et al., 2019</xref>). The protein encoded by <italic>MAT2A</italic>, MATα2, uses ATP and L-methionine to produce SAM. Upon donating a methyl group, SAM converts to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which inhibits some methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferreira de Freitas et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, SAM must be constantly produced to maintain SAM-to-SAH ratios sufficient to support methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krijt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>). Too much or too little methylation of substrates by SAM has been associated with cancer, diabetes, along with other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gharipour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McMahon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, intracellular SAM levels are tightly controlled to maintain homeostasis, with loss of regulation resulting in cellular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lio and Huang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ouyang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parkhitko et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We identified the N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosyl (m<sup>6</sup>A) transferase METTL16 as a key regulator of SAM-responsive MAT2A RNA splicing and proposed that it serves as a critical intracellular SAM sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>). METTL16 methylates MAT2A on six evolutionarily conserved hairpins (hp1-hp6) in the 3´ untranslated region (3´UTR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Warda et al., 2017</xref>). These hairpins contain UAC<underline>A</underline>GARAA motifs which, in combination with their structure, allows for methylation by METTL16 at the A4 position (underlined)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doxtader et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mendel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>). METTL16 interactions with MAT2A hairpins regulate MAT2A by two mechanisms, mRNA stability and pre-mRNA splicing. Upon methylation of hp2-6, the stability of the MAT2A mRNA decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martínez-Chantar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shima et al., 2017</xref>). In SAM-limiting conditions, reduced methylation of hp2-6 stabilizes the MAT2A mRNA. This mechanism likely reflects the typical ‘reader-writer’ paradigm in which m6A marks are read by m6A-specific binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yue et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A CRISPR screen identifies CFI<sub>m</sub>25 as a candidate MAT2A splicing factor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of endogenous MAT2A gene (top) and GFP-MAT2A reporter (bottom).

Our working model proposes that in SAM-rich conditions, METTL16 methylates hp1 then dissociates, resulting in increased retention of the last intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pendleton et al., 2018</xref>). Failure to excise the last intron of MAT2A results in nuclear retention and degradation of the transcript, defining this intron as a detained intron (DI)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pendleton et al., 2018</xref>). During SAM starvation, METTL16 binds hp1 but low SAM levels lead to decreased enzymatic turnover of METTL16. The resulting increased METTL16 occupancy on hp1 promotes splicing of the final MAT2A intron. Two carboxyl-terminal vertebrate conserved regions (VCR) in METTL16 are necessary and sufficient to promote splicing of MAT2A reporters and increase the affinity of METTL16 for RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, with respect to hp1 and regulation of intron detention, METTL16 functions as both the m6A reader and writer. However, METTL16 lacks recognizable splicing domains and has no known protein interacting partners, so its mechanism for promoting splicing of the MAT2A DI has been unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ignatova et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Splicing of terminal introns is coupled with 3´-end formation. Definition of both the 5´ and 3´ ends of an exon is necessary for efficient splicing, but terminal exons lack 3´ definition as there are no downstream introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Conti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martinson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Niwa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Niwa et al., 1990</xref>). Instead, splicing factors and 3´ end formation machinery directly interact during the definition of the terminal exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and West, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dettwiler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kyburz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lutz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McCracken et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Millevoi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rappsilber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vagner et al., 2000</xref>). While splicing of terminal exons and 3´ end formation enhance each other, the mechanisms of this coupling remain incompletely understood.</p><p>The cleavage factor I<sub>m</sub> complex (CFI<sub>m</sub>) is a component of the 3´-end formation machinery with characteristics that suggest it links 3´ end formation with splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardy and Norbury, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martinson, 2011</xref>). The CFI<sub>m</sub> complex consists of a dimer of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 (NUDT21, CPSF5) and each CFI<sub>m</sub>25 interacts with a monomer of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 (CPSF6) or CFI<sub>m</sub>59 (CPSF7) to form a heterotetrameric CFI<sub>m</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rüegsegger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rüegsegger et al., 1998</xref>). The CFI<sub>m</sub> complex was identified as a 3´-end formation factor, but more recent work suggests it is not required for polyadenylation of all mRNAs. Instead, CFI<sub>m</sub> is an enhancer that regulates the efficiency of poly(A) site usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). As a result, knockdown of CFI<sub>m</sub> components leads to widespread changes in polyadenylation, with the predominant effect being a shift to proximal poly(A) site usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumbaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 contain arginine- and serine-rich regions (RS domains) that aid in 3´ end formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). However, RS domains are common components of splicing factors, suggesting a role for CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dettwiler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hardy and Norbury, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Long and Caceres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Millevoi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rappsilber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rüegsegger et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, in addition to its well-defined roles in 3´-end formation and alternative polyadenylation (APA), the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex may function in splicing. To date, there has been little direct evidence that any specific pre-mRNA requires CFI<sub>m</sub> as a splicing factor independent of its functions in poly(A) site selection.</p><p>Here, we uncover the role of the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex in METTL16-mediated splicing of MAT2A. Using a SAM-sensitive GFP reporter in a CRISPR knock-out screen, we identified CFI<sub>m</sub>25 as a candidate factor in the regulation of MAT2A intron detention. Similar to loss of METTL16, knockdown of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 results in a decrease in MAT2A mRNA after methionine, and therefore SAM, depletion. Additionally, knockdown of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 results in a reduction of intracellular SAM levels in a detained intron dependent manner. Although the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex has a widespread role in alternative polyadenylation, it appears the regulation of SAM is separable from this function. We next identified two CFI<sub>m</sub>25-binding sites that are necessary for the splicing of MAT2A. Finally, we show that CFI<sub>m</sub> induction of splicing requires the RS domains of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 or CFI<sub>m</sub>59. This leads to an updated model of splicing for the SAM-synthetase MAT2A, in which METTL16 serves as an upstream SAM sensor that mediates splicing of MAT2A through the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A CRISPR screen identifies CFI<sub>m</sub>25 as a candidate MAT2A splicing regulator</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of METTL16-mediated splicing of MAT2A, we designed a SAM-responsive GFP reporter cell line.

In SAM-replete conditions, the MAT2A intron should be inefficiently spliced and produce little GFP protein, while SAM depletion should lead to efficient splicing, mRNA stabilization, and robust GFP signal. To validate our reporter line, we depleted intracellular SAM using CRISPR/Cas9 with an sgRNA targeting the endogenous MAT2A. As expected, MAT2A knockout increased GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, depletion of methionine, and therefore SAM, robustly increased GFP as monitored by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, ‘Reporter’). GFP-MAT2A mRNA accumulates upon shift to ~11 μM methionine media mirroring the endogenous MAT2A mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of METTL16 abrogates the cell’s ability to induce production of the endogenous MAT2A or reporter mRNA after methionine depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, these observations demonstrate that the production of our reporter mRNA reflects that of the endogenous MAT2A.</p><p>Despite its usefulness in our studies (see below), we found that the reporter mRNA from our clonal line unexpectedly splices the β-globin 5´ splice site to the MAT2A 3´ splice acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Other isolated clonal lines that spliced as predicted produced less GFP protein upon methionine depletion, the majority of which was accumulated as a putative degradation product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>, ‘Predicted’). Since the reporter splicing creates a distinct C-terminal extension on GFP, we reasoned that the GFP C-terminal extension produced from β-globin and MAT2A exons 8 and 9 destabilizes the GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Indeed, treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased protein levels produced in lines that had the predicted splicing pattern, but GFP protein was unaffected in our reporter line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, the alternative splicing of the reporter line results in a more stable protein product and therefore more useful reporter. Nevertheless, our reporter robustly responds to intracellular SAM levels in a METTL16-dependent fashion, mimicking the endogenous MAT2A. Therefore, we used this reporter cell line in a screen for factors required to induce MAT2A expression upon methionine depletion.</p><p>To identify factors necessary for MAT2A induction, we performed a CRISPR knockout screen. We reasoned that if we knock out genes essential for induction of MAT2A splicing (e.g. METTL16), cells will have reduced ability to induce GFP expression upon methionine depletion. We transduced our reporter line with the puromycin-resistant lentiviral Brunello library, which contains four sgRNAs per protein-coding gene of the entire genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doench et al., 2016</xref>). Two days post-transduction, we added puromycin, selected over 6 days, then replaced media with methionine-free media. Eighteen hours later, we sorted for the lowest ~1% of GFP intensity cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We identified seventy-two genes passing a 1% FDR cutoff from three independent biological replicates analyzed by MAGeCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>). However, nearly all 72 genes were found on chromosome 19, where the AAVS1 safe harbor locus resides. The simplest explanation for this overrepresentation is that we selected for recombination events that reduced GFP signal by removing the reporter. After exclusion of genes on chromosome 19, three hits remained. The top candidate was METTL16 which supports the efficacy of the screen. The other hits were MED9 and NUDT21 (CPSF5). MED9 is a member of the mediator complex, a coactivator of RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Soutourina, 2018</xref>). NUDT21 encodes the CFI<sub>m</sub>25 protein. Given its association with RS domain-containing proteins CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59, we decided to investigate potential functions for CFI<sub>m</sub>25 in the regulated splicing of MAT2A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CFI<sub>m</sub>25 is required for induction of MAT2A mRNA and maintaining SAM levels</title><p>To validate our CRISPR screen, we first examined the effects of knockdown of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 on reporter RNA accumulation.

Next, we tested the effects of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown on a modified reporter. Into this reporter construct, we inserted a T2A ‘self-cleaving’ peptide after GFP to overcome the GFP destabilization by the β-globin/MAT2A C-terminal extension described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luke and Ryan, 2018</xref>).

Using two independent clonal cell lines (‘T2A, hp2-6m9#1’ and ‘T2A, hp2-6m9#2’), we observed decreases in mRNA accumulation and increases in intron detention in this reporter after METTL16 or CFI<sub>m</sub>25 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

CFI<sub>m</sub>25 depletion using two independent siRNAs increased intron detention under methionine-free conditions, phenocopying METTL16 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, red). Interestingly, there was also a slight but significant increase in intron detention in methionine-replete media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, blue), further supporting a role for CFI<sub>m</sub>25 in the regulation of MAT2A intron detention. CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown did not affect METTL16 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), so CFI<sub>m</sub>25 does not regulate MAT2A expression by manipulation of METTL16 abundance. If METTL16 and CFI<sub>m</sub>25 are both necessary for efficient splicing of the MAT2A detained intron, co-depletion should not exacerbate the effects of individual depletion of each factor. Indeed, co-depletion had no greater effects on MAT2A RNA than depletion of each individual factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Finally, we assessed SAM levels in cells depleted of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 and found that, like METTL16, depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 decreased intracellular SAM levels under methionine-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Together, these data support the hypothesis that that CFI<sub>m</sub>25 is necessary for production of SAM by regulating MAT2A splicing.</p><p>Knockdown of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 results in global changes in poly(A) site usage. Indeed, a minor isoform of MAT2A using a weak, proximal poly(A) site in the 3´UTR has previously been detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Routh et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulates MAT2A by APA in our cells. The shorter isoform was not evident in our total RNA northern blots, so we poly(A) selected RNA for higher sensitivity. Two low-abundance bands of higher mobility were observed in 293A-TOA cells, either or both of which could be an APA product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). RNase H mapping results were consistent with one isoform being the previously reported APA isoform, but the longer isoform was of unclear origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, neither was responsive to methionine levels nor depletion of METTL16 or CFI<sub>m</sub>25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). APA patterns can be cell-type specific (see below), but these data support the conclusion that the observed changes in MAT2A expression and SAM levels in 293A-TOA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and I</xref>) are not due to CFI<sub>m</sub>-mediated changes in MAT2A poly(A) site usage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulation of MAT2A requires the detained intron</title><p>Depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 alters poly(A) site selection on many transcripts, so the observed changes in MAT2A and SAM levels may result from processes unrelated to MAT2A intron detention. Conversely, it is formally possible that some of the changes in APA are secondary to the drops in SAM levels observed upon CFI<sub>m</sub>25 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). To test the importance of the DI, we used CRISPR to produce a clonal HCT116-derived cell line with the MAT2A DI deleted. Although we used a donor plasmid to promote homologous repair (HR) upon cleavage of two sites flanking the DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the resulting clonal line (116-ΔDI) is heterozygotic. One allele contains the expected precisely deleted DI from HR while the second allele deletes the DI via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The latter allele replaces the C-terminal 39 amino acids with 18 amino acids produced from a frameshift. As expected, no MAT2A-DI isoform was detected by northern blot, but methionine depletion leads to an increase of MAT2A mRNA, presumably due to hp2-6-mediated stabilization of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, CFI<sub>m</sub>25 depletion had no effect on the methionine responsiveness of MAT2A mRNA in 116-ΔDI cells, consistent with a function for CFI<sub>m</sub>25 in regulation of the MAT2A DI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next compared intracellular SAM levels in 116-ΔDI to the parental line.

To assess APA, we performed Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-seq), a click chemistry technique to sequence the 3´ ends of polyadenylated transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Routh, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Routh et al., 2017</xref>).

Consistent with previous reports that depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 favors the use of proximal poly(A) sites, the overwhelming majority of changes were reductions in the percent distal usage (PDU) of poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Importantly, nearly identical levels of shortening were observed in 116-ΔDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In fact, when we compared the parental and 116-ΔDI lines under either knockdown condition, only 45 and 20 genes experienced APA for the siNT and siCFI<sub>m</sub>25, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). Additionally, many exons with significant changes in APA were consistent between HCT116 and 116-ΔDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>). Because the APA patterns were largely similar even though the SAM levels differ upon CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), these global analyses support our conclusion that CFI<sub>m</sub>25’s role in SAM regulation and APA are separable. They also strengthen the conclusion that CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulates MAT2A mRNA abundance in a MAT2A DI-dependent fashion.</p><p>Consistent with our analysis in 293A-TOA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the PAC-seq analysis showed little use of the weak proximal MAT2A poly(A) site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Surprisingly, there was a statistically significant increase in use of this site in 116-ΔDI cells upon CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown, although the distal poly(A) site is still the predominant isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, there was a novel, albeit low abundance, poly(A) site in intron 7 in the 116-ΔDI cells only. We confirmed the existence of these RNAs by northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). In principle, this could contribute to the restoration of MAT2A mRNA and protein because use of this site excludes the regulatory hp2-6.

To determine if any of these consensus CFI<sub>m</sub>25-binding sites affect the splicing of MAT2A, we employed a reporter construct consisting of MAT2A exon 8, the DI, and exon 9 with the 3´UTR fused downstream of β-globin coding sequence containing an efficiently spliced β-globin intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>).

To further validate that CFI<sub>m</sub> binds to the UGUU site, we conducted label transfer assays using SUMO-tagged recombinant CFI<sub>m</sub>25. Radiolabeled 21-mer RNA substrates containing the UGUU or its variants were incubated with SUMO-CFI<sub>m</sub>25, cross-linked, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Upon CFI<sub>m</sub> binding, CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 serve as the downstream effectors that promote efficient splicing of the DI through their RS domains. This model predicts that CFI<sub>m</sub> is downstream of the SAM sensor METTL16. To test the proposed hierarchy of factors in the splicing of the MAT2A DI, we combined our tethering system with siRNA knockdown of individual factors. In some cases, the expression of the MS2 transgenes is reduced upon knockdown of these essential factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, in each of these cases, our data further show that the lower levels remain sufficient to potently drive reporter splicing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> legend). If CFI<sub>m</sub> is downstream of METTL16, tethering METTL16 will no longer induce splicing upon CFI<sub>m</sub>25 depletion. Indeed, the tethering of METTL16 fails to induce splicing after CFI<sub>m</sub>25 depletion compared to the non-target and no MS2 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, gray and orange). Conversely, tethering of CFI<sub>m</sub>25, so long as it is in complex with CFI<sub>m</sub>68 or CFI<sub>m</sub>59, should induce splicing even in METTL16-depleted cells. As expected, tethering of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 after METTL16 depletion results in splicing induction comparable to the non-targeting control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, gray and purple).

Conversely, the levels of MS2-NLS-fl-METTL16 observed upon CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown is reduced, but these levels are the same to those observed upon METTL16 knockdown and they remain well above the endogenous levels (C). In this case, these levels of expression also are sufficient to drive splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, purple). Therefore, we conclude that the changes in transgene expression are not responsible for the observed changes in β-globin-MAT2A reporter splicing.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64930-fig7-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Our model proposes that CFI<sub>m</sub>68 or CFI<sub>m</sub>59 interchangeably function for the splicing of MAT2A, while CFI<sub>m</sub>25 recruits CFI<sub>m</sub>68/CFI<sub>m</sub>59 to the RNA. If so, tethering METTL16 or CFI<sub>m</sub>25 will no longer induce splicing if the downstream effectors CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 are not present. Consistent with this prediction, CFI<sub>m</sub>68/CFI<sub>m</sub>59 co-depletion reduces splicing induction upon METTL16 or CFI<sub>m</sub>25 tethering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, green). Surprisingly, depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 alone had similar effects as CFI<sub>m</sub>68/CFI<sub>m</sub>59 co-depletion, while CFI<sub>m</sub>59 depletion was comparable to the non-targeting control. We likewise observed that tethering CFI<sub>m</sub>68 induces splicing in CFI<sub>m</sub>25-depleted cells, but CFI<sub>m</sub>59 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, orange). These data demonstrate that tethering CFI<sub>m</sub>68 is sufficient to induce splicing of MAT2A in the absence of METTL16 or other CFI<sub>m</sub> complex family members. The function of CFI<sub>m</sub>59 in MAT2A splicing is less clear, but it may contribute to splicing redundantly with CFI<sub>m</sub>68 or have other functions in MAT2A splicing or CFI<sub>m</sub> complex assembly (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we propose that the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex, a major APA factor, is a key regulator of SAM metabolism. Next to METTL16, CFI<sub>m</sub>25 was a top candidate in a global unbiased screen for regulators of MAT2A splicing. Knockdown and tethering independently support the conclusion that components of the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex drive splicing of the MAT2A DI through the RS domains of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and/or CFI<sub>m</sub>59. Moreover, mutation of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 binding sites in the MAT2A DI and 3´UTR both abrogate splicing. Taken together, these data support our conclusion that the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex is a downstream effector that promotes MAT2A splicing regulated by the SAM sensor METTL16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that MAT2A splicing regulation is independent of its role in 3´ end formation. Whether APA-independent regulation of splicing by CFI<sub>m</sub> is unique to MAT2A or is more widespread remains unknown. However, CFI<sub>m</sub>25 has recently been reported to affect regulation of the glutaminase (GLS) gene in a complex regulatory paradigm that includes alternative splicing and APA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Redis et al., 2016</xref>). GLS generates at least three isoforms, including two longer transcripts that use the same last exon but distinct polyadenylation sites within that exon. A shorter isoform, called GAC, uses a unique 3´ splice site and polyadenylation site within an upstream intron to generate an alternative last exon. CFI<sub>m</sub>25 promotes the accumulation of the GAC isoform, suggesting it defines this alternative last exon by promoting usage of its poly(A) site and/or the 3´ splice site. Interestingly, the 3´ splice site of the GAC isoform has a weak polypyrimidine tract and includes a UGUA within 20 nt of the 3´ AG splice site, similar to MAT2A. Thus, other genes may require CFI<sub>m</sub> binding near a 3´ splice site to promote splicing, but the extent of the phenomenon is unclear.</p><p>Our proposed model leads to an important question: how is METTL16 binding to hp1 connected to CFI<sub>m</sub>-mediated MAT2A DI splicing? The simplest model is that METTL16 recruits CFI<sub>m</sub> to the RNA, but we were unsuccessful in coimmunoprecipitating METTL16 and CFI<sub>m</sub>25. Additionally, our unpublished yeast two-hybrid experiments and coimmunoprecipitation mass spectrometry experiments were consistent with a published report that found no METTL16-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ignatova et al., 2019</xref>). It seems unlikely that METTL16 functions without other binding partners, but if METTL16 and CFI<sub>m</sub>25 directly interact, this interaction is likely transient. Alternatively, METTL16 may mediate CFI<sub>m</sub>25 binding to MAT2A through an RNA conformational change that exposes the binding sites. This conformational change hypothesis is supported by the discovery that the VCR domain of METTL16 binds RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyama et al., 2020</xref>). Since the VCR domains alone can drive splicing when tethered to a reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pendleton et al., 2017</xref>), the VCR domain could alter RNA secondary structure surrounding hp1 thereby allowing CFI<sub>m</sub>25 binding. Alternatively, other RNA, proteins, or posttranslational modifications may promote the transient formation of the METTL16:CFI<sub>m</sub> complex on the MAT2A transcript. Such proteins would likely function redundantly with other factors because they were not identified in our CRISPR screen. In any case, future experiments will focus on distinguishing among these and other models that explain the interface between METTL16 and CFI<sub>m</sub> in MAT2A splicing.</p><p>CFI<sub>m</sub>-binding sites in the MAT2A DI and immediately upstream of hp1 are necessary for MAT2A splicing. Mutation of either the DI UGUA or 3´UTR UGUU results in abrogation of splicing to comparable levels, suggesting that both sites contribute equally to the splicing of MAT2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). The two sites could independently function as CFI<sub>m</sub> binding sites. Alternatively, since CFI<sub>m</sub>25 exists as dimer within the complex, it is possible that the sites are bound simultaneously with the intervening RNA looped out. In fact, previous data suggests looping may be important for the function of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Two UGUA motifs in the PAPOLA mRNA 3´UTR simultaneously bind to the CFI<sub>m</sub>25 dimer to promote more efficient binding. The two sites must be at least nine nt apart to allow for looping, but the upper limit of distance between UGUA motifs has yet to be determined. The MAT2A DI UGUA and UGUU motif upstream of hp1 are 114 nt apart allowing ample separation for RNA looping. It has been proposed that RNA looping mediated by the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex regulates poly(A) site selection by occluding or presenting poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). However, to our knowledge, this has yet to be demonstrated in cells. Given that one of the sites is in the DI near the 3´ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that CFI<sub>m</sub>-dependent RNA looping exposes the 3´ splice site to increase its accessibility to the spliceosome.</p><p>In addition to its potential role in RNA looping, the UGUA in the DI presents a particularly interesting component of MAT2A splicing regulation. The 3´ splice site of most pre-mRNAs is recognized by binding of the U2AF heterodimer that binds the 3´ AG and the ~9 nt polypyrimidine tract through the U2AF1 (U2AF35) and U2AF2 (U2AF65) subunits, respectively. After binding the 3´ splice site, U2AF recruits the spliceosomal U2 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ruskin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sibley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wu and Fu, 2015</xref>). The polypyrimidine tract in the MAT2A DI is interrupted by three purines, two of which are the part of the UGUA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that the same sequence that weakens the polypyrimidine tract also provides a regulatory CFI<sub>m</sub> binding site capable of overcoming inefficient splicing.</p><p>We can imagine at least three distinct possibilities for how CFI<sub>m</sub> promotes splicing within the MAT2A detained intron. In the first model, CFI<sub>m</sub> recruits U2AF such that it binds directly to the weak 3´ splice site. Upon recruitment, CFI<sub>m</sub> may ‘handover’ the RNA to U2AF, as has been described for some RNA export factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hautbergue et al., 2008</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that CFI<sub>m</sub> recruits U2AF, but only one of the U2AF RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) engages the RNA at the four pyrimidines immediately adjacent to the AG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with this idea, U2AF’s RRMs are separated by a flexible linker and each interacts with ~4–5 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jenkins et al., 2013</xref>). A related second model proposes that CFI<sub>m</sub> recruits U2AF, but U2AF does not directly bind the RNA. Instead, U2AF functions exclusively by protein-protein interactions within the CFI<sub>m</sub>-RNA complex. These recruitment models are similar to the mechanism in which the YB-1 protein binds RNA to recruit U2AF to weak splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, protein-protein interactions between CFI<sub>m</sub> and U2AF2 have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Millevoi et al., 2006</xref>). However, we note that those interactions are specific for CFI<sub>m</sub>59, which is not strictly required to activate MAT2A splicing. A third model proposes that CFI<sub>m</sub> functionally substitutes for U2AF. In fact, as many as ~12% of introns may be U2AF-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Shao et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, U2AF can be functionally substituted by SPF45/RBM17 on a subset of introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukumura et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, in vitro U2AF depletion can be complemented by excess SR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">MacMillan et al., 1997</xref>), so it is not unreasonable to suggest that the RS domains of CFI<sub>m</sub> may supply this function for MAT2A DI.</p><p>We have determined that the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex is necessary for the splicing of MAT2A, but the composition of this complex is unclear. In our knockdown experiments CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 appear to be redundant for splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and neither appeared as CRISPR screen hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Further supporting functional redundancy, tethering of either CFI<sub>m</sub>68 or CFI<sub>m</sub>59 resulted in comparable splicing induction, as long as an RS domain is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Despite CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 belonging to the same complex and sharing significant sequence and structural similarity, CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 have non-redundant function in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tresaugues et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Knockdown of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 leads to a global shift to proximal poly(A) site usage, similarly to CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown, while CFI<sub>m</sub>59 has no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 have distinct interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Millevoi et al., 2006</xref>). Although CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 initially appear to be functionally similar for the splicing of MAT2A, some of our data minimize the role of CFI<sub>m</sub>59. When tethered, CFI<sub>m</sub>25 is incapable of promoting splicing in the absence of CFI<sub>m</sub>68, while CFI<sub>m</sub>59 knockdown alone has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Additionally, tethering of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 enables splicing independent of CFI<sub>m</sub>25, while CFI<sub>m</sub>59 requires CFI<sub>m</sub>25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). One possible explanation is rooted in the three possible compositions of the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex. The CFI<sub>m</sub>25 dimer can form a tetramer with two CFI<sub>m</sub>59 proteins, two CFI<sub>m</sub>68 proteins, or with one of each. Thus, tethering of CFI<sub>m</sub>59 may lead to recruitment of the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex that includes CFI<sub>m</sub>68. If so, then tethering of a CFI<sub>m</sub>25:CFI<sub>m</sub>68:CFI<sub>m</sub>59 containing complex would be capable of promoting splicing but would require CFI<sub>m</sub>25 to recruit CFI<sub>m</sub>68. More testing needs to be done to unravel the overlapping and distinct roles of CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 in regulation of MAT2A.</p><p>The CFI<sub>m</sub> complex is a major regulator of poly(A) site selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumbaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Our data show that the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex’s role in MAT2A splicing and SAM metabolism appear to be independent of poly(A) site selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). The shortening of 3´UTRs upon CFI<sub>m</sub> knockdown has been linked to important biological phenotypes including cancer cell proliferation and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumbaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jafari Najaf Abadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tamaddon et al., 2020</xref>). For example, knockdown of either CFI<sub>m</sub>25 or CFI<sub>m</sub>68 increases transcription-factor-induced reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumbaugh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ji and Tian, 2009</xref>). This effect is attributed to global shifts from distal poly(A) site usage to proximal, which is characteristic of less differentiated and more proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sandberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shepard et al., 2011</xref>). Our work suggests that SAM levels may drop in MEFs upon CFI<sub>m</sub> knockdown, so it is possible that this SAM reduction contributes to the increased dedifferentiation potential, priming cells for transition into iPSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shiraki et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, it is plausible that SAM levels contribute to the growth potential of cancer cells, as cancer cells often have reduced methylation potential and/or intracellular SAM levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murray et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, CFI<sub>m</sub> knockdown may augment cancer growth by reducing SAM levels in addition to the well-defined 3´UTR shortening mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jafari Najaf Abadi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to decouple CFI<sub>m</sub>25’s role in poly(A) site selection from that in maintenance of intracellular SAM to see how each contributes to these important biological phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>Bacterial: ElectroMAX Stbl4 Competent Cells</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Cat#: 11635018</td><td>Electrocompetent Cells</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td>Bacterial: Rosetta (DE3) cells</td><td>EMD Millipore</td><td>Cat#: 70954</td><td>For production of SUMO-CFI<sub>m</sub>25</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293</td><td>Dr. Joan A.

The same media was used with a maintenance concentration of Plasmocin (InvivoGen, Cat#ant-mpt, 1:10,000) for all HCT116-based cell lines and 50 μg/ml hygromycin for reporter cell lines. 293A-TOA cells were cultured similarly to HEK293 cells, but with Tet-free FBS (Atlanta Biologicals, Cat#S10350) and 100 μg/ml G418. Care was taken to ensure cells were passaged in methionine-rich media to keep MAT2A DI/mRNA ratios consistent between experiments. Methionine-free media DMEM (Thermo Fisher, Cat#21013024) was supplemented with 0.4 mM L-cysteine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate in addition to penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine, and Tet-free FBS. All cell lines have been validated by STR analysis and are routinely tested for mycoplasma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Generation of GFP-reporter lines</title><p>HCT116 cells were co-transfected in a 6-well plate with 0.2 µg AAVS1 1L TALEN, 0.2 µg AAVS1 1R TALEN, and 1.6 µg hAAVS1-GFP-β2-MAT-E8-3´. The next day cells were split to 10 cm plates, and hygromycin was added to 100 µg/ml. Cells were selected for a total of two weeks, initially in 100 µg/ml hygromycin and then in 250 µg/ml hygromycin over the second week. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to select clonal cell lines with low to mid GFP output in methionine-rich conditions. Clonal cell lines were selected based on high differential GFP expression between methionine-rich and methionine-starved conditions. The cell line that provided the most robust GFP expression after methionine depletion was chosen as the reporter line. As described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the robust differential results in part from an alternate splicing pattern that stabilizes the GFP protein.</p><p>The modified GFP reporter cell lines containing a T2A element and mutations in hp2-6 to abrogate METTL16 activity were created in a similar fashion to the original reporter, with the only change being using hAAVS1-GFP-T2A-β2-MAT-E8-3 ́hp2-6m9 instead of hAAVS1-GFP-β2-MAT-E8-3´.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Generation of 116-ΔDI line</title><p>Two 10 cm plates of HCT116 cells were each transfected with 3 µg of pX458-MAT2A-E9, 3 µg of pX459-MAT2A-E8, and 10 µg of pBS-ΔRI-Donor. Eight hrs later, fresh media was added that included 1 µg/ml puromycin and 1 µM of the NHEJ inhibitor SCR7 (Fisher Scientific; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maruyama et al., 2015</xref>). Approximately 48 hr after transfection, puromycin-resistant transfected cells were subjected to FACS, and GFP-positive single cells were seeded on a 96-well plate. SCR7 was included for an additional 3–5 days. After clonal expansion, DNA was harvested, and MAT2A DI status was examined by PCR using primers NC1145 and NC2537. The sequences of all primers and DNA oligonucleotides are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Only one clonal line contained DI deletions on both alleles. Subsequent sequencing demonstrated that one allele had the DI deleted by HR while the other allele had intron eight deleted by NHEJ.

For co-immunoprecipitations, 600 μl Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher, Cat#31985–070) and 36 μl TransIT-293 were incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min before addition to 10 μg of aliquoted DNA. The mixture was incubated 15 min before adding dropwise to a 10 cm dish of cells. For typical 12-well transfections, 2 μl TransIT-293, 40 μl Opti-MEM, and 800 ng plasmid was added per well using the above protocol. MS2-tethering experiments used 30 ng of reporter, 200 ng of MS2-NLS-flag tagged construct, and 570 ng of pcDNA3 per well of a 12-well plate. Expression of MS2-NLS-flag protein was analyzed after transfecting 400 ng of MS2-NLS-flag construct and 400 ng pcDNA per well. For experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, 100 ng of reporter construct and 700 ng pcDNA3 was transfected per well of a 12-well plate into HEK293 cells. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, 15 ng of reporter and 785 ng pcDNA3 was transfected on day three of a 4-day knockdown in 293A-TOA cells.

For one well of a 12-well plate, 400 μl of TRI Reagent was added. Upon homogenization by pipetting, 80 μl chloroform was added to the TRI Reagent containing tube before shaking vigorously by hand until homogenization. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C before transferring the aqueous phase to a fresh tube then mixing with an equal volume of chloroform. Care was taken not to disturb the interphase between the organic and aqueous phases. The chloroform/aqueous mixture was shaken vigorously by hand and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min at RT before transferring the aqueous phase once again to a fresh tube. The aqueous solution was mixed with an equal volume of isopropanol for storage at –20°C or precipitation by centrifugation at 16,000 x g 10 min RT with the addition of 15 μg GlycoBlue Coprecipitant (Thermo Fisher, Cat#AM9516).</p><p>If necessary, RNA was further purified by an additional phenol:chloroform:iso-amyl alcohol (PCA, 25:24:1) extraction step, in which an equal volume of PCA was added to RNA in an aqueous solution. The mixture was vortexed briefly before centrifugation at 14,000 x g 5 min RT. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with an equal volume of chloroform. The samples were mixed by vigorous shaking before a second centrifugation step at 14,000 x g 5 min RT.

Twenty-four hr after transfection, confluent cells were split to allow for an additional 3 days of cell division and knockdown (total 96 hr knockdown). Degree of cell dilution when passaging at this stage was dependent on the toxicity associated with the specific knockdown. We changed the media 24 hr before harvesting to ensure cells were maintained in a methionine-rich conditions. For samples using multiple siRNAs targeting the same gene, 15 nM of each siRNA was used for a total of 30 nM. For knockdown prior to transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), cells were transfected with the appropriate tethering or reporter constructs 72 hr post knockdown after a media change to ensure cells were harvested in methionine-rich conditions.

In brief, 400 ng of library was electroporated into ElectroMAX Stbl4 Competent Cells (Thermo Fisher, Cat#11635018). After recovery in SOC Outgrowth Medium (New England Biolabs, Cat#B9020S), the sample was plated equally between four 500 cm<sup>2</sup> bioassay plates containing LB agar with 100 μg/ml puromycin using a biospreader (Bacti Cell Spreader, VWR International). Cells were grown 18 hr at 37°C before scraping with ice cold LB.

Brunello library, pMD2.G, and psPAX2 were co-transfected between the twenty plates equally, using a total of 300 μg, 120 μg, and 180 μg plasmid, respectively. Prior to transfection, the media was exchanged for DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS instead of the normal 10%, with subsequent media used for the production of lentivirus likewise containing 3% FBS. Media was changed 6 hr post transfection, then collected and pooled at 48 and 72 hr post-transfection. HEPES pH 7.2 (20 mM) and 4 μg/ml polybrene was added to the lentivirus before filtration through a 0.45 μM filter to clear debris. The filtered virus was treated with Benzonase Nuclease (Sigma, Cat#E1014) to digest residual plasmid (50 U/ml benzonase, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) for 30 min at 37°C with gentle agitation.

Five days after transduction, cells were harvested and analyzed via CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Cat#G7570). To estimate the viral titer, we compared cell counts in selected vs unselected conditions for each lentivirus treatment condition.</p><p>For the genome-wide screen, a titer that infected ~20% of plated cells was used. To obtain 100X coverage of the 76,441 gRNA in the Brunello library, sixteen 6-well plates with 4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well were infected. Two days post transduction, cells were split into media containing 1 μg/ml puromycin and Plasmocin (1:10,000). Media was changed every day and cells were split as needed, with 200 μM additional methionine added on day 7 post-transduction. On day eight, cells were deprived of methionine 18 hr before sorting by FACS. Care was taken to sort cells within an 18–20 hr window after methionine depletion to maintain consistency between replicates.</p><p>To prepare cells for FACS, cells were trypsinized then diluted in ice-cold PBS, pipetting gently yet thoroughly to ensure cell clumps were broken up. Cells were pelleted at 1600 x g for 3 min at 4°C before resuspension in FACS buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2% Tet-free FBS, PBS). Resuspended cells were strained using a 100 μM nylon cell strainer (Falcon 100 μM Cell Strainer, Cat#352360) and kept on ice before and during sorting. Cells with the lowest 1% of GFP signal were collected in FACS collection buffer (50% Tet-free FBS, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, PBS) with two rounds of enrichment using a BD Biosciences FACSAria Fusion Cell Sorter. The first round of enrichment of cells sorted at approximately 12,000 cells/sec. However, due to the droplet size, several mid to high GFP expressing cells appeared in the sample. The second round of enrichment removed the mid to high GFP expressing cells, only accepting cells within the initial gating set for the lowest 1% of GFP-expressing cells relative to the unsorted population. For unsorted input to compared to the GFP-depleted sample, a minimum of 8 million cells were set aside for lysis without sorting. Sample coverage was calculated by the number of cells collected in the final sample divided by 1% of the number of gRNA found in the Brunello library (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>).

The two-step variation of the BROAD institute protocol consists of an initial amplification step using primers flanking the P5 and P7 primers used for sequencing. The initial PCR product (PCR#1) is then diluted to be used as template for amplification Illumina P5/P7 flow cell primers (PCR#2). For the first PCR step, 6.6 μg DNA was used as template per 100 μl reaction, with twenty reactions being set up per sample if possible. If the sample contained less than 13.2 μg DNA, the DNA was divided evenly between a minimum of two reactions. The DNA was amplified using with TaKaRa ExTaq and primers NC3196 and NC3197 flanking the P5 and P7 sites (1X ExTaq reaction buffer, 0.2 mM each dNTP, 0.5 μmol each primer, 0.075U ExTaq polymerase, 6.6 μg template DNA, water to 100 μl per reaction). PCR#1 consisted of 18 cycles following the ExTaq manufacturer’s protocol (95°C 1 min, [95°C 30 s, 53°C 30 s, 72°C 30 s] x 18, 72°C 10 min, hold 4°C). For the second PCR amplification step, 5 μl of the pooled PCR#1 reaction was used as template for each 100 μl PCR#2 reaction. Four 100 μl reactions were made per sample using the reaction conditions above, except replacing the primers NC3196 and NC3197 with Illumina P5 stagger primer mix and a P7 barcode primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The P5 stagger primer consisted of all eight stagger primers evenly mixed. A unique P7 barcode primer was used for each sample. The PCR cycle number for PCR#2 was selected to match band intensity between samples when run on an agarose gel (8–12 cycles).</p><p>The 400 μl PCR#2 product per sample was pooled before purification by AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, Cat#A63880) following the BROAD institute protocol (BROAD Institute PCR of sgRNAs for Illumina sequencing). Briefly, the pooled PCR volume was mixed with 0.5 AMPure XP bead volume then incubated 5 min RT. Beads were separated on a magnetic strip for 2 min then the supernatant transferred to a fresh tube to be mixed with 1.8 volumes of AMPure XP beads. After a 5-min RT incubation, beads were separated for 3 min on a magnetic strip before washing twice with 70% EtOH for 1 min each while remaining on the magnet. The beads were dried for 5 min before eluting with the starting volume of water (400 μl) for 2 min at RT. The beads were separated from the sample for 2 min on the magnetic strip, and the eluted DNA was transferred to a fresh tube. The purification protocol was repeated a second time, with the only change being a final elution volume of 50 μl water instead of 400 μl.</p><p>Amplified library was analyzed by Qbit, TapeStation, and qPCR to assess library purity and concentration before sequencing.

CFI<sub>m</sub>25 was amplified by NC3604 and NC3752 and then inserted into the pcDNA-flag and pcMS2-NLS-flag vectors using BamHI and XhoI sites. Similarly, CFI<sub>m</sub>25 derivatives were produced using SOEing using NC3604 and NC3752 as the exterior flanking primers and inserted into the same vectors using BamHI and XhoI sites. The internal primers used for mutagenesis are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>CFI<sub>m</sub>68 and CFI<sub>m</sub>59 were amplified as two fragments each from cDNA produced by oligo-dT priming, using primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. The fragments were joined by SOEing using the forward primer from PCR#1 and reverse primer from PCR#2 then ligated into pcMS2-NLS-flag using BamHI and XhoI sites. Constructs with the RS domain deleted were produced by amplification from the pcMS2-NLS-fl-CFI<sub>m</sub>68 or -CFI<sub>m</sub>59 vectors using primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> before insertion into pcMS2-NLS-flag using BamHI and XhoI sites. pLentiV2-MAT2A was produced by annealing NC2533 and NC2534 before insertion into LentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene #52961; gift of Dr. Feng Zhang) following the Zhang lab protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>). pLentiV2-NT was produced similarly, by annealing NC3198 and NC3199 before insertion into LentiCRISPRv2.</p><p>The pE-SUMO-CFI<sub>m</sub>25 expression plasmid was generated by amplification of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 cDNA with NC3852 and NC3853. The PCR product was digested with BbsI and XbaI and ligated into pE-SUMO cut with BsaI.</p><p>The construct pcbD1-MAT-E8-3´ HP1AG, (2xMS2; β-MAT-hp1G4, 2XMS2) was generated by SOEing joining amplicons generated with primers NC1576 and NC2671 with those from SP6 +and NC2670. PCR reactions used pcβD1-MAT-E8-3´ HP1AG (No MS2) plasmid as a template. The products were inserted into β-MAT-WT cut with EcoRI and XhoI.</p><p>AAVS1 1L TALEN and AAVS1 1R TALEN were gifts from Dr. Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmids #35431 and #35432)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sajana et al., 2014</xref>). The plasmid hAAVS1-GFP-β2-MAT-E8-3´ was generated in two steps. First, we made pcGFP-β1-MAT-E8-3´ by Gibson assembly of three DNA fragments using the Gibson assembly. One insert was generated by amplifying EGFP using primer pair NC2229/NC2230 with pEGFP-N1 as a template and the second insert was made with primer pair NC2231/NC2232 using β-MAT-WT as a template. The vector fragment was generated by gel purification of β-MAT-WT cut with HindIII. The resulting plasmid was used as a template for PCR amplification with primers NC2264/NC2265 and the product was inserted into pAAVS-EGFP-DONOR digested with FseI and XbaI by Gibson assembly to generate hAAVS1-GFP-β2-MAT-E8-3´. The plasmid hAAVS1-GFP-T2A-β2-MAT-E8-3 ́hp2-6m9 was made in two steps. First, we made pcGFP-T2A-β2-MAT-E8-3 ́mhp2-6 by Gibson assembly of three DNA fragments. The vector fragment was pcEGFP, which was made by amplification of eGFP from pEGFP-N1 using primers NC3272 and NC3273 and insertion of the product into pcDNA3 using restriction site HindIII in a Gibson assembly. One insert was generated by amplifying the T2A sequence using primer pair NC3354/NC3375 with pSCRPSY as a template. The second insert was made using primer pair NC3463/NC3466 with β-MAT-hp2-6m9 as a template. The resulting plasmid was used as a template for PCR amplification with primers NC2264/NC2265. This PCR product was inserted into pAAVS-EGFP-DONOR digested with FseI and XbaI by Gibson assembly to generate hAAVS1-GFP-T2A-β2-MAT-E8-3 ́hp2-6m9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Imagequant 5.2 was used to quantify northern blots.

The strengths of the study are the novelty that CFI<sub>m</sub> subunits appear to be functioning in splicing, which has been understudied in the field. Weaknesses include technical concerns revolving around how much intron detention and splicing is playing in the regulation as opposed to mRNA stability</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two main themes emerged from the discussion among the reviewers: 1) concern about the reporter as displaying a readout that is splicing dependent; 2) the desire for additional experimental support and discussion of the model presented in Figure 7. As such, the reviewers suggest the following be addressed:</p><p>1. Provide additional controls to convince the reader that the GFP reporter expression is truly dependent on its splicing efficiency. Both Reviewers 1 and 2 provide more granular suggestions on how to potentially do this below.</p><p>2. Figure 7A makes two predictions: (1) the UGUU and UGUA reporters in Figure 4G, but not the UGCU, should be responsive to CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown and (2) co-depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 and METTL16 should not have a bigger impact on the splicing of the endogenous MAT2A than depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 alone. Both of these predictions are readily tested with the reagents at hand and therefore should be done.</p><p>3. Modify language in the discussion as described by Reviewer 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1. In Figure 1, there needs to be more data provided to indicate that the GFP reporter SAM-dependence is indeed derived from splicing of detained intron in addition to mRNA-stability. The data presented are convincing that the reporter is responsive to SAM depletion (through Mat2A KD), methionine reduction. And METTL16 knock down, but the northern blots do not show the status of the DI splicing in the GFP reporter itself. The concern is that the effects seen are entirely mediated by the hp2-6. qRT-PCR would be sufficient to show this for the reporter. The authors make comments to this event later in the results stating that this product does not appear to accumulate for unknown reasons but it is concerning that it cannot be detected yet is the key component of reporter output.</p><p>2. Along these same lines, the authors describe in S1B-C that there was an unexpected splicing event in their reporter but no primary data is shown for this. This makes it really difficult to understand what is going on quantitatively at the level of splicing.</p><p>3. In Figure 2B, it appears to me that the major effect is less accumulation of the mature MAT2A mRNA (m). The authors are presenting data as 'percentage detained intron inclusion', which increases upon CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knock down. But the raw data seems to suggest that absolute DI levels are not changing but the mature product is going down. Could CFI<sub>m</sub>25 impact mRNA stability as well?</p><p>4. The CRISPR experiment to surgically remove the DI intron is clever but because the authors did not get the homozygous line they desired, I am concerned that other allele could be acting strange as it has a frameshift. Is this other allele subject to NMD? Seems the experiment would be simpler to interpret if both alleles were the same. Can the authors do a better job justifying this genetic tool?</p><p>5. If the authors can either create a homozygous δ-DI cell line or provide a reasonable response to my point #4, they should conduct the experiment shown in Figure 5C but on the δ-DI line. This experiment is slightly different than what was done in Figure 3B and is entirely more compelling because the response is robust. This would really get at the heart of what is the driving factor here: stability of the mature MAT2A mRNA or the splicing of it (that is, in response to methionine depletion).</p><p>6. The model in Figure 7 will likely confuse people. I understand that the authors are trying to keep things simple but they do not show the impact on mRNA stability of the MAT2A mRNA – which appears to be quite dominant. Moreover, the connection between METTL16 and the CFI<sub>m</sub> complex has not been established in this study raising more questions. I would recommend reducing the accentuation on this component of the model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1. CFI<sub>m</sub>25 was initially identified at a regulator of MAT2A splicing through its strong phenotype in the initial CRISPR screen. But it is not shown that GFP expression is actually a read out of the splicing efficiency of the reporter, or that the splicing of the reporter (which is different from that observed in the endogenous MAT2A context) is dependent on SAM and/or METTL16. Without these controls it could be that CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown impacts GFP expression through a splicing- or METTL16-independent manner.</p><p>2. Figure 3C is compelling evidence that depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 only impacts SAM expression when the intron of MAT2A is present, but is this really due to splicing? Expression of mature MAT2A appears similarly Met responsive in the 116-DeltaD1 cells compared to HCT116 (Figure S3A – compare mature message -/+Met). Therefore an equally plausible model is that CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulates the stability of the mature MAT2A?</p><p>3. The model in Figure 7A makes two predictions: (1) the UGUU and UGUA reporters in Figure 4G, but not the UGCU, should be responsive to CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown and (2) co-depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 and METTL16 should not have a bigger impact on the splicing of the endogenous MAT2A than depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 alone. Both of these predictions are readily tested with the reagents at hand and therefore should be done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Rewrite the discussion. It comes off as primarily defensive of some points that are reasonable criticisms but that you have made good counter arguments for in the Results section, and does little to highlight the truly interesting and remarkable findings of the paper.</p><p>A couple of obvious but speculatory points (i.e. beyond the reasonable scope of this paper) that might be included: 1) whether canonical splicing factors that typically bind within the polypyrimidine tract (U2AF1/2) where the intronic CFI<sub>m</sub>25 binding site is located are bound here in MET depleted conditions, or whether they are physically and functionally replaced by the RS-domains of CFI<sub>m</sub>68/59. 2) Given that free METTL16 and CFI<sub>m</sub>25 do not show interaction it may be necessary to obtain macromolecular structures of the MAT2A DI-3UTR region/METTL16/CFI<sub>m</sub> complex in order to determine the RNP interactions governing this complex formation. 3) To what degree does the role of CFI<sub>m</sub> here represent a completely isolated and specific innovation by METTL16 to complete a splicing-based feedback loop, versus providing some insight into the long-understood role of 3' end formation in the splicing of the ultimate intron of a transcript?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64930.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two main themes emerged from the discussion among the reviewers: 1) concern about the reporter as displaying a readout that is splicing dependent; 2) the desire for additional experimental support and discussion of the model presented in Figure 7. As such, the reviewers suggest the following be addressed:</p><p>1. Provide additional controls to convince the reader that the GFP reporter expression is truly dependent on its splicing efficiency. Both Reviewers 1 and 2 provide more granular suggestions on how to potentially do this below.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s fairly point out that several shortcomings of our GFP reporter obscured whether the regulation by CFI<sub>m</sub>25 is due to splicing activity or to changes in RNA stability. These concerns were based primarily on three results: 1) We did not observe the detained intron isoform (GFP-DI) in our northern blots, so it was questionable whether it was even regulated by intron detention, 2) the reporter spliced in an unexpected pattern (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), and 3) we did not exclude potential roles of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 in hp2-6 regulation of mRNA stability. We have developed two new reagents that we think rigorously address these concerns and strongly support the conclusion that the GFP reporters (and MAT2A) are regulated by CFI<sub>m</sub>25 at the level of splicing of the detained intron.</p><p>First, we have improved the quality of our northern blot GFP probe. In the previous version of the manuscript, we mentioned that we could not visualize the isoform of GFP containing the detained intron (GFP-DI). In fact, we did not even observe the mRNA except under inducing (-methionine) conditions (see Figure 1D and Figure 1E). Since then, we designed a significantly improved GFP probe that detects both isoforms of our reporter (revised Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). To improve the signal-to-noise in the assay even more, we also added a poly(A)-selection step to our northern blot validation experiments in Figure 2B-2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. To address Reviewer #1’s concern regarding quantification, we included quantification of these data not only as %DI, but also as relative levels of each of the isoforms (Figure 2C-2E). Using the original reporter, we see concomitant decreases of mRNA with increases in the GFP-DI isoform upon knockdown of METTL16 or CFI<sub>m</sub>25. These observations support the proposed roles of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 and METTL16 in the regulation of splicing of the detained intron of the reporter used in the CRISPR screen.</p><p>We have kept the data with the old probe in Figures 1D and 1E. We could repeat those experiments with the new GFP probe to produce a cleaner result, but that seems misleading since our screen was rationalized based on those data.</p><p>Second, we have included data from a modified reporter recently developed in the lab (revised Figure 2A, bottom diagram). The reporter is effectively the same as the one used previously except for two changes. This reporter includes a T2A “self-cleaving” peptide between the GFP and the β-globin MAT2A fusions for better protein stability. (The stability issue was described in the original version and remains in the revised Results section and Figure 1—figure supplement 1.) However, the relevant change for the current paper is that the new reporter has hp2-6 mutated, so it is not subject to regulation by hp2-6-mediated RNA stability. Using this reporter (T2A, hp2-6m9), we observed diminished GFP mRNA levels and increased GFP-DI accumulation upon depletion of METTL16 or CFI<sub>m</sub>25 (Figure 2A-E; Figure 2—figure supplement 1). A similar response was observed with two independently derived integrated clonal cell lines (Figure 2B-E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This observation excludes the possibility that the CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulation is hp2-6 dependent and is consistent with a role for these factors in splicing of the MAT2A detained intron in the GFP reporter.</p><p>As a side note, careful inspection of the northern blots in revised Figure 2B show that the new T2A, hp2-6m9 reporter mRNA is slightly longer and the detained intron isoform is slightly shorter than the original “Reporter” counterparts. These patterns are consistent with the fact that the new reporter lines’ splicing patterns reflect the “predicted” pattern discussed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, while the original reporter is distinct as previously reported. Thus, the effects of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 on the reporter is not specific to the unique splicing pattern in the original reporter.</p><p>With these new data, we have specifically demonstrated that CFI<sub>m</sub>25-mediated regulation of our MAT2A reporter does not require hp2-6. Conversely, both the initial submission and the revised version of the paper include data from the 116-ΔDI line that demonstrates that CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulation of the endogenous MAT2A requires the detained intron (Figure 3A-3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Since hp2-6 are not required for CFI<sub>m</sub>25 regulation but the detained intron is, these data strongly support the conclusion that the effect of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 on GFP mRNA accumulation is due to a novel role for CFI<sub>m</sub>25 in splicing of the MAT2A detained intron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 7A makes two predictions: (1) the UGUU and UGUA reporters in Figure 4G, but not the UGCU, should be responsive to CFI<sub>m</sub>25 knockdown and (2) co-depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 and METTL16 should not have a bigger impact on the splicing of the endogenous MAT2A than depletion of CFI<sub>m</sub>25 alone. Both of these predictions are readily tested with the reagents at hand and therefore should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent suggestions, and we have included both of these experiments in the revised manuscript. To address the second point first, we have now included METTL16/CFI<sub>m</sub>25 co-depletion experiments in revised Figure 2H. As predicted by the model, there is no synergistic/additive effect after co-depletion of both CFI<sub>m</sub>25 and METTL16 on endogenous MAT2A RNA isoforms.</p><p>We also include the requested experiment with the mutant reporters in revised Figure 4—figure supplement 1. As predicted by the reviewer, the UGUA reporter responds similarly to wild-type upon either CFI<sub>m</sub>25 or METTL16 knockdown, but the UGCU is unaffected. However, there is an important technical caveat regarding the behavior of the UGCU mutant. In our hands, siRNA knockdowns are considerably more efficient in the 293A derivative line 293A-TOA than in HEK293 cells. The latter were used for the reporter experiments in Figure 4, but since the requested experiments required knockdown, we used 293A-TOA cells for the requested experiments. However, 293A-TOA cells show a much higher baseline intron detention than HEK293 cells. As with many alternative splicing events, we find considerable variability in intron retention patterns with both endogenous and reporter RNAs in different cell lines (e.g. Park et al. Cell Reports 2017). In the case that the counter-hypothesis were true (i.e. siCFI<sub>m</sub>25 has additive effects with UGCU), we would not be able to see this change because there is little dynamic range to increase intron retention. Therefore, these data remain largely inconclusive on this issue. These caveats are included in the legend to Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
