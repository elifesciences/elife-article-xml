neurotransmitter release. Recently, the structures of Ric-8A bound to Gα have revealed how Ric-8A phosphorylation promotes Gα recognition and activity as a chaperone and guanine nucleotide exchange factor. However, the molecular mechanism by which NCS-1 regulates Ric-8A activity and its interaction with Gα subunits is not well understood. Given the interest in the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex as a therapeutic target in nervous system disorders, it is necessary to shed light on this molecular mechanism of action at atomic level. We have reconstituted NCS-1/Ric-8A complexes to conduct a multimodal approach and determine the sequence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and phosphorylation events that promote the interaction of Ric-8A with Gα. Our data show that the binding of NCS-1 and Gα to Ric-8A are mutually exclusive. Importantly, NCS-1 induces a structural rearrangement in Ric-8A that traps the protein in a conformational state that is inaccessible to casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation, demonstrating one aspect of its negative regulation of Ric-8A-mediated G-protein signaling. Functional experiments indicate a loss of Ric-8A guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity toward Gα when complexed with NCS-1, and restoration of nucleotide exchange activity upon increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Finally, the high-resolution crystallographic data reported here define the NCS-1/Ric-8A interface and will allow the development of therapeutic synapse function regulators with improved activity and selectivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>guanine nucleotide exchange</kwd><kwd>molecular chaperone</kwd><kwd>calcium

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a key signal that regulates multiple biological phenomena ranging from neurotransmission to gene expression. Changes in the concentration of intracellular free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, its locus of action, and the amplitude and duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are essential to transmit information through the nervous system. The mechanisms by which these changes can bring about such diverse neural responses rely on the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors to decode Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>). The neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of proteins has evolved to participate in specialized neuronal functions separate from calmodulin, due to their 10-fold higher affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The most abundant protein of the NCS family is the neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1), which was first discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and named frequenin (Frq), is N-terminally myristoylated (Myr) and highly conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pongs et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames and Lim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgoyne and Haynes, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Unlike other NCSs, NCS-1 is found outside the nervous system. It does not contain a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Myr switch, thus being constantly bound to the membrane, and has multiple binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ames and Lim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgoyne and Haynes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>). NCS-1 participates in a wide range of important neuronal functions: it is a regulator of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, exocytosis, synaptogenesis, and axonal growth, affecting higher functions such as learning and memory, neuroprotection, and axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgoyne and Haynes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McFerran et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hui and Feng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weiss et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dason et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, NCS-1 has been implicated in several pathological processes such as X-linked mental retardation and autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Torres et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahi et al., 2003</xref>). The multifunctionality of NCS-1 relies on its ability to recognize and regulate different and unrelated target proteins: G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and some of their regulators, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), and kinases, both in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent or -independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The structure of NCS-1 consists of two pairs of EF-hand motifs, of which only three are functional: EF-2, EF-3, and EF-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne et al., 2001</xref>). EF-2 and EF-3 can recognize Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well. It is known that the two Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are structural sites that allow the protein to adopt its tertiary fold. EF-4 has been suggested to be a regulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site, able to sense changes in cytosolic calcium levels in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikhaylova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsvetkov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gifford et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The structures of several NCS proteins bound to their corresponding targets have shown that these Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors use a surface-exposed hydrophobic crevice to recognize their targets, which generally present short helical motifs that bind to the N- or C-terminal part of this large cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It has been proposed that the structural determinants of target specificity are based on the shape and size of the hydrophobic crevice. NCS proteins contain a dynamic C-terminal helix (the so-called helix H10) that can insert into the crevice, thus contributing to its shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding promotes structural rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the occupancy of the three Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites also determines affinity for protein partners. Also, the presence of hydrophilic residues at the border of the crevice contributes to target specificity and they constitute hot spots for interactions with the different targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The structure of NCS/target complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of NCS protein structures bound to their targets.

Although little is known of the regulatory activity of NCS-1 on GPCR function and the cellular and physiological consequences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>, showed that the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex is implicated in the regulation of synapse number and probability of neurotransmitter release. In fact, the regulation of this protein-protein interaction (PPI) using small-molecule modulators allows synapse function control under pathological conditions. In neurodevelopmental disorders, where synapse number is abnormally high, the inhibition of the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex formation reduces synapse number and improves learning in Fragile X syndrome animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cogram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>).

Both activities are stimulated by casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2018</xref>). Ric-8A has been shown to regulate asymmetric cell division and is essential for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller and Rand, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couwenbergs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tõnissoo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woodard et al., 2010</xref>). Work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has shown the relevance of Ric-8A in activating G<sub>s</sub> for in vivo synaptogenesis and that this activity is downregulated by NCS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, the structure of several Ric-8A/Gα or Gα fragment complexes have been solved at atomic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava and Artemyev, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seven et al., 2020</xref>). These works revealed the structural basis of Ric-8A as a Gα chaperone and GEF and showed how phosphorylation of Ric-8A residues S435 and T440 stabilizes a conformation that is competent for Gα recognition. However, there is scarce information on the molecular function of NCS-1 on Ric-8A activity. Based on genetic studies, it has been proposed that NCS-1 interacts with Ric-8A and prevents the Ric-8A/Gα interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we have combined biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic studies to reveal the structural determinants of NCS-1/Ric-8A recognition and the mechanism of NCS-1-mediated downregulation of Ric-8A activity. This work shows how NCS-1 and Ric-8A constitute a hub that integrates Ca<sup>2+</sup>, phosphorylation, and G-protein signaling. The emergent picture indicates that Ric-8A activity is under NCS-1 control and that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal triggers the disassembly of the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex, which in turn allows phosphorylation of Ric-8A, which stabilizes the Ric-8A/Gα complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The NCS-1 interacting region of Ric-8A and the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>To identify potential NCS-1 binding regions, we exploited the high-resolution structural information available on Ric-8A and NCS-1. An analysis of the different reported Ric-8A structures was performed to find potential NCS-1 binding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). First, we took into account that NCS protein targets generally employ one or two short helical motifs to recognize the N- or C-terminal pair of EF-hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>). Second, we considered that the potential interacting helix or helices may have hydrophobic character, since Ric-8A interacts with NCS-1 through its surface-exposed hydrophobic crevice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Third, NCS-1 and G-proteins compete for Ric-8A binding and thus, could share certain interaction surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Using these criteria, we evaluated the hydrophobic character of the HEAT repeat 9 of the ARM/HEAT repeat domain of Ric-8A, which is composed of a two-helix bundle (called a9 and b9), as well as two C-terminal helical motifs (rH10 and rH11), all of them involved in Gα recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The marked hydrophobic character of the a9-b9 two-helix bundle led us to hypothesize that a9 and/or b9 helices could be implicated in the interaction with NCS-1.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we carried out the in vitro reconstitution of the protein complex using an unphosphorylated Ric-8A rat variant construct ending at residue 452 (rRic-8A-452), which includes the two-helix bundle a9-b9 and rH10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and a human NCS-1 deletion construct (NCS-1ΔH10; 100% sequence identity to rat). The NCS-1 C-terminal helix H10 was removed since it works as a built-in competitive inhibitor of the Ric-8A interaction and the affinity for Ric-8A increases 30% in the absence of this helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Previous co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays with the NCS-1 <italic>Drosophila</italic> variant suggested that the interaction occurred in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, although it was stronger in the presence of EDTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). To gain further insights into the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of the complex formation, reconstitution experiments were conducted at different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to evaluate complex assembly (see Materials and methods section). Assembly (i) was attempted in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (2 mM EGTA with or without 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>; see Materials and methods section). No sign of complex assembly was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Assembly (ii) was carried out using a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-preloaded NCS-1 protein and maintaining 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentration in the SEC elution buffer. A very small peak at higher molecular weights was observed and most of the sample eluted as un-complexed species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, neither a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free nor a fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded NCS-1 protein recognized Ric-8A properly, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading of some, out of the 3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites, is required for Ric-8A recognition. To achieve this, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free EGTA-purified NCS-1 was mixed with Ric-8A at a final EGTA concentration of 0.6 mM, and subsequently dialyzed against a 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> buffer (Assembly (iii)). The majority of the protein sample eluted at an apparent molecular mass consistent with the formation of the NCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A complex, as confirmed by SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nano-DSF) experiments also corroborated the efficient assembly when moving from EGTA to intermediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the presence of 0.6 mM EGTA, the denaturation profile of the mixture is consistent with the independent denaturation of both proteins, whose unbound forms have Ti values of 53.5 ± 0.2°C (Ric-8A) and 58.4 ± 0.8°C (NCS-1 EGTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the thermal transition of Ric-8A is up-shifted by more than 20°C (Ti = 79.7 ± 2.8°C) in the sample dialyzed from EGTA to Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, due to the complex formation promoted by NCS-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Moreover, the Ti of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form of NCS-1 in the sample is 82.8 ± 2.6°C, a value that is significantly lower than that shown when the three Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are saturated, which is above 90°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The assembly of rat and human NCS-1/Ric-8A complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependency of the interaction of the rat complex.

To determine whether elements beyond a9-b9 (e.g. rH10 and rH11) are implicated in NCS-1 recognition and also determine if the interaction occurs in the context of the human proteins, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using both full-length human Ric-8A (hRic-8A-FL) and a C-terminally truncated construct lacking rH10 and rH11, and ending at G424 (hRic-8A-424, residues 1–424) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The human Ric-8A sequence is one residue longer than the rat variant due to the insertion of a proline in a loop at position 208. Therefore, G424 in human corresponds to rat G423 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Compared with hRic-8A-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), hRic-8A-424 has significantly higher affinity for NCS-1, suggesting that the HEAT repeat 9, but not the rH10 or rH11 helices, is implicated in the PPI. This supports a model in which two helices of Ric-8A are bound to NCS-1, similar to the case found for yeast NCS-1 bound to Pik1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strahl et al., 2007</xref>). Also, this model is consistent with a reported crystal structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> NCS-1 (also known as Frq2) in its apo form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>), in which its hydrophobic crevice is occupied by two C-terminal NCS-1 H10 helices, one belonging to the same protein and an additional helix belonging to another molecule of the asymmetric unit, thus mimicking a protein/target complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The crystal structure of hNCS-1 bound to Ric-8A peptides</title><p>Attempts to crystallize the assembled in vitro reconstituted NCS-1ΔH10/rRic-8A complex were made with different rRic-8A constructs (ending at different positions between Ric-8A-423 and Ric-8A-452), without success.

Three different peptides were synthesized starting at residue 400 and ending at positions 423 (P1), 429 (P2), and 432 (P3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These peptides include a region of Ric-8A that is 100% identical in both the human and rat variants.

No crystals were obtained with the shortest peptide (P1). However, crystals were obtained with the complexes assembled with peptides P2 and P3.

The quality of the data allowed the unambiguous modeling of Ric-8A-P2 residues 402–429; no density was found for the N-terminal residues S400 and E401 and the density corresponding to residues S402 to R405 was very weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The structures solved with Ric-8A-P3 (Structures 2 and 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were virtually identical with the exception that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is present only in Structures 1 and 2. Compared with Structure 2, the C<sub>α</sub> RMSD for the protein and peptide in Structures 1 and 3 were 0.090 and 0.227, and 0.103 and 0.117, respectively. The greatest differences are found between Structures 1 and 2 at the N-terminus of the Ric-8A peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which make few contacts with NCS-1, and for which the temperature factors are high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although Ric-8A-P3 contains three extra residues at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) no electron density was found for the C-terminal residues P430, E431, and G432 suggesting that they are disordered, exposed to the solvent and do not participate in protein-protein recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In fact, the thermal stability of NCS-1 bound to Ric-8A-P2 or Ric-8A-P3 is very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The two helical elements are interconnected through the loop by an H-bond and van der Waals contacts (triad 1: I407-T410-A415) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>) and also with helix-helix van der Waals interactions (F406-L418 and triad 2: K408-Y409-N414) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Polar contacts with a chloride ion appear to stabilize the conformation of the turn between the two helical segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A calculation of the surface electrostatic potential of Ric-8A-P shows that the helices are amphipathic and expose positive charges to the solvent, except for the C-terminal tip, which shows a negative potential due to the carboxylic end of the peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>The hNCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P contact area is 1140 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>) and a total of 1469 contacts take place (4.2 Å cutoff distance). All the NCS-1 helices that shape the cavity are implicated in Ric-8A recognition: while R2 helix is recognized by multiple helices, R1 contacts helices H7 and H8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). A total of nine H-bonds are formed with Ric-8A in the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Helix R2 is recognized at the middle (L419), N- (N414) and C-terminus (R429) through H-bonds. The Ric-8A R1-R2 loop also plays a relevant role in the recognition process and Y412 forms two water-mediated H-bonds with residues located at the C-terminal part of the crevice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). NCS-1 residue R148 uses its guanidinium group to establish two direct H-bonds with T410 (R1-R2 loop) and K408 (R2 helix). All NCS-1 residues involved in polar contacts are located at the border of the hydrophobic crevice in which Ric-8A is inserted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition to the polar contacts, a large number of van der Waals interactions are formed with the bottom and lateral walls of the NCS-1 crevice in which hydrophobic and a good number of aromatic residues are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Several hydrophobic and aromatic Ric-8A residues satisfy these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Using Ric-8A peptides of different lengths to generate crystal structures, together with PPI assays, it has been possible to define the region of Ric-8A that is necessary and sufficient for NCS-1 recognition and which is conserved in rat and human protein sequences. The addition of three extra residues (peptide P3 vs P2) may allow better folding of the R2 helix. In fact, a cell-based PPI assay with an hRic-8A deletion mutant (hRic-8A-433) ending like rRic-8A-P3 at G432 shows the strongest interaction with full-length hNCS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The crystal structure shows that all Ric-8A-P modeled residues except the N-terminal S402, and the residues P404, R405, and F406 (which belong to helix R1 and are exposed to the solvent, opposite to the face that contacts NCS-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>) are involved in the interaction. The long R2 helix highly contributes to the protein-protein contact area with multiple van der Waals contacts and four H-bonds. Shorter regions such as the R1-R2 loop, only formed by residues T410, G411, Y412, and G413, are also implicated in the PPI, contributing with three hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In fact, these four residues account for 28% of total contacts between hNCS-1 and Ric-8A-P.</p><p>To further validate the PPI interface and the relevance of the interactions observed in the presented crystal structures, several Ric-8A and NCS-1 full-length human mutant proteins were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitations were conducted to analyze their impact on the recognition of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Most of the strong and directional interactions, hydrogen bonds, between NCS-1 and Ric-8A peptides are mediated by NCS-1 side chains oxygens and Ric-8A main chain carbonyl oxygens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, we introduced mutations in NCS-1 and tested the interaction with wild-type hRic-8A. To disrupt H-bonds found in the upper, middle, and/or bottom of the NCS-1 cavity, two double mutants (NCS-1 D37A, Y52A and NCS-1 R148A, R151A) a triple mutant (NCS-1 D37A, R148A, R151A) and a quadruple mutant including the previous double mutants (NCS-1 D37A, Y52A, R148A, R151A) were generated. The location and interacting residues of mutated amino acids are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. The co-immunoprecipitation assays show that mutations R148A, R151A in NCS-1 do not alter Ric-8A binding, despite three H-bonds are lost at the bottom of the crevice. When the recognition of Ric-8A R2 helix is affected at the middle and C-terminus of NCS-1 crevice (Y52A and D37A, respectively), differences in binding are not significant either. The combination of mutations at the top and bottom of NCS-1 crevice (triple mutant; D37A, R148A, R151A), which would affect the recognition of both Ric-8A helices and the R1-R2 loop, has a statistically significant impact on the interaction (40% binding loss). As expected, the quadruple mutant (D37A, Y52A, R148A, R151A) shows the deepest impact on the interaction (more than 60% binding loss), since H-bonds are disrupted at the top, middle, and bottom of the PPI. To further understand the relevance of the R1-R2 loop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>), a Ric-8A triple mutant, T410A, Y412A, N414A (which would correspond to T411A, Y413A, N415A in the human protein), was tested in the PPI binding assay showing no changes in NCS-1 binding. This is in agreement with the previous NCS-1 double mutant designed in that area (R148A, R151A). Finally, we designed mutants in NCS-1 and Ric-8A to test the relevance of the interactions of the C-terminal half of Ric-8A R2 helix, which acquires a extended coiled structure in the presence of Gα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seven et al., 2020</xref>) and becomes helical for NCS-1 recognition. Mutations include NCS-1 W30 (W30A) and two Ric-8A residues close to NCS-1 W30, L424, and M425 (L425 and M426 in the human protein) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>). Despite these residues only mediate long-range hydrophobic contacts, and no H-bond is affected, the impact on the PPI is relevant and binding is reduced more than 50%. The effect is similar to that found when disrupting H-bonds all along the PPI (NCS-1 quadruple mutant).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Residues mutated to alanine to validate the NCS-1/Ric-8A PPI interface.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Residue</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Position and interacting residues</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>NCS-1 D37</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Upper part of the crevice.

However, the in vitro reconstitution assays presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) show that the fully Ca<sup>2+</sup> saturated protein does not efficiently generate the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex. Therefore, some out of the three sites are not occupied with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. NCS-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> occupancy has been addressed previously with the calculation of anomalous difference maps since Ca<sup>2+</sup> but not Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> shows anomalous signal at typical protein-diffraction wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>). In fact, at 0.979 Å wavelength, the anomalous scattering coefficients (f’’) for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> are 0.616, 0.049, and 0.073 electrons, respectively. Therefore, to identify the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound to the EF-hands, anomalous difference maps were calculated as a 10-fold increased anomalous signal is expected if Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present. We used the best quality data set (Structure 2), in which Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were present in the crystallization solution. The anomalous difference map shows 6σ peaks at EF-2 and EF-3 metal sites while no signal is observed in EF-4, indicating unambiguously the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at sites EF-2 and EF-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). EF-4 shows a residual anomalous signal when reducing the σ level, which could indicate a low occupancy of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at EF-4, consistent with the observation that a fully saturated NCS-1 does not recognize Ric-8A properly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We have not modeled Mg<sup>2+</sup> at any of the metal binding sites since it has been reported that EF-4 is unable to bind this metal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the metal-oxygen distances observed (2.3–2.4 Å) are higher than those characteristic of Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination (2.1 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harding, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harding, 2002</xref>). We did observe a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion at the surface of the NCS-1, close to EF-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and located at a special position where atoms from two symmetry-related molecules participate in the coordination sphere. In this case, Mg<sup>2+</sup> exhibits typical octahedral coordination and metal-oxygen distances (2.1 Å), as well as the absence of an anomalous signal. Taking these observations together, a Na<sup>+</sup> ion was modeled at EF-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), since Na<sup>+</sup> was present in the crystallization solution, does not scatter X-rays anomalously, and is structurally undistinguishable from Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Using tryptophan emission fluorescence experiments, we studied the ability of full-length hNCS-1 to bind Na<sup>+</sup> in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As a control, we also studied the binding to K<sup>+</sup>. Our data show that an increase in Na<sup>+</sup> concentration produces an enhancement of the emission fluorescence intensity that achieves saturation at 300 mM NaCl. Considering a 1:1 equilibrium, it is possible to estimate the apparent dissociation constant from these data, which is 123.4±26.6 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>). Compared with Na<sup>+</sup>, the addition of K<sup>+</sup> promotes smaller changes in the emission intensity, which varied linearly with the cation concentration up to 500 mM KCl, with no sign of saturation. This suggests that NCS-1 is unable to bind K<sup>+</sup> at physiologically relevant concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Therefore, the tryptophan emission fluorescence experiments support the binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to NCS-1. The changes observed upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding may reflect variations in the environment of W103 (EF-3 helix H6), which is the tryptophan residue closer to the EF-4 Na<sup>+</sup> binding site. In fact, the EF-4 helix H9 is connected to EF-3 helix H6 through multiple hydrophobic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), so that the structural rearrangement that occurs upon Na<sup>+</sup> binding at EF-4 could be transmitted to W103. Indeed, EF-hand motifs always occur in pairs and upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, EF-hands communicate with each other through the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding loops and helix-helix contacts, in order to orchestrate structural rearrangement and transmit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grabarek, 2006</xref>).

Therefore, as suggested by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> titration experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) only binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the structural sites EF-2 and EF-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>) triggers the conformational rearrangement needed for Ric-8A recognition, and Na<sup>+</sup> occupation of EF-4 does not contribute to NCS-1/Ric-8A complex formation. Therefore, Ric-8A can bind to NCS-1 species with a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free EF-4 site, and in this situation, and at the 100 mM Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations used in the crystallization conditions, the site is occupied with Na<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>Given that NCS-1 EF-4 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourne et al., 2001</xref>) but also Na<sup>+</sup>, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine whether binding of Na<sup>+</sup> to EF-4 affects the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties of NCS-1. We compared the binding isotherms obtained in the presence of 150 mM NaCl or KCl (control). In both media the binding data can be fit to a sequential binding model assuming three available sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the first and last binding steps being enthalpy-driven and the second step entropy-driven. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, filling of the third site is significantly delayed compared to the occupation of the other two sites. Since the stoichiometric binding model makes no distinction as to which sites are saturated, but only on the total number of saturated sites, establishing a correlation between the ITC-derived parameters and filling of specific sites is not possible. However, a previous NMR-based study showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequentially binds to EF-2, EF-3, and finally EF-4, based in the microscopic binding constant measured for each site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mikhaylova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsvetkov et al., 2018</xref>). This observation is also consistent with our crystal structure, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> is found only in EF-2 and EF-3 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, a direct inspection of the isotherms suggests that the interaction with Ca<sup>2+</sup> depends on the monovalent cation present in the media. In particular, we observe that the dissociation constants of the first and last steps (likely involving sites EF-2 and EF-4) increase by about 1.5 times in the presence of Na<sup>+</sup>, while that of the second step doubles and its enthalpy change triples. In conclusion, our data suggest that Na<sup>+</sup> binding modulates the affinity of NCS-1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the influence likely extending to more than one site due to communication among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gifford et al., 2007</xref>). However, the possibility that Na<sup>+</sup> could bind to more than one unoccupied Ca<sup>2+</sup> site cannot be completely discarded.</p><p>Taking into account the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity measured for the regulatory EF-hand (Table 4) and the fact that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> saturated protein does not recognize NCS-1, we performed biolayer interferometry (BLI) experiments to study the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent affinity of NCS-1 for Ric-8A, using the full-length NCS-1 and the Ric-8A-P3 peptide (see Materials and methods section, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Our data show that when the regulatory EF-4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site is empty (0 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 125 mM Na<sup>+</sup> experimental conditions), the apparent dissociation constant of the NCS-1/Ric-8A-P3 complex is in the hundreds of the µM range. However, at high cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (250 nM), the affinity is decreased 1.5 times. At 425 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, when Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are above the K<sub>d</sub> of the regulatory EF-4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, site 3), NCS-1 affinity for Ric-8A-P3 is greatly reduced to the mM range.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent affinity of full-length NCS-1 for Ric-8A-P3 peptide.</title><p>Calculated apparent K<sub>d</sub> and standard error of the mean (SEM) using biolayer interferometry.

With the aim to approximate physiological conditions, full-length NCS-1 and a more native-like rRic-8A construct (residues 1–491) were used. The change in tryptophan fluorescence of rat ΔN31Gα<sub>i1</sub> upon exchange of GDP for GTPγS was measured for the intrinsic exchange activity of ΔN31Gα<sub>i1</sub> and for exchange activity following incubation with either rRic-8A-491, His-NCS-1/rRic-8A-491, or His-NCS-1 in the presence of 0–500 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the intrinsic and Ric-8A-catalyzed rates of nucleotide exchange at ΔN31Gα<sub>i1</sub> in equal measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, after correcting for this effect, it is evident that Ca<sup>2+</sup> produces a concentration-dependent enhancement of the exchange rate in the presence of His-NCS-1/Ric-8A-491 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At 25 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, ~35% of the nucleotide exchange rate is restored to levels similar to that observed in the presence of Ric-8A-491 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, NCS-1 complexed to Ric-8A effectively inhibits the GEF activity of Ric-8A whereas addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> restores GEF activity. From these data, it is possible to calculate the apparent activation constant for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced enhancement of the intrinsic and Ric-8A-catalyzed nucleotide exchange rates at ΔN31Gα<sub>i1</sub> (K<sub>a-EXC</sub>=29 ± 8 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, it is possible to estimate a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced apparent activation constant for its action on the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex, which disassembles upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to NCS-1 EF-4, enabling Ric-8A to catalyze Gα<sub>i1</sub> nucleotide exchange (K<sub>a-NCS-1</sub>=61 ± 35 µM). It is noteworthy that this apparent constant is in the tens of micromolar range and higher than the submicromolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity calculated for the regulatory EF-4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). These differences may be due to different issues. First, the experimental conditions were different in each experiment: Na<sup>+</sup> concentration was 50 mM and 200 mM in the ITC and nucleotide exchange assays, respectively. Second, the nucleotide exchange assay requires 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> competes with Ca<sup>2+</sup> for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>). Third, the apparent activation constant K<sub>a-NCS-1</sub> includes at least three different events: Na<sup>+</sup> dissociation from NCS-1 EF-4 (200 mM NaCl experimental conditions), dissociation of Ric-8A from the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex, and finally, binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to NCS-1. Na<sup>+</sup> dissociation from EF-4 and the disassembly of NCS-1 from Ric-8A are unfavorable contributions to NCS-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding.</p><p>Finally, at this juncture, we have not explored the mechanism of Ca<sup>+</sup>-induced intrinsic nucleotide exchange at ΔN31Gα<sub>i1</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several studies have shown the structural determinants of Ric-8A chaperone and GEF activity for Gα protein subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava and Artemyev, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seven et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2023</xref>). Ric-8A phosphorylation promotes Gα recognition since it stabilizes a conformation that allows Ric-8A to trap the Ras-like domain of Gα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This facilitates the folding of the Gα subunit and stabilizes a nucleotide-free state, which in turn would prepare the protein for GTP loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava and Artemyev, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seven et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the Gα chaperone and GEF activity of Ric-8A could be downregulated by NCS-1 remained unclear. Here, we have combined biochemical, biophysical, and PPI assays with X-ray crystallography to shed light on the mechanism that keeps Ric-8A inactive.</p><p>The combination of the crystallographic work using Ric-8A peptides of different lengths, together with cell-based PPI assays with different Ric-8A and NCS-1 mutants, has enabled the discovery of the necessary and sufficient region of Ric-8A that is required for NCS-1 recognition, a region that is conserved between human and rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This region corresponds to the two-helix bundle that constitutes the HEAT repeat 9 of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain, and a disordered region that, in the presence of Gα, forms an extended coil to permit phosphorylated S435 and T440 (in human S436 and T441) to attach to positively charged patches of Ric-8A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srivastava and Artemyev, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seven et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). Binding of phosphorylated rRic-8A (pRic-8A) to Gα does not substantially alter the conformation of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain, since the overall structure and orientation of repeats of uncomplexed pRic-8A and pRic-8A bound to Gα are very similar, such that any major differences are confined to the polypeptide loop regions. As shown by the crystal structures presented here, the HEAT repeat 9 undergoes a substantial conformational change: helix a9 unfolds while helix b9 refolds, resulting in the named regions R1 and R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The relative orientation of R1 and R2 change with respect to a9 and b9. If helices b9 and R2 are superposed, helix a9 is rotated ~180 degrees with respect to R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To illustrate the structural rearrangement, a morph movie has been produced starting at the Gα-bound and ending at the NCS-1-bound conformations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The structural reorganization affects the distribution of hydrophobic and positively charged amino acids. In the Ric-8A/Gα complex, hydrophobic residues in the HEAT repeat 9 are facing the ARM repeat 8 to create contacts between the two repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In the NCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P complex, the same hydrophobic residues are exposed to the solvent, affording their interaction with the hydrophobic crevice of NCS-1, while positively charged residues are exposed on the opposite face, generating an amphipathic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This would create electrostatic repulsions with repeat 8 and would force the detachment of repeat 9 from repeat 8, so that NCS-1 properly recognizes Ric-8A.

It also means that the free energy of binding would be high enough as to pay the energy penalty derived from the structural changes experienced by Ric-8A to give rise to the complex with NCS-1. Currently, it is unknown if the impact of NCS-1 binding to Ric-8A extends beyond the structural rearrangement that takes place at repeat 9 and its detachment from repeat 8. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that global changes within Ric-8A ARM-HEAT repeat domain have been observed when comparing the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Ric-8A-452 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). The combination of the crystallographic data with low-resolution SAXS data suggested that there were quasi-rigid body angular displacements of three subdomains (constituted by repeats 1–4, 5–6, and 7–9) of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, interactions between the phosphorylated residues and the C-terminal repeat 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) are translated into different contacts between the subdomains, along with a different global shape and curvature of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). The structure solution of the complete Ric-8A ARM-HEAT repeat domain bound to NCS-1 will allow to understand the extent of the rearrangement that Ric-8A suffers upon NCS-1 binding.</p><p>It is worth noting that most of the residues of Ric-8A implicated in the NCS-1/Ric-8A PPI are occluded in the absence of NCS-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The analysis of co-immunoprecipitation assays conducted with different NCS-1 and Ric-8A mutants point to the relevance of van der Waals interactions between the upper part of the NCS-1 crevice and the C-terminal half of Ric-8A helix R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; see binding loss in NCS-1 W30A and Ric-8A L424A, M425A). In the complex with Gα, this region adopts an extended coiled structure and is attached to the ARM-HEAT repeat domain, due to the interactions with the phosphorylated Ric-8A residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the absence of phosphorylation, this region would be exposed to the solvent and could acquire the helical structure needed to initiate the recognition of NCS-1. Initial contacts of the C-terminal part of helix R2 with NCS-1 could constitute the first steps in the recognition process and trigger the subsequent reorganization, which would imply the detachment of repeat 9 and complete the formation of helix R2 and, finally, the formation of helix R1 and the change in the relative orientation of R1 and R2 with respect to a9 and b9.</p><p>The dynamic C-terminal helix H10 of NCS-1 regulates the binding of Ric-8A by inserting into the hydrophobic crevice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Comparison of the structure of Ric-8A-P in complex with NCS-1ΔH10 with that of NCS-1 in which its helix H10 is inserted in the hydrophobic crevice explains why this helix constitutes a built-in competitive inhibitor of the NCS-1/Ric-8A interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The position of helix H10 completely overlaps with the Ric-8A region that is recognized by NCS-1 and displaces most of the H-bonds and contacts reported for the complex, including the C-terminus of helix R1, the N-terminus of helix R2, and the loop connecting them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the binding of Ric-8A does not cause a significant structural reorganization of NCS-1. Superimposition of the hNCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P structure with that of free human NCS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canal-Martín et al., 2019</xref>) shows subtle changes: the NCS-1 helix H3 and the loop connecting the helices H3 and H4 rearrange to open up the cavity to accommodate helix R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, the loop connecting helices H7 and H8 helices, which interacts with the Ric-8A R1 region, undergoes a conformational change to permit the contacts between NCS-1 T135 and Ric-8A residues I407 and, to a lesser extent, V403 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The data presented here show how Ca<sup>2+</sup> recognition and Ric-8A phosphorylation serve as determinants of NCS-1/Ric-8A recognition. Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the structural EF-hands EF-2 and EF-3 is necessary for protein recognition, while EF-4, the regulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>), is free of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as shown in the crystal structure of the NCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and the in vitro reconstruction of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We show that a fully Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loaded protein does not properly recognize Ric-8A (assembly assays, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and BLI, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that in the cellular context, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the subsequent loading of EF-4 may trigger the disruption of the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex. This agrees with the previous cell-based PPI assays that showed a weakened affinity of NCS-1 for Ric-8A in Ca<sup>2+</sup> saturating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romero-Pozuelo et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, our in vitro nucleotide exchange assays demonstrate a loss of Ric-8A GEF function when in complex with NCS-1, while nucleotide exchange rates are partially rescued following addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). With respect to the phosphorylation state of Ric-8A, NCS-1 binds to unphosphorylated Ric-8A protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>) and more importantly, in the context of the protein complex, NCS-1 protects Ric-8A from CK2-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In this situation, an increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels would permit the disassembly of the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex, allowing release of Ric-8A from the membrane, and subsequent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This would promote Ric-8A activation for Gα subunit binding and GEF activity. When inactivation of Ric-8A is required in the cellular context, Ric-8A dephosphorylation must precede NCS-1 binding, since the phosphorylated protein does not recognize NCS-1 properly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). This can be explained as well in the context of the structure of phosphorylated Ric-8A bound to Gα, since the strong ionic interactions of phosphorylated S335 and T440 with the ARM-HEAT repeat domain would preclude the structural rearrangement of repeat 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). Cellular mechanisms of Ric-8A dephosphorylation are not understood. It has been proposed that in the cell, Ric-8A is constitutively phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2018</xref>). However, and in the light of the results presented here, in neurons and other tissues where NCS-1 is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgoyne et al., 2019</xref>), Ric-8A phosphorylation may be under NCS-1 control and regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Since NCS-1 is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that is constantly bound to the membrane and close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, changes of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> would promote the disassembly of the protein complex and the subsequent phosphorylation of Ric-8A by CK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given that Ric-8A is a ubiquitously expressed protein, it is unknown if, in tissues where NCS-1 is not expressed, there are other Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in charge of the regulation of its activity. Furthermore, it is likely that NCS-1 interacts with Ric-8B, a chaperone for other Gα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2011</xref>), since the sequence and structure of the NCS-1 interacting region is conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Papasergi-Scott et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the mechanism of Ric-8A activation regulated by NCS-1.</title><p>Step 1: At low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations NCS-1 interacts with unphosphorylated Ric-8A (uRic-8A), at the plasma membrane. NCS-1 protects Ric-8A from phosphorylation or Gα subunit binding. Ric-8A ARM-HEAT repeat domain is labeled with a question mark since the structure in the context of the NCS-1 complex is unknown. Step 2: When Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase in the cytosol, NCS-1 binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> at EF-4 and the complex is disassembled. NCS-1 helix H10 inserts in the hydrophobic crevice (green) and would be ready for dopamine D2 receptor recognition. Inactive uRic-8A, free of NCS-1, repacks repeats 8 and 9 (helices a9 and b9 in light green) and S335 and T440 are phosphorylated (P) by casein kinase II (CK2) (Step 3). In this state, phosphorylated Ric-8A (pRic-8A) is now active, recognizes prefolded Gα subunit and allows GTP loading (Step 4).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86151-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The transmission of the nerve impulse between neurons begins with the generation of an action potential in the axon initial segment. An action potential is a depolarization of the plasma membrane that depends on Na<sup>+</sup> entry through specific voltage-gated channels and that propagates along the axon to the terminal. When the depolarization Na<sup>+</sup> wave reaches the axon terminal, voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open allowing the massive entrance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> which in turn triggers neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Llinás et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oheim et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, Na<sup>+</sup> precedes Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. Here, we demonstrate that Na<sup>+</sup> decreases the affinity of NCS-1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). The crystal structure of the hNCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P complex shows that NCS-1 binds Na<sup>+</sup> at EF-4, the regulatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site. From a physiological point of view this finding is relevant since NCS-1/Ric-8A disassembly and Ric-8A activation would occur at a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that is higher than initially expected, ensuring the return to the Ric-8A inactive and NCS-1-complexed state when Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels decrease, due to sequestering by several high capacity, low specificity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins.</p><p>This work also sheds light into the mechanism of specificity that allows NCS-1 to recognize different targets. NCS-1 interacts with several proteins related to G-protein signaling: Ric-8A and GPCRs such as the adenosine A2A, cannabinoid CB1, or the dopamine D2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kabbani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Navarro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Angelats et al., 2018</xref>). The structure and Ca<sup>2+</sup> determinants of dopamine D2 receptor recognition by NCS-1 are known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pandalaneni et al., 2015</xref>). It is relevant that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that trigger protein-protein recognition are opposite: while the binding of NCS-1 to Ric-8A takes place at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations at which the functional site EF-4 is free of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>), binding to dopamine D2 receptor takes place at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, while Ric-8A is being blocked by NCS-1, dopamine D2 receptor is free of NCS-1 and vice versa. Also, the role of the NCS-1 dynamic C-terminal helix H10 is different in the two molecular recognition processes, while NCS-1 uses this helical element to properly recognize dopamine D2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pandalaneni et al., 2015</xref>), the helix H10 negatively regulates the binding to Ric-8A. Finally, if the crystal structure of the NCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P complex is compared with other NCS proteins bound to their corresponding targets, the complex that is structurally most similar is the KChIP1/Kv4.3 pair, with an elongated helix resembling the R2 bound to Ric-8A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the N- to C-orientation of the helix is opposite, and no extra helical segment (R1) is recognized. In addition, the Ca <sup>2+</sup> content is different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pioletti et al., 2006</xref>). The number of structures that have been determined of NCS proteins bound to different targets continues to grow. Comparison of these structures show that, while all of the ligands use the same NCS hydrophobic crevice, differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> site ligation, role of the helix H10, and the loop that connects EF-3 and EF-4 in NCS-1 shape the crevice to recognize, very specifically, different target protein motifs. In this sense polar interactions between NCS-1 and the target protein play also an important role to ensure specificity and affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Small-molecule PPI modulators with therapeutic potential have been discovered in the past few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canal-Martín et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roca et al., 2018</xref>). They are able to inhibit (e.g. the phenothiazine FD-44) or stabilize (e.g. the acylhydrazone 3b) the formation of the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex and in doing so, they regulate synapse number and function and show a promising prospect in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mansilla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cogram et al., 2022</xref>) and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canal-Martín et al., 2019</xref>). It has been suggested that these small molecules, which bind to the same NCS-1 site despite their opposite activity, are not Ric-8A competitors. Instead, they have been suggested to be allosteric modulators that contribute to the stabilization of the dynamic helix H10 inside (inhibitors) or outside (stabilizers) the crevice, favoring NCS-1 conformations that hinder or allow the entrance of Ric-8A and the subsequent formation of the protein complex. Supporting this, the modulator FD-44 does not inhibit the formation of the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex when the dynamic helix H10 is deleted. The structure of the hNCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P complex explains the molecular mechanism of action of the regulatory compounds. Comparison of the different complexes shows that the binding sites for these molecules overlap with the C-terminal half of helix R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). With respect to the inhibitors, hydrophobic interactions of FD-44 with the helix H10 stabilize the crevice-inserted helix H10 conformation of NCS-1. The combination of the compound plus helix H10 makes the Ric-8A interacting region of NCS-1 completely unavailable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). On the contrary, for the PPI stabilizer, the polar characteristics of the molecule hinders the approach of the helix H10 to the crevice, making the C-terminal part of the cavity, which is more relevant in terms of the PPI, available for Ric-8A recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The structure of hNCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-P does not support the existence of a ternary NCS-1/Ric-8A/stabilizer complex, since there would be no room for the repositioning of the compound. Therefore, the binding of Ric-8A to NCS-1 would displace modulator 3b from the crevice, which would be likely given the moderate affinity of the compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canal-Martín et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, we believe that the high-resolution data on the NCS-1/Ric-8A PPI interface presented here will be essential to rationally develop improved compounds with better PPI regulatory properties and selectivity, since the relevant interactions between NCS-1 and Ric-8A have been finally revealed. The fact that the NCS-1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> and structural determinants are different in recognizing Ric-8A and the dopamine D2 receptor is conceptually relevant, since opens the path to the design of selective drugs that target specifically these neuronal pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression, and purification of proteins</title><p><italic>NCS-1 constructs:</italic> Human full-length NCS-1 (100% protein sequence identity with the rat variant) was cloned in the pETDuet vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canal-Martín et al., 2019</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The neuronal calcium sensor NCS<sup>-1</sup> regulates the phosphorylation state and activity of the Gα chaperone and GEF Ric-8A&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jennifer Cash (Reviewer #2);</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers do not think that the cryo-EM maps, at the current resolution, support the conclusions drawn from this data including the model for the full assembly. The reviewers encourage the authors to continue to improve the protein prep and grid preparation to achieve higher resolution. However, the reviewers also acknowledge that this may be difficult. If the authors are unable to improve the maps, the conclusions and models based on cryo-EM data should be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers were also concerned that the nanobodies may interfere with the native binding interface. If the cryo-EM maps are improved and included, the authors should provide evidence that the nanobodies do not exert such an influence.</p><p>2. Since the structures of the Ric-8A/NCS-1 interface are inferred from Ric-8A peptides, it is critical to validate this interface with mutational analysis of the full-length or truncated Ric-8A.</p><p>3. Additional control or replicate experiments should be reported, including:</p><p>– Measurements of the Gα GTPγS binding rates in the presence of NCS-1 alone, as well as the data points for 1 and 50 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup> across all conditions.</p><p>– The data for NSC-1/Ric-8A at all Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are compared to the 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition for Gα (Figure 8A). The comparison should be between the data points with the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p><p>– Figure 2B and 2D: Please provide replicate measurements and errors to assess reproducibility, including replicates from at least independent protein preps. The authors should provide an explanation of what the points on these plots indicate, and how the inflection values were determined.</p><p>– The section on Ric-8A phosphorylation should include additional positive controls to demonstrate that the casein kinase treatment successfully phosphorylates Ric-8A, such as the LC-MS/MS experiment.</p><p>4. The authors should clarify the conclusions drawn from the calcium dependence of GEF activity, supplementing with additional experiments if necessary. In Figure 8B, the effect of ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GTPγS binding by Gα alone should be considered, since this would correspondingly diminish the rescue effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GEF activity of Ric-8A in the presence of NCS-1. The authors should also address why the rescue occurs at high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The authors hypothesize that the rescue occurs because NSC-1 no longer effectively binds to Ric-8A at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, the authors should comment on why the fast component of the Ric-8A-stimulated GTPgS binding is not restored at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 8-suppl Figure 1). Finally, the authors should comment on why Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinities for the three NCS-1 binding sites (Kd values &lt; 1 uM, Figure 4D, Table 2) do not match the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Figure 8, which require up to 500 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>5. The large increase in the thermostability of Ric-8A in the complex with NCS-1 (Figure 2) seems to disagree with the proposed detachment of the Ric-8A arm/heat repeats 8 and 9 from the core of Ric-8A. This should be considered and discussed.</p><p>6. Please provide additional discussion and rationale for the following experiments:</p><p>– Nano-DSF experiments (starting line 180): Here (and elsewhere in the manuscript) the reader would benefit from a short description of the assay and analysis.</p><p>– Tryptophan emission fluorescence experiments: Please describe this assay and why it can be utilized for these proteins. Where are the tryptophans located, and what does the data tell us?</p><p>– Clarification is needed on ITC data interpretations, including how the authors determine the sequence of calcium binding to each site.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is odd that the intensity of the NCS-1 band in the SEC-purified Ric-8A/NCS-1 complex is roughly double that for Ric-8A when the opposite would be expected based on the MW of the proteins (Figure 2A).</p><p>2. The large increase in the thermostability of Ric-8A in the complex with NCS-1 (Figure 2) is in stark contrast with the proposed detachment of the Ric-8A arm/heat repeats 8 and 9 from the core of Ric-8A.</p><p>3. Many of the NCS-1 contact residues of Ric-8A from the structures with peptides are involved in the intramolecular interactions and are not available for binding NCS-1 (Figure 3). What residues of Ric-8A are involved in the initial recognition of NCS-1? The interface from the &quot;peptide&quot; structures needs to be validated with mutational analysis of Ric-8A, which may identify residues involved in the initial recognition.</p><p>4. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinities for the three NCS-1 binding sites (Kd values &lt; 1 uM, Figure 4D, Table 2) do not match the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Figure 8 requiring up to 500 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>5. The resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction is low, and the maps are visually not improving through multiple rounds of 3D classification (Figure 4S). With significant portions falling out of the density, the Ric-8A nanobodies do not anchor Ric-8A into the map well. More importantly, the placement of NCS-1 into the map does not appear to have a structural rationale. What force pulls NCS-1 with Ric-8A repeats 8 and 9 away from the arm/heat core domain and towards the N-terminal part of Ric-8A (and keeps it stable in that position)? From the model, this could only be a nonspecific interaction of NCS-1 with the Nb8119 nanobody. Optimization of the sample/grid preparation is required for unequivocal cryo-EM reconstruction of the complex structure.</p><p>6. The analysis of the effect of NCS-1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GEF activity of Ric-8A lacks important controls and comparisons. Missing are the measurements of the Gα GTPγS binding rates in the presence of NCS-1 alone, as well as the data points for 1 and 50 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup> across all conditions. Also, the data for NCS-1/Ric-8A at all Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are compared to the 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition for Gα (Figure 8A). The comparison should be between the data points with the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Similarly, the meaning of the plot in Figure 8B is unclear because the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GTPγS binding by Ga alone is not taken into account. If one takes into account the activating effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Gα, the rescue effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GEF activity of Ric-8A in the presence of NCS-1 is not as apparent. Why does the rescue occur at high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see comment 4)? It is hypothesized that the rescue occurs because at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> NSC-1 no longer effectively binds to Ric-8A. Why then is the fast component of the Ric-8A-stimulated GTPγS binding not restored at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 8-suppl Figure 1)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Nano-DSF experiments (starting line 180): Here (and elsewhere in the manuscript) the reader would benefit from a short description of the assay being used before describing the results. What is a &quot;Ti&quot; value? In Figure 2B, why are there two points on this curve, and how were they determined? The inflection points are not convincing, and there are no statistics presented to allow the reader to assess the reproducibility and significance of the data. Data shown in Figure 2D is equally unconvincing.</p><p>– Tryptophan emission fluorescence experiments: Please describe this assay and why it can be utilized for these proteins. Where are the tryptophans located, and what does the data tell us?</p><p>– Results in the paragraph starting line 341: How are the authors determining the sequence of calcium binding to each site? How are the data correlated to each binding site? Clarification is needed on ITC data interpretations here.</p><p>– The major concern of this reviewer is in the cryo-EM data presented. A very low-pass filtered map is presented (17 Å), and it is stated that low resolution is due to high levels of dissociation and conformational heterogeneity. How was this determined? From the micrograph, it looks like the particles are buried in thick ice, which would limit the resolution. From the 2D class averages, the complete particles look mostly intact. Resolution is likely also limited by a low number of particles representing the final map. The authors state that the model could be &quot;unambiguously fit using the Nbs as fiducial markers&quot; (line 370). From the maps presented, I do not see this, and I would argue that nothing can be unambiguously fit into a cryo-EM map at 17 Å. All three nanobodies are protruding from the map as well as bits of Ric-8A. Additionally, there are unaccounted-for parts of the map that are left unmodeled. The cryo-EM data are of poor quality, and the modeling is not convincing. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn from this data add little to the story being presented in the manuscript. I recommend removing this data from the manuscript, or, at the very least, moving it entirely to the supplemental data section. This would not diminish the impact of the manuscript.</p><p>– Abstract: Briefly define what Neuronal Calcium Sensor 1 is – what type of protein is this?</p><p>– Figure 7: This is out of order with the flow of the presented figures. Please fix.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The section on Ric-8A phosphorylation should include additional positive controls to demonstrate that the casein kinase treatment successfully phosphorylates Ric-8A, such as the LC-MS/MS experiment. This would both bolster the conclusion from LC-MS/MS that the complexed Ric8A resists phosphorylation, and provide support for the statement that uncomplexed Ric8A is fully phosphorylated (line 409), which is difficult to conclude from ion exchange chromatography alone since this is a low-resolution method (although it is clear that the protein is at least partially phosphorylated).</p><p>2. What evidence is there that the nanobodies don't interfere with the native binding interaction between Ric8A and NCS-1? Based on the figures, 8109 looks particularly problematic in terms of being close to the proposed interface, as if it might cause the proposed hinge to extend in a non-native way. It would strengthen this section to perform a binding experiment in the presence of the nanobody.</p><p>3. Can the authors quantify their fits to the density envelope in cryo-EM? (perhaps by determining RSCC values?) The authors state that they identified the proper docking configuration because the nanobodies fit the density better, but even in the favored interpretation, nanobody 8109 and 8117 seem to be sticking out of the density envelope. It's hard to tell by eye that one version in figure S5 is clearly better than the others.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The neuronal calcium sensor NCS<sup>-1</sup> regulates the phosphorylation state and activity of the Gα chaperone and GEF Ric-8A&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kenton Swartz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, and the reviewers are satisfied with most of the changes, but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Two reviewers with expertise in cryo-EM both have reservations about the updated cryo-EM data processing and remain concerned about the model fitting to the map. However, the reviewers think that the manuscript still provides new, valuable insight even without the cryo-EM data and that this data is not essential to support the main conclusions. Thus, the cryo-EM data should be removed from the manuscript, and the conclusions and models should be rewritten accordingly. The full reviews are below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would still recommend that the authors remove the cryo-EM analysis from the manuscript. The new analysis of the old data does not seem to significantly improve the reconstruction. The use of the previous cryo-EM map to search for particles may have introduced model bias, and it may have led to overfitting the noise. This may explain why the new 2D classes are streaky. In my view, the model fitting into the map remains ambiguous.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the authors have assembled a thorough and satisfactory response to most of the requests of the reviewers.</p><p>However, after reviewing the revised data, my concerns on the presented cryo-EM data still stand. In fact, I am now more confused about the way the model of the complex has been assembled into the map. It appears that NCS-1 is no longer making contact with Ric-8A. Although the 2D classification images show more detail, they also show spikey features, likely due to the alignment of noise. I disagree that the new map is more informative. The presented micrograph is also difficult to interpret, and I'm not sure what is meant to be seen here. It seems that the biochemistry of the sample needs to be revisited and not further data collection and processing of the current sample. I don't support publishing this cryo-EM data. Again, I don't think these data are needed to support the main conclusions of the paper, and the paper would not carry any less weight without them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86151.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

For this reason, we have made significant additional efforts to improve the current cryo-EM map while also tuning down the conclusions extracted from the model:</p><p>a) We have made new NCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-452 complex sample (with two Nbs Nb8117 and Nb8119) and vitrified the complex in cryo-grids with carbon support, attempting to remove potential effects of the air-water interface that could trigger the disassembly of the complex. We then collected &gt;30,000 micrographs however, without success. We saw an even higher disassembly, likely due to the lower concentration used for carbon support grid (3-fold lower than what we use for freestanding ice). Hence, this approach failed to improve the sample quality. Although we did not manage to obtain 3D maps, 2D averages were similar to those previously achieved and those in the improved dataset, albeit with worse quality.</p><p>b) We have also used both Relion and Cryosparc to reprocess all four data sets that had been collected on the NCS-1ΔH10/Ric-8A-452 complex with three nanobodies. We had success by using the final cryo-EM map presented in the previous manuscript to search for particles in previous datasets. Using this strategy, we managed to achieve improved data in one of the earlier datasets, as seen by the 2D averages and cryo-EM map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> the comparison in Figure 1). Although still at low resolution (10 Å), it is more homogenous and density can be assigned with no ambiguity (i.e. nanobodies fit clearly into their own density when fitting the Ric-8A and 3Nbs <italic>en bloc</italic>). We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> a comparison of the different views of the old and new map with the fit.

Our assembly procedure is the same as that used in the Ric8A/Gα/3Nb complex (McClelland et al., 2020). The structure of Ric-8A/Gα has been solved also without nanobodies (Seven et al. 2020) and the structural comparison of both structures shows that they are virtually the same, with local changes in large loops that are implicated in Nb recognition. It has been described that the ARM-HEAT repeat domain is arranged in three subdomains constituted by repeats 1-4, 5-6 and 7-9 (Zeng et al., 2019), and that these subdomains can suffer quasi-rigid body angular displacements, contributing to the generation of different curvatures of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain. Since Nb8119 binds to repeats 1-2, Nb8117 to repeat 5-6 and Nb8109 to repeat 7, all at the middle of the subdomain and not to the junctions, we don’t feel that they interfere with mobility. Additionally, Nbs do not bind to the repeat 9, which physically contacts NCS-1.</p><p>Overall, we feel that the cryo-EM map, although at low resolution, makes some relevant contributions: (a) it supports the detachment of Ric-8A repeat 9 from the ARM-HEAT repeat domain, as suggested by the crystal structure of NCS-1/Ric-8A peptide complexes; (b) it highlights the different nature of the Ric-8A/NCS-1 complex when compared to Ric-8A/Gα (while the latter has three strong interfaces, NCS-1 interacts with the C-terminus of Ric-8A ARM-HEAT repeat domain, through a flexible region and makes no interactions with the core of the domain); and (c) it highlights that therapeutic modulation of Ric-8A/NCS-1 interaction would exclusively require regulation of the interaction observed in the crystal structure. Therefore, we believe that keeping these data in the manuscript is positive.</p><p>We have introduced the corresponding changes in the Results (starting at line 423), Discussion (line 565) and Materials and methods (line 1046) sections, as well as in Figure 5, Figure 5-supplement 1 and 2, and Figure 8C and 8D (previously Figure 7C and 7D). In this new version of the manuscript, and thanks to one of the reviewers´ comments, we have properly named Figure 7. Taking the flow of figures along the paper, Figure 8 should be named Figure 7, and the other way around, Figure 7 should be named Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Since the structures of the Ric-8A/NCS-1 interface are inferred from Ric-8A peptides, it is critical to validate this interface with mutational analysis of the full-length or truncated Ric-8A.</p></disp-quote><p>We have designed several human hRic-8A and hNCS-1 full-length mutants and conducted co-immunoprecipitations (experiments in triplicate) to validate the protein-protein interface observed in the crystal structures of NCS-1 bound to Ric-8A peptides (see new Figure 3D and Table 3). Concretely, we have tested with a total of 4 NCS-1 mutants the relevance of disrupting H-bonds between NCS-1 and Ric8A. Also, we have tested the relevance of interactions that involve the Ric-8A R1-R2 loop and the C-terminal region of helix R2, which acquires an extended coil structure when bound to Ga and is helical in the presence of NCS-1. The analysis of the results validates the crystal structure presented and also gives insights on how the initial recognition of Ric-8A may take place.

The authors should clarify the conclusions drawn from the calcium dependence of GEF activity, supplementing with additional experiments if necessary. In Figure 8B, the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GTPγS binding by Gα alone should be considered, since this would correspondingly diminish the rescue effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GEF activity of Ric-8A in the presence of NCS-1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the reviewer´s recommendation and clarified the conclusions. See, please, Results section related to nucleotide exchange experiments (starting at line 481). After subtracting the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Gα<sub>i1</sub> alone, ~35 % of the nucleotide exchange rate (instead of 85%) is restored at 25 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, compared to levels observed in the presence of Ric-8A-491(new Figure 7). The recovery increased at higher cation concentrations, and an apparent constant K<sub>a-NCS-1</sub> = 61 + 35 µM was estimated for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced effect on the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex, leading to Ric-8A disassembly from NCS-1 and enabling Ric8A to catalyze Gα<sub>i1</sub> nucleotide exchange. We discuss that the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex must be partially kinetically trapped. The extensive conformational changes that must occur in order to disengage the a8-b9 HEAT repeat helices of Ric-8A from NCS-1 and subsequently rearrange to accommodate binding to Gα<sub>i1</sub> likely imposes a substantial kinetic barrier. Also, in vitro and in the absence of other NCS-1 targets (this is not the case in vivo, as we point out in Figure 9 and the corresponding Discussion section) the NCS-1/Ric8A complex is thermodynamically favored, since the complete hydrophobic crevice of NCS-1 is buried in the complex, while in the absence of target, it would be partially exposed to the solvent.</p><p>Additional data are also provided to better understand the interplay between NCS-1, Ric-8A and Gi. See new Figure 4E, Figure 4-supplement figure 2 and Table 4. Using biolayer interferometry (BLI) (see Results section starting at line 407 and the corresponding methods starting at line 977), we have found that the affinity of full-length NCS-1 for a Ric-8A peptide is reduced with the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Our data show that when the regulatory EF-4 Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site is empty, the apparent dissociation constant of the NCS-1/Ric-8A-P3 complex is in the hundreds of µM range. However, at high cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (250nM), NCS-1 affinity for Ric-8A-P3 is reduced 1.5 times, and at 425 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the interaction is greatly reduced. In such situation, Ric-8A would be free to interact with Gα<sub>i</sub>. The new data are found in: Materials and methods (new “Biolayer Interferometry” section starting at line 977), Results (new paragraph starting at line 407), Table 4 (line 1147) and the new figures Figure 4E and Figure 4-supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also address why the rescue occurs at high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The authors hypothesize that the rescue occurs because NSC-1 no longer effectively binds to Ric-8A at high Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, the authors should comment on why the fast component of the Ric-8A-stimulated GTPγS binding is not restored at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 8-suppl Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see our arguments and discussion above. Also comments in the corresponding Results section (starting at line 407). The fact that the complex gets partly kinetically trapped would not allow the detection of the binding of GTPγS to an intermediary complex of Ric-8A with nucleotide-free ΔN31Gαi1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors should comment on why Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinities for the three NCS-1 binding sites (Kd values &lt; 1 uM, Figure 4D, Table 2) do not match the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Figure 8, which require up to 500 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>We comment on these differences in the Results section related to the nucleotide binding assays (starting at line 516). There are several reasons that may account for the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations the rescue occurs compared with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity of the regulatory EF-4 site. First, the experimental conditions were different in each experiment: Na<sup>+</sup> concentration was 50 mM and 200 mM in the ITC and nucleotide exchange assays, respectively. Second, the nucleotide exchange assay requires 2 mM MgCl2, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> competes with Ca<sup>2+</sup> for binding. Third, and more importantly, the apparent activation constant K<sub>a-NCS-1</sub> includes at least three different events: Na<sup>+</sup> dissociation from NCS-1 EF-4 (200 mM NaCl experimental conditions), dissociation of Ric-8A from the NCS-1/Ric-8A complex, and binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to NCS-1. Na<sup>+</sup> dissociation from EF-4 and the disassembly of NCS-1 from Ric-8A would negatively contribute to the overall free energy change, thereby reducing the apparent affinity of NCS-1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Therefore, a higher concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is needed to saturate the EF-4 hand in nucleotide exchange functional assays compared to ITC experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The large increase in the thermostability of Ric-8A in the complex with NCS-1 (Figure 2) seems to disagree with the proposed detachment of the Ric-8A arm/heat repeats 8 and 9 from the core of Ric-8A. This should be considered and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As it is pointed out, there is an important improvement of Ric-8A thermostability (&gt;20ºC) upon NCS-1 binding (Figure 2B). This result was indicative of the strong interactions established in the complex between the Ric-8A-452 and NCS-1ΔH10. It also means that the free energy of binding would be high enough as to pay the energy penalty derived from the structural changes experienced by Ric-8A to give rise to the complex with NCS-1. The impact of NCS-1 binding to Ric-8A probably goes beyond the structural rearrangement that takes place at repeat 9 and its detachment from repeat 8. In this respect, it is worth noting that global changes in the Ric-8A ARM-HEAT repeat domain have been observed when comparing the phosphorylated (pRic-8A) with the unphosphorylated version (uRic-8A) of the protein. Specifically, Zeng et al. (2019) showed that phosphorylation of Ric-8A induces a global change in rRic-8A-452 structure. The combination of the crystallographic data of pRic-8A-452 with low-resolution SAXS data of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated proteins in solution suggested that there were quasi-rigid body angular displacements of three subdomains (repeats 1-4, 5-6 and 7-9) of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain. This rearrangement is translated into different contacts between subdomains, along with a different global shape and curvature of the ARM-HEAT repeat domain (see new Figure 8D). Finally, although the current resolution of our cryo-EM data does not allow us to describe the structural reorganization, the curvature of Ric-8A in the low-resolution uRic-8A/NCS-1 complex does not match that of the low-resolution model uRic8A or those of pRic-8A or pRic-8A/Gα complex (Figure 8D), suggesting that NCS-1 induces a global rearrangement. We now comment on this issue in the Discussion section, starting at line 565.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

It is odd that the intensity of the NCS-1 band in the SEC-purified Ric-8A/NCS-1 complex is roughly double that for Ric-8A when the opposite would be expected based on the MW of the proteins (Figure 2A).</p></disp-quote><p>This type of calcium sensors run anomalously on gels since they are highly thermostable due to their high affinity for calcium. Despite the samples are boiled, they maintain a certain fold because structural Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites are not completely destroyed. The protein is not completely denatured and runs at a lower molecular weight (NCS-1ΔH10 is 20,500 Da but clearly migrates below 20,000, see Figure 2). Also, their aberrant migration is translated to bands that sometimes look wider. We would like to point out that we have run SEC-MALS with the nanobodies assembled NCS-1/Ric-8A complex and the results point to a heteropentameric NCS-1/Ric-8A/Nb8117/Nb8119/Nb8109 (Material and methods line 817).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Many of the NCS-1 contact residues of Ric-8A from the structures with peptides are involved in the intramolecular interactions and are not available for binding NCS-1 (Figure 3). What residues of Ric-8A are involved in the initial recognition of NCS-1? The interface from the &quot;peptide&quot; structures needs to be validated with mutational analysis of Ric-8A, which may identify residues involved in the initial recognition.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see Essential revision question 2. The mutations point to the relevance of the interactions between the upper part of the NCS-1 crevice and the C-terminal half of helix R2. In the absence of NCS-1, this region adopts an extended coiled structure, and in the absence of phosphorylation, it would be detached from Ric8A ARM-HEAT repeat domain, and thus, it would be available. The presence of NCS-1 would promote the formation of the helical structure and this could constitute the first steps that would trigger the structural reorganization of Ric-8A. We now discuss this in the manuscript (Discussion section starting at line 587).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinities for the three NCS-1 binding sites (Kd values &lt; 1 uM, Figure 4D, Table 2) do not match the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in Figure 8 requiring up to 500 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>Discussed above at Essential revision question 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction is low, and the maps are visually not improving through multiple rounds of 3D classification (Figure 4S). With significant portions falling out of the density, the Ric-8A nanobodies do not anchor Ric-8A into the map well. More importantly, the placement of NCS-1 into the map does not appear to have a structural rationale. What force pulls NCS-1 with Ric-8A repeats 8 and 9 away from the arm/heat core domain and towards the N-terminal part of Ric-8A (and keeps it stable in that position)? From the model, this could only be a nonspecific interaction of NCS-1 with the Nb8119 nanobody. Optimization of the sample/grid preparation is required for unequivocal cryo-EM reconstruction of the complex structure.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in Essential revision question 1, the improvement of cryo-EM data processing suggests that there is no contact between Nb8119 and NCS-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The analysis of the effect of NCS-1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GEF activity of Ric-8A lacks important controls and comparisons. Missing are the measurements of the Gα GTPγS binding rates in the presence of NCS-1 alone, as well as the data points for 1 and 50 μm Ca<sup>2+</sup> across all conditions. Also, the data for NCS-1/Ric-8A at all Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are compared to the 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition for Gα (Figure 8A). The comparison should be between the data points with the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Similarly, the meaning of the plot in Figure 8B is unclear because the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GTPγS binding by Gα alone is not taken into account. If one takes into account the activating effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Gα, the rescue effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the GEF activity of Ric-8A in the presence of NCS-1 is not as apparent. Why does the rescue occur at high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see comment 4)? It is hypothesized that the rescue occurs because at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> NCS-1 no longer effectively binds to Ric-8A. Why then is the fast component of the Ric-8A-stimulated GTPγS binding not restored at high Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 8-suppl Figure 1)?</p></disp-quote><p>Discussed above.

A very low-pass filtered map is presented (17 Å), and it is stated that low resolution is due to high levels of dissociation and conformational heterogeneity. How was this determined? From the micrograph, it looks like the particles are buried in thick ice, which would limit the resolution. From the 2D class averages, the complete particles look mostly intact. Resolution is likely also limited by a low number of particles representing the final map. The authors state that the model could be &quot;unambiguously fit using the Nbs as fiducial markers&quot; (line 370). From the maps presented, I do not see this, and I would argue that nothing can be unambiguously fit into a cryo-EM map at 17 Å. All three nanobodies are protruding from the map as well as bits of Ric-8A. Additionally, there are unaccounted-for parts of the map that are left unmodeled. The cryo-EM data are of poor quality, and the modeling is not convincing. Furthermore, the conclusions drawn from this data add little to the story being presented in the manuscript.
