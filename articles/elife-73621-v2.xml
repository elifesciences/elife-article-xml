While external flows that draw food into the mouth are well described, how intraoral waterflows manage to deposit food at the esophagus entrance remains unknown. In theory, the posteriorly moving water must, at some point, curve laterally and/or ventrally to exit through the gill slits. Such flows would eventually carry food away from the esophagus instead of toward it. This apparent paradox calls for a filtration mechanism to deviate food from the suction-feeding streamlines. To study this gap in our fundamental understanding of how fishes feed, we developed and applied a new technique to quantify three-dimensional (3D) patterns of intraoral waterflows in vivo. We combined stereoscopic high-speed X-ray videos to quantify skeletal motion (XROMM) with 3D X-ray particle tracking (XPT) of neutrally buoyant spheres of 1.4 mm in diameter. We show, for carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) and tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>), that water tracers displayed higher curvatures than food tracers, indicating an inertia-driven filtration. In addition, tilapia also exhibited a ‘central jet’ flow pattern, which aids in quickly carrying food to the pharyngeal jaw region. When the food was trapped at the branchial basket, it was resuspended and carried more centrally by periodical bidirectional waterflows, synchronized with head-bone motions. By providing a complete picture of the suction-feeding process and revealing fundamental differences in food transport mechanisms among species, this novel technique opens a new area of investigation to fully understand how most aquatic vertebrates feed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic></kwd><kwd>fish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-ACHN-0006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Wassenbergh</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The integration of biplanar X-ray videos with 3D X-ray particle tracking revealed that fish use a combination of intraoral 'central jet' waterflow pattern and inertia to guide food toward the digestive tract during suction feeding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How organisms acquire food is largely determined by the medium in which they feed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herrel et al., 2012</xref>). Aquatic organisms commonly exploit the dense and viscous properties of water to carry food from a distance, toward and through their mouth, by generating flows of water. These flows typically result from suction created by a powerful expansion of the feeding apparatus, for example, in fishes that suddenly increase the volume of their buccopharyngeal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander, 1969</xref>). This action is referred to as &quot;suction feeding&quot;.</p><p>A wide range of aquatic vertebrates across a large size range employ suction feeding: from larval fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drost et al., 1988</xref>) and frog tadpoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deban and Olson, 2002</xref>) to whales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Werth, 2004</xref>), and some carnivorous plant with tiny suction traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Müller et al., 2020</xref>). Because of this impressive diversity in organisms making use of suction feeding, it plays an important role in all major aquatic habitats and feeding niches throughout the water column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wainwright et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In virtually all fishes, waterflows generated by suction are essential for transporting food inside the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labarbera, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Potvin and Werth, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wainwright et al., 2015</xref>). During suction feeding, the three-dimensional (3D) waterflow patterns toward the fish’s mouth have been particularly well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Day et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nauwelaerts et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skorczewski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Leeuwen, 1984</xref>). Although waterflow patterns external to the mouth depend on the approaching speed of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kane and Higham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muller and Osse, 1984</xref>), instantaneous streamline patterns are fairly conserved between species and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacobs and Holzman, 2018</xref>): as the 3D streamlines converge toward the gape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, blue arrows), food items that are initially somewhere close to the mouth will curve into the buccal cavity by these extraoral waterflows.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical waterflow patterns during suction feeding in fish.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustration of extraoral flows (blue path line arrows) and hypothetical intraoral flows (red path line arrows) with important anatomical structures involved in food interception (the right-side buccopharyngeal walls and branchial basket are removed and only left-side path lines are shown) in a bony fish.

Note that from (<bold>b</bold>) to (<bold>d</bold>), the tendency to move food away from the desired food target, the esophagus, decreases.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73621-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast to this relatively straightforward and well-resolved mechanism of food capture toward the mouth, food transport mechanisms inside the buccopharyngeal cavity are not as simple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callan and Sanderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Divi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanderson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Meer et al., 2019</xref>) and are largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 2015</xref>). After passing through the mouth opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, blue arrows), water streamlines are generally assumed to diverge along with the widening buccopharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>, red arrows; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muller et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Provini and Van Wassenbergh, 2018</xref>). This implies that, inside the buccal cavity, waterflow tends to be directed toward the gill slits, located at the posteroventral and posterolateral head margins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Paradoxically, as these flows take a short route to the gill slits, they seem far from optimal to carry food to the entrance of the esophagus, along the midsagittal plane of the buccal cavity.</p><p>To date, there is no evidence that the esophagus expands in concert with buccopharyngeal suction generation to directly draw in a significant amount of water together with the food. Therefore, other structures need to be involved in separating food from the waterflows. Ideally, in bony fish, the food that is sucked into the mouth could be intercepted by the pharyngeal jaws located just anterior to the esophageal sphincter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The mobile pharyngeal jaws, while maintaining physical contact with the food, can move it to the esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liem, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibbing et al., 1986</xref>). However, given the current hypothesis of diverging streamlines in the expanding buccopharyngeal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>), food is more likely to end up being sieved by the other branchial arches and their gill rakers, after which a second food transport cycle is needed, encountering the same problem regarding how the food is able to reach the esophagus. Consequently, intraoral hydrodynamics are critical in determining the initial food deposit site after capture and, in turn, the associated anatomical adaptations and behaviors for food transport and handling inside the head.</p><p>Alternatively, two other intraoral flow patterns are theoretically possible, which may facilitate interception by the pharyngeal jaws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). Computational models of suction-feeding hydrodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Wassenbergh, 2015</xref>) show that flow can separate from the expanding buccopharynx to create a centralized jet of suction flow, along with anterior flow at the borders of the buccal cavity forming vortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This pattern, to which we will refer as a &quot;central jet&quot;, could carry food closer to the pharyngeal jaws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) compared to the classical hypothesis of &quot;diverging flow&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Thirdly, as hypothesized for fishes relying on filtration of smaller food particles from the water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanderson et al., 2001</xref>), gill arch and raker structures may cause crossflows, in which the main direction of flow medial to the branchial arches is directed toward the esophagus and only the permeate of the branchial filter basket flows out through the gill slits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>Despite this critical role during feeding in nearly all fishes, the spatiotemporal pattern of intraoral waterflow has still not been quantified in vivo due to the difficulty in gaining optical access to the buccopharyngeal cavity. This implies a fundamental gap in our knowledge regarding how more than half of all vertebrates feed. Here, we develop a new technique based on biplanar high-speed X-ray videography to simultaneously quantify the 3D path lines of both food and intraoral water, as well as skeletal kinematics. We apply this technique to two distantly related omnivorous suction feeders, carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) and tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>). These species were chosen from the large diversity of suction feeders because their adult head size is small enough to fit the imaging volume of the biplanar X-ray setup, yet large enough to avoid hindrance from an intake of tracer particles for waterflow inside the buccal cavity using X-rays. We use this data to describe the intraoral waterflow and determine the intraoral mechanisms of aquatic feeding that have remained hidden thus far.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intraoral kinematics of water tracers and food</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>The periodic bidirectional motion of water tracers</title><p>During each feeding sequence (carp: two individuals, seven trials; tilapia: two individuals, six trials), the water tracers moved alternatingly backward and forward, interspersed with phases of stasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). At the beginning of the sequence, for both species, we observed a relatively slow posterior motion of the water tracers toward the posterior part of the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). As the velocity of the water tracers is calculated in reference to the entrance of the esophagus, this low velocity corresponds to the approaching speed of the fish. It corresponds to 3.9 ± 2.5 cm/s in carp and 3.3 ± 1.3 cm/s in tilapia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Representative sequences of suction feeding for carp (<bold>a</bold>) and tilapia (<bold>b</bold>).</title><p>Water and food tracer 3D trajectories outside and inside the buccal cavity are represented by a semi-transparent model of a carp (<bold>a</bold>, left) and a tilapia (<bold>b</bold>, left) head.

Despite the inevitably low number of tracked particles (&lt;20) compared to common, light-optical techniques using dense suspensions of considerably smaller seeding particles (e.g., particle-tracking velocimetry), we managed to resolve the flow speeds and directions in the vicinity of the food. Compared to previously employed invasive techniques to quantify intraoral flows, such as endoscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callan and Sanderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith and Sanderson, 2008</xref>) or pressure recordings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Van Leeuwen and Muller, 1982</xref>), our noninvasive approach yields a more complete view of the spatial aspects of intraoral suction-feeding dynamics, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of different hydrodynamic mechanisms for food transport.</p><p>The new particle-tracking technique we described here (Figure 7a–d) can be easily combined with 3D motion reconstruction protocols for skeletal elements (i.e., X-ray reconstructions of the moving morphology [XROMM]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brainerd et al., 2010</xref>) to link waterflow patterns to skeletal kinematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The relatively straightforward, inexpensive, yet time-consuming protocol to construct the particles, as proposed in this study (Figure 7a–d), may be further optimized to reduce the variability in density (Figure 7d). That way, particles could be kept in suspension in the water column for longer periods and allow an accurate tracking for a wider range of waterflows, including those involving less strong pressure gradients than during suction feeding. Mold-based manufacturing protocols for metal-cored expanded polystyrene (EPS) spheres, currently available for relatively large particles with a diameter of 8 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drake et al., 2011</xref>), could perhaps be miniaturized. In any case, the method of X-ray particle tracking has strong potential to become an indispensable tool for studying form–function relationships and the biomechanics of various functions involving water motions to which we lack optical access.</p><p>The main question of our study was how food ends up at the esophagus entrance when the water that carries the food is traveling elsewhere – namely, to the outflow at the gill slits. If water was a pure &quot;carrier&quot; of the food, it would follow our water tracer’s trajectory from the entrance of the buccal cavity to end up in physical contact with the gill rakers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, both carp and tilapia appeared to be well capable of positioning the food close to the midsagittal streamlines, thereby avoiding the food from becoming laterally deviated and ending up adhering to the branchial basket. Despite the fact that only a small proportion of the water path lines passed close to the pharyngeal jaws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), direct interception of the food item by the pharyngeal jaw was common, which avoided the need for subsequent intraoral food-handling actions.</p><p>We hypothesize that fish make use of two mechanisms to cause the food to follow a midsagittal trajectory toward the esophagus: (1) developing a &quot;central jet&quot; flow pattern inside the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and (2) exploiting the food’s inertia and finite size. Our study found support for the first mechanism by showing a centrally concentrated flow with reverse flow developing near the borders of the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). This central jet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) was previously reported in computational modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Wassenbergh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), but was not given any attention thus far. It was thought to be an artifact of not having included a water outflow trough gill slits in 3D models of expanding heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>) or a potential artifact of the hydrodynamic simplification in models using steady flow conditions in nonexpanding heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Provini and Van Wassenbergh, 2018</xref>). However, the current experimental results show that similar central jet patterns can be present in vivo. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models indicate that a diverging flow pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> at 2.5 ms) gradually transitions into a central jet by narrowing in course of the suction event. Since a narrowing of the main suction stream will increase the chance of food interception close to the esophagus entrance by the pharyngeal jaws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>), this will enhance suction efficiency. Further research will be required to unravel why the central jet was more prominent in tilapia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) compared to carp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), which should be related to differences in mouth shape, buccal cavity shape, or expansion kinematics.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Results from previous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies of suction feeding in fish showing intraoral flow patterns.</title><p>Anterior-to-posterior velocities (color scale) and streamlines at the mid-frontal section planes are given, with the respective 3D models of the head in the bottom-left corners.

For the large prey that fill the bulk of the buccopharyngeal cavity, such inertial effects would be logical and intuitive. However, our data suggest that these mechanisms, in essence a type of filtration, are also present and effective for a relatively small pellet. A similar mechanism is hypothesized to underlie the process of crossflow filtration in filter feeders in the flows that pass close to the branchial arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanderson et al., 1991</xref>), but here we show that such an inertial separation mechanism is present at the full scale of the buccopharyngeal cavity. The effect of the size, shape, and density of food on its trajectory in a flow field, as shown in our work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), remains to be further quantified to fully understand the constraints of the observed filtration mechanism during the initial phase of food intake. Although flow patterns matching those of a branchial crossflow could not be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), the fish may not have employed this technique because the food type that was offered may not require it to be filtered in such a way.</p><p>As shown in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Olsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sibbing, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibbing et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Meer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weller et al., 2020</xref>), the feeding process is far from finished after the initial capture in the buccopharyngeal cavity, especially in omnivorous species that perform food sorting and processing. We observed regular and periodical back-and-forth motions of the water tracers after this intake, which moved the food back and forth inside the buccal cavity, with the food finally ending up near the entrance of the esophagus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Rfs, directed toward the anterior part of the buccal cavity and previously referred as ‘back-wash’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibbing et al., 1986</xref>), were previously observed in carp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Callan and Sanderson, 2003</xref>) and tilapia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith and Sanderson, 2008</xref>). In carp, anterior movement of the food has been observed using X-ray videos, after which a muscular structure packed with taste buds – the palatal organ – is hypothesized to locally bulge to clamp onto edible particles between the pharyngeal roof and floor, while small waste particles are flushed through the branchial slits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sibbing, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibbing et al., 1986</xref>). The anteromedial direction of the flows observed in this study during the rf phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) seems ideal to bring food particles from both the gill rakers and from the pharyngeal region toward the palatal organ. Overall, these back-and-forth flows are clearly important in the process of sorting food items from the nonedible particles present in the ingested water, and they potentially also prevent the gill slits from clogging. Rfs most likely involve the gill slit functioning as a flow inlet, a function that has rarely been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Wassenbergh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our data provide the first empirical evidence of bidirectional waterflows being synchronized with motions of the upper and lower jaws, hyoid, and opercula to create anterior-to-posterior waves during bfs and posterior-to-anterior waves during rfs. The anterior-to-posterior wave of head expansion and compression is already well known in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibb and Ferry-Graham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lauder, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muller and Osse, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Wassenbergh et al., 2016</xref>). This is interpreted as a mechanism to both ingest and dynamically accommodate a volume of water as it moves anteroposteriorly through the buccal cavity. For both species studied, this classical anterior-to-posterior wave was also observed during the consecutive periodic bf motions. Yet, the associated waterflow was not purely anterior-to-posteriorly directed: the water was also guided toward the ventral part of the buccal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) by the hyoid depression, and it deviated toward the gill covers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) via the abduction of the opercula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). During the backward motions of the water, we never observed any particles entering the digestive tract, thus consolidating our hypothesis that no water enters inside the esophagus. A wave in the opposite direction was synchronized with the rfs, as hypothesized earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sibbing et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Wassenbergh et al., 2016</xref>). The stereotypical bf and rf alternations eventually lead the food to the centerline of the buccal cavity and closer to the pharyngeal jaws, where it will be actively transported toward the digestive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sibbing, 1982</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights the biomechanical complexity of the processes occurring inside the mouth cavity during aquatic feeding in fishes. We showed how high-velocity suction flow patterns during the initial food intake phase can have an effect on the food’s initial deposit site, and how centralized suction streams may help to direct food toward the esophagus. The omnivorous species studied here during benthic feeding followed this phase by repeated, hydrodynamically driven repositionings as part of their food sorting and tasting abilities. Future research using our X-ray particle-tracking technique could further reveal how these processes, and their intraoral hydrodynamic patterns, may vary between feeding modes (e.g., ram-feeders ingesting larger volumes of water), between animals with varying head morphology and size, etc. Such studies would further advance our currently limited insight into the optically invisible processes of aquatic feeding in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and surgical procedures</title><p>Two carp (<italic>C. carpio</italic>), carp 01 (mass = 341 g, total length = 25.94 cm) and carp 02 (mass = 304.5 g, total length = 20.42 cm), purchased from a pond shop (De Hof-Leverancier, Ekeren, Belgium), and two Nile tilapia (<italic>O. niloticus</italic>), tilapia 01 (mass = 488.4 g, total length = 29.4 cm) and tilapia 02 (mass = 489.0 g, total length = 30.3 cm), from a farm (Til-Aqua, Someren, The Netherlands), were housed in two large water tanks at the University of Antwerp and provided with food ad libitum.</p><p>We reduced the number of experimental animals to a minimum for ethical considerations.

An easy-to-execute and cost-efficient procedure was developed to make spherical waterflow tracers of minimal size to be used with biplanar high-speed X-ray video setups. Like the existing tracer designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Drake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seeger et al., 2001</xref>), we surrounded a radio-opaque metal with a closed-cell foam. The foam compensates for the inevitably high weight of the metal so that the overall density of the tracer particle approximates the density of water.</p><p>EPS foam spheres with diameters between 1 and 2 mm were purchased (Rovul, Middelstum, The Netherlands) and sieved to retain only those with a diameter of 1.4 mm. To do so, the foam spheres that were loosely stuck in between the mesh holes of a precision test sieve were extracted. Next, 0.4-mm-diameter brass rods (Albion Alloys, Bournemouth, UK) were cut into approximately 0.1 m pieces in length, and their tips were sharpened by holding the rod at a sharp angle against a grinding stone rotating on a Proxxon MF70 micro-milling machine (Proxxon GmbH, Föhren, Germany). Next, the sharp tips were dipped in petroleum jelly to reduce friction. A foam sphere was then gently immobilized between two fingertips while being pierced (as close as possible through its center) by the sharp tip, which was gently rotated by the fingertips of the other hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The one-by-one pierced EPS spheres were slid to the back of the rod. Finally, when the rod was filled with a chain of foam spheres, each sphere was clipped close to the foam sphere edges using side-cutting pliers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Tracer fabrication for X-ray particle tracking and the experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Construction of the flow tracer particles by piercing 1.4-mm-diameter expanded polystyrene (EPS) spheres on a 0.4-mm-diameter, Vaseline-coated brass rod with a sharpened tip.

A simple model of suction into a cylindrical cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>), with a cavity size (length 40 mm, radius 10 mm) and suction pressure magnitude (sinusoidal profile reaching - 2 kPa after 20 ms) that are realistic for adult fishes, was used in laboratory studies. These simulations were performed in software Ansys 2019 R1 (Ansys Inc, Canonsburg, USA) using the CFD solver Ansys Fluent. The cylindrical mouth cavity was extruded out of a hemispherical &quot;head&quot;, which, in turn, together with a 0.7 mm radius sphere were subtracted from a large hemisphere with 0.6 m radius in Ansys DesignModeler. The resulting volume, that is, the flow domain, was meshed with about 2 million tetrahedral cells (mesh edge size of 0.3 mm at the cylinder; growth rate of 1.1) using Ansys Meshing. A simulation with a less-refined mesh of about 1 million tetrahedra (mesh edge size 0.5 mm) showing nearly identical flow patterns confirmed that the 2 million cell mesh was fine enough. In Ansys Fluent, gravity was enabled (9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) in a transient, laminar flow model using the 6 DOF dynamic mesh functionality to update the position of the spherical particle to the next time step (800 time steps of 0.125 ms solved with 40 iterations per time step). The inertial properties of spheres filled with uniformly dens material, as well as the hydrostatic lift force, were provided by user-defined functions. A second user-defined function set the profile of the pressure drop at the interior base plane of the cylinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). The dynamic mesh updating involved both smoothing (spring constant factor 0; Laplace node relaxation factor 0.5) and local cell remeshing at each time step. The default mathematical solver settings for Fluent were used. We ran simulations for a case without a flow-tracing sphere, for two simulations with a sphere with the same density as water (998 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) at two initial positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), and similarly for spheres with densities of 1100 and 1200 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Numerical modeling assessment of tracking performance of suction-feeding waterflows.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cylindrical mouth cavity inside a hemispherical head generating suction trough a transient pressure-outlet-type boundary condition assigned to the back of the cylinder.

Using new artificial food particles that are radio-opaque and naturally buoyant, Provini et al. imaged the roller-coaster ride that food particles make being sucked in from outside to inside the fish using 3D stereo high-speed fluoroscopy. The recordings show fishes to have an intriguing ability to generate flows that center the food particles as they enter the muscular tube that carries them from the mouth to the stomach. Remarkably, the flow patterns in the mouth that accomplish this seem to differ between the two species of fish studied, although samples sizes are very small at present and results should be interpreted cautiously. These new insights will be of interest to biologists working on suction-feeding mechanisms ranging from millimeter-sized carnivorous water plants, tadpoles, and fish larvae, to large fish and marine mammals, and even gigantic whales. Bioinspired engineers designing rapid underwater suction apparatuses may benefit from harnessing the new insights to elegantly center items of interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73621.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lentink</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012p63287</institution-id><institution>University of Groningen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Lentink</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012p63287</institution-id><institution>University of Groningen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.17.460802">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.17.460802v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including David Lentink as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission. Please carefully address the comments and suggestions, mark all changes in the revised manuscript in coloured font, and provide a point-by-point response. This will help the Reviewing Editor evaluate your revision. Please add line numbers in case another round of review is required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the editors and reviewers all greatly appreciate the method used, the experiments performed, and the data visualization presented. This has persuaded us to give the authors the opportunity to resolve several weaknesses in a revised manuscript.</p><p>– High-level feedback based on editorial discussion</p><p>While this work on fish suction feeding is impressive and informative, it is currently too narrowly focused for a broad interest journal like <italic>eLife</italic>. Hence, we believe the manuscript would be much improved if it succinctly addressed the following points.</p><p>(1) A broader introduction on suction feeding in its ecological and evolutionary context is needed, covering a wider range of suction feeding studies, from tadpoles, fish larvae and microscopic carnivorous waterplant suction feeding apparatuses up to those of the largest marine vertebrates (e.g., whales). The point needs to be made more compellingly that, while suction feeding has been studied across scales externally to the degree possible, the internal fluid mechanics remain poorly understood at any of those scales due to the experimental challenges of imaging flow at high-speed internally. This requires a paragraph in the Introduction, to enable the general reader to understand why this research matters and what challenge was solved for which reason; especially, if the evolutionary context of &quot;why suction feeding matters&quot; is given in the broadest sense. For this the following review article may be helpful: Deban, Stephen M., Roi Holzman, and Ulrike K. Müller. &quot;Suction feeding by small organisms: performance limits in larval vertebrates and carnivorous plants.&quot; Integrative and Comparative Biology 60.4 (2020): 852-863.</p><p>(2) With this broader background in place, the authors have a solid jump-off point at the end of the Introduction (before they describe the methods used) to introduce the model species selected. This is likely based on factors such as their size matching the optimal bi-planar (stereo) fluoroscopy setup imaging volume.</p><p>(3) The text about the potential impact of the method itself in the last paragraph of the Discussion can stay (although its readability should be improved), but it isn't an effective closing paragraph for a broad audience. In the Discussion, it would be good to conclude with a paragraph with a broader perspective, one that connects to the introductory biological context added under (1). Currently the last paragraph is very dense and technical, written for a specialist audience. To better serve the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, it would help to translate the biological implications to movement ecology or evolutionary biology or any other biological domains the authors believe will benefit from the new scientific insights. This section does not need to be speculative; it can be strongly connected to the actual findings, for example, on how they could inform other studies in which suction feeding is a key factor. For example, an effective broader impact closeout could include discussion of any scaling laws derived or confirmed based on the research, helping explain how these findings could advance our understanding of suction feeding across a wider range of species. Or, it could be a very specific and focused paragraph on the mechanism for the species tested written in a fashion that makes it more broadly accessible, with associated clear schematics connecting internal and external perspectives: a helicopter perspective completing our understanding of suction feeding (one that could go into a biology textbook). In conclusion, we encourage the authors to write a closing paragraph that is scientifically rigorous while serving a broader audience beyond the small suction feeding community. Some minor speculation is acceptable if the wording communicates this.</p><p>– Actionable feedback summary from the peer review outcomes</p><p>(4) Please clarify the number of species, individuals and trials for which data have been processed and integrated in the figure captions, Methods, Results and Discussion. The number of individuals per species (n = 2) is very small and this has been brought up as a concern. Another concern is that the number of individuals and trials analyzed seems to be variable throughout the manuscript, depending on the particular analyses made. To address this, we would like to see all data processed for all individuals and species reported in the manuscript. In the Methods, the rationale for using just 2 individuals, as compared to the more typical 3-4 as a minimum, is missing. In the Discussion, a few sentences should clarify how the low number of individuals may limit the interpretation and generalisability of the data. Given the total number of individuals across both species is 4, the overall conclusions supported across both species and both individuals are considered strongest. Finally, please keep in mind that the calculation of a biologically meaningful average and standard deviation representative for a species requires a minimum of three individuals. The major limitations remain (after processing all trials for all individuals across the two species to resolve the minor limitations) and impact the ability to conduct statistical analyses, inferences and conclusions that are biologically meaningful. Yet, this context is not sufficiently integrated in the presentation of the experimental design and discussion of the results.</p><p>(5) The tracking of particles into the mouth should provide qualitative data that can highlight the hydrodynamics of the flows, but the speed of intra-oral flows is not fully examined. The manuscript is missing a quantitative estimate of the volume of water that passes near the esophagus, and of the kinematics of bone movements and how they correspond to fluid flows. Therefore, we would like to see quantitative mapping of the relationship between the distance from the mouth at the beginning of the strike to where the particle ends, and other quantitative measures. The authors also mention efficiency but make no attempt to quantify it. For the reviewers, it is the quantitative insight into these and other suction feeding parameters that has the potential to make this article particularly impactful.</p><p>(6) The beautifully illustrated tracks are a strength of the manuscript, but also mask some mechanistic details we would like to see dissected. The tracks in the current plot format confound space and time, meaning that the particles potentially started at different distances under different angles from the mouth and may have also started to move substantially at different times. We therefore believe additional figures are needed to quantitatively analyze this. Quantification will also enable the authors to make statements such as &quot;food items that are initially somewhere close to the mouth…&quot; as specific as possible based on the dataset.</p><p>(7) We are curious if the suction effort of the fish may have varied across the trials (videos). Such variation has been shown to be primal in determining the speed of the external flows, hence we believe it is worthy of inclusion in the analyses.</p><p>(8) The manuscript somewhat oversells the study's novelty; please try to better delineate the contribution. (i) Briefly clarify the exact contribution of the new method in the context of existing literature; what existed and has been done, which aspects are added / new etc. For example, the water markers seem to represent a modified design of previously reported particle and food item tracking approaches. Neither the XROMM technique nor particle tracking nor neutrally buoyant particle tracking are entirely new; for example, tracking marked prey items (with radio opaque markers) into the mouth and esophagus using XROMM has been done previously. Both particle tracking and particle image correlation are established for a wide range of applications. XROMM is also established for 3D imaging and tracking in the body. The new advances should be presented in the context of the relevant experimental literature. (ii) Discuss previous CFD studies more extensively, and how the limitations of those studies precluded the insights achieved by the present study. Considering these internal flows were modeled extensively by the authors (others), there is a model and theoretical framework that predicts how the internal flow behaves. This rich CFD and literature context is missing in the presentation of Figure 1, the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>(9) Please discuss the tracking particle physical properties consistently and correctly: there is confusion about the particles being neutrally buoyant versus (page 16) negatively buoyant; this should be clarified throughout. The PIV literature provides a useful tracking error framework for relating the effect of particle size and density ratio to the ability of particles to track the flow. These established error analyses should be integrated into the Methods section in which the method is outlined. This should include estimated limitations due to particle size and buoyancy imperfections limiting the ability of the particles to trace out the flow pattern of interest. With this context the reader can fully comprehend the significant advance the current study achieves, within the acceptable limitations given the challenges involved in this tracking approach. The technical discussion paragraph could comment on how future tracing particles could/should be improved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73621.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the editors and reviewers all greatly appreciate the method used, the experiments performed, and the data visualization presented.

As quantifying individual variability would require a higher number of individuals per species it was not a goal of our study, therefore intraspecific variation is not covered sufficiently by our analysis to allow generalizations within each species. Additionally, the limited number of species studied do not allow us to generalize our findings to other adult, omnivorous, teleost fish. Even if the number of analyzed individuals was limited to two per species, which may limit the interpretation of the data in the context of the STRANGE framework, the total number of individuals across both species (4 individuals), the number of trials (carp: 7 trials, tilapia: 6 trials), and the consistency of the results, imply that the mainly qualitative conclusions on overall patterns in water flow and skeletal motion are well supported.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, please keep in mind that the calculation of a biologically meaningful average and standard deviation representative for a species requires a minimum of three individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>We pooled the data from the two individuals of each species, but standard deviations are “among trials within species” and not “among individuals”.

Yet, this context is not sufficiently integrated in the presentation of the experimental design and discussion of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence in the Material and Methods to highlight the small number of individuals per species and the potential limitations it can cause in terms of generalizability of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The tracking of particles into the mouth should provide qualitative data that can highlight the hydrodynamics of the flows, but the speed of intra-oral flows is not fully examined. The manuscript is missing a quantitative estimate of the volume of water that passes near the esophagus, and of the kinematics of bone movements and how they correspond to fluid flows.</p></disp-quote><p>To quantify the volume of engulfed water that passes by the pharyngeal jaws, unfortunately, we would need more particles distributed over a larger volume in front of the mouth. Currently, the particles are distributed over a circular area surrounding the food at the bottom of the aquarium. This does not allow a quantification of the full water volume entering the mouth, and therefore also not the volume of water passing near the oesophagus. Future studies may further optimise our protocol to get a more complete view of what happens intra-orally with the entire water parcel entering the mouth. This will, however, require X-ray-visible particles that are in suspension for a long time, which would be technically very challenging to build.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, we would like to see quantitative mapping of the relationship between the distance from the mouth at the beginning of the strike to where the particle ends, and other quantitative measures. The authors also mention efficiency but make no attempt to quantify it. For the reviewers, it is the quantitative insight into these and other suction feeding parameters that has the potential to make this article particularly impactful.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a figure in the supplementary material (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2), showing the tracer trajectories, coloured according to their initial position. Generally, the particles tend to stay on the same side as their initial location, but there can be a change of side before the particles arrive close to the oesophagus. A Kendall test of correlation revealed a significant correlation in carp but not in tilapia (carp: p-value = 0.000287; tilapia: p-value = 0.07952).</p><p>As we did not find a solution to clearly define a metric of efficiency for suction feeding that can be quantified with our data, we no longer mention it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The beautifully illustrated tracks are a strength of the manuscript, but also mask some mechanistic details we would like to see dissected. The tracks in the current plot format confound space and time, meaning that the particles potentially started at different distances under different angles from the mouth and may have also started to move substantially at different times. We therefore believe additional figures are needed to quantitatively analyze this. Quantification will also enable the authors to make statements such as &quot;food items that are initially somewhere close to the mouth…&quot; as specific as possible based on the dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, as the number of particles, their initial location relative to the individual, and the fish behaviour (angle, velocity, etc.) and anatomy (size, shape of the buccal cavity) differed between trials and individuals, we chose to use a representation of the data using space instead of time, as a standardization technique.</p><p>We added a Figure showing the particle distribution for each trial of each individual, based on the moment they start to move toward the buccal cavity (Figure 4 – supplement figure 1). We found no correlation between the moment of ingestion and the distribution of the tracers in the buccal cavity. However, visually, it seems that early-sucked particles tend to stay in the medial plane of the buccal cavity, participating to the central jet, whereas the late ones tend to end up on the lateral parts of the buccal cavity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) We are curious if the suction effort of the fish may have varied across the trials (videos). Such variation has been shown to be primal in determining the speed of the external flows, hence we believe it is worthy of inclusion in the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering our effort to standardize the set-up (food type, position, number of tracers, etc.) our goal was to minimize the variation between individuals and trials. Therefore, it would not be relevant to quantify the variability in term of suction effort in the context of this study. We agree, however, that further studies using the same methods should try to quantify this.</p><p>Note that since we are aware that flow velocities are depending on suction effort, which depends on the type of food that is offered, we focus on the spatial patterns in the flow in the light of the hypothesis that were put forward in Figure 1, and not on the velocity magnitudes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The manuscript somewhat oversells the study's novelty; please try to better delineate the contribution. (i) Briefly clarify the exact contribution of the new method in the context of existing literature; what existed and has been done, which aspects are added / new etc. For example, the water markers seem to represent a modified design of previously reported particle and food item tracking approaches. Neither the XROMM technique nor particle tracking nor neutrally buoyant particle tracking are entirely new; for example, tracking marked prey items (with radio opaque markers) into the mouth and esophagus using XROMM has been done previously. Both particle tracking and particle image correlation are established for a wide range of applications. XROMM is also established for 3D imaging and tracking in the body. The new advances should be presented in the context of the relevant experimental literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this was confusing in the original version of the manuscript, especially in the sentence from the introduction. We rewrote it to:</p><p>“Here, we develop a new technique based on biplanar high-speed X-ray videography to quantify the 3D pathlines of intraoral water and combine it with existing methods to track food and quantify 3D skeletal motions.”</p><p>This should clearly separate the new contribution from the existing methods and make it clear that we see the tracking of water as a separate method in addition to the tracking of food. The latter has indeed been done previously in many 2D x-ray studies, and in more recent 3D biplanar X-ray studies. The revised paragraph in the discussion now reverts back to the x-ray particle tracking protocols that have been used in industrial settings (reference Drake et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Discuss previous CFD studies more extensively, and how the limitations of those studies precluded the insights achieved by the present study. Considering these internal flows were modelled extensively by the authors (others), there is a model and theoretical framework that predicts how the internal flow behaves. This rich CFD and literature context is missing in the presentation of Figure 1, the Introduction and Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a paragraph in the Discussion, a new figure (Figure 6), and a supplementary video (Figure 6 – video 1) summarizing the results from previous CFD studies as requested. Note, however, that to our knowledge, 3D CFD models including an outflow of water through the gill slits do not exist currently. Consequently, to study patterns of intra-oral flow, the CFD literature is not rich. We included results from the currently most advanced, dynamically expanding 3D model of the head of a sunperch from Thompson et al., 2018 in Figure 6a. We clearly noted the limitations of this work (i.e., assumption of no outflow through gill slits). In Figure 6b, the non-expanding model from Provini and Van Wassenbergh 2018 is presented. Both CFD studies are discussed in the light of the current experimental results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Please discuss the tracking particle physical properties consistently and correctly: there is confusion about the particles being neutrally buoyant versus (page 16) negatively buoyant; this should be clarified throughout. The PIV literature provides a useful tracking error framework for relating the effect of particle size and density ratio to the ability of particles to track the flow. These established error analyses should be integrated into the Methods section in which the method is outlined. This should include estimated limitations due to particle size and buoyancy imperfections limiting the ability of the particles to trace out the flow pattern of interest. With this context the reader can fully comprehend the significant advance the current study achieves, within the acceptable limitations given the challenges involved in this tracking approach. The technical discussion paragraph could comment on how future tracing particles could/should be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We maintain our statement concerning the negatively buoyant particles, in the Material and Methods section of the previous version of the manuscript. We measured the density of 19 particles (figure 7d), but the particles we used in the experiment were the ones that could remain at the bottom of the water tank, waiting for the fish to swallow them. By definition they were negatively buoyant.</p><p>We had previously evaluated the effect of size and density on tracking performance of our particles using CFD but have now worked this out in detail and added this CFD analysis to the manuscript. The results are presented in a new Figure (Figure 8), which is further illustrated by a video (Figure 8 – video 1). It serves to quantify the limitations due to particle size and buoyancy imperfection.</p><p>The CFD results reassure that the finite size (1.4 mm diameter) and density (up to about 1050 kg m-3) of the current sample of particles (Figure 7) does not hinder a realistic assessment of the suction flows by fish. A small deviation of the path in the direction of gravity can be expected (Figure 8b), but this should be smaller than 1 mm even for the heaviest particles of 1050 kg m-3. Lag during flow acceleration and overshoot during deceleration for the slightly negatively buoyant particles was relatively small (Figure 8c) and therefore acceptable to describe general patterns of flow during suction feeding.</p><p>As suggested, we added a discussion on how to improve future tracer particles in terms of achieving less variability in density. Miniaturising the manufacturing protocol by Drake et al., 2011 has this potential, in theory.</p></body></sub-article></article>
