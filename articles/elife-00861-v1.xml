A few genes are transcribed before this stage but how this differential activation is accomplished is still an open question. We have performed ChIP-seq experiments on tightly staged <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and show that massive recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) with widespread pausing occurs de novo during the midblastula transition. However, ∼100 genes are strongly occupied by Pol II before this timepoint and most of them do not show Pol II pausing, consistent with a requirement for rapid transcription during the fast nuclear cycles. This global change in Pol II pausing correlates with distinct core promoter elements and associates a TATA-enriched promoter with the rapid early transcription. This suggests that promoters are differentially used during the zygotic genome activation, presumably because they have distinct dynamic properties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00861.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00861.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00861.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fertilized eggs—zygotes—develop into embryos via several distinct stages. In many animals, the zygote initially undergoes rapid rounds of genome replication; however, this hectic activity is not controlled by the zygote itself. Instead, the mother deposits RNA molecules in the egg as it forms inside her, and after the egg has been fertilized, these RNA molecules are translated into proteins that guide the development of the early embryo. Only at a stage called midblastula transition does the zygote take over control by transcribing its own RNA molecules.</p><p>Fruit flies start to transcribe their own genes en masse after completing thirteen rounds of DNA replication. However, some genes are already transcribed during the rapid cycles of DNA replication earlier in development. How these early genes are transcribed, and how the embryo shifts to more widespread transcription during the midblastula transition, are not well understood. In particular, it is not known if the molecular machinery needed to transcribe the genes is recruited a long time before transcription starts, or if it is recruited ‘just in time’. Here, Chen et al. explore how genes are switched on in the fruit fly zygote.</p><p>Genes are transcribed by a protein complex called RNA polymerase, which binds to DNA sequences, called promoters, within the genes. Chen et al. used a technique called ChIP-Seq to determine how much RNA polymerase was bound to the DNA before, during and after the midblastula transition. Before the transition—from about eight rounds of DNA replication onward—RNA polymerase was bound to only about 100 genes, and was active in most of these cases. In contrast, after the transition, RNA polymerase had been recruited to the promoters of around 4000 genes (fruit flies have a total of about 14,000 genes). However, it was often found in a paused, rather than active, form, at these genes, which is thought to help ensure that their transcription can occur on a precise schedule.</p><p>Chen et al. then used computer analyses to test the theory that differences in the DNA sequences of the gene promoters might determine which genes the RNA polymerase bound to, and whether or not the polymerase underwent pausing or became active immediately. Strikingly, there were clear differences in the sequence motifs that recruited RNA polymerase to the promoters of genes that were transcribed immediately and those that showed pausing of the polymerase. Moreover, genes that were transcribed before the midblastula transition were shorter, on average, than those transcribed after. This suggests that transcription during the rapid genome replication cycles has to occur quickly and therefore lacks pausing. Together, these findings present a biological rationale for differences in how genes are first transcribed during fruit fly development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00861.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00861.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>ChIP-seq</kwd><kwd>promoters</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>zygotic genome activation</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase pausing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health New Innovator Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2 OD004561-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeitlinger</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pew Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeitlinger</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first zygotic genes are transcribed without RNA polymerase II pausing from a TATA-enriched promoter.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of a fertilized egg is initially under the control of maternal products and then becomes under zygotic control when transcription begins. In animals such as <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, development begins with rapid, synchronous cell divisions without gap phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamb and Laird, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). During the midblastula transition (MBT), cells switch to prolonged asynchronous divisions and this coincides with a massive increase in zygotic transcription. Before the MBT, only a small set of ‘pre-MBT genes’ are expressed. How this differential transcription is set up globally during these early stages of development, including the role of histone modifications and the recruitment of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), has been the subject of considerable interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>).

However, both TATA-box binding protein (TBP), the key subunit of TFIID, which binds to the promoter prior to Pol II recruitment, as well as Serine 5-phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of Pol II (Ser5-P Pol II), which marks transcriptional initiation, can only be first detected during nuclear cycles 8–12, when significant transcription of pre-MBT genes occurs. This was the first indication that Pol II is recruited to promoters de novo during the zygotic genome activation.</p><p>We next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) to analyze the occupancy of Pol II, TBP and histone modifications in pre-MBT embryos (nuclear cycles 8–12), MBT embryos (nuclear cycles 13–14), as well as post-MBT embryos as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Genes in the first group (‘pre-MBT not-paused’, n = 77) have highest expression during cellularization (nuclear cycle 14) and tend to diminish in expression thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These genes appear never to become paused during early development (see <italic>SNCF</italic> and the average profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Genes in the second group (‘pre-MBT dual’, n = 30) initially show little evidence of pausing; however, higher levels of Pol II gradually accumulate at the pause site during and after the MBT (see <italic>ac</italic> and the average profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, there is a small group of genes (‘pre-MBT paused’, n = 10) that appear to have Pol II that is paused or non-productive even at the pre-MBT stages (see <italic>sim</italic> and the average profile in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with the expression of these genes; their transcript levels rise much later during pre-MBT stages as compared to the first two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that Pol II pausing exists during pre-MBT stages but that most genes are non-paused.</p><p>As a control, we analyzed Pol II pausing at genes that are newly occupied by Pol II during the MBT (‘MBT genes’, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.52325/supplemental_file_1.xlsx">Supplementary file hosted by Dryad</ext-link> [7.6 Mb]).

Thus, many genes become newly paused during the MBT and are poised for later activation.</p><p>The significant difference seen in Pol II pausing between pre-MBT and MBT genes is likely to be biologically meaningful. Genes expressed before the MBT have to be transcribed particularly fast because the nuclear cycle is extremely short (8 min in nuclear cycle 10, increasing to 13 min in nuclear cycle 12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foe et al., 1993</xref>]) and progression through mitosis causes abortion of nascent transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rothe et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shermoen and O’Farrell, 1991</xref>). As previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>), we also found that the pre-MBT genes are particularly short (median of 1228 bp vs 6024 bp, Mann–Whitney test p&lt;10<sup>−20</sup>) and more often intronless (54.6% vs 9.2%, Fisher test p&lt;10<sup>−23</sup>) compared to MBT-zygotic genes. We also noticed that pre-MBT genes frequently use the transcription start site that yields the shortest transcript (62.9% vs 30.6%, Fisher test p&lt;0.0003) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, and examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). This supports the idea that rapid transcription is important during the fast cleavage cycles before the MBT and makes it plausible that the lack of Pol II pausing is advantageous for pre-MBT transcription.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00861.011</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>Size and intron difference between pre-MBT and MBT zygotic genes</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00861.011">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00861.011</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">Transcript size</th><th colspan="2">Shortest transcript usage</th><th colspan="2">Intron content</th></tr><tr><th>Gene group</th><th>Gene count</th><th>Median width (bp)</th><th>Genes with multiple TSS</th><th>Genes using shortest transcript (%)</th><th>Gene count (protein-coding)</th><th>Genes with no introns (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>All pre-MBT</td><td>117</td><td>1228<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></td><td>35</td><td>22 (62.9%)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></td><td>97</td><td>53 (54.6%)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">‡</xref></td></tr><tr><td>MBT maternal</td><td>3163</td><td>3322</td><td>1125</td><td>308 (27.4%)</td><td>3163</td><td>228 (7.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>MBT zygotic</td><td>844</td><td>6042</td><td>284</td><td>87 (30.6%)</td><td>736</td><td>68 (9.2%)</td></tr><tr><td> active</td><td>251</td><td>5422</td><td>191</td><td>50 (26.2%)</td><td>251</td><td>35 (13.9%)</td></tr><tr><td> poised</td><td>593</td><td>6771</td><td>93</td><td>37 (39.8%)</td><td>485</td><td>33 (6.8%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>Mann–Whitney test for pre-MBT vs MBT zygotic transcript size: p&lt;10<sup>−20</sup>.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>†</label><p>Fisher test for pre-MBT vs MBT zygotic: p&lt;0.0003.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><label>‡</label><p>Fisher test for pre-MBT vs MBT zygotic: p&lt;10<sup>−23</sup>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Absence of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 before transcription</title><p>We next explored potential mechanisms that could explain the difference between pre-MBT and MBT genes.

H3K27me3, a marker of Polycomb-mediated gene silencing and possibly epigenetic memory, can be detected in nuclei and in polar bodies at the earliest cleavage stages but is then undetectable in somatic nuclei until after the MBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Consistent with this, the ChIP-seq H3k27me3 signal at Polycomb response elements (PREs) increases over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Interestingly, only pre-MBT genes that initially show the non-paused profile (pre-MBT not-paused, pre-MBT dual) are significantly enriched for Inr and TATA. Furthermore, only pre-MBT genes that are paused at some point (pre-MBT dual, pre-MBT paused) show enrichment for GAGA, Inr and PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, the presence of specific core promoter elements correlates well with the Pol II occupancy profile across the gene body.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the transcription factor Zelda and its binding motif (known as the TAGteam motif) regulates the onset of zygotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Renzis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">ten Bosch et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, the binding levels of Zelda in the promoter region correlate well with the onset of gene expression, although Zelda is also abundantly found at enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harrison et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that Zelda motifs are highly enriched in the promoter region of pre-MBT genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, this enrichment is found in all three pre-MBT classes and does not correlate with the Pol II pausing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>To further consolidate the differences between pre-MBT and MBT genes, we performed de novo motif analysis with MEME on the 200 bp centered on the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). For pre-MBT stage non-paused genes (pre-MBT not-paused, pre-MBT dual), the top two motifs were Zelda and TATA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, the top two known motifs for the most comparable MBT group (MBT active genes, which are also early-expressed developmental genes), were GAGA and a motif that resembles DPE, MTE and PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This confirms that pre-MBT and MBT genes differ in their core promoter sequences.</p><p>Finally, an analysis of the co-occurrences of core promoter elements similar to previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>) also supports our finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, Zelda, Inr and TATA significantly co-occur among all our Pol II-bound genes (pre-MBT and MBT genes) but not among all annotated genes, suggesting that these motifs preferentially function together during early development.</p><p>This suggests a model in which rapid pre-MBT transcription without Pol II pausing is mediated by Zelda bound close to a TATA-enriched promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, paused Pol II is typically established through GAF during the MBT at promoters with pausing elements such as DPE, MTE or PB. Thus, there are two principle modes by which zygotic genes are activated but genes may also have elements of both and show a dual behavior.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00861.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the two main modes of Pol II recruitment and elongation behavior during the zygotic genome activation.</title><p>Before the midblastula transition, when the cell cycle is fast, efficient transcription occurs through a TATA promoter with multiple Zelda sites upstream. This combination leads to transcription without pausing, presumably due to fast re-initiation. During the midblastula transition, Pol II is recruited de novo to many genes and pausing is established with the help of GAGA factor and core promoter elements associated with pausing such as DPE, MTE and PB. Note that genes can have core promoter elements of both modes (e.g., TATA and PB), leading them to switch from a non-pausing behavior to a pausing behavior during the midblastula transition. It is likely that transcription factors in addition to Zelda and GAF also influence the Pol II behavior at genes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00861.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00861.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00861-fig6-v1"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest that a large number of genes first recruit Pol II during the MBT with widespread Pol II pausing, while the small number of genes transcribed before that are not paused. Presumably, these pre-MBT genes are required for very early developmental events such as sex determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erickson and Cline, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbash and Cline, 1995</xref>) or cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schejter and Wieschaus, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>), or may be involved in early patterning events that require feedback regulation over time (for example <italic>ftz</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edgar et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</xref>] or <italic>sna</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Renzis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reeves et al., 2012</xref>]). Thus, while Pol II pausing is commonly found at developmental genes and may be advantageous for their precise and synchronous expression in response to localized extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boettiger and Levine, 2009</xref>), a different mode of transcription is used during pre-MBT stages. Due to the short nuclear cycles at this stage, it is likely that transcription is optimized to achieve high levels of transcripts in a very short time period.</p><p>The fact that we find the TATA box enriched among pre-MBT genes is consistent with the known properties of TATA-containing promoters. TATA is a strong core promoter element that efficiently supports transcription in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 1994</xref>), mediates efficient re-initiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yean and Gralla, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">1999</xref>), and its presence in vivo correlates with ‘bursts’ of transcription that produce many transcripts within a short time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that TATA promotes pTEFb activity, leading to more efficient elongation rates in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amir-Zilberstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montanuy et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>This suggests that TATA-enriched promoters and paused promoters have different transcription dynamics and serve different purposes during development. While this difference is particularly evident during the zygotic genome activation as reported here, we propose that this difference is general and also applies to later development. For example, we have analyzed promoters during muscle development and find that many genes are induced during late stages of embryogenesis without prior Pol II pausing and that these genes are also enriched in TATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaertner et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, statistical analyses suggest that the combination of Inr and TATA represents a separate class of promoters that is often found among genes expressed in adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenhard et al., 2012</xref>).

To calculate a p-value for the observed frequency of each promoter element in each group of transcripts, a Fisher test was performed. Enrichments and depletions with a p&lt;0.05 (after correcting for multiple testing with the Benjamini and Hochberg method) were deemed significant.</p><p>For Zelda, we calculated enrichment and p-values via random sampling. Enrichment values for each group of transcripts were calculated by dividing the number of Zelda sites per transcript in each group by the average number of Zelda sites per transcript in the genome. To calculate p-values for each group of transcripts, we randomly selected an equal number of transcripts from the entire genome 10,000 times and calculated the enrichment value for each random sample. The p-value was then calculated as the portion of random samples with higher Zelda enrichment than the transcript group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Promoter element co-occurrence analysis</title><p>The enrichments (Observed/Expected) and p-values (Fisher test) for the co-occurrence of promoter elements were calculated for all pairs of core promoter elements in three sets of genes.

For the ‘all promoters’ set, we included all unique promoters in FlyBase r5.47 as well as our additional ten custom transcripts. For the ‘pre-MBT and MBT’ set, we included only the promoters of our pre-MBT and MBT gene groups. The order of motifs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> was determined by hierarchically clustering the enrichment values with the R v3.0.1 <italic>hclust</italic> function using Euclidean distance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers. The Reviewing editor and reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We are delighted to tell you that the review of your manuscript is now completed and the reviewers really liked your study. We suggest a few small changes that we are sure you can do in short time. Please below see the combined reviews.</p><p>This study constitutes an important systematic contribution to the analysis of the expression profile and chromatin state of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, before, during, and after the midblastula transition. Pre-MBT embryos were carefully hand-sorted and analyzed by ChIP-seq for Pol II, TBP, and histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Strong occupancy of TBP and Pol II as well as low levels of H3K4me3 were observed on the pre-MBT genes in the pre-MBT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By using a pausing index based on the distribution of Pol II, it was found that most (77 to 107 out of 117) pre-MBT genes exhibit little transcriptional pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, a strong extent of pausing was observed with genes that are activated during the MBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were essentially absent from the nuclei of pre-MBT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Analysis of core promoter sequences revealed that the TATA box is significantly enriched in the promoters of pre-MBT genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings lead to the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. In essence, zygotic transcription from pre-MBT genes appears to occur typically via the TATA box by a mechanism that does not involve transcriptional pausing.</p><p>The findings suggest that there is a specific, perhaps streamlined, mechanism of transcription involving the TATA box that is used to achieve the rapid synthesis of transcripts that is needed in the pre-MBT embryo. This is a notable and interesting finding.</p><p>Prior to publication we would like to see the following changes made to the manuscript. These changes are largely aimed at making the manuscript more easily accessible to the readership.</p><p>1) The authors need to provide some statistics on reproducibility among the biological replicates used.</p><p>2) While the authors will release a GEO accession, having supplements at the journal site is a good idea. Supplementary file 1 is critical (the most important for anyone really wanting to study the primary results), but is lacking in ways that will make it difficult to use. There should be another sheet in the workbook, or a separate readme file that has all the def lines and nomenclature explained. For example, I have no idea what “Custom_slam” means in a column where all the rest of the cells appear to have FBtr#s. I can guess what most of the columns labels mean, but you should not make the reader do this. Additionally, many of the important data fields in Supplementary file 1 are conclusions rather than data (e.g., “yes”, “never-paused”, etc). These should be replaced with numbers used for the classification system as outlined in the methods. The classification scheme itself is somewhat ad hoc and in a different study, by a different lab, so it is almost certain that some of the same genes will be classified differently. These types of data handling issues have muddled many areas of genomics and can be ameliorated by giving others data, allowing them to apply a different classifier.</p><p>3) Write something about the nucleosome positioning in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p>4) The core promoter enrichments are clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, but are there any dependencies of the type mentioned in the Discussion? For example, in the case of preMBT dual genes, do they have an Inr and a PB element? One or the other?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the locations of the putative DPE, MTE and PB sites are distributed throughout the promoter region. It is known, however, that these sequences function only in a specific downstream location. Therefore, DPE, MTE, and PB-like sequences that are not located in their characteristic downstream location should probably be disregarded.</p><p>6) There are a confusing number of core promoter and MBT classification names. This is certainly not all the fault of the authors, but it would help the reader if the names from the traditional literature and the computational studies were both used or listed somewhere to help match Ohler and FitzGerald, for example. This could be added to the “promoter element table”. The authors should not send the reader to another paper for a term that they could easily define in the manuscript (dispersed and focused are never described). The long descriptors (“pre-MBT not-paused genes”) could be replaced in the figures with data in the heat maps. Almost anything that would make the high-dimensional naming of promoters easier to follow would be greatly appreciated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00861.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors need to provide some statistics on reproducibility among the biological replicates used</italic>.</p><p>We agree that additional information about the reproducibility of our ChIP-seq experiments would be useful.

As suggested, we have added an additional sheet containing complete descriptions of each column. In addition, we have added all data columns used in our gene classification schemes.</p><p><italic>3) Write something about the nucleosome positioning in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref>.</p><p>We now say in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: “The overall nucleosome occupancy, as measured by MNase digestion, shows more pronounced nucleosome positioning at MBT maternal genes but the overall nucleosome occupancy is not dramatically different (compare top and bottom panels at the right).”</p><p>We did not emphasize this result in the main text because the strong positioning of nucleosomes at promoters with dispersed initiation has been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rach et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaertner et al., 2012</xref>) and the number of pre-MBT genes is relatively small.</p><p><italic>4) The core promoter enrichments are clear in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>, but are there any dependencies of the type mentioned in the Discussion? For example, in the case of preMBT dual genes, do they have an Inr and a PB element? One or the other</italic>?</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now added a figure on the co-occurrence of promoter elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). Our results agree very well with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>) and show that the association between Zelda, TATA, and Inr is specific for early development.</p><p>We have added this analysis and mention this result in the main text: “Finally, an analysis of the co-occurrences of core promoter elements similar to previous analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FitzGerald et al., 2006</xref>) also supports our finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, Zelda, Inr, and TATA significantly co-occur among all our Pol II-bound genes (pre-MBT and MBT genes) but not among all annotated genes, suggesting that these motifs preferentially function together during early development.”</p><p>The figure also shows that Inr and PB significantly co-occur. Note, however, that most co-occurrences are only significant when analyzing a large data set and not in selected pre-MBT or MBT gene sets. Thus, it is likely that promoters do not generally require a pair of motifs with a perfect match to the consensus sequence (i.e., a high affinity binding site). We interpret a co-occurrence of two motifs as evidence that they are found in the same promoter type and can function together.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref><italic>, the locations of the putative DPE, MTE and PB sites are distributed throughout the promoter region. It is known, however, that these sequences function only in a specific downstream location. Therefore, DPE, MTE and PB-like sequences that are not located in their characteristic downstream location should probably be disregarded</italic>.</p><p>We agree that instances of DPE, MTE and PB motifs found upstream of the transcription start site in the MBT active gene group are unlikely to be functional. That’s why we selected a specific window relative to the transcription start site when we scanned for known motif sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. These windows are listed in the promoter element table in the methods and were based on previous experimental evidence and our own computational analyses. In contrast, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows a de novo motif analysis and the distribution for each recovered known motif. This shows that the most frequent location of the identified motifs agrees with previous studies. Although the recovered DPE/MTE/PB motif is not as specific in its location, we felt that it would be wrong to manipulate the original results. Rather, our results suggest that the recovered DPE/MTE/PB motif is more frequently found by chance (outside its location where it is functional) as compared to the other motifs.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion this has caused and added to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. “Only occurrences close to the known location of the motif relative to the TSS were scored (see promoter element table in the Materials and methods).” Furthermore, we added to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>: “Note that all motifs are found with the highest frequency at the expected location, but that the DPE/MTE/PB motif is less specific and more frequently found at positions where it is unlikely to be functional as a core promoter element.”</p><p><italic>6) There are a confusing number of core promoter and MBT classification names. This is certainly not all the fault of the authors, but it would help the reader if the names from the traditional literature and the computational studies were both used or listed somewhere to help match Ohler and FitzGerald, for example. This could be added to the “promoter element table”. The authors should not send the reader to another paper for a term that they could easily define in the manuscript (dispersed and focused are never described). The long descriptors (“pre-MBT not-paused genes”) could be replaced in the figures with data in the heat maps. Almost anything that would make the high-dimensional naming of promoters easier to follow would be greatly appreciated</italic>.</p><p>We also noticed that promoter studies and their classifications are not well known to a general audience. We have therefore now defined focused and dispersed promoters in the text, and mention their alternative names (peaked and broad promoters):</p><p>“Focused transcription initiates within a very narrow window and often at a single nucleotide (also called peaked promoters), while dispersed transcription initiates from several weak transcription start sites within a ∼150 nucleotide region (also called broad promoters). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, dispersed initiation is typically found at broadly expressed housekeeping genes with constitutive promoters.”</p><p>We also evaluated whether we could simplify our nomenclature but only found one instance where it was not completely consistent. We had labeled the Ohler motifs as either Motif1, etc. or Ohler1, etc. We have now consistently referred to these motifs as Ohler1, etc. to make sure the source is clear (for example, as opposed to the FitzGerald nomenclature). Overall, we feel that our choice, description, and presentation of the core promoter elements is systematic:</p><p>• We only include core promoter elements in the analysis that are relatively well understood to avoid confusion.</p><p>• We are always using traditional names if available (DPE, DRE, GAGA, Inr, MTE, PB, TATA, Zelda) and use the Ohler nomenclature only if no other name is known (Ohler1, Ohler6, Ohler7).</p><p>• If possible, we always mention promoter elements that belong to the same promoter type together.</p><p>• In the figures, core promoter elements are sorted and grouped by function for clarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
