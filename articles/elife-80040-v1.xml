Generally, our knowledge of the mechanistic details behind the localization of a given RNA is restricted to a particular cell type. Here, we show that RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type predictably regulate localization in other cell types with vastly different morphologies. To determine transcriptome-wide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells, we used our recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-seq. We found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP mRNAs) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single-molecule RNA FISH, we found that pyrimidine-rich motifs in the 5′ UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5′ UTR of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the RNA-binding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-1. To extend these findings, we compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. We found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The information required to build a specific protein is encoded into molecules of RNA which are often trafficked to precise locations in a cell. These journeys require a complex molecular machinery to be assembled and set in motion so that the RNA can be transported along dynamic ‘roads’ called microtubules. The details of this mechanism are known only for a handful of RNAs in a few cell types; for example, scientists have uncovered the signals presiding over the shuttling of certain RNAs to the axon, the long and thin projection that a neuron uses to communicate. Yet these RNAs are also present in cells that lack axons. Whether the molecular processes which preside over RNA movement apply across cell types has so far remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate this question, Goering et al. tracked the location of RNA molecules in two types of polarized mouse cells: neurons which feature an axon, and ‘epithelial’ cells which line the intestine. The experiments revealed that the signals sending RNAs to the axons also directed the molecules towards the bottom pole of epithelial cells. In both cases, the RNAs travelled towards the extremity of the growing, “plus” end of the microtubules.</p><p>Overall, this work suggests that RNA transport mechanisms should not be thought of as leading to a particular location in the cell; instead, they may be following more generalisable instructions. This knowledge could allow scientists to predict where a particular RNA will be sent across cell types based on data from one cell population. It could also aid the development of synthetic RNAs that target specific parts of the cell, offering greater control over their actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA localization</kwd><kwd>RNA trafficking</kwd><kwd>TOP motif</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM133385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taliaferro</surname><given-names>J Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000888</institution-id><institution>W.

These post-transcriptional processes, including alternative splicing, translational regulation, RNA decay, and subcellular RNA localization, are often regulated by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that exert their function upon their RNA targets by recognizing and binding specific sequence motifs. Because the binding of RNA by RBPs is largely governed by specific sequence-based interactions, RBPs often bind similar RNA targets across cell types. Therefore, RBPs often exert their regulatory function upon the same RNA targets, regardless of cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matia-González et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van Nostrand et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Many RBPs are ubiquitously expressed across tissues and generally elicit the same post-transcriptional regulatory behaviors on their target RNAs in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>). The subcellular localization of an RNA, though, is at least conceptually tightly linked to cell morphology. If the interaction between an RBP and an RNA sequence in neurons results in a transcript’s localization to axons, where will the same transcript localize in a cell type that doesn’t have axons yet nevertheless expresses the same regulatory RBP? (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) Can we define spatial equivalents for RNA destinations across cells with vastly different morphologies?</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Halo-seq enriches cytoplasmic localized RNA molecules in C2bbe1 monolayers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA regulatory processes are generally driven through the interaction of an RBP and an RNA sequence element. Because RBPs are often widely expressed, many of these processes (exemplified here by RNA decay) operate across cellular contexts. The orange RBP binds a particular sequence within a transcript to promote its degradation in both cell types. However, because RNA localization is intimately linked with cell morphology, if an RBP/RNA interaction promotes RNA localization in one cell type, how the same interaction would affect RNA localization in another cell type is unclear. (<bold>B</bold>) Overview of the Halo-seq method. A HaloTag is genetically fused to a protein with specific localization. DBF-conjugated Halo ligands are specifically recruited to the Halo fusion proteins due to their high affinity and covalent binding to HaloTag protein domains. When exposed to green light, DBF produces oxygen radicals that, in combination with propargylamine, alkynylate DBF-proximal RNAs. ‘Click’ chemistry covalently attaches biotin moieties to alkynylated RNAs in vitro, facilitating their enrichment via streptavidin pulldown, thereby enriching localized RNAs for high-throughput sequencing. (<bold>C</bold>) HaloTag protein fusions to P65 are localized to the cytoplasm. HaloTag fusions are visualized in fixed cells through the addition of a Halo ligand fluorophore shown in red. DAPI stain marks the nuclei in blue. Profile lines across the XY image demonstrate exclusion of Halo signal from the nucleus and in the XZ-projected image demonstrate no apical or basal bias. Images are an average projection through the XZ axis of approximately 50 cells. (<bold>D</bold>) Equation for Cytoplasmic Bias. Cytoplasmic RNA localization is calculated with a metric termed Cytoplasmic Bias as the log<sub>2</sub> of a transcript’s abundance in the streptavidin enriched fraction divided by its abundance in the input total RNA.

However, how these RBPs and RNA elements would regulate RNA localization in cell types or morphologies outside of those that they were discovered in is generally unknown.</p><p>RNA localization is widely studied in neuronal models as their long projections are amenable to both microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Hundreds of RNAs are actively transported into neuronal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gumy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taliaferro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zappulo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zivraj et al., 2010</xref>).

Enterocytes are polarized across their apicobasal axis with specialized regions that perform specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klunder et al., 2017</xref>). The apical regions of enterocytes are responsible for nutrient absorption from the gut. whereas the basal regions export processed nutrients to the lymph and bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodman, 2010</xref>). Many proteins and RNAs are asymmetrically localized across the apicobasal axis to aid in these spatially distinct functions, but little is known about the RNA elements and RBPs that regulate a transcript’s location within epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ryder and Lerit, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using transcriptome-wide assays, we reveal that the neurites of neurons and the basal pole of epithelial cells are enriched for similar RNAs. We further find that specific RNA regulatory elements and RBPs that regulate RNA localization in one cell type can predictably do so in other cell types with very different morphologies as well as in different species. These results hint at conserved mechanisms of RNA localization and potentially a predictable, underlying code for RNA localization compatible with vastly different subcellular locations and cellular morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Halo-seq allows for isolation of spatially distinct RNA populations from C2bbe1 monolayers</title><p>C2bbe1 cells, a subclone of the human CaCo-2 cell line, recapitulate human intestinal enterocytes by spontaneously creating polarized monolayers with differentiated brush-borders in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peterson and Mooseker, 1992</xref>).

Halo-fusion-proximal RNAs are therefore selectively alkynylated in situ.</p><p>Following total RNA isolation, alkynylated transcripts are biotinylated using Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuACC) ‘Click’ chemistry with biotin azide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hein et al., 2008</xref>). Halo-proximal transcripts are therefore selectively biotinylated by this reaction allowing for purification of localized RNAs from total RNA via streptavidin pulldowns. By comparing the abundances of transcripts in total RNA and streptavidin-purified RNA samples using high-throughput sequencing, transcripts that were Halo-proximal can be identified.</p><p>To first assay the efficiency with which Halo-seq can enrich localized RNAs in C2bbe1 monolayers, we targeted the cytoplasmic compartment for analysis with Halo-seq. Because differences between the cytoplasmic and nuclear transcriptomes are well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaghlool et al., 2021</xref>), we reasoned that this would provide a good benchmark of the technique in C2bbe1 monolayers. We fused a HaloTag domain to a cytoplasmically restricted NF-kappa B subunit, P65. This doxycycline-inducible transgene was integrated into the genome of C2bbe1 cells using cre/<italic>loxP</italic> recombination. The doxycycline-inducible expression and size of the cytoplasmic-Halo fusion were confirmed by gel electrophoresis with fluorescent Halo ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). We also confirmed the cytoplasmic localization of the Halo fusion protein in situ using fluorescent Halo ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then visualized the site-specific alkynylation of biomolecules following DBF-mediated oxidation by performing azide-alkyne cycloaddition in situ with Cy3-conjugated azides. The presence of Cy3 labeled molecules required the addition of DBF, indicating that the observed alkynylation was due to the Halo-seq procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). These experiments revealed that both the cytoplasmic-Halo fusion and the molecules it labeled were restricted to the cytoplasm, indicating that the DBF-mediated labeling was spatially specific.</p><p>To determine if we could biotinylate alkynated RNA, we performed Halo-seq in differentiated C2bbe1 monolayers expressing the cytoplasmic-Halo. Following in-cell alkynylation and in vitro Click-mediated biotinylation, we visualized biotinylated RNA using RNA dot blots with streptavidin-HRP. We observed strong RNA biotinylation signal that was dependent upon the addition of DBF to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We then incubated biotinylated RNA samples from DBF-treated and untreated cells with streptavidin-coated beads. For three DBF-treated samples, we recovered an average of 1.6% of the total RNA sample from the streptavidin-coated beads. In contrast, we only recovered an average of 0.05% of the total RNA sample from DBF-untreated samples, further illustrating that RNA biotinylation requires DBF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>We then created rRNA-depleted RNAseq libraries from three streptavidin input and enriched RNA samples from DBF-treated cells. Following high-throughput sequencing, we quantified transcript and gene abundances in each sample using salmon and tximport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, samples separated primarily by fraction (input vs. streptavidin pulldown) in a principal component analysis (PCA) plot of transcript expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>To quantify cytoplasmic RNA localization, we created a metric called cytoplasmic bias (CB), which we defined as the log<sub>2</sub> of a transcript’s abundance in the streptavidin-pulldown samples compared to its abundance in the input RNA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We used DESeq2 to identify genes that were significantly enriched in streptavidin-pulldown samples compared to input samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>). These represent genes whose transcripts were enriched in the cytoplasm. Using this approach, 1192 genes were identified as significantly cytoplasmically enriched (FDR &lt; 0.01) while 715 genes were significantly depleted and therefore likely enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We then looked at CB values for lncRNAs specifically. As a class, these transcripts are known to be enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lubelsky and Ulitsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shukla et al., 2018</xref>), and therefore should be depleted from the streptavidin-pulldown samples. As expected, lncRNA transcripts had significantly lower CB values, indicating that Halo-seq was faithfully reporting on RNA localization in C2bbe1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, we used a custom salmon index to simultaneously quantify intron-containing and fully spliced versions of every transcript. Spliced transcripts are exported to the cytoplasm while intron-containing transcripts are often restricted to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luo and Reed, 1999</xref>). Further validating Halo-seq, we observed that intron-containing pre-mRNA transcripts generally had negative CB values, indicating their nuclear enrichment. Conversely, intron-lacking, mature transcripts of the same genes had positive CB values, indicating their cytoplasmic enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results provided confidence that Halo-seq identifies localized RNAs in C2bbe1 monolayers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Halo-seq identifies RNAs differentially localized across the apicobasal axis of C2bbe1 monolayers</title><p>To identify RNAs localized across the apicobasal axis of enterocytes, we first needed to ensure that we could establish polarized monolayers of C2bbe1 cells.

The subcellular localization of both HaloTag fusions was then assessed using fluorescent Halo ligands. The PODXL fusion (henceforth referred to as apical-Halo) was restricted to the apical region of cells while the ATP1A1 fusion (henceforth referred to as basal-Halo) was restricted to the basal pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). To assess the localization of alkynylated molecules produced by the Halo-seq protocol with these fusions, we visualized alkynylated molecules using in situ Click chemistry with a fluorescent azide as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>. We found that in cells expressing apical-Halo, alkynylated molecules were concentrated toward the apical poles of cells.

In both cases, alkynylation was dependent upon the addition of DBF to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>).

To identify RNAs that were differentially localized across the apicobasal axis, we calculated an apical bias (AB) value for each gene. We defined this metric as the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of a gene’s abundance in the apical-Halo pulldown samples compared to its abundance in the basal-Halo pulldown samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Genes with positive AB values are therefore apically-enriched while those with negative AB values are basally-enriched. AB values and their associated p values were calculated using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Love et al., 2014</xref>). With this approach, transcripts from 1053 genes were found to be significantly apically localized (FDR &lt; 0.05) while transcripts from 1200 genes were significantly basally localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To test this, we visualized mitochondria using both immunofluorescence and a mitochondrial-specific dye, mitoView. Both methods indicated that the localization of mitochondria was, in fact, basally biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>).

Given that RP mRNAs were strongly basally localized in epithelial cells, we hypothesized that 5<italic>′</italic> TOP motifs may be regulating their localization. Similar 5<italic>′</italic> UTR motifs called pyrimidine-rich translational elements (PRTEs) have additionally been found to regulate the translation of some non-RP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>). We found that PRTE-containing RNAs were also basally enriched, suggesting that like 5<italic>′</italic> TOP motifs, PRTEs may also be regulating RNA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although there is some inconsistency in the literature, in general, 5<italic>′</italic> TOP motifs are defined as being located <italic>immediately</italic> next to the 5<italic>′</italic> cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berman et al., 2021</xref>) while PRTEs can be more generally localized anywhere within the 5<italic>′</italic> UTR. There are conflicting reports as to whether the proximity of a pyrimidine-rich motif to the 5<italic>′</italic> cap affects its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ashtal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the location of pyrimidine-rich elements within 5<italic>′</italic> UTRs of mRNAs was connected to RNA localization, we defined the presence and location of pyrimidine-rich elements within all RP and PRTE-containing mRNAs (see Methods). If a UTR contained multiple pyrimidine-rich elements, we used the position of the most 5<italic>′</italic> element. We observed no difference in basal localization between RNAs that contained 5<italic>′</italic> TOP motifs immediately adjacent to the 5<italic>′</italic> cap and those that contained PRTE elements further downstream in the 5<italic>′</italic> UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). From this, we conclude that there is no relationship between the localization of an RNA and the <italic>position</italic> of pyrimidine-rich elements within its 5<italic>′</italic> UTR. Therefore, we will refer to these elements as pyrimidine-rich regulatory elements (PRREs) as (1) their position within 5<italic>′</italic> UTRs seems unimportant and (2) they may regulate more than translation.</p><p>Although the above analyses showed a relationship between PRREs and RNA localization, they do not demonstrate causality. To directly test the ability of PRREs to regulate RNA localization, we selected two RP mRNAs, <italic>RPL7</italic> and <italic>RPS28</italic>, that were basally localized in the Halo-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and validated their localization using smFISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We then placed their entire 5<italic>′</italic> UTRs in front of the open reading frame (ORF) of Firefly luciferase to create two reporter transcripts such that the PRREs in these transcripts were approximately 90 nt from the 5<italic>′</italic> cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As negative controls, we created similar reporter RNAs containing mutated PRREs such that every pyrimidine within the motif was replaced with a purine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We determined the localization of these reporter RNAs in C2bbe1 intestinal epithelial monolayers using smFISH probes designed to target the Firefly luciferase ORF.</p><p>On its own, the Firefly luciferase transcript is an exogenous, non-localized RNA. We found that addition of the PRREs from both <italic>RPL7</italic> and <italic>RPS28</italic> were sufficient to drive the Firefly luciferase transcript to the basal compartment. Mutated PRREs were not able to drive basal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We then quantified the localization of each PRRE reporter’s transcripts and found that PRRE-containing reporter transcripts were significantly localized to the basal pole of the cells (p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test) while those containing mutant PRREs were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first identified RNA element that is sufficient to drive RNAs to the basal pole of epithelial cells.</p><p>5<italic>′</italic> TOP motifs have been previously shown to negatively regulate RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, mutant PRRE reporter transcripts were more abundant than their wildtype counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). It should be noted again, though, that in these reporters the PRREs are located well into the 5<italic>′</italic> UTR, further demonstrating that they need not be immediately adjacent to the 5<italic>′</italic> cap to exert their potential regulatory ability.</p><p>To more broadly assess the ability of the PRRE motif to regulate RNA localization in intestinal epithelial cells, we investigated the localization of our reporter constructs in a different human intestinal enterocyte cell line, HCA-7 cells. HCA-7 cells create monolayers that are more colon-like than the enterocyte-like C2bbe1 monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kirkland, 1985</xref>). Reporter constructs were integrated into HCA-7 lox cells via cre-<italic>lox</italic> recombination. We again found that PRRE motifs from RPL7 and RPS28 were both sufficient for basal RNA localization in HCA-7 monolayers while mutated PRRE motifs were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Also, as in the C2bbe1 monolayers, PRRE motifs were associated with decreased transcript abundance compared to their mutated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>To test the ability of PRRE motifs to regulate RNA localization in epithelial cells generally, we integrated our human PRRE reporter constructs into MDCK cells through <italic>cre</italic>-mediated recombination. MDCK cells are epithelial cells derived from canine kidneys and have been used to study polarity across the apicobasal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balcarova-Ständer et al., 1984</xref>). As before, we found that PRRE-containing reporter RNAs were strongly basally localized while mutant PRRE motifs were not able to drive basal RNA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>) and that PRREs were associated with decreased transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9</xref>). PRRE motifs are therefore able to promote basal RNA localization in a variety of epithelial cell types across multiple mammalian species. Furthermore, elements derived from human transcripts are able to regulate RNA localization in canine-derived cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PRRE motifs regulate RNA localization in morphologically dissimilar cell types</title><p>RP mRNAs have been found to be localized to cellular projections made by neurons and migrating cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dermit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shigeoka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taliaferro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations were made by sequencing RNA fractions collected following mechanical fractionation using microporous membranes where small projections grow through pores restricting cell bodies on top of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In these experiments, RNA localization can be described as a localization ratio (LR) comparing the log<sub>2</sub> abundance of a transcript in projection or neurite fraction to its abundance in the soma or cell body fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To identify RNAs robustly localized into neurites, we combined published datasets from over 30 unique experiments where neuronal cells were subjected to mechanical fractionation. This dataset included neuronal samples spanning a range of neuronal cell types from cultured cell lines to primary cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goering et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taliaferro et al., 2016</xref>). For each neuronal sample, we calculated an LR value for each gene in each sample. These were then Z-normalized within a sample, and the gene’s LRz value was defined as the gene’s median normalized LR value across all samples. Genes with positive LRz values therefore have RNAs that are neurite-enriched while genes with negative LRz values have RNAs that are cell body enriched. Using this dataset, we confirmed that RP mRNAs are efficiently localized to neurites across dozens of experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p><p>As in the epithelial cells, RNAs previously defined as having a pyrimidine-rich translation element (PRTE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>) were also neurite-enriched, and the location of pyrimidine-rich elements with 5<italic>′</italic> UTRs was not correlated with RNA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). This again indicates that PRREs can likely regulate RNA localization in neurons independent of their proximity to the 5<italic>′</italic> cap.</p><p>Although RP mRNAs are enriched in neuronal projections, the RNA sequences within the RP mRNAs that regulate this localization are unknown. We reasoned that because PRRE motifs are highly conserved and had the ability to regulate RNA localization in epithelial cells that perhaps they may similarly be able to drive RNA transcripts to neurites. Endogenous mouse Rpl7 and Rps28 transcripts were found to be localized to neurites in the transcriptome-wide subcellular fractionation datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>) and by RT-qPCR of CAD cell body and neurite RNA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). The PRRE motifs of these mouse RNAs differ from their human orthologs by only a few nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>).</p><p>To test if PRRE elements are sufficient for neurite localization, we integrated and expressed our human PRRE reporter RNAs derived from human RPL7 and RPS28 in CAD mouse neuronal cells. Using smFISH, we found that reporters with wildtype PRRE motifs were efficiently localized to neurites while reporters that contained mutated PRRE motifs or lacked PRRE motifs were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). We quantified the smFISH data by comparing the number of RNA puncta in the neurite to the number of puncta in the soma for each reporter. We found that PRRE-containing reporters were significantly more enriched in neurites than reporters that contained mutated PRRE motifs (p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). This effect was driven by a neurite-specific increase in transcript abundance and not due to any cell-wide RNA expression changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s12">Figure 3—figure supplement 12</xref>).</p><p>We then confirmed this result using an orthologous technique. We mechanically fractionated reporter-expressing CAD cells into cell body and neurite fractions and quantified reporter RNA in both fractions using qRT-PCR. Consistent with the smFISH results, we found that PRRE-containing reporter RNAs were neurite-enriched while RNAs containing mutated PRREs were significantly less enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s13">Figure 3—figure supplement 13</xref>).</p><p>Human PRRE motifs are therefore sufficient for neurite localization in mouse neuronal cells, suggesting that PRRE-mediated RNA localization mechanisms are conserved across species. Further, given that PRRE motifs regulate RNA localization in intestinal epithelial cells, neuronal cells, and migrating cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dermit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), these results demonstrate that PRRE-mediated RNA localization mechanisms are conserved across cell types with vastly different morphologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Neurite localization driven by PRRE motifs is Larp1 dependent</title><p>We next sought to identify RBPs that are required for PRRE-mediated RNA transport in neuronal cells. Multiple members of the highly conserved La superfamily of RBPs (also known as La Related Proteins or LARPs) regulate multiple aspects of RNA metabolism in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deragon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dock-Bregeon et al., 2021</xref>). Two of these, Ssb and Larp1, have been previously found to bind pyrimidine-rich motifs within 5′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dermit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lahr et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maraia et al., 2017</xref>). Given this, we assayed the requirement of Larp family members for PRRE-mediated RNA localization in CAD cells by performing a targeted RNAi screen and monitoring the localization of our PRRE-containing reporters. Importantly, although Larp6 is required for endogenous RP mRNA transport in migrating cancer cell projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dermit et al., 2020</xref>), it is not expressed in CAD cells and therefore was not included in the screen.</p><p>We knocked down Larp family members Ssb, Larp1, Larp4, and Larp7 using siRNA transfection. Knockdown efficiencies assayed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) were between 80% and 95% for each Larp protein assayed. We hypothesized that if a Larp RBP was responsible for PRRE-mediated RNA localization to neurites, we would see a decrease in the neurite localization of PRRE-containing reporters when expression of the Larp RBP was reduced. Following the depletion of Larp1, we observed that wildtype PRRE-containing reporters were significantly less neurite-enriched, demonstrating that Larp1 is required for their efficient transport. This effect was PRRE-specific as the localization of mutant PRRE-containing reporters was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Larp1 was the only assayed RBP that was required for PRRE-mediated localization as knockdown of the other Larp family members did not consistently affect the localization of wildtype PRRE reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Specifically, the loss of Larp1 expression reduced both the number of cells producing neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) and shortened overall neurite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Larp1 was the only tested Larp protein for which this effect was observed. The depletion of other Larp proteins increased the number of cells producing neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), and in the case of Larp4, also increased overall neurite length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Larp1 is therefore both required for transport of PRRE-containing transcripts to neurites and required for proper neurite outgrowth. However, because many Larp proteins, including Larp1, are implicated in a wide range of RNA regulatory modes, we cannot directly ascribe this neurite phenotype to the loss of RP mRNA localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Basal localization of PRRE motifs in epithelial cells is LARP1 dependent</title><p>Following our knockdown experiments in mouse neuronal cells, we suspected that the pyrimidine-binding protein LARP1 may be responsible for the basal localization of PRRE-containing RNAs in human epithelial monolayers. To test this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a LARP1 knockout C2bbe1 cell line.</p><p>Using two guide RNAs, we targeted exon 2 and exon 19, both of which are included in all major isoforms of LARP1, with the goal of deleting the sequence in between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Because C2bbe1 cells may not be diploid at the <italic>LARP1</italic> locus, we expected to identify multiple Cas9-generated <italic>LARP1</italic> alleles in a single clonal line. We identified one clonal line in which no wild type <italic>LARP1</italic> was detectable. One or more alleles had lost the sequence in between exon 2 and exon 19 and the only remaining allele contained a 53 base pair deletion in exon 2 that resulted in a premature stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">7</xref>). The <italic>LARP1</italic> RNA produced by this clone is therefore not expected to produce a full length protein product and should be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Consistent with this, the level of <italic>LARP1</italic> RNA produced in this clone was less than 3% of that produced in wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>To reintroduce expression of LARP1 in the selected LARP1 knockout clone, we integrated a full-length LARP1 rescue cDNA under a doxycycline-inducible promoter via <italic>cre-</italic>mediated recombination. This LARP1 KO-rescue line expressed LARP1 protein only in the presence of doxycycline. As a control, we also created a line in which the knockout was rescued with doxycycline-inducible GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>By expressing our PRRE-containing reporter RNAs in the LARP1 knockout and rescue lines, we found that PRRE-containing reporters were basally localized only when LARP1 was present, indicating that LARP1 is required for their localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). We wondered if the loss of LARP1 expression would also reduce the basal localization of endogenous RPL7 and RPS28 transcripts. Using smFISH probes targeting the endogenous transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), we assayed the localization of the endogenous RP RNAs across the apicobasal axis in our wildtype C2bbe1 cells as well as in our LARP1 KO cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplements 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">10</xref>). We found that loss of LARP1 did not change the abundance of endogenous RP transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s11">Figure 4—figure supplement 11</xref>). However, the basal localization of the endogenous transcripts was reduced when LARP1 was not present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Altogether, we found that LARP1 mediates the basal localization of PRRE-containing RNAs in epithelial monolayers and the neurite localization of the same RNAs in neuronal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>PRRE motifs must be in the 5′ UTR of transcripts in order to mediate RNA localization</title><p>To better understand how PRRE motifs were regulating the localization of our reporter transcripts, we asked if the location of the motif in the transcript beyond the 5′ UTR changed its ability to regulate RNA localization. Much of the data demonstrating that LARP1 interacts with pyrimidine-rich elements does so with motifs that are close to the 5′ 7-methylguanosine cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ashtal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Philippe et al., 2018</xref>). To test if PRRE motifs could regulate RNA localization when they were in 3′ UTRs, we placed the RPL7 and RPS28 PRRE motifs after the Firefly luciferase ORF, thus creating 3′ PRRE reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We reasoned that if the PRREs must be in 5′ UTRs in order to regulate RNA localization, the 3′ PRRE reporters would display a reduced ability to regulate RNA localization. In C2bbe1 monolayers, we found that 3′ PRRE reporters were significantly less basally localized than their 5′ PRRE counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We observed similar results in mouse neuronal cells, finding that 3′ PRRE reporters were significantly less efficient at driving RNAs to neurites than their 5′ PRRE counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, in order to efficiently regulate RNA localization, PRRE motifs must be in the 5′ UTR of transcripts.

To test this, we compared LRz and AB values from the neuronal fractionation and epithelial Halo-seq datasets, respectively, transcriptome-wide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Somewhat surprisingly, we found a reasonably strong and highly significant correlation between these values (<italic>R</italic>=–0.28, p&lt;2.2e-16). The negative sign of this correlation indicates that neurites and the basal pole of epithelial cells are enriched for similar transcripts. RP mRNAs, highlighted in red, exemplify this relationship (<italic>R</italic>=–0.46, p=1.5e-11). These correlations are even more striking when considering the fact that the LRz and AB values are derived from experiments that differ greatly in their approaches (mechanical subcellular fractionation vs. proximity labeling), species (mouse vs. human), and cell types (neurons vs. intestinal epithelial cells). These very different cellular compartments are therefore spatial equivalents, at least in terms of RNA localization, and their RNA contents are likely governed by the same regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>The genes that fall in the fourth quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> are localized basally in enterocytes and to the neurites of neurons. To interrogate the identity of these genes we used GO enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexa, 2010</xref>). The most enriched GO terms were ‘ribosome’ and ‘mitochondrion’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We have extensively detailed that RP mRNAs are enriched both in neurites and the basal compartment of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have similarly found that mitochondria are enriched toward the basal pole of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>), and mitochondria have previously been reported to be found in neuronal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mandal and Drerup, 2019</xref>). Given that many nuclear-encoded RNAs that encode mitochondrial proteins are translated on the surface of the mitochondria, it may be expected that these RNAs are also neurite- and basal-enriched. Consistent with this idea, we found that RNAs that encode components of the electron transport chain (ETC) were both neurite- and basal-enriched according to our sequencing data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).

This effect was specific to the <italic>Net1</italic> 3′ UTR as the localization of reporter transcripts lacking the 3′ UTR was unaffected by kinesin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, we found that inhibition of dynein strengthens basal localization of Net1 3′ UTR transcripts. Kinesin and dynein activity are often closely linked, pulling the same cargoes in different directions. When the activity of one motor is inhibited, it can therefore increase the apparent activity of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>). In neuronal cells, kinesin inhibition again significantly reduced the neurite localization of the <italic>Net1</italic> 3′ UTR reporter RNAs, again suggesting they are transported along microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). We did not observe any changes in the localization of our control reporter transcript, Firefly luciferase, in response to drug treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>).

For those that are known, their activity has generally only been studied in a single cell type (e.g. neurons or <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos). Because the subcellular location of an RNA is often intricately linked with the morphology of the cell, it has been difficult to predict how RNA localization elements that are active in one cell type would behave in another. In this study, we have demonstrated that two RNA localization elements, PRRE motifs and a GA-rich element in the 3′ UTR of the mouse <italic>Net1</italic> RNA, drive RNAs to the projections of mouse neuronal cells and the basal pole of human epithelial cells. Further, transcriptome-wide analysis of these subcellular compartments revealed that their RNA contents are similar, suggesting that the same mechanisms are populating their localized transcriptomes.</p><p>RP mRNAs have been previously identified as enriched in neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taliaferro et al., 2016</xref>) and the basal pole of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moor et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms that direct RP mRNAs to those locations have been unknown. We found that PRRE motifs regulate the trafficking of RNAs to both of those locations and do so in a manner that requires the RBP LARP1. PRRE motifs were also previously found to regulate RNA localization to the protrusions of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dermit et al., 2020</xref>). However, in these cells, RP mRNA localization required another La-family RBP, LARP6. Larp6 was not expressed in our mouse neuronal model, and LARP6 was only lowly expressed in our human epithelial model. Thus, it is possible that LARP1 and LARP6 have redundancy in RNA localization activities and can complement each other in this regard if expressed in the same cell.</p><p>Interactions between LARP1 and PRRE motifs have been well-studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Ashtal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lahr et al., 2015</xref>). Generally, these interactions have been characterized in the context of LARP1’s ability to regulate the translational status of PRRE-containing RNAs, often through a model in which LARP1’s interaction with the 5′ cap inhibits translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, it has been demonstrated that LARP1 contains at least three RNA binding regions, a DM15 region that recognizes the 5′ mRNA cap, an RNA recognition motif, and a La motif that recognizes the PRRE. RNA binding is tightest when both of these binding modes (i.e. to the 5′ cap and the PRRE motif) are engaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lahr et al., 2017</xref>). These models have further proposed that regulation by LARP1 requires the 5′ cap and pyrimidine-rich motif be <italic>immediately</italic> adjacent to each other. We challenge the necessity of this adjacency for two reasons.</p><p>First, although the <italic>presence</italic> of PRREs within 5′ UTRs was clearly connected with RNA localization, we found no relationship between the <italic>position</italic> of the PRREs within 5′ UTRs and their ability to regulate RNA localization. Conversely, PRREs in 3′ UTRs were unable to regulate RNA localization. Together, this suggests that general proximity to the 5′ cap may be important although immediate adjacency may not be required. Second, multiple datasets interrogating transcription start sites using CAGE and related techniques have found that for most mammalian genes, including RP-mRNAs, transcription is not initiated at the same nucleotide every time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, transcription begins somewhere within a window that is often several nucleotides wide. In this case, only some fraction of RP-mRNA transcripts would have their 5′ cap and pyrimidine-rich motifs located immediately adjacent to each other.</p><p>Intriguingly, the depletion of Larp1 in mouse neuronal cells and the knockout of LARP1 in human epithelial cells led to noticeable phenotypes. In neuronal cells, Larp1 depletion led to cells producing fewer and shorter neurites. LARP1 knockout epithelial cells had a noticeable growth defect and had considerably longer doubling times. It is tempting to ascribe at least parts to these phenotypes to the mislocalization of RP mRNAs, especially since RP mRNAs are some of the most highly expressed mRNAs in the cell. However, given that LARP1 participates in multiple facets of post-transcriptional gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berman et al., 2021</xref>), we cannot directly make this conclusion.</p><p>The conserved localization of RP mRNAs as a class across multiple species and cell types suggests a repeated need for the spatial control of ribosomal protein synthesis. The translation of RP mRNAs could greatly impact the translational output of an entire cell as more ribosomal proteins allows for a greater number of functional ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fonseca et al., 2018</xref>). Still, given that ribosome assembly canonically occurs in the nucleolus, it is puzzling as to why RNAs encoding ribosomal subunits would often be kept so far away from the nucleus. One idea is that locally synthesized ribosomal proteins can directly join and remodel, or perhaps repair, nearby ribosomes, promoting further local control of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shigeoka et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We also found that a GA-rich region in the 3′ UTR of the mouse <italic>Net1</italic> RNA is necessary and sufficient to drive RNAs both to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells and the basal pole of human epithelial cells. Interestingly, a GA-rich region in the 3′ UTR of human <italic>NET1</italic> RNA was also identified as necessary for the localization of the transcript to the leading edges of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrisafis et al., 2020</xref>) dependent on transport by KIF1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pichon et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these findings point to the existence of an RNA localization ‘code’ that operates in multiple cell types and is conserved across species. In the mechanisms illuminated in this study, we propose that the RNA localization codes we identified are not ‘neurite localization’ signals or ‘basal localization’ signals per se. Rather, they are signals that specify that an RNA should be trafficked to the plus end of microtubules, wherever that may be in a given cell type. This opens up the possibility of predicting the localization of an RNA in a given cell type if its localization in another cell type is known, greatly increasing our understanding of mechanisms underlying RNA trafficking.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

RNPs from Synthego with AAVS1 targeting sgRNA (UAGUGGCCCCACUGUGGGGU) were electroporated with the Neon electroporation system (C2bbe1:1600 V 10ms and 3 pulses, HCA-7: 1100 V 20ms 2 pulses). A donor plasmid containing the loxP cassette with homology to the AAVS1 safe harbor was co-electroporated with the RNPs. Following electroporation, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 hr before selection with blasticidin (20 μg/mL for C2bbe1, 10 μg/mL for HCA-7) until untransfected negative control cells had died and the newly selected loxP line exhibited normal growth patterns.</p><p>Integration of the loxP cassette into the AAVS1 safe harbor was validated by PCR amplifying the junctions of the AAVS1 site upstream and downstream the inserted cassette. Primers were designed such that PCR products are only created when the LoxP cassette is inserted as expected. The parental line was included as a negative control and did not produce junction PCR products.</p><p>MDCK loxP cells were created through random integration using the same electroporation (1600 V 10ms 3 pulses) strategy and donor plasmid for human lines. CRISPR/Cas9 RNPs were omitted from this electropporation. Selection of blasticidin resistant clones contained loxP cassettes in undetermined locations.</p><p>For the LARP1 knockout line, C2bbe1 loxP cell lines were treated with two sgRNAs from Synthego that targeted exon 2 (GCUGUUCCUAAACAGCGCAA) and exon 19 (GCUGUUCCUAAACAGCGCAA) of LARP1. CRISPR Cas9 RNPs and a GFP plasmid were co-electroporated using the Neon electroporation system (1600V 10ms and 3 pulses) and incubated at 37 °C for 48 hr. GFP positive cells were sorted to single cells using a flow cytometer (MoFlo XDP100) and allowed to expand for 2–4 weeks. Clones were screened for gene deletion by PCR as well as LARP1 mRNA and protein depletion determined by qPCR and western blot analysis with a monoclonal LARP1 antibody (Santa Cruz sc-515873).

All Halo-fusion proteins were cloned into the location of the GFP ORF by excising GFP with AgeI and BstXI and then PCR amplifying the cDNA of the Halo fusion protein of interest with overhanging primer handles that provide 20 bp of homology to the plasmid backbone. Some Halo fusion cDNAs were synthesized by Twist Bioscience. PODXL (Horizon, MHS6278-202858197), ATP1A1 (Horizon, MHS6278-202759485), and LARP1 (Horizon, MHS6278-202827213) cDNAs were obtained from Horizon Discovery. Infusion cloning (TakaraBio) was used to ligate PCR amplified inserts into plasmid backbones. Constructs were confirmed by restriction digest assays and DNA sequencing.</p><p>A variant of pRD-RIPE with a bi-directional promoter driving both Firefly and Renilla luciferases was inserted into pRD-RIPE creating pRD-RIPE-BiTET-FR. Reporter constructs were created by adding additional sequence to cut sites in the 5′ (AscI) or 3′ (PmeI) end of the Firefly luciferase ORF. Because PRRE motifs are short, DNA inserts were created by annealing two oligos and cloning via sticky end cloning with T4 DNA Ligase (NEB M0202S) into the linearized pRD-RIPE-BiTET-FR such that inserted motifs were 90nt downstream of the canonical CMV promoter transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isomura et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cre recombinase-mediated cassette switching</title><p>All loxP-containing cell lines followed the same protocol for cassette switching.

Different volumes of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Pierce PI88816) were used depending on the amount of labeled RNA by each Halo fusion protein. Halo-P65 required 1 μl beads per 2 μg total RNA while apical-Halo and basal-Halo required 1 μl beads per 4 μg RNA. Prior to mixing with RNA, beads were washed three times in B&amp;W buffer (5 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, 0.1 Tween 20), two times in solution A (0.1 M NaOH, 50 mM NaCl), and one time in solution B (100 mM NaCl).

All spot thresholding parameters were set to exclude gross outliers. The detection settings were the same for every soma and neurite imaged within an experiment. Approximately ten cells were analyzed for each sample. The mean number of Firefly luciferase transcripts in neurites compared to soma was calculated by FISH-quant mature mRNA summary files. Cell outlines for somas and neurites were manually drawn within the FISH-quant software. Usually cell outlines were visible in the FISH channel with high brightness.

To fractionate CAD cells into soma and neurite fractions, CAD cells were plated on porous, transwell membranes that had a pore size of 1.0 micron (Corning 353102). One million CAD cells were plated on each membrane. These membranes fit in one well of a six well plate, and three membranes were combined to comprise one single biological replicate. After allowing the cells to attach, the cells were induced to differentiate into a more neuronal state through the withdrawal of serum. Cells were then differentiated on the membranes for 48 hr.</p><p>To fractionate the cells, the membranes were washed one time with PBS. One mL of PBS was added to the top (soma) side of the membrane. The top side of the membrane was then scraped repeatedly and thoroughly with a cell scraper and the soma were removed into an ice-cold 15 mL falcon tube. After scraping, the membranes were removed from their plastic housing with a razor blade and soaked in 500 µL RNA lysis buffer (Zymo R1050) at room temperature for 15 min to make a neurite lysate. During this time, the 3 mL of soma suspension in PBS was spun down and resuspended in 300 μL PBS. Of this soma sample, 100 µL was then carried forward for RNA isolation using the Zymo QuickRNA MicroPrep kit (Zymo R1050). In parallel, RNA was also isolated from the 500 μL neurite lysate using the same kit. Typically, the neurite RNA yield from the six combined membranes was 100–300 ng. The efficiency of the fractionation was assayed by Western blotting using anti-beta-actin (Sigma A5441, 1:5000) and anti-Histone H3 (Abcam ab10799, 1:10000) antibodies. cDNA was created from 100 ng of RNA from each fraction using LunaScript RT supermix kit (NEB #E3010) following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Taqman qPCR of neurite fractions</title><p>All Firefly luciferase reporter constructs were driven by a bi-directional tet-On promoter that also induces Renilla luciferase expression.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jeffrey Chao (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Both reviewers feel the manuscript is worthy of publication but they feel it would be stronger with some additional data, as described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There are several points related to the smFISH experiments that were brought up by both reviewers that need to be addressed that will require a modest amount of experiments as well as additional image analysis</p><p>2. There are several control experiments requested along with clarification of the 5' TOP sequences and reporters that were used in their experiments. This is important because the current results are inconsistent with the published literature as presented.</p><p>3. It will be important to verify the asymmetric localization of the endogenous ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs characterized in this study. The reviewers could not find the pertinent data in the manuscript.</p><p>Further details are available in the full reviews below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Line 14: &quot;results&quot;.</p><p>– Figure 1-S2: Please add marker lengths to the gel image to indicate the size of PCR products.

For all the RNA imaging-based experiments you quantified a very limited number of cells (usually ~10 cells) and it is not clear if the quantifications are derived from independent experiments. You mentioned in the methods that you used FISH-quant for the quantifications, which has a very powerful batch mode for the quantifications of many images at the same time.

For all experiments where RNA is quantified by smFISH or smiFISH please always report not only the ratios but also the absolute counts of mRNA transcripts per cell.

A control experiment where the smFISH for the endogenous mRNAs RPL7 or RPS28 should be provided in addition to the reporter constructs. These two mRNAs are the ones that you have extensively characterized throughout the paper. I believe that it would be important to show the bias in their localization both in epithelial and neuronal cell lines, even though single molecule detection may be difficult due to the high mRNA counts. If single mRNAs cannot be quantified, total integrated fluorescence intensity can be measured in different compartments to estimate the localization bias.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80040.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In particular, we understand the concerns about how counting each individual smFISH punctum as a unique observation may artificially overpower the results.</p><p>To address this in the C2bbe1 epithelial system, we reanalyzed smFISH images using each of the following as a unique observation: the mean location of all smFISH puncta in one cell, the mean location of all puncta in a field of view, and the mean location of all puncta in one coverslip. Using each of these metrics, the results we observed were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) with the obvious difference of reductions in statistical power. We therefore chose to reanalyze the existing images using the mean locations of puncta within individual cells as our metric of choice. Figures 2G, 3C, 3F, 4F, 4G, 5B, 5D, 6D, 7C, 7F, and several supplemental figures have been updated to reflect this change.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>C2bbe1 monolayer smFISH spot position analysis.</title><p>RNA localization across the apicobasal axis is measured by smFISH spot position in the Z axis. This can be plotted for each spot, where thousands of spots over-power the statistics. Spot position can be averaged per cell as outlined manually within the FISH-quant software. This reduces sample size and allows for more accurate statistical analysis. When spot position is averaged per field of view, sample size further decreases, statistics are less powered but the localization trends are still robust. Finally, we can average spot position per coverslip, which represents biological replicates. We lose almost all statistical power as sample size is limited to 3 coverslips. Despite this, the localization trends are still recognizable..</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80040-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>For the CAD neuronal smFISH images, those analyses were already done on a per-cell level as the metric presented is neurite puncta / soma puncta within one individual cell. Still, the reviewers’ comments about needing to image more cells for these experiments are worthwhile. Rather than imaging more cells, though, we turned to the completely orthogonal technique of subcellular fractionation into soma and neurite fractions followed by RT-qPCR. This technique profiles the population average of approximately 3 million cells. The results from fractionation/RT-qPCR experiments agreed very well with the original smFISH results (compare Figure 3M and Figure 3 —figure supplement 13). We hope that the use of two orthogonal techniques to quantify neurite RNA localization lends increased confidence to the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are several control experiments requested along with clarification of the 5' TOP sequences and reporters that were used in their experiments. This is important because the current results are inconsistent with the published literature as presented.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers’ point about whether pyrimidine-rich motifs need to be directly adjacent to the 5’ cap in order to regulate localization is a very good one. There is conflicting literature about whether LARP proteins, and in particular LARP1, require such an arrangement. Further, the nomenclature in the literature is confusing as some say that in order for pyrimidine-rich motifs to be called TOP motifs they must be immediately next to the cap while others are more lenient with their position with the 5’ UTR.</p><p>Published CAGE data indicates that a substantial fraction of endogenous RPL7 and RPS28 transcripts begin with a purine (see <bold>reviewer figure 2</bold>). Yet, endogenous RPL7 and RPS28 transcripts are clearly basally/neurite enriched (figure 3C and 3K).</p><p>A deeper analysis of our reporter transcripts led us to find that the pyrimidine-rich elements within our reporter RNAs were located approximately 90 nt into the body of the 5’ UTR. Yet, these reporter transcripts are also basally/neurite localized. We redesigned our reporters such that the pyrimidine-rich motif was immediately adjacent to the 5’ cap and found that their localization was very similar to those with internal pyrimidine-rich motifs (see <bold>reviewer figure 3</bold>). These results suggest that a pyrimidine-rich element need not be immediately adjacent to the 5’ cap to regulate RNA localization.</p><p>To generalize these results, we began with pyrimidine-rich 5’ UTR elements that had previously been found to regulate translation in an mTOR-dependent manner (Hsieh et al. 2012). We found that RNAs containing these elements were similarly basally/neurite localized as TOP-containing RP mRNAs (figures 3A, 3I). To assess any relationship between the location of pyrimidine-rich elements within 5’ UTRs and their localization regulatory ability, we compared the localization of transcripts with pyrimidine-rich elements at different 5’ UTR positions. We found no such relationship, and motifs in the body of the 5’ UTR seemed just as able to regulate RNA localization as those immediately adjacent to the 5’ cap. This data is presented in figures 3B and 3J.</p><p>From this, we conclude that localization-regulating pyrimidine-rich elements can be located anywhere within 5’ UTRs. We have therefore begun calling these elements “pyrimidine-rich regulatory elements” (PRREs) to differentiate them from 5’ TOP motifs since there is literature requiring 5’ TOP motifs to be cap-adjacent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It will be important to verify the asymmetric localization of the endogenous ribosomal protein-encoding mRNAs characterized in this study. The reviewers could not find the pertinent data in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have performed smFISH on the two endogenous RP-mRNAs we used as the basis for our reporters, RPL7 and RPS28. In epithelial cells, we found their endogenous transcripts to be extremely basally enriched. This data can be found in figure 3C and figure 3 supplement 3. For neuronal cells, we again turned to the orthogonal subcellular fractionation / RT-qPCR experiment. Using our nonlocalized firefly reporter as a control, we found that endogenous mouse Rpl7 and Rps28 transcripts were approximately 4-fold neurite enriched. This data is included as figure 3K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further details are available in the full reviews below.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Line 14: &quot;results&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for catching this.

The reviewer is correct that the apical fusion protein does display two bands on this gel. Based on the design of our transgene, we did not expect this. It is possible that some cleavage or other protein processing is happening with this protein. Regardless, figure 2A demonstrates that almost all apical fusion protein, no matter the potential cleavage product, is apically localized, indicating that it can still serve as a useful reagent for proximity labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2-S3 and 4: Are the scales for intensity (y-axis) identical between figures?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, these intensity scales are identical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 196:.… confirmed the &quot;ability&quot; of the apical-Halo…</p></disp-quote><p>This mistake has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

For the epithelial cell images, we have reorganized the analysis such that the reported metric is now mean transcript position per cell. In these images, we are routinely assaying dozens to hundreds of cells per condition.</p><p>For the neuronal images, it is more difficult to image many cells as their extended morphology makes it difficult to capture an entire cell in one field of view. Given that we would have to perform additional imaging on dozens of individual cell lines, we instead turned to an orthogonal technique to bolster the neuronal smFISH results. Using porous transwell membranes, we mechanically fractionated these cells into soma and neurite fractions, collected RNA from each fraction, and then quantified endogenous and reporter transcript abundances in each fraction using RT-qPCR. This technique reports the population average from approximately 3 million cells across at least three biological replicates.</p><p>In all cases, results from the subcellular fractionation agreed quite well with the smFISH results (compare figure 3M with figure 3 —figure supplement 13).

For each tested LARP, we did verify knockdown using RT-qPCR and found the knockdowns to be strong (&gt;80%, figure 4 —figure supplement 1).
