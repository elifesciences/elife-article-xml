Multiplex optogenetic applications require spectrally separated molecules, which are difficult to engineer without disrupting channel function. Scanning numerous sequence databases, we identified three naturally blue-shifted ChRs from ancyromonads. They form a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree and contain residue motifs characteristic of anion ChRs (ACRs). However, only two conduct chloride, whereas the closely related <italic>Nutomonas longa</italic> homolog generates inward cation currents in mammalian cells under physiological conditions, significantly exceeding those by previously known tools with similar spectral maxima (peak absorption at ~440 nm). Measurements of transient absorption changes and pH titration of purified proteins combined with mutant analysis revealed the roles of the residues in the photoactive site. Ancyromonad ChRs could be activated by near-infrared two-photon illumination, a technique that enables the deeper-tissue optogenetic activation of specific neurons in three dimensions. Both ancyromonad ACRs allowed optogenetic silencing of mouse cortical neurons in brain slices. <italic>Ancyromonas sigmoides</italic> ACR (<italic>Ans</italic>ACR) expression in cholinergic neurons enabled photoinhibition of pharyngeal muscle contraction in live worms. Overall, our results deepen the mechanistic understanding of light-gated channel function and expand the optogenetic toolkit with potent, blue-shifted ChRs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>channelrhodopsins</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>ancyromonads</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM140838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD032293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01NS118288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St-Pierre</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan G</given-names></name><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1NS133657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St-Pierre</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan G</given-names></name><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R61CA278458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St-Pierre</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS136027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St-Pierre</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AU-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Q-2016-20220331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St-Pierre</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Q-2016-20190330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>St-Pierre</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019895</institution-id><institution>Vivian L.

The chromophore is attached via a retinylidene Schiff base (RSB) linkage to a conserved lysine residue in the seventh transmembrane helix (TM7). Upon photoexcitation, ChRs generate passive ionic currents across the cell membrane and are used for optical control of excitable animal cells (optogenetics; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deisseroth, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piatkevich and Boyden, 2023</xref>). The seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain is sufficient for channel activity; the role of the C-terminal domain, which comprises up to half of the polypeptide chain, remains unclear. A considerable diversity within the ChR family suggests a convergent evolution of light-gated channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Govorunova et al., 2022c</xref>). ChRs form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Volkov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>) or trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tucker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morizumi et al., 2023</xref>), but their ionic conductance is intrinsic to individual protomers, unlike voltage- or ligand-gated channels, in which several protomers contribute to the channel pore. Anion channelrhodopsins (ACRs) generate photoinduced anion influx in mammalian cells; cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs) generate H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> influx; and kalium channelrhodopsins (KCRs) generate K<sup>+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Govorunova et al., 2022a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Govorunova et al., 2023</xref>). ACRs and KCRs are used for optogenetic neuronal inhibition, and CCRs are used for neuronal activation.</p><p>Increasingly popular all-optical electrophysiology, that is simultaneous perturbation and measurement of membrane potential using light-sensitive actuators and reporters, respectively, in the same genetically defined cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>) requires spectrally non-overlapping optogenetic tools. Even the most red-shifted ChRs retain sufficient sensitivity to blue light due to their relatively wide spectral bandwidth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Govorunova et al., 2020</xref>). The development of red-light-absorbing genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors for monitoring neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakamoto and Yokoyama, 2025</xref>) opened up the possibility of pairing them with blue-shifted ChRs. Molecular engineering yielded several blue-shifted ChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2015</xref>), but mutagenetic perturbations of the binding pocket frequently harm channel function. A complementary approach is exploring natural ChR diversity to search for molecules with desired biophysical properties optimized by evolution. Approximately ~1000 ChR sequences are currently known, but a much smaller number has been functionally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Govorunova et al., 2022c</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identified and characterized three ChR variants from bacterivorous ancyromonad flagellates. Ancyromonads (also known as planomonads) represent a distinct major clade near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). We conducted automated and manual patch clamp analyses of photocurrents upon expression of ancyromonad ChR cDNAs in cultured mammalian cells under one- and two-photon excitation and monitored transient light absorption changes using detergent-purified proteins. We show that two ancyromonad ChRs are anion-selective, while the third and most blue-shifted ChR conducts metal cations. We expressed ancyromonad ACRs in mouse cortical pyramidal neurons and demonstrated photoinhibition of action potentials in acute brain slices. The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an attractive model for analyzing nervous system function by optogenetic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergs et al., 2022</xref>). We used this model organism to demonstrate that a blue-shifted ancyromonad ACR enables efficient optogenetic inhibition of pharyngeal activity upon expression in the cholinergic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogeny, spectral sensitivity, and photon flux dependence</title><p>Our bioinformatic search identified ChR homologs in the ancyromonads <italic>Ancyromonas sigmoides, Fabomonas tropica,</italic> and <italic>Nutomonas longa; Ancoracysta twista,</italic> a predatory flagellate placed in the newly established supergroup Provora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tikhonenkov et al., 2022</xref>); the diatom <italic>Odontella aurita</italic>; and <italic>Paraphysoderma sedebokerense</italic>, a chytrid-like fungus from the phylum Blastocladiomycota.

One reason for this behavior could be equal permeabilities of this ChR to Cl<sup>-</sup> and F<sup>-</sup>. However, when Cl<sup>-</sup> in the external solution was partially replaced with bulky, non-permeable aspartate, only <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR showed substantial V<sub>r</sub> shifts to more positive values, which confirmed their permeability to Cl<sup>-</sup>, but no such shift was detected in <italic>Nl</italic>CCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>, red symbols).

Next, we analyzed transient absorption changes in detergent-purified <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR. In contrast to <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, we could not find a clear indication of the accumulation of a blue-shifted L intermediate. After an initial (unresolved) decay of a K-like intermediate, red-shifted absorbance temporally increased in both ancyromonad ACRs, reaching a maximum at 100–200 μs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, red), that is in the time domain of fast channel opening. This red-shifted intermediate could be a long-lived K or an unusual red-shifted L. In <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, an additional slower increase in the red-shifted absorbance likely reflected the formation of an O-like intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, red). Accumulation of the M intermediate absorbing in the UV range was only 10 (<italic>Ans</italic>ACR) or 2 times (<italic>Ft</italic>ACR) slower than channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>), although in <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, it was 50 times slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sineshchekov et al., 2015</xref>).

An extremely fast M-like UV-absorbing intermediate absent in the WT was observed in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, red).

We interpret this positive current as an intramolecular proton transfer to the mutagenetically introduced primary acceptor (Glu86), which was suppressed by negative voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, lower black trace). Acidification increased the amplitude of the fast negative current ~10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, black arrow) and shifted its V<sub>r</sub> ~100 mV to more depolarized values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This can be explained by passive inward movement of the RSB proton along the large electrochemical gradient. Remarkably, the G86E mutation suppressed channel current at neutral pH, but acidification of the bath to pH 5.4 recovered it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, red arrow). The full current trace recorded under acidic conditions could be deconvoluted into four components with τ 30 μs, 80 μs, 1.5ms, and 640ms, revealing that the mutation slowed channel closing sixfold. Replacement of Cl<sup>-</sup> with Asp<sup>-</sup> caused an ~40 mV shift of the channel current’s V<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that the mutant channel remained Cl<sup>-</sup> selective.

In the presence of 10 mM serotonin required to maintain regular pharyngeal pumping, its frequency in the dark was not significantly different in the transgene and wild-type worms (4.07 ± 0.05 and 4.19 ± 0.08 Hz, respectively, mean ± SEM, n=26 transgenic and 11 wild-type worms, respectively; the p-value by the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test is 0.21), indicating that <italic>Ans</italic>ACR expression did not affect the pharyngeal function in the darkness. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> shows representative EPG recordings from a transgenic worm fed on bacteria supplemented with all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal. The onset of 470 nm illumination caused an immediate inhibition of pumping in such transgene worms but not in the WT worms fed on the same bacteria or transgene worms in the absence of retinal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes LITE-1 and GUR-3 UV/blue light receptors (unrelated to ChRs) responsible for photoinhibition of pharyngeal pumping at high light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhatla et al., 2015</xref>). However, no photoinhibition was detected in the absence of retinal in either wild-type or transgenic worms. This indicates that the irradiance used in our experiments was insufficient to stimulate these endogenous photoreceptors. The magnitude of the <italic>Ans</italic>ACR-mediated photoinhibition depended on the irradiance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). The maximal irradiance (2.1 mW mm<sup>–2</sup>) completely abolished the pumping for 15 s in all tested worms (n=13). In five of 13 worms, individual action potentials were observed during the second half of the 30 s illumination period, an indication of adaptation. Two independently created transgenic lines showed the same degree of photoinhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, filled and empty symbols). The photoinhibition was fully reversible: after switching off the maximal-irradiance light, the pumping frequency returned to the pre-illumination level with <italic>τ</italic>~9 s.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Photoinhibition of pharyngeal pumping in live <italic>C. elegans</italic> expressing <italic>Ans</italic>ACR in the cholinergic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A scheme of the genetic construct for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR expression in the cholinergic neurons.

Since then, ChRs have been identified in the genomes and transcriptomes of several other eukaryotic supergroups, including cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, and alveolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Govorunova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Govorunova et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, ChRs appear in the genomes of giant viruses, which likely facilitate the spread of ChR genes by horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rozenberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zabelskii et al., 2020</xref>). Our identification and characterization of ChRs in ancyromonads, phylogenetically placed near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018</xref>), suggests that eukaryotes acquired ChR genes at the early steps of their evolution. Consistent with the role of the encoded proteins as phototaxis receptors as shown in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, ChR genes or transcripts have been found only in protists that develop flagella at some stage of their life cycle. The diatom <italic>O. aurita</italic>, in which we identified ChRs, is no exception: the flagella are lost in the vegetative state of this protist but are still present in its male gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nanjappa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Prediction of biophysical properties such as ionic selectivity from protein sequences is a major unresolved problem in ChRs research. The <italic>Nl</italic>CCR sequence shows ∼29% identity and ∼49% similarity in the 7TM domain to each of the two ancyromonad ACRs and contains a neutral residue in the counterion position (Asp85 in BR), typical of all ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, red arrow). Yet, <italic>Nl</italic>CCR does not conduct anions, showing instead permeability to Na<sup>+</sup>. In the earlier known ChRs, the presence of conserved Glu residues in TM2 and the TM2-TM3 loop, corresponding to Glu82, Glu83, Glu90, and Glu101 of <italic>Cr</italic>ChR2, correlates with cation selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Govorunova et al., 2021</xref>). However, TM2 of <italic>Nl</italic>CCR contains no carboxylated residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which suggests a unique mechanism of cation selection in this channel. <italic>Nl</italic>CCR is the most blue-shifted among ancyromonad ChRs and generates larger photocurrents than the earlier known <italic>Ps</italic>ChR2 with a similar absorption maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Govorunova et al., 2013</xref>), which makes <italic>Nl</italic>CCR a good candidate for optogenetic stimulation of neuronal activity with blue light.</p><p>All ancyromonad ChRs absorb light in the blue spectral range. The λ<sub>max</sub> of retinylidene proteins is determined by the energy gap between the electronic ground (S0) and first excited (S1) state of the chromophore and depends on the chromophore geometry, the protonation state of the Schiff base counterion, and the interaction of the chromophore with other residues of the retinal-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ernst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engqvist et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2015</xref>). Paradoxically, the retinal-binding pockets of all three ancyromonad ChRs contain the residues corresponding to Met118 and Ala215 of bacteriorhodopsin, the well-known ‘color switches’ characteristic of red-shifted microbial rhodopsins. The role of the near-ring Met118 homolog in red-shifting the spectrum has been experimentally verified in <italic>Haloquadratum walsbyi</italic> BR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sudo et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engqvist et al., 2015</xref>), archaeorhodopsin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2015</xref>), and Chrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oda et al., 2018</xref>). It is thought that the bulky Met side chain pushes away the C7 atom of retinal, increasing the ring-chain coplanarity, expanding the π-conjugation, and red-shifting absorbance, as theoretically predicted in the <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1_C133M mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsujimura et al., 2021</xref>). The red-shifting effect of the Ala215 homolog has been demonstrated in <italic>N. pharaonis</italic> sensory rhodopsin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimono et al., 2000a</xref>), <italic>H. salinarum</italic> BR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spudich et al., 2012</xref>), Chrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oda et al., 2018</xref>), sodium-pumping rhodopsin KR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>Mantoniella squamata</italic> ACR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oppermann et al., 2024</xref>), and is explained by electrostatic interactions between the polar residue in this position and the RSB. However, in ancyromonad ChRs, mutations of the Met118 homolog to smaller residues and the Ala215 homolog to polar residues caused a red spectral shift or no shift. Furthermore, the mutagenetic introduction of the ring-rotating residues responsible for the blue-shifted spectra of <italic>Hyphochytrium catenoides</italic> kalium channelrhodopsin 2 (<italic>Hc</italic>KCR2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tajima et al., 2023</xref>) and <italic>Kn</italic>ChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2025</xref>) did not change the ancyromonad ChR spectra, which suggests that either the torsion around the C6-C7 bond is already enforced by a different geometry of the Met118 homolog or that the blue-shifted absorbance of ancyromonad ChRs arises by a different mechanism. Atomic structures of ancyromonad ChRs are needed to investigate the unexpected spectral shifts we observed when mutating residues of the retinal binding pocket.</p><p>ACRs are widely used to inhibit neuronal activity with light. We evaluated <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR as neuronal silencers in mouse brain slices and <italic>Ans</italic>ACR in the context of a live animal, the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We previously showed that <italic>Gt</italic>ACRs could inhibit action potentials at the soma while triggering synaptic transmission due to high axonal Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Messier et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and <italic>Ft</italic>ACR showed similar phenomena in our brain slice experiments. These ACRs can inhibit action potentials in cortical neurons but depolarize axonal terminals and trigger synaptic transmission at the onset of light stimulation. Fusing these new ACRs with somatodendritic trafficking motifs to reduce axonal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Messier et al., 2018</xref>) could lead to potent inhibition with reduced axonal excitation. Nevertheless, this undesired excitatory effect needs to be taken into consideration when using ACRs.</p><p>Optogenetic inhibition of <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharyngeal pumping has been demonstrated earlier upon expression of the <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> proton-pumping rhodopsin known as Mac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trojanowski et al., 2014</xref>) or <italic>N. pharaonis</italic> halorhodopsin (<italic>Np</italic>HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schüler et al., 2015</xref>) in the cholinergic neurons. However, ion-pumping rhodopsins such as these transport only one ion per absorbed photon and, therefore, require almost 20 times higher irradiance for photoinhibition than the maximal irradiance used in this study. All ACRs, including <italic>Ans</italic>ACR that we tested in the worms, transport multiple anions during the open state and, therefore, are more efficient optogenetic silencers than the ion-pumping rhodopsins. One possible explanation of the partial recovery of pharyngeal pumping that we observed after 15 s illumination, even at the highest tested irradiance, is continued attenuation of photocurrent during prolonged illumination (desensitization). However, the rate of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>) is much faster than the rate of the pumping recovery, reducing the likelihood that desensitization is driving this phenomenon. Another possible reason for the observed adaptation is an increase in the cytoplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration owing to <italic>Ans</italic>ACR activity and hence a breakdown of the Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient on the neuronal membrane. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharynx is innervated by 20 neurons, 10 of which are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>). A pair of MC neurons is the most important for regulation of pharyngeal pumping, but other pharyngeal cholinergic neurons, including I1, M2, and M4, also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trojanowski et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the pharyngeal muscles generate autonomous contractions in the presence of acetylcholine tonically released from the pharyngeal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trojanowski et al., 2016</xref>). Given this complexity, further elucidation of pharyngeal pumping adaptation mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>In summary, our characterization of ancyromonad channelrhodopsins (ChRs) reveals that their blue-shifted spectral sensitivity and unique ionic selectivity arise from distinct residue motifs not found in previously characterized ChRs. These findings broaden our understanding of how protein sequence modulates light-gated channel function. The blue-shifted absorption properties of ancyromonad ChRs hold promise for multiplexed applications alongside red-shifted indicators and warrant further evaluation across diverse experimental systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The pipette solution contained (in mM) KCl 130, MgCl2 2, HEPES 10 pH 7.4, and the bath solution contained (in mM) NaCl 130, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, glucose 10, HEPES 10 pH 7.4. In experiments to test the relative permeability of ChRs for Cl<sup>-</sup>, NaCl in the bath was replaced with Na aspartate, and in experiments in cells co-transfected with <italic>Ans</italic>ACR and Chrimson, KCl in the pipette solution was replaced with K gluconate. The low-pass filter of the amplifier output was set to 2 kHz. The signals were digitized with a Digidata 1440 A (Molecular Devices) at a 250 kHz sampling rate (4 μs per point) in experiments with laser flashes, and at a 5 kHz sampling rate (200 μs per point) in experiments with continuous light pulses using pClamp 10.7. Patch pipettes with 2–3 MΩ resistances were fabricated from borosilicate glass. Laser excitation was provided by a Minilite Nd:YAG laser (532 nm, pulse width 6 ns, energy 5 mJ; Continuum). The current traces were logarithmically filtered using Logpro software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spudich, 2022</xref>). Curve fitting was performed using Origin Pro software. Continuous light pulses were provided by a Polychrome V light source (T.I.L.L. Photonics GMBH) in combination with a mechanical shutter (Uniblitz Model LS6, Vincent Associates; half-opening time 0.5ms). The action spectra of photocurrents were constructed by calculating the initial slope of photocurrent recorded in response to 15 ms light pulses at the intensity &lt;25 µW mm<sup>–2</sup>, corrected for the quantum density measured at each wavelength, and normalized to the maximal value. To analyze the dependence of photocurrents on the photon flux density, 1 s light pulses were applied with 60 s dark intervals starting from the lowest density. Calibrated neutral density filters (Newport, Cat. #FSQ-OD50, #FSQ-OD100, #FSQ-OD150, and #FSQ-OD200) were used to adjust the density.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Manual patch clamp recording using 2P excitation in HEK293A cells</title><p>2P excitation of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, and <italic>Gt</italic>ACR2 expressed in HEK293A cells was conducted using an inverted microscope with multiphoton capability (A1R-MP, Nikon Instruments) at room temperature (23°C). A coverslip seeded with the transfected cells was placed in a custom glass-bottom chamber based on Chamlide EC (Live Cell Instrument) with a glass bottom made with a 24×24  mm cover glass #1 (Erie Scientific, Cat. #89082–270). Cells were perfused continuously with the external solution as described in the 1 P excitation section. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Cells were held at −20  mV for power dependency and spectral measurements, and at +20 mV for desensitization measurements. The holding voltages were compensated for the 4.4  mV LJP calculated using the ClampEx v.11.1 (Molecular Devices) built-in calculator. The signals were digitized with an Axon Digidata 1550B1 Low Noise system with a HumSilencer (Molecular Devices), and the current was recorded at 10  kHz using pClamp. The near-IR excitation was generated by a titanium:sapphire femtosecond laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) with a repetition rate of 80 MHz and a tuning range between 680 and 1,080  nm. Laser pulses were not pre-compensated for dispersion in the microscope optical path. Laser power was tuned using an acousto-optic modulator and delivered to the sample plane through a 40×0.95-numerical aperture (NA) objective (CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda, Nikon Instruments). Scanning across 40.96×40.96 μm regions-of-interest was achieved using resonant scanning at 33.3 Hz.</p><p>To determine the 2P action spectra of <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, the excitation wavelength was varied from 800 to 1080  nm in 40 nm increments. At each wavelength, the laser power at the sample plane was adjusted to 7.5  mW for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, 5  mW for <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and 3  mW for <italic>Nl</italic>CCR, as measured using a microscope slide power sensor (S170C, Thorlabs). Excitation power levels were selected to elicit robust photocurrents while minimizing ChR desensitization, by operating at or near the quadratic regime, where doubling the excitation power results in an approximate fourfold increase in the initial photocurrent slope. Deviations from the target power level were kept below 10% and corrected by considering the quadratic dependence of photocurrents on power under 2P excitation. Illumination consisted of 30 consecutive raster scans (total duration ~1 s) over a 40.96×40.96  μm region (512x512 pixels), approximating the average size of a HEK293A cell. Scans were performed back-to-back without temporal gaps, except for the brief interval required for the laser to return to the starting scan position. To mitigate desensitization, we spaced illumination pulses ~54 s apart. We verified that the power ramp and spectral scan protocols caused a less than 20% reduction in the peak photocurrent, as measured at the beginning and end of each protocol using peak-wavelength light pulses at 7.5  mW for <italic>Ans</italic>ACR, 5  mW for <italic>Ft</italic>ACR, and 3  mW for <italic>Nl</italic>CCR.

The <italic>Ft</italic>ACR trace was additionally smoothed by the 5-point Savitzky-Golay algorithm in Origin. Peak currents were quantified as the maximal currents over the 5 s traces.

Additionally, further engineering or combination with other tools may be required to achieve truly orthogonal control in multiplexed experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>To demonstrate the usefulness of ancyromonad ChRs for multiplex optogenetics as a proof of principle, we co-expressed AnsACR with the red-shifted cation-conducting ChR Chrimson and measured net photocurrent generated by this combination as a function of the wavelength.

A thorough discussion of this challenge in the application of optogenetics tools would prove very valuable to the readership.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following paragraph to the revised Discussion:</p><p>“One possible explanation of the partial recovery of pharyngeal pumping that we observed after 15-s illumination, even at the highest tested irradiance, is continued attenuation of photocurrent during prolonged illumination (desensitization). However, the rate of AnsACR desensitization (Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5A) is much faster than the rate of the pumping recovery, reducing the likelihood that desensitization is driving this phenomenon. Another possible reason for the observed adaptation is an increase in the cytoplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration owing to AnsACR activity and hence a breakdown of the Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient on the neuronal membrane. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> pharynx is innervated by 20 neurons, 10 of which are cholinergic (Pereira, Kratsios et al. 2015). A pair of MC neurons is the most important for regulation of pharyngeal pumping, but other pharyngeal cholinergic neurons, including I1, M2, and M4, also play a role (Trojanowski, Padovan-Merhar et al. 2014). Moreover, the pharyngeal muscles generate autonomous contractions in the presence of acetylcholine tonically released from the pharyngeal neurons (Trojanowski, Raizen et al. 2016). Given this complexity, further elucidation of pharyngeal pumping adaptation mechanisms is beyond the scope of this study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Govorunova et al present three new anion opsins that have potential applications in silencing neurons.

Such comparisons are very useful to adopt new opsins.</p></disp-quote><p>GtACR1 exhibits the peak sensitivity at 515 nm and therefore is poorly suited for combination with red-shifted CCRs or fluorescent sensors, unlike blue-light-absorbing ancyromonad ACRs. Nevertheless, we conducted side-by-side comparison of ancyromonad ChRs, GtACR1 and GtACR2, the latter of which has the spectral maximum at 470 nm. The results are shown in the new Figures 1E and F, and the new multipanel Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 added in the revision. We also added the following text, describing these results, to the revised Results section:</p><p>“Figures 1E and F show the dependence of the peak photocurrent amplitude and reciprocal peak time, respectively, on the photon flux density for ancyromonad ChRs and GtACRs. The current amplitude saturated earlier than the time-to-peak for all tested ChRs. Figure 1 – figure supplement 4A-E shows normalized photocurrent traces recorded at different photon densities. Quantitation of desensitization at the end of 1-s illumination revealed a complex light dependence (Figure 1, Figure Supplement 4F). Figure 1 – figure supplement 5 shows normalized photocurrent traces recorded in response to a 5-s light pulse of the maximal available intensity and the magnitude of desensitization at its end.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, multiphoton optogenetics is a promising emerging field in neuroscience, and I appreciate that the authors began to evaluate this approach with these opsins. However, a few additional comparisons are needed to establish the user viability of this approach, principally the photocurrent evoked using the 2p process, for given power densities. Comparison across the presented opsins and GtACR1 would allow readers to asses if these opsins are meaningfully activated by 2P.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out additional 2P experiments in ancyromonad ChRs, GtACR1 and GtACR2 and added their results to a new main-text Figure 6 and Figure 6 – figure supplement 1. We added the new section describing these results, “Two-photon excitation”, to the main text in the revision:</p><p>“To determine the 2P activation range of AnsACR, FtACR, and NlCCR, we conducted raster scanning using a conventional 2P laser, varying the excitation wavelength between 800 and 1,080 nm (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1). All three ChRs generated detectable photocurrents with action spectra showing maximal responses at ~925 nm for AnsACR, 945 nm for FtACR, and 890 nm for NlCCR (Figure 6A). These wavelengths fall within the excitation range of common Ti:Sapphire lasers, which are widely used in neuroscience laboratories and can be tuned between ~700 nm and 1,020-1,300 nm. To assess desensitization, cells expressing AnsACR, FtACR, or NlCCR were illuminated at the respective peak wavelength of each ChR at 15 mW for 5 seconds. GtACR1 and GtACR2, previously used in 2P experiments (Forli, Vecchia et al. 2018, Mardinly, Oldenburg et al. 2018), were included for comparison. The normalized photocurrent traces recorded under these conditions are shown in Figure 6B-F. The absolute amplitudes of 2P photocurrents at the peak time and at the end of illumination are shown in Figure 6G and H, respectively. All five tested variants exhibited comparable levels of desensitization at the end of illumination (Figure 6I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to develop Channelrhodopsins (ChRs), light-gated ion channels, with high potency and blue action spectra for use in multicolor (multiplex) optogenetics applications.

Note, however, that GtACR1’s spectral maximum is at 515 nm, which makes it poorly suitable for blue light excitation. Also, ChRs are known to perform very differently in different cell types and upon expression of their genes in different vector backbones, so our results cannot be generalized for all experimental systems.

This paper follows the tradition of the Spudich lab, presenting and rigorously characterizing potentially valuable opsins. Furthermore, they explore several mutations of the identified opsin that may make these opsins even more useful for the broader community. In general, I feel positively about this manuscript. It presents new potentially useful opsins and provides characterization that would enable its use. I have a few recommendations below, mostly centered around side-by-side comparisons to existing opsins.</p><p>(1) My primary concern is that while there is a reference to GtACR1, a highly used opsin first described by this team, they do not present any of this data side by side.</p><p>When evaluating opsins to use, it is important to compare them to the existing state of the art. As a potential user, I need to know where these opsins differ. Citing other papers does not solve this as, even within the same lab, subtle methodological differences or data plotting decisions can obscure important differences.</p></disp-quote><p>As we explained in the response to the public comments, we carried out side-by-side comparison of ancyromonad ChRs and GtACRs as requested by the Reviewer. The results are shown in the new Figures 1E and F, and the new multipanel Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5, added in the revision. However, we would like to emphasize a limited usefulness of such comparative analysis, as ChRs are known to perform very differently in different cell types and upon expression of their genes in different vector backbones, so our results cannot be generalized for all experimental systems. Each ChR user needs to select the most appropriate tool for his/her purpose by testing several candidates in his/her own experimental setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Multiphoton optogenetics is an emerging field of optogenetics, and it is admirable that the authors address it here. The authors should present more 2p characterization, so that it can be established if these new opsins are viable for use with 2P methods, the way GtACR1 is. The following would be very useful for 2P characterization:</p><p>Photocurrents for a given power density, compared to GtACR1 and GtACR2.</p></disp-quote><p>The new Figure 6 (B-F) added in the revision shows photocurrent traces recorded from the three ancyromonad ChRs and two GtACRs upon 2P excitation of a given power density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comparing NICCR and FtACR's wavelength specificity and photocurrent.

However, direct comparison of the 2P data with the 1P data is not possible, as we used laser scanning illumination for the former and wild-field illumination for the latter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Characterization of desensitization. As the authors mention, many opsins undergo desensitization, presenting the ratio of peak photocurrent vs that at multiple time points (probably up to a few seconds) would provide evidence for how effectively these constructs could be used in different scenarios.</p><p>We conducted a detailed analysis of desensitization under both 1P and 2P excitation. The new Figure 1 – figure supplement 4 and Figure 1 – figure supplement 5 show the data obtained under 1P excitation, and the new Figure 6 shows the data for 2P conditions.</p><p>I have to admit, that by the end of the paper, I was getting confused as to which of the three original constructs had which property, and how that was changing with each mutation. I would suggest that a table summarizing each opsin and mutation with its onset and offset kinetics, peak wavelength, photocurrent, and ion selectivity would greatly increase the ability to select and use opsins in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we added a table of the spectroscopic properties of all tested mutants as Supplementary File 2. This study did not aim to analyze other parameters listed by the Reviewer. We added the following sentence referring to this table to the main text:</p><p>“Supplementary File 2 contains the λ values of the half-maximal amplitude of the long-wavelength slope of the spectrum, which can be estimated more accurately from the action spectra than the λ of the maximum.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It may be out of the scope of this manuscript, but if a soma localization sequence can be shown to remove the 'axonal spiking' (as described in line 441), this would be a significant addition to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous study (Messier et al., 2018, doi: 10.7554/eLife.38506) showed that a soma localization sequence can reduce, but not eliminate, the axonal spiking. We plan to test these new ACRs with the trafficking motifs in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NICCR appears to have the best photocurrents of all tested opsins in this paper. It seems odd that it was omitted from the mouse cortical neurons experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not included analysis of NlCCR behavior in neurons because we are preparing a separate manuscript on this ChR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 would benefit from more gradation in the light powers used to silence and would benefit from comparison to GtACR. I suggest using a fixed current with a series of illumination intensities to see which of the three opsins (or GtACR) is most effective at silencing. At present, it looks binary, and a user cannot evaluate if any of these opsins would be better than what is already available.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we added the data comparing the light sensitivity of AnsACR and FtACR with previously identified GtACR1 and GtACR2 (new Figure 1E and F) to help users compare these ACRs. Although they are less sensitive to light comparing to GtACR1 and GtACR2, they could still be activated by commercially available light sources if the expression levels are similar. Less sensitive ACRs may have less unwanted activation when using with other optogenetic tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Suggested Improvements to Experiments, Data, or Analyses:</p><p>(1) Line 25: &quot;significantly exceeding those by previously known tools&quot; and Line 408: &quot;NlCCR is the most blue-shifted among ancyromonad ChRs and generates larger photocurrents than the earlier known CCRs with a similar absorption maximum.&quot; As noted in the public review, this statement applies only to a very specific subgroup of ChRs with spectral maxima below 450 nm. If the goal was to claim that NlCCR is a superior tool among a broader range of blue-light-activated ChRs, direct comparisons with state-of-the-art ChRs such as ChR2 T159C (Berndt et al., 2011), CatCh (Kleinlogel et al., 2014), CoChR (Klapoetke et al., 2014), CoChR-3M (Ganjawala et al., 2019), or XXM 2.0 (Ding et al., 2022) would be beneficial. If the goal was to demonstrate superiority among tools with spectra below 450 nm, I suggest explicitly stating this in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer correctly inferred that we emphasized the superiority of NlCCR among tools with similar spectral maxima, not all blue-light-activated ChRs available for neuronal photoexcitation, most of which exhibit absorption maxima at longer wavelengths. To clarify this, we added “with similar spectral maxima” to the sentence in the original Line 25. The sentence in Line 408 already contains this clarification: “with a similar absorption maximum”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 111-113: &quot;The absorption spectra of the purified proteins were slightly blue-shifted from the respective photocurrent action spectra (Figure 1D), likely due to the presence of non-electrogenic cis-retinal-bound forms.&quot; I would be skeptical of this statement. The spectral shifts in NlCCR and AnsACR are small and may fall within the range of experimental error. The shift in FtACR is more apparent; however, if two forms coexist in purified protein, this should be reflected as two Gaussian peaks in the absorption spectrum (or at least as a broader total peak reflecting two states with close maxima and similar populations). On the contrary, the action spectrum appears to have two peaks, one potentially below 465 nm. Generally, neither spectrum appears significantly broader than a typical microbial rhodopsin spectrum. This question could be clarified by quantifying the widths of the absorption and action spectra or by overlaying them on the same axis. In my opinion, the two spectra seem very similar, and just appearance of the &quot;bump&quot; in the action spectum shifts the apparent maximum of the action spectrum to the red. If there were two states, then they should both be electrogenic, and the slight difference in spectra might be explained by something else (e.g. by a slight difference in the quantum yields of the two states).</p></disp-quote><p>As the Reviewer suggested, in the revision we added a new figure (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2), showing the overlay of the absorption and action spectra of each ancyromonad ChR. This figure shows that the absorption spectra are wider than the action spectra (especially in AnsACR and FtACR), which confirms our interpretation (contribution of the non-electrogenic blue-shifted cis-retinal-bound forms to the absorption spectrum). Note that the presence of such forms explaining a blue shift of the absorption spectrum has been experimentally verified in HcKCR1 (doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2023.08.009; 10.1038/s41467-025-56491-9). Therefore, we revised the text as follows:</p><p>“The absorption spectra of the purified proteins (Figure 1C) were slightly blue-shifted from the respective photocurrent action spectra (Figure 1 – figure supplement 3), likely due to the presence of non-electrogenic cis-retinal-bound forms. The presence of such forms, explaining the discrepancy between the absorption and the action spectra, was verified by HPLC in KCRs (Tajima et al. 2023, Morizumi et al., 2025).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 135-136: &quot;The SyncroPatch enables unbiased estimation of the photocurrent amplitude because the cells are drawn into the wells without considering their tag fluorescence.&quot; While SyncroPatch does allow unbiased selection of patched cells, it does not account for the fraction of transfected cells. Without a method to exclude non-transfected cells, which are always present in transient transfections, the comparison of photocurrents may be affected by the proportion of untransfected cells, which could vary between constructs. To clarify whether the statistically significant difference in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test could indicate that the fraction of transfected cells after 48-72h differs between constructs, I suggest analyzing only transfected cells or reporting fractions of transfected cells by each construct.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer correctly states that non-transfected cells are always present in transiently transfected cell populations. However, his/her suggestion to “exclude non-transfected cells” is not feasible in the absence of a criterion for such exclusion. As it is evident from our data, transient transfection results in a continuum of the amplitude values, and it is not possible to distinguish a small photocurrent from no photocurrent, considering the noise level. We would like, however, to emphasize that not excluding any cells provides an estimate of the overall potency of each ChR variant, which depends on both the fraction of transfected cells and their photocurrents. This approach mimics the conditions of in vivo experiments, when non-expressing cells also cannot be excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 176: &quot;AnsACR and FtACR photocurrents exhibited biphasic rise.&quot; The fastest characteristic time is very close to the typical resolution of a patch-clamp experiment (RC = 50 μs for a 10 pF cell with a 5 MΩ series resistance). Thus, I am skeptical that the faster time constant of the biphasic opening represents a protein-specific characteristic time. It may not be fully resolved by patch-clamp and could simply result from low-pass filtering of a specific cell. I suggest clarifying this for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is right that the patch clamp setup acts as a lowpass filter. Earlier, we directly measured its time resolution (~15 μs) by recording the ultrafast (occurring on the ps time scale) charge movements related to the trans-cis isomerization (doi: 10.1111/php.12558). However, the lowpass filter of the setup can only slow the entire signal, but cannot lead to the appearance of a separate kinetic component (i.e. a monophasic process cannot become biphasic). Therefore, we believe that the biphasic photocurrent rise reflects biphasic channel opening rather than a measurement artifact. Two phases in the channel opening have also been detected in GtACR1 (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1513602112) and CrChR2 (10.1073/pnas.1818707116).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 516: &quot;The forward LED current was 900 mA.&quot; It would be more informative to report the light intensity rather than the forward current, as many readers may not be familiar with the specific light output of the used LED modules at this forward current.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the light intensity value in the revision:</p><p>“The forward LED current was 900 mA (which corresponded to the irradiance of ~2 mW mm<sup>-2</sup>)…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Lines 402-403: &quot;The NlCCR ... contains a neutral residue in the counterion position (Asp85 in BR), which is typical of all ACRs. Yet, NlCCR does not conduct anions, instead showing permeability to Na+.&quot; This is not atypical for CCRs and has been demonstrated in previous works of the authors (CtCCR in Govorunova et al. 2021, ChvCCR1 in Govorunova et al. 2022). What is unique is the absence of negatively charged residues in TM2, as noted later in the current study. However, the absence of negatively charged residues in TM2 appears to be rare for ACRs as well. Not as a strong point of criticism, but to enhance clarity, I suggest analyzing the frequency of carboxylate residues in TM2 of ACRs to determine whether the unique finding is relevant to ion selectivity or to another property.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct that some CCRs lack a carboxylate residue in the D85 position, so this feature alone cannot be considered as a differentiating criterion. However, the complete absence of glutamates in TM2 is not rare in ACRs and is found, for example, in HfACR1 and CarACR2. We have discussed this issue in our earlier review (doi: 10.3389/fncel.2021.800313) and do not think that repeating this discussion in this manuscript is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for Writing and Presentation:</bold></p><p>(1) Some figures contain incomplete or missing labels:</p><p>Figure 2: Panels D to I lack labels.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we have expanded the legend of Figure 2 to explain all individual panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 - Figure Supplement 1: Missing explanations for each panel.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we changed the order of panes and explained all individual panels in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 - Figure Supplement 1: Missing explanations for each panel.</p></disp-quote><p>No further explanation for individual panels in this Figure is needed because all panels show the action spectra of various mutants, the names of which are provided in the panels themselves.

To clarify the matter, we added a new photocurrent trace to Figure 4I in the revision recorded from AnsACR_G86E at 0 mV and pH 7.4. We have rewritten the corresponding section of Results as follows:</p><p>“Its rise and decay τ corresponded to the rise and decay τ of the fast positive current recorded from AnsACR_G86E at 0 mV and neutral pH, superimposed on the fast negative current reflecting the chromophore isomerization (Figure 4I, upper black trace). We interpret this positive current as an intramolecular proton transfer to the mutagenetically introduced primary acceptor (Glu86), which was suppressed by negative voltage (Figure 4I, lower black trace). Acidification increased the amplitude of the fast negative current ~10-fold (Figure 4I, black arrow) and shifted its V<sub>r</sub> ~100 mV to more depolarized values (Figure 4 – figure supplement 2A).
