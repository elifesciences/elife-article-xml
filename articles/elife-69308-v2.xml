Whether and <italic>how</italic> sleep deprivation modulates human brain physiology and cognition is not well understood. Here we examined how overnight sleep deprivation vs overnight sufficient sleep affects (a) cortical excitability, measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation, (b) inducibility of long-term potentiation (LTP)- and long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and (c) learning, memory, and attention. The results suggest that sleep deprivation upscales cortical excitability due to enhanced glutamate-related cortical facilitation and decreases and/or reverses GABAergic cortical inhibition. Furthermore, tDCS-induced LTP-like plasticity (anodal) abolishes while the inhibitory LTD-like plasticity (cathodal) converts to excitatory LTP-like plasticity under sleep deprivation. This is associated with increased EEG theta oscillations due to sleep pressure. Finally, we show that learning and memory formation, behavioral counterparts of plasticity, and working memory and attention, which rely on cortical excitability, are impaired during sleep deprivation. Our data indicate that upscaled brain excitability and altered plasticity, due to sleep deprivation, are associated with impaired cognitive performance. Besides showing how brain physiology and cognition undergo changes (from neurophysiology to higher-order cognition) under sleep pressure, the findings have implications for <italic>variability</italic> and optimal <italic>application</italic> of noninvasive brain stimulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep deprivation</kwd><kwd>sleep homeostasis</kwd><kwd>cortical excitability</kwd><kwd>neuroplasticity</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>non-invasive brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>transcranial direct current stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sleep-deprived brain in humans undergoes upscaled intracortical excitability which diminishes induction of LTP-like plasticity via transcranial electrical stimulation while converting the LTD-like to LTP-like plasticity and these physiological changes couple with impaired learning, memory, and attention at behavioral level.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade, a strong link has been established between sleep and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yaffe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lowe et al., 2017</xref>). Adequate sleep is critical for optimal cognitive functions across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carskadon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lo et al., 2016</xref>). Findings from experimental settings support this critical role of sleep for cognition in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyce et al., 2017</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krause et al., 2017</xref>) especially for memory consolidation and sequence learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stickgold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chouhan et al., 2021</xref>). As a ubiquitous <italic>physiological</italic> phenomenon, sleep has extensive impacts on brain physiology and especially on parameters relevant to cognition such as brain excitability and plasticity.</p><p>Previous experimental studies, mostly in nonhuman animals, linked sleep with synaptic homeostasis. Specifically, extended wakefulness (or sleep deprivation) is associated with the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP)-related molecular changes and plasticity-related genes (e.g. BDNF, CREB) in the brain, leading to saturation of synaptic potentiation in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tononi and Cirelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>). Sleep, on the other hand, desaturates synapses that have been potentiated during wakefulness in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamoto et al., 2021</xref>) resulting in a renewed capacity for encoding new information. Recent studies confirmed this sleep-dependent synaptic downscaling by showing reduced or weakened synaptic connections in the primary motor and somatosensory cortex of mice during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vivo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamoto et al., 2021</xref>). This demonstrates that sleep is required for preparing the brain for proper cognitive, motor, and physiological functioning; however, the effect of sleep on specific parameters of <italic>human</italic> brain physiology and their association with cognition and behavior remains to be further determined.</p><p>In humans, molecular mechanisms of synaptic homeostasis cannot be directly studied; however, non-invasive (indirect) markers of brain physiology can be used for studying the impact of sleep and extended wakefulness on synaptic potentiation and cortical excitability. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques are safe methods for monitoring and modifying brain functions in humans providing a means for studying the causality of brain-behavior relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>). Several NIBS techniques, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), are widely used to non-invasively monitor and induce changes in cortical excitability and neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nitsche and Paulus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>). It is shown that corticospinal excitability increases after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ly et al., 2016</xref>). This increase of brain excitability comes with a reduced inhibitory control mechanism in humans as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kreuzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Placidi et al., 2013</xref>) which can reduce the ability of the brain to induce neuroplasticity (as a result of synaptic saturation). In this line, decreased LTP has been shown in rats after sleep deprivation in both, in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), and a recent human study also showed decreased LTP-like plasticity, induced by paired associative stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The number of available studies about the impact of sleep deprivation on human brain physiology relevant for cognitive processes is limited, and knowledge is incomplete. With respect to cortical excitability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref> showed increased excitability under sleep deprivation via a global measure of corticospinal excitability, the TMS intensity needed to induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of a specific amplitude. Specific information about the cortical systems, including neurotransmitters and neuromodulators involved in these effects (e.g. glutamatergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic) is, however, missing. The level of cortical excitability affects neuroplasticity too, a relevant physiological derivate of learning and memory formation. While sleep deprivation-dependent alteration of LTP-like plasticity in humans was recently investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>), the effects of sleep deprivation on long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity, which is required for a complete picture are, however, not explored so far. In the present study, we aimed to complete the current knowledge and also monitor basic cognitive abilities that critically depend on cortical excitability (working memory and attention) and neuroplasticity (motor learning) to gain mechanistic knowledge about sleep deprivation-dependent performance decline. Finally, we aimed to explore if the impact of sleep deprivation on brain physiology and cognition differs from the effects of non-optimal time of day performance in different chronotypes, which we recently explored in a parallel study with an identical experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Salehinejad et al., 2021</xref>). The use of measures of different modalities in this study allows us to comprehensively investigate the impact of sleep deprivation on brain and cognitive functions which is largely missing in the human literature.</p><p>In addition to these primary objectives, we were interested in brain oscillatory activities which are well-established indicators of the sleep-wake cycle and can inform us about the physiological state of the sleep-deprived brain. Specifically, theta oscillations are related to sleep and cognition. Here, at least two types of theta oscillations are distinguishable: one related to cognition and information processing, which occurs during wakefulness, but also rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Puentes-Mestril et al., 2019</xref>), and one related to sleep pressure due to extended wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005</xref>). For the former, animal studies show that it is generated by the hippocampus and involves mainly the temporal lobes at the level of the neocortex. In humans, where the temporal lobes are located ventrally and thus difficult to record specifically from surface EEG, these theta rhythms with a strong regularity are observed mainly in frontal and midline cortices. The second type of theta, which is of main interest here, is of cortical origin, less regular, predominantly but not exclusively observed over frontal-midline areas and builds up with growing sleep pressure, including sleep deprivation, in both, animals and humans studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Magnuson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Snipes et al., 2022</xref>). While there is no clear and direct link between this sleep pressure-dependent theta activity and synaptic strength as suggested by some works, recent works in humans, however, linked it to an increase of cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the sleep deprivation paradigm applied in the present study, participants are kept in an extended wakefulness condition for a certain amount of time. We accordingly investigated the impact of one-night sleep deprivation, compared to one-night sufficient sleep on non-invasive parameters of human brain physiology and cognitive performance. Specifically, we monitored cortical excitability of the brain via TMS protocols that measure cortical inhibition and facilitation (i) and induced both LTP-like and LTD-like plasticity (ii). We expected increased cortical excitability (specifically enhanced glutamate-related intracortical facilitation (ICF) and decreased GABA-related intracortical inhibition), and a resultant saturated state for plasticity induction, leading to lower plasticity induction for both, LTP- and LTD-like plasticity under sleep deprivation. We furthermore examined learning and memory formation as behavioral indices of brain plasticity (iii), and working memory and attention which depend on cortical excitability (iv) along with their electrophysiological correlates. Here we expected compromised performance and lower amplitude event-related potential (ERP) components under sleep deprivation. We also assessed resting-EEG theta/alpha, as an indirect measure of homeostatic sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leemburg et al., 2010</xref>) and examined cortisol and melatonin concentration to see how these are affected under sleep conditions, given the reported mixed effects in previous studies.</p><p>To do so, we recruited 30 healthy, right-handed participants in this randomized, crossover study. All participants attended two experimental sessions after having sufficient sleep (23:00–8:00), or sleep deprivation (23:00–8:00). All physiological, behavioral, and hormonal measures were obtained in each session (see Methods for details) at a fixed time. For the neuroplasticity measures, half of the participants received anodal and the other half cathodal stimulation in a randomized, sham-controlled parallel-group design. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the detailed course of study.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The course of the experiment.</title><p>We recruited 30 young healthy participants to attend two experimental sessions in a randomized order (sufficient sleep and overnight sleep deprivation).

These MEPs were also significantly larger after sleep deprivation vs those of after sufficient sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

The sleep synaptic hypothesis proposes that synaptic strength is saturated during long awake times and restored after sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). Saturation can lead to decreased LTP-like plasticity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>).

We were also interested in determining how induction of LTD-like plasticity is affected under this brain state, which has not been investigated so far. To this end, participants received ‘anodal vs sham’ and ‘cathodal vs sham’ tDCS over the motor cortex after sufficient sleep and sleep deprivation (see Methods). We analyzed the MEPs by a mixed-model ANOVA with stimulation condition (active, sham), timepoint (seven levels), and sleep condition (normal vs deprivation) as within-subject factors and group (anodal vs cathodal) as between-subject factor.

We hypothesized an increase and decrease in intracortical facilitation and inhibition, respectively, lower neuroplasticity induction for both LTP and LTD, and compromised behavioral performance in learning, memory, and attention tasks. In line with our hypotheses and recent previous works, sleep deprivation upscaled parameters of cortical excitability, and corticospinal excitability was trendwise upscaled. This was associated with diminished induction of LTP-like plasticity under sleep pressure. The induction of LTD-like plasticity with cathodal tDCS, however, and in contrast to our initial hypothesis, was converted into LTP-like plasticity (anodal like) after sleep deprivation. These sleep deprivation-related physiological changes in the human brain provide further support for the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, according to which sleep plays a critical role in desaturating synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vivo et al., 2017</xref>) and adds important novel insights into how LTD-like plasticity is affected under sleep pressure. These physiological findings were moreover associated with compromised sequence learning, working memory, and attentional functioning and their electrophysiological correlates, which underscore the behavioral relevance of synaptic homeostasis. Finally, changes in concentration of cortisol and melatonin were minor at best, in line with recent works (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>) and cannot explain the observed effects.</p><p>Changes in cortical excitability following sleep deprivation were mostly observed in the corticocortical measures that include neurotransmitter systems involved in intracortical facilitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Lazzaro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Lazzaro et al., 2005a</xref>), and brain oscillations. Specifically, glutamate-related cortical facilitation (measured by ICF) was upscaled while GABA- and acetylcholine-related cortical inhibition (measured by SICI, I-wave, and SAI) were disinhibited or reversed after sleep deprivation. These sleep-dependent changes of cortical excitability are in line with the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis postulating that synaptic strength is increasingly potentiated during wakefulness and saturated if wakefulness is extended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tononi and Cirelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>). Animal studies have shown that at this state, molecular and electrophysiological markers of synaptic strength <italic>increase</italic> including AMPA receptors, cortical spine density, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses, and even the size and number of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tononi and Cirelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bushey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maret et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings also complement those of human studies that show an increase and decrease of ICF and inhibition, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>), as well as those animal and human studies that documented an increase of theta and beta band activity, markers of homeostatic sleep pressure, and after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finelli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leemburg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these findings argue for an upscaled state of cortical excitability mediated by the need for sleep.</p><p>Cortical excitability is a basic physiological response of cortical neurons to an input and is, therefore, a fundamental aspect of neuroplasticity and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaggioni et al., 2019</xref>). Changes in brain excitability will therefore affect neuroplasticity and cognition. We non-invasively induced LTP- and LTD-like plasticity by tDCS to investigate how a synaptic saturation state due to sleep deprivation affects the inducibility of LTP- and LTD-like plasticity. For LTP-like plasticity, the results demonstrate diminished plasticity in the motor cortex after sleep deprivation as compared to LTP-like plasticity induction after sufficient sleep. This can be explained via the synaptic strength perspective. Sleep deprivation saturates (or upscales) synaptic strength which eventually leads to deficient LTP inducibility. This is moreover in agreement with in vivo and in vitro studies in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McDermott et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>), and in line with the results of a recent human study that showed decreased LTP-like plasticity after sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>). Regarding LTD, the results show that sleep deprivation <italic>reversed</italic> the LTD-like inhibitory effect of cathodal stimulation into LTP-like excitatory effects (i.e., anodal-like). This is the first evidence for the effect of sleep deprivation on LTD-like plasticity induction in humans. Critically, this conversion of LTD-like into LTP-like plasticity is in line with a saturating effect of sleep deprivation on synaptic strength rather than cortical underactivation, which would be otherwise an alternative explanation for reduced LTP-like effects after anodal tDCS.</p><p>One mechanism that can explain the diminished LTP-like and conversion of LTD-like to LTP-like plasticity during sleep deprivation is intracellular calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is known that the directionality of plasticity (LTP or LTD) depends on the level of calcium concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lisman, 2001</xref>) with LTP and LTD being linked to higher and lower intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, respectively. There are, however, certain limit zones for induction of plasticity. In this line, anodal LTP-like plasticity is linked to largely enhanced intracellular calcium concentration in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Islam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nitsche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biabani et al., 2018</xref>), while cathodal tDCS-induced LTD-like plasticity is assumed linked to lower intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nitsche et al., 2003b</xref>). Our excitability results earlier showed a glutamate-controlled NMDA receptor facilitation during sleep deprivation, which enhances calcium influx. In this state, applying anodal tDCS, which enhances calcium concentration, can then result in abolishment of LTP induction due to calcium overflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lisman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Misonou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grundey et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, inducing LTD-like plasticity might downregulate upscaled cortical excitability at the network level and open some synaptic space for LTP-related plasticity induction. This is in line with previous studies that show calcium enhancement can convert the direction of cathodal-induced LTD-like to LTP-like plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batsikadze et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for plasticity induction.</title><p>The intracellular calcium concentration (x-axis) determines directionality of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lisman, 2001</xref>). It can be assumed that intracellular calcium concentration under no sleep pressure (sufficient sleep) is at an optimal level leading to stronger tDCS-induced LTP/LTD-like plasticity. Under sleep deprivation, LTP-like plasticity induction via anodal tDCS is prevented due to calcium overflow, and LTD-like plasticity via cathodal tDCS is converted to LTP-like plasticity possibly via (<bold>a</bold>) enhanced baseline calcium (due to upscaled excitability) which makes minor calcium increase obtained from cathodal stimulation to be sufficient to induce LTP-like plasticity and (<bold>b</bold>) gradual downregulating upscaled cortical excitability and opening some synaptic space for LTP-related plasticity induction.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-69308-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also monitored EEG oscillatory activities and found an increase of theta-band activity in the frontal-midline regions during sleep deprivation. These oscillatory activities constitute the most salient electrophysiological correlate of sleep pressure-related brain activity. There are, however, also other potentially interesting components of sleep-related theta activity and also potentially sleep deprivation-related theta activity in the human EEG. It was recently shown that synchronized theta oscillations (i.e. periodic) during sleep occur in transient bursts that are interleaved with desynchronized aperiodic network states that represent information-rich neurophysiological substrates of sleep-dependent cognition-related mechanisms, including memory formation and synaptic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helfrich et al., 2021</xref>). These aperiodic components are involved in (1) hippocampal–neocortical network interactions, (2) excitation–inhibition (E/I) balance, and (3) plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanslmayr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helfrich et al., 2021</xref>). Our main objective in this study was to analyze EEG markers of sleep pressure, and not sleep, and thus those EEG markers of sleep (e.g. hippocampus-dependent theta oscillations) along with related aperiodic components of EEG activity were beyond the scope of this study. These analyses were thus not carried out here, however, they may provide new information about functional EEG markers during sleep deprivation related to plasticity and the capacity of information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanslmayr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helfrich et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Changes in synaptic strength are the primary mechanisms mediating learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feldman, 2009</xref>). The sleep-dependent global synaptic downscaling spares neuronal assemblies crucially involved in the encoding of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Niethard and Born, 2019</xref>) which results in an improved signal-to-noise ratio and a renewed capacity for encoding new information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, a better cognitive/behavioral performance is expected after sleep, compared to sleep deprivation. In this line, our results show enhanced motor sequence learning after sufficient sleep and impaired sequence learning and retention after sleep deprivation. Similarly, we show compromised working memory and attentional functioning after sleep deprivation in line with previous findings across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Havekes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zare Khormizi et al., 2019</xref>). In support of this, we noticed specific alterations of task-dependent ERP components, such as lower amplitudes of the P300 after sleep deprivation in the sustained attention, and motor learning tasks, and suppressed N200 and N450 in the Stroop conflict condition, which measures selective attention and interference control.</p><p>To converge our findings, the potential links between the physiological parameters of the brain and behavioral tasks are noteworthy. In sequence learning, a specific link can be made between behavioral learning and plasticity results. The behavioral and electrophysiological markers of motor sequence learning and retention were associated with facilitated LTP/LTD-like plasticity in the motor cortex after sufficient sleep, which supports the suggested link between inducibility of neuroplasticity and learning and memory formation. This observation makes sense, as tDCS-induced neuroplasticity in the motor cortex and behavioral motor learning share intracortical mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stagg, 2014</xref>). For the cognitive functions measured in our study, cortical excitability alterations are more relevant. The increase of cortical excitability parameters and the resultant synaptic saturation following sleep deprivation can explain the respective cognitive performance decline. It is, however, worth noting that our study was not powered to identify these correlations with sufficient reliability and future studies that are powered for this aim are needed.</p><p>Our findings have several implications. First, they show that sleep and circadian preference (i.e. chronotype) have functionally different impacts on human brain physiology and cognition. The same parameters of brain physiology and cognition were recently investigated at circadian optimal vs non-optimal time of day in two groups of early and late chronotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Salehinejad et al., 2021</xref>). While we found decreased cortical facilitation and lower neuroplasticity induction (same for both LTP and LTD) at the circadian nonpreferred time in that study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Salehinejad et al., 2021</xref>), here we observed upscaled cortical excitability and a functionally different pattern of neuroplasticity alteration (i.e. diminished LTP-like plasticity induction and conversion of LTD- to LTP-like plasticity). Second, the results of the present study underscore the importance of sufficient sleep for adaptive and efficient performance (e.g. in working or educational environments) specifically in individuals with demanding jobs. Third, the relevance of sleep for brain plasticity and optimal cortical excitability argues for the role of sufficient sleep in preventing disorders that are associated with cognitive and/or plasticity deficits, such as Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ju et al., 2014</xref>) and major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wolf et al., 2016</xref>) that constitute a growing public health concern. Aging, which is associated with cognitive decline, is another critical period of life that is associated with sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the findings of cortical excitability and neuroplasticity results have implications for the variability of NIBS, especially TMS and tDCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Polanía et al., 2018</xref>). Controlling for sleep pressure should be considered in basic and applied studies that use NIBS. Finally, modulating sleep via therapeutic sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wolf et al., 2016</xref>) or NIBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Romanella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herrero Babiloni et al., 2021</xref>) and thereby affecting plasticity and cognitive parameters seems a promising yet understudied field for the future.</p><p>There are several points to be considered for interpreting the results. First, timing of the experimental measurements should be taken into account. Although we strictly controlled for external and environmental factors that could affect cortical excitability, especially in the sleep-wake cycle, the measurement time of cognitive functions, cortical excitability monitoring, and neuroplasticity induction differed by a few hours (24, 26, 27 hr sleep deprivation, respectively). By fixing the specific time for conduction of the single protocols, we, however, controlled for potential confounding effects of different measurement times <italic>within</italic> a specific protocol. Nevertheless, for the between-protocol comparisons, this procedure could have gradually affected subjective sleepiness and probably brain physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuhn et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the physiological measures were based on the motor system and indirect measures of the involved neurotransmitters, and the cognitive tasks under study are more closely related to prefrontal regions, with the exception of the motor learning task. Third, the power spectral analysis was analyzed with a ‘band ratio’ approach in which each frequency band is analyzed based on periodic, or oscillatory, activity. However, the EEG signal reflects at least some aperiodic components (e.g. power spectrum density; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>) that were not taken into account, as the focus of our study was on sleep pressure which refers to periodic activity. Considering aperiodic EEG signals could, however, be relevant for physiological interpretations of sleep-related data in future studies. Finally, sleep consists of different stages including REM, non-REM, slow-wave sleep, and spindles that can have different impacts on plasticity which are not taken into account in our data.</p><p>In conclusion, this experiment provides further evidence in humans supportive of the sleep homeostasis hypothesis. General information of upscaled brain excitability, as shown in previous works, was complemented by evidence that shows alterations in specific parameters of cortical excitability (e.g. increased facilitation, decreased and/or converted inhibition). The saturated state for inducing LTP-like plasticity aligns with the increased synaptic strength after sleep deprivation. The results of the present study also provide first evidence for LTD-like plasticity being converted into LTP under sleep pressure in the human brain, in conceptual accordance with an hyperexcitable state under sleep deprivation. These findings complement current knowledge about the critical role of sleep for neuroplasticity and cognition in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty healthy adult volunteers (15 females, mean age=24.44 ± 3.93) who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from the TU Dortmund University, Ruhr-University Bochum, and the surrounding community. Power analysis showed that for a medium effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Minarik et al., 2016</xref>; <italic>f</italic>=0.35 equivalent to partial eta squared=0.10), a minimum of 30 subjects are required to achieve 95% power at an alpha of 0.05 for the primary applied statistical test. All participants were right-handed non-smokers, with a regular sleep-wake pattern (determined by sleep diary) and underwent a medical screening to verify no history of neurological diseases, epilepsy or seizures, central nervous system-acting medication, metal implants, and current pregnancy. As gender and age may affect the sleep-wake cycle and brain excitability, we balanced participants’ gender and kept the age range to early adulthood. Each participant took part in a test TMS session to become acquainted with experiencing stimulation and the study protocol. Female subjects were not examined during the menstrual period to ensure hormonal changes would not interfere with the measurements. This study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (ethics code: 99). Participants gave informed consent and received monetary compensation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Study design and course of study</title><p>This was a randomized, sham-controlled, crossover study. Participants completed a sleep diary 2 weeks before the beginning of the experiment and attended two experimental sessions after having ‘sufficient sleep (23:00-8:00)’ and ‘sleep deprivation (23:00-8:00)’ overnight in counterbalanced order. The experimental sessions took place at a fixed time in the morning (9:00 AM). The interval between the sessions was at least 2 weeks. In each session, participants underwent the same experimental protocol. Each experimental session began with saliva sampling at 8:45 AM, followed by behavioral and cognitive task performance during EEG recording (1.5 hr), followed by cortical excitability monitoring sessions (1 hr), and finally followed by neuroplasticity induction with active and sham tDCS (1.5 hr). The reason for starting the session with behavioral/EEG measures was to take advantage of 1 hr between 8 and 9 AM for preparing the EEG cap, which took about 45 min on average. The order of measurements (behavioral/EEG, cortical excitability, tDCS) was identical across participants, to keep the start time of each measurement and the number of hours deprived from sleep fixed for each measure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sleep conditions</title><p>In the ‘sufficient sleep’ condition, participants had to go to bed in their home environment at around 23:00 and have at least 8 hr of uninterrupted sleep. This was to prevent potential poor sleep in a new environment (i.e. the laboratory). The experiment was scheduled to start at 9:00 AM. Participants were refrained from drinking alcohol and coffee 12 hr before sleep time and afterward until the end of the session. In the case of poor sleep quality for any reason (measured by sleepiness rating scales) or unregular sleep pattern (sleep onset, wake-up time) informed by the sleep diary (more than ±2.5 hr deviation from the scheduled time frames), the respective session was canceled and postponed until sufficient sleep condition requirements were met. In the ‘sleep deprivation’ condition, participants spent the night in a specific lounge at the local institute where the data was collected. The lounge was equipped with an unrecording live camera and prepared for participants’ stay overnight. Participants spent all night awake in the lounge (23:00–8:00) and were supervised by a scientific staff member. Additionally, their sleep-waking status was recorded via a wrist-worn Actigraphy (MotionWatch 8.0, CamTech, Cambridge, UK). Food and drinks were provided (the consumption of coffee, caffeine-containing soft drinks, black tea, and alcohol was not allowed), watching TV programs, reading, and working on the computer were also allowed. Participants were prevented from any sleep-related activities during the night, such as lying down, or closing their eyes for a prolonged time. They were refrained from drinking caffeine-containing drinks and sleeping or taking a nap from the afternoon before they joined the sleep deprivation session at 23:00. Before starting each experimental session, subjective sleepiness of participants and their alertness was evaluated with KSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerstedt and Gillberg, 1990</xref>) and SSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoddes et al., 1972</xref>).

First, the hotspot (the coil position over the primary motor area that produces the largest MEP in the right ADM with a given medium TMS intensity) was identified with TMS and marked with a water-proof pen. The stimulation intensity was then adjusted to evoke MEPs with a peak-to-peak amplitude of an average of 1 mV. Following this step, RMT and AMT were obtained.

The hotspot region was already identified and marked in the cortical excitability part. Stimulation intensity was adjusted to reach a peak-to-peak MEP amplitude of 1 mV (SI1mV), which was then used for the remaining measurements. Following a baseline measurement of 25 MEPs, 7 min of active (anodal or cathodal, depending on group assignment) or sham stimulation was delivered. Right after, MEP measurements were conducted immediately in epochs of every 5 min for up to 30 min after tDCS (seven total epochs). About 5 min after the last MEP measurement (30 min following tDCS), the second tDCS intervention (active or sham) started with the same experimental procedure. Based on the previous works, this tDCS protocol induces polarity-specific short aftereffects up to 30 min after stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nitsche and Paulus, 2001</xref>), and thus applying the second intervention after 30 min is feasible.

The electrodes were connected to the head using high-viscosity electrolyte gel (SuperVisc, Easycap, Herrsching, Germany). All impedances were kept below 10 kΩ throughout the experimental sessions. EEG data were collected in a shielded room, and no spectral peaks at 50 Hz were observed. Raw EEG data were recorded and stored for offline analysis using BrainVision Analyzer 2.1 (Brain Products GmbH, München, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>EEG data analysis</title><p>EEG recordings were band-pass filtered offline between 1 and 30 Hz (48 dB/Octave) and re-referenced to an average reference. The VEOG and HEOG signals were used to correct for eye movement artifacts in ERP recordings using the Gratton and Coles method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gratton et al., 1983</xref>) embedded in the BrainVision Analyzer 2.1. EEG data were then time-locked to the stimulus of interest onset in each task. Epochs started 100 ms before stimulus onset and ended 700 ms after stimulus onset in the SRTT, 100 ms before the target onset and ended 1000 ms after target onset in the three-back and AX-CPT tasks, and 100 ms before stimulus onset and ended 1000 ms after stimulus onset in the Stroop task (both congruent and incongruent trials). Epochs were baseline-corrected using a –100 to 0 ms time window. Artifacts were identified using a combination of automated (artifacts greater than 100 µV peak-to-peak) and manual selection processes. Segments were removed based on this automatic selection, and visual inspection to identify artifacts due to sources of non‐neurogenic activity. The remaining epochs were averaged for calculating the average ERP. Average ERP of blocks 5, 6, 7 in the SRTT task was based on 120 trials per block. In the N-back and AX-CPT tasks, average ERP of hits (correct response) was based on 40 and 96 trials, respectively. In the Stroop task, the average ERP of congruent and incongruent trials was based on 40 and 120 trials, respectively. For the analyses, the following averaged components were investigated: (1) the P300 at electrodes Pz, Cz, and P3 within a time window of 300–600 ms after stimulus onset in the SRTT learning blocks (block 5, 6, 7), (2) the P300 at electrodes Fz and Cz within a time window of 300–600 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Picton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kok, 2001</xref>) after target stimulus onset in the three-back task, (3) the N200 and N450 at electrodes Fz and Cz within time windows of 200–300 ms and 400–550 ms, respectively after congruent and incongruent trials onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feroz et al., 2017</xref>) in the Stroop task, and (4) the P300 at electrodes Fz and Cz within a time window of 300–600 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Picton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tekok-Kilic et al., 2001</xref>) after target onset (when target letter X was preceded by cue A) in the AX-CPT task. The time windows were selected based on previous studies and designated as the maximum positive or negative deflection occurring at the post-stimulus latency window. A fast Fourier transform analysis (Hanning window length: 10%) was performed on the epochs to obtain spectral power levels in the beta (13–30 Hz), alpha (7–13 Hz), theta (4–7 Hz) ,and delta (1–4 Hz) range.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary statistical procedures were repeated measure mixed model and/or within-subject ANOVA. Post hoc tests were conducted conditional on significant results of the ANOVAs. The data analyses were conducted independently for each dataset, and corrections for multiple comparisons were performed separately for each analysis.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Cortical excitability</title><p>For the TMS protocols with a double-pulse condition (i.e. SICI-ICF, I-wave facilitation, SAI), the resulting mean values were normalized to the respective single-pulse condition. First, mean values were calculated individually and then inter-individual means were calculated for each condition. For the I-O curves, absolute MEP values were used. To test for statistical significance, repeated measures ANOVAs were performed with ISIs, TMS intensity (in I-O curve only), and condition (sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation) as within-subject factors and MEP amplitude as the dependent variable. In case of significant results of the ANOVA, <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons were performed using Bonferroni-corrected t-tests to compare mean MEP amplitudes of each condition against the baseline MEP and to contrast sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Neuroplasticity</title><p>The mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the 25 MEPs obtained for each timepoint (BL, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 min after tDCS) was calculated and averaged for active and sham tDCS in the sufficient sleep and sleep deprivation conditions. To determine if individual baseline measures differed within and between sessions, SI1mV and Baseline MEP were entered as dependent variables in a mixed-model ANOVA with session (four levels) and condition (sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation) as within-subject factors, and group (anodal vs cathodal) as between-subject factor. The mean MEP amplitude for each measurement timepoint was normalized to the session’s baseline (individual quotient of the mean from the baseline mean) resulting in values representing either increased (&gt;1.0) or decreased (&lt;1.0) excitability. Individual averages of the normalized MEP from each timepoint were then calculated and entered as dependent variables in a mixed-model ANOVA with repeated measures with stimulation condition (active, sham), timepoint (eight levels), and sleep condition (normal vs deprivation) as within-subject factors and group (anodal vs cathodal) as between-subject factor. In case of significant ANOVA results, <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons of MEP amplitudes at each time point were performed using Bonferroni-corrected t-tests to examine if active stimulation resulted in a significant difference relative to sham (comparison 1), baseline (comparison 2), the respective stimulation condition at sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation (comparison 3), and the between-group comparisons at respective timepoints (comparison 4).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Behavioral task performance</title><p>Means of RT, RT variability, and accuracy for SRTT blocks 5, 6, and 7 were calculated. Trials with wrong responses, as well as those with RTs of less than 150 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins and Long, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mella et al., 2015</xref>) or more than 3000 ms, and trials that are deviated by three standard deviations or more from the average individual response time, were discarded. The mean RT, RT variability, and accuracy of blocks were entered as dependent variables in repeated measures ANOVAs with block (5 vs 6, 6 vs 7) and condition (sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation) as within-subject factors. Because the RT differences between blocks 5 vs 6 and 6 vs 7 were those of major interest, <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons were performed on RT differences between these blocks using paired-sample t-tests (two-tailed, p&lt;0.05) without correction for multiple comparisons. For three-back, Stroop, and AX-CPT tasks, mean and standard deviation of RT and accuracy were calculated and entered as dependent variables in repeated measures ANOVAs with sleep condition (sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation) as the within-subject factor. For significant ANOVA results, <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons of dependent variables were performed using paired-sample t-tests (two-tailed, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) without correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Correlational analyses</title><p>To assess the relationship between induced neuroplasticity and motor sequence learning, and the relationship between cortical excitability and cognitive task performance we used bivariate linear regression analysis (Pearson’s correlation, two-tailed). For the first correlation, we used individual grand-averaged MEP amplitudes obtained from anodal and cathodal tDCS pooled for the timepoints between 0 and 20 min after interventions, and individual motor learning performance (i.e. BL6-5 and BL6-7 RT difference) across sleep conditions. For the second correlation, we used individual grand-averaged MEP amplitudes obtained from each TMS protocol and individual accuracy/RT obtained from each task across sleep conditions. No correction for multiple comparisons was done for correlational analyses as these were secondary exploratory analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Electroencephalogram</title><p>EEG data preprocessing and analysis were described in the previous section. For the resting-state data, brain oscillations at mid-central electrodes (Fz, Cz, F3, F4) were analyzed with a 4×2 ANOVA with location (Fz, Cz, F3, F4) and sleep condition (sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation) as the within-subject factors. For all tasks, individual ERP means were grand-averaged and entered as dependent variables in repeated measures ANOVAs with sleep condition (sufficient sleep vs sleep deprivation) as the within-subject factor. <italic>Post hoc</italic> comparisons of grand-averaged amplitudes were performed using paired-sample t-tests (two-tailed, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) without correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is a member of the Scientific Advisory Boards of Neuroelectrics and NeuroDevice</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the Institutional Review Board (ethics code: 99).

Conversely, lower accurate response during sleep deprivation was negatively correlated with converted intracortical inhibition to facilitation (i.e. larger MEP amplitude) measured by SAI at ISI of 40 ms (<italic>r</italic>=–0.386, p=0.035). This indicates that upscaled cortical facilitation was associated with poor working memory performance.</p><p>No correlation was observed between Stroop task outcome measures and cortical excitability measures. For AX-CPT task performance, there was only a significant <italic>negative</italic> correlation between enhanced performance accuracy after sufficient sleep and reduced intracortical inhibition (measured by averaged MEPs of SICI) at the same time (<italic>r</italic>=–0.372, p=0.043). This indicates that improved task performance (i.e. higher accuracy) were associated with decreased intracortical inhibition after having sufficient sleep. In the sleep deprivation condition, lower performance accuracy and negatively correlated with higher corticospinal excitability (i.e. enhanced MEP at 150% of RMT intensity; <italic>r</italic>=–0.429, p=0.018).</p></sec></sec></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69308.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dresler</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05wg1m734</institution-id><institution>Radboud University Medical Centre</institution></institution-wrap><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" link-type="continued-by" object-id="10.1101/2021.04.28.441823" object-id-type="id" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.28.441823"/></front-stub><body><p>This paper provides a comprehensive investigation into the neural effects of sleep deprivation in humans across a broad range of methods and, using non–invasive brain stimulation as well as electrophysiological markers and behavioral measures, the study demonstrates that sleep deprivation results in higher cortical excitability, which may explain the negative impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69308.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Dresler</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05wg1m734</institution-id><institution>Radboud University Medical Centre</institution></institution-wrap><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.28.441823">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.28.441823v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Or more generally spoken, the authors tested a quite well refined model of cortical excitability/net synaptic strength and inducibility of LTP– and LTD–like plasticity after sleep deprivation and the relation to parameters of cognition.

While a comprehensive comparison and data integration across the different measures will likely not be possible with the current sample size, and the study can thus be viewed as a parallel investigation of different research questions within the same sample, please revisit the other core points of the previous editorial letter:</p><p>Theta: the association between theta and synaptic strength remains unclear. The manuscript now makes this link less explicitly, however, would profit from a more dedicated attempt to clarify potential differences in the human vs. animal literature; the topographic origin of the observed theta findings (previous presentation suggested a stronger occipital rather than midfrontal effects as might be expected from the human literature); and the potential oscillatory nature of the findings (periodic vs. aperiodic).</p><p>Multiple comparisons correction: please state more explicitly how correction for multiple comparisons was performed, i.e. within or across analyses.</p><p>Data availability: data on the corresponding OSF site does not seem to include raw EEG data.

Because the methods section comes at the end, these methodological details were not clarified already in the introduction. In brief, we analyzed data of each measure with a separate statistical analysis in line with our previous work with the same number of measures (Salehinejad et al., 2021, <italic>Nature Communications</italic>), which enables comparability between study results. Changing the approach would have made comparisons difficult. Moreover, the different parameters we tested were delivering information about different entities, i.e. these were informative in their own right, which in our opinion would make it tricky to put them all under one overarching hypothesis as precondition for correction for multiple comparisons overall conditions explored in the study. Finally, this strategy would end up in a situation where “small” studies testing only one or two parameters would much more likely result in significant results as compared to studies with multiple parameters, as done here, in case of identical numerical results, which would also not be helpful, and make comparisons between different study designs extremely problematic. For each dependent variable, mixed factorial or within-subjects ANOVAs were employed. And for each major analysis, correction for multiple comparisons was applied. We clarified this in detail in the methods section. Please see pages 32-34.</p><p>Methods pages 32-34:</p><p>“For the TMS protocols with a double-pulse condition (i.e., SICI-ICF, I-wave facilitation, SAI), the resulting mean values were normalized to the respective single-pulse condition.

However, on page 10 in the Results section, I still do not understand if there are parallel gropus or repeated measures or a combination of it.</p></disp-quote><p>For analysis of neuroplasticity data (on page 10) we had a parallel-group design and used a mixed factorial ANOVA with repeated measures (thus the combination of both) with sleep condition (normal vs deprivation) and timepoint as the within-subject factors and group (anodal vs cathodal) as between-subject factor. The respective analysis was thus a mixed-model ANOVA. This was clarified in the methods section and now also in the Results section. We also clarified this in the figure 1 legend in the introduction. Please see the response to the previous comment, second paragraph. We also added more details about the design in the introduction:</p><p>Revised text, Page 6:</p><p>“To do so, we recruited 30 healthy, right-handed participants in this randomized, cross-over study. All participants attended two experimental sessions after having sufficient sleep [23:00-8:00], or sleep deprivation [23:00-8:00]. All physiological, behavioral, and hormonal measures were obtained in each session (see Methods for details) at a fixed time. For the neuroplasticity measures, half of the participants received anodal and the other half cathodal stimulation in a randomized, sham-controlled parallel-group design. Figure 1 shows the detailed course of study. “</p><p>Revised text, Page 10:</p><p>“We analyzed the MEPs by a mixed-model ANOVA with stimulation condition (active, sham), time-point (7 levels), and sleep condition (normal vs deprivation) as within-subject factors and group (anodal vs cathodal) as between-subject factor.

We need to clarify that our study was not sufficiently powered for a correlational design, and thus calculated correlations as a secondary aim of this work. We ran exploratory correlations between different measures to identify associations to be explored in detail with a larger sample size in future studies. We think that exploring associations with correlations in this exploratory approach makes sense content wise. Calculation of regressions would involve a couple of predictors, and thus be aimed to deliver statements about the relative contribution of single predictors, which might be even more problematic with the current sample. We added a respective statement to the results.</p><p>Revised text, page 10:</p><p>“Although our study was not sufficiently powered for conducting correlational analyses between measures as primary outcome, we ran exploratory correlation analyses to identify associations between physiologically and cognitive parameters which are conceptually related, including measures of plasticity and motor learning on the one hand, and parameters of cortical excitability and working. memory/attention on the other. Several relevant correlations between motor learning <italic>and</italic> plasticity, as well as working memory/attention <italic>and</italic> excitability indices were identified. LTP-like plasticity effects after sufficient sleep were correlated with better sequence learning acquisition (<italic>r</italic>=-0.558, <italic>p</italic>=0.031) and retention (<italic>r</italic>=-0.734, <italic>p</italic>=0.002). Enhanced working memory and sustained attention after sufficient sleep were also correlated with higher cortical facilitation and lower cortical inhibition (supplementary materials).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>– I would expect that the beginning of the introduction more clearly relates to the tested model/hypotheses, that is provides the context, and not only lists findings (e.g., our findings provide further support for the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis…; or, in line with our initial hypothesis…); moreover, I would expect that the beginning of the introduction more clearly provides information about what represents a replication of prior work, an extension or a novel contribution to the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions.

We rephrased the whole concluding paragraph. Please see below:</p><p>Revised text p. 24:</p><p>“In conclusion, this experiment provides further evidence in humans supportive of the sleep homeostasis hypothesis. General information of upscaled brain excitability, as shown in previous works, was complemented by evidence that shows alterations in specific parameters of cortical excitability (e.g., increased facilitation, decreased and/or converted inhibition). The saturated state with respect to the inducibility of LTP-like plasticity aligns with the increased synaptic strength after sleep deprivation. The results of the present study also provide first evidence for LTD-like plasticity being converted into LTP under sleep pressure in the human brain, in conceptual accordance with an hyperexcitable state under sleep deprivation. These findings complement current knowledge about the critical role of sleep for neuroplasticity and cognition in humans.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>– Participants: Please provide information about potential substance use (including smoking).</p></disp-quote><p>We only included non-smokers and clarified this in the participants' section.

While a comprehensive comparison and data integration across the different measures will likely not be possible with the current sample size, and the study can thus be viewed as a parallel investigation of different research questions within the same sample, please revisit the other core points of the previous editorial letter:</p><p>Theta: the association between theta and synaptic strength remains unclear. The manuscript now makes this link less explicitly, however, would profit from a more dedicated attempt to clarify potential differences in the human vs. animal literature; the topographic origin of the observed theta findings (previous presentation suggested a stronger occipital rather than midfrontal effects as might be expected from the human literature); and the potential oscillatory nature of the findings (periodic vs. aperiodic).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for making this point. To properly address these core points, we added a new paragraph to the introduction (pages 4-5). In this revision we clarify that the theta oscillations were related most probably to sleep pressure rather than plasticity, and we distinguish between two types of theta, of which only sleep pressure related theta was our oscillatory activity of interest. For the topographic origin, our <italic>focus</italic> was rather on the midfrontal theta as it is closely associated with sleep pressure (Brown et al., 2012; Kuhn et al., 2016; Magnuson et al., 2022). Also, it is known that during sleep deprivation, α rhythms appear in posterior cortical recordings whilst theta rhythms increase in frontal cortical regions (Brown et al., 2012). The previous presentation (which is not included in the revision anymore, and thus in our opinion an extended discussion about the dominant topography might not be required) was showing the same pattern (i.e., stronger α and β rhythms in the posterior regions, while enhanced prefrontal theta). Please see pages 4-5. Revised text, pages 4-5 (introduction): In addition to these primary objectives, we were interested in brain oscillatory activities which are well-established indicators of the sleep-wake cycle and inform about the physiological state of the sleep-deprived brain. Specifically, theta oscillations are related to sleep and cognition. Here, at least two types of theta oscillations are distinguishable: one related to cognition and information processing, which occurs during wakefulness, but also REM sleep (Brown et al., 2012; Puentes-Mestril et al., 2019), and one related to sleep pressure due to extended wakefulness (Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005). For the former, animal studies show that it is generated by the hippocampus and involves mainly the temporal lobes at the level of the neocortex. In humans, where the temporal lobes are located ventrally, and thus difficult to record specifically from surface EEG, these theta rhythms with a strong regularity are observed mainly in frontal and midline cortices. The second type of theta, which is of main interest here, is of cortical origin, less regular, predominantly, but not exclusively observed over frontal-midline areas, and builds up with growing sleep pressure, including sleep deprivation, in both, animals and humans studies (Brown et al., 2012; Finelli et al., 2000; Magnuson et al., 2022; Snipes et al., 2022; Vyazovskiy and Tobler, 2005). While there is no clear and direct link between this sleep pressure-dependent theta activity and synaptic strength as suggested by some works, recent works in humans however linked it to an increase of cortical excitability (Kuhn et al., 2016). We addressed the functional implications of these findings also in the discussion. Please see page 23.</p><p>Revised text, page 23 (discussion).</p><p>“We also monitored EEG oscillatory activities and found an increase of theta-band activity in the frontal-midline regions during sleep deprivation. […] These analyses were thus not carried out here, however, they may provide new information about functional EEG markers during sleep deprivation related to plasticity and the capacity of information processing (Hanslmayr et al., 2016; Helfrich et al., 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Multiple comparisons correction: please state more explicitly how correction for multiple comparisons was performed, i.e. within or across analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment.
