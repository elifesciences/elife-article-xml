nucleoplasm and are finally exported into the cytoplasm. The AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Rea1 participates in the nucleolar exit by releasing the Ytm1–Erb1 heterodimer from the evolving pre-60S particle. Here, we show that the DEAD-box RNA helicase Spb4 with its interacting partner Rrp17 is further integrated into this maturation event. Spb4 binds to a specific class of late nucleolar pre-60S intermediates, whose cryo-EM structure revealed how its helicase activity facilitates melting and restructuring of 25S rRNA helices H62 and H63/H63a prior to Ytm1–Erb1 release. In vitro maturation of such Spb4-enriched pre-60S particles, incubated with purified Rea1 and its associated pentameric Rix1-complex in the presence of ATP, combined with cryo-EM analysis depicted the details of the Rea1-dependent large-scale pre-ribosomal remodeling. Our structural insights unveil how the Rea1 ATPase and Spb4 helicase remodel late nucleolar pre-60S particles by rRNA restructuring and dismantling of a network of several ribosomal assembly factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>RNA helicases</kwd><kwd>AAA-ATPases</kwd><kwd>RNA restructuring</kwd><kwd>Spb4</kwd><kwd>Rea1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>885711-Human-Ribogenesis</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beckmann</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HU363/15-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurt</surname><given-names>Ed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADG 741781 GLOWSOME</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hurt</surname><given-names>Ed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA helicase Spb4 restructures rRNA helices H62/H63 and primes pre-ribosomal 60S intermediates for large-scale remodelling by the AAA-ATPase Rea1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic ribosomes consist of a small (40S) and a large (60S) subunit that are comprised of four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and 79–80 ribosomal proteins. While the yeast 40S subunit contains the 18S rRNA and 33 ribosomal proteins, the 60S subunit contains the 5S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNA species and 46 ribosomal proteins. The two ribosomal subunits are assembled in a complex highly regulated and hierarchical biogenesis process that starts in the nucleolus by transcription of a common precursor RNA (the 35S pre-rRNA) and the co-transcriptional association of the first ribosomal proteins and assembly factors. Upon endonucleolytic cleavage within the internal RNA spacer element 1 (ITS1), the pre-40S and pre-60S subunits follow separate biogenesis routes in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and finally cytoplasm. For reviews on ribosome biogenesis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baßler and Hurt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de la Cruz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klinge and Woolford, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kressler et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>The precursors of the large ribosomal subunit undergo a cascade of consecutive rRNA folding steps in which the initially flexible six intertwined 25S rRNA domains (named in the 5’ to 3’ direction as domains I to VI) get integrated into the developing 60S core. While in the earliest precursors the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA is highly flexible, the proportion of stably folded rRNA domains is strongly increased in succeeding 27SB pre-rRNA containing precursor particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burlacu et al., 2017</xref>). In line with chemical probing data, cryo-EM structures revealed that shaping of the immature rRNA occurs in a hierarchical order, in which first the 25S rRNA domains I, II, and parts of domain VI, together with the 5.8S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), adopt a folded conformation and form the solvent-exposed back side of the pre-60S particle (structural states 1/A and 2/B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kater et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanghai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2019b</xref>). Subsequent compaction of large parts of domains III, IV, and V results in formation of the polypeptide exit tunnel (PET) in state C to E particles. Transition of the 60S precursors to the nucleoplasm goes along with a re-positioning of the L1 stalk (helices H75-H78 of 25S rRNA domain V) allowing restructuring and incorporation of large parts of domain V and formation of the central-protuberance (CP) (state F/Nog2 particles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). As part of the CP, the 5S rRNA, which is transcribed independently from the other rRNA species and flexibly assembled at an earlier maturation stage, becomes stably integrated and structurally visible at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leidig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Upon subsequent removal of ITS2 and rotational movement of the 5S rRNA into its nearly mature orientation, the pre-60S intermediates are exported to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gasse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schuller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thoms et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2019a</xref>). Here, final structuring of the inter-subunit side (ISS) and the peptidyl-transferase centre (PTC) completes 60S maturation and permits entrance of the assembled subunit to the pool of actively translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kargas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malyutin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>The accurate and efficient rRNA maturation and ribosome assembly requires ca. 80 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and at least 200 non-ribosomal assembly factors. Among these assembly factors are a variety of energy consuming enzymes such as AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and RNA helicases that facilitate key RNA and protein remodelling events on nascent ribosomal intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>). The activity of the dynein-related AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Rea1 is required for two separate ATP-hydrolysis-dependent pre-60S maturation steps. In the earlier step, Rea1 releases assembly factor Ytm1 and its binding partner Erb1 from late nucleolar pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thoms et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wegrecki et al., 2015</xref>). In a second maturation step, which goes along with CP formation in the nucleoplasm, Rea1 dislodges assembly factor Rsa4 and thereby primes the 60S precursors for their export to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>). The interaction of Rea1 with Ytm1 and Rsa4 is established between a metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) at the C-terminal tip of the Rea1 tail and the ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains of its assembly factor ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mickolajczyk et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ulbrich et al., 2009</xref>). We previously revealed the architecture of Rea1 and its associated pentameric Rix1-complex, which serves as docking platform for the ATPase on nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>). Upon pre-60S association, a highly conserved loop motif within the Rea1 MIDAS facilitates the attachment of the C-terminal MIDAS onto the N-terminal AAA<sup>+</sup> ring domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sosnowski et al., 2018</xref>). This intramolecular MIDAS docking may enable a direct force-transmission upon ATP hydrolysis from the AAA<sup>+</sup> domain onto the MIDAS to dislodge the MIDAS-bound Rsa4 ligand. While there is no direct evidence that the Rix1-complex recruits Rea1 also to nucleolar 60S precursors, inhibition of Ytm1 release resulted in a shift of otherwise nucleoplasmic Rix1 particles to a nucleolar stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests a function of the Rix1-complex for mediating Rea1 remodeling of its nucleolar substrate particles as well.</p><p>Around 20 RNA helicases involved in ribosome biogenesis have been identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Granneman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitterer and Pertschy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rodríguez-Galán et al., 2013</xref>). While it is suggested that these ATP-dependent enzymes promote crucial ribosomal restructuring steps including rRNA folding/re-arrangement or disassembly of snoRNAs, a precise molecular function was described only for very few RNA helicases. The DEAD-box helicase Spb4 is essential for cell viability and 60S assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Cruz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Gómez et al., 2011</xref>). Spb4 exhibits RNA-stimulated ATPase activity in vitro, which is abolished by a point mutation within the catalytic DEAD (Walker B) helicase motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüning et al., 2018</xref>). Upon its depletion and in <italic>spb4</italic> catalytic mutant backgrounds, processing of the 27SB pre-rRNA on pre-60S particles was blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Cruz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García-Gómez et al., 2011</xref>). In line with this, depletion of Spb4 impaired the recruitment of the late B-factor Nog2, which is necessary for subsequent 27SB processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Talkish et al., 2012</xref>). A low-resolution cryo-EM density and CRAC (UV-crosslinking and cDNA analysis) experiments suggested that Spb4 binds to pre-60S intermediates at a hinge region at the base of eukaryote-specific expansion segment 27 (ES27) within 25S rRNA domain IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kater et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanghai et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite the proposed pre-60S location, the function of Spb4 on these intermediates and its rRNA restructuring substrate remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we report an essential function of the RNA helicase Spb4 and its interaction partner Rrp17 for the maturation of late nucleolar pre-60S particles. Spb4 and Rrp17 bind to such intermediates directly prior to their transition to the nucleoplasm, which is mediated by the Rea1 AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Consistent with a most recently published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>), our cryo-EM structure of Spb4 bound to pre-60S particles suggests how the helicase facilitates restructuring of its substrate rRNA before it can later fold into its mature-like conformation. Furthermore, the association of Spb4 with 60S precursors is required to allow the Rea1-dependent release of the Ytm1–Erb1 subcomplex. By coupling an in vitro maturation assay with isolated pre-60S particles to cryo-EM analyses, we could recapitulate this major structural transition during removal and destabilization of a large set of assembly factors, which promotes the nucleolar exit of 60S precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spb4 and Rrp17 are enriched on late nucleolar pre-60S particles</title><p>During the transition from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm, precursors of the 60S subunit undergo substantial changes regarding the rRNA folding status and concomitant association and dissociation of several assembly factors. Our previous cryo-EM analysis of a late nucleolar pre-60S particle (state E) purified via the dominant-lethal Ytm1 E80A mutant (this mutation impairs the Rea1-dependent release of the Ytm1–Erb1 subcomplex) revealed a low-resolution density for the DEAD-box RNA helicase Spb4 at the inter-subunit side, which was not present on earlier (states A–C) or later pre-60S maturation stages (states NE1, NE2, F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kater et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Spb4 was enriched on pre-60S particles isolated via Ytm1 E80A but not via wild-type Ytm1, whereas earlier nucleolar assembly factors (e.g. Noc1, Rrp5, Drs1) already dissociated at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kater et al., 2017</xref>). Besides Spb4, another assembly factor, Rrp17, was accumulated on these Ytm1 E80A particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating that both, Spb4 and Rrp17, have a function during late steps of nucleolar pre-60S maturation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spb4 and Rrp17 bind to late nucleolar 60S precursors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spb4 and Rrp17 are enriched on Ytm1 E80A particles.

Subsequent affinity purifications of the helicase mutants and the C-terminal Spb4 truncations, all tagged with Flag-TEV-protein A (FTpA), showed that they still co-purify pre-ribosomal particles, however, somewhat less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This indicates an essential pre-60S targeting function of the C-terminal domain (CTD), which was recently described also for DDX55, the human homologue of Spb4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhury et al., 2021</xref>), whereas another recent study on yeast Spb4 suggested that not the entire CTD is strictly required for pre-60S assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that the Spb4 function on nascent 60S pre-ribosomes depends on both the catalytic and C-terminal domain.</p><p>In contrast to the tested <italic>spb4</italic> mutants, affinity purifications via wild-type Spb4 co-enriched a pattern of assembly factors highly similar to Ytm1 E80A particles (state E) and contained large amounts of Rrp17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left panel). Vice versa, Rrp17-FTpA affinity purifications co-enriched pre-60S particles with a comparable assembly factor composition and Spb4 but in contrast to Spb4 purifications also a few downstream nucleoplasmic assembly factors like Nog2, Rsa4, and the ITS2 foot-factor Nop53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right panel). Based on these affinity purifications, we conclude that both, Spb4 and Rrp17, join the maturation pathway around nucleolar state E. While Spb4 subsequently dissociates during or shortly after release of Ytm1–Erb1 by Rea1, Rrp17 may remain associated on downstream intermediates upon Nop53 association (Nop53 binds pre-60S particles at state NE1 upon Ytm1–Erb1 removal).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Depletion of Spb4 and Rrp17 arrests pre-60S maturation at a stage directly before nucleolar exit</title><p>To elucidate which particular pre-60S maturation step(s) require Spb4 and Rrp17, we assessed the impact of their cellular depletion on the assembly factor composition of purified pre-60S intermediates. Therefore, we generated chromosomal AID fusions of <italic>SPB4</italic> or <italic>RRP17</italic> in strains expressing FTpA-tagged Nop7, Nug1, or Arx1 and isolated these assembly factors from cells in presence of Spb4-HA-AID and Rrp17-HA-AID (-auxin) or after their auxin-induced degradation (+auxin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the absence of Spb4 or Rrp17, pre-60S maturation was effectively arrested at a late nucleolar stage, as apparent by the accumulation of assembly factors Ytm1–Erb1, Spb1, and Has1 on Nug1- and Nop7-derived particles, whereas the recruitment of Nop53 and downstream nucleoplasmic assembly factors such as Nog2 and Bud20 to these stalled maturation intermediates was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). This suggests an important function of both Spb4 and Rrp17 for pre-60S maturation before Ytm1–Erb1 dissociation and transition of pre-60S particles to the nucleoplasm. Consistently, the export factor Arx1 that joins at a nucleoplasmic stage failed to efficiently co-purify pre-ribosomes upon Spb4 or Rrp17 depletion and was instead present mainly in a free form or associated with mature ribosomes or non-ribosomal factors (e.g. importins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, while the association of Spb4 with Nug1- and Nop7-derived particles was a prerequisite for recruitment of Rrp17, the presence of Rrp17 was apparently not strictly required for Spb4-recruitment to these 60S precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel; note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> Spb4 is co-migrating with the Nug1-Flag bait protein as revealed by mass spectrometry analyses).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spb4 and Rrp17 depletion arrests pre-60S maturation at a late nucleolar stage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Colour-coded bait proteins selected for affinity purifications are associated with distinct maturation intermediates along the 60S biogenesis pathway in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm: Nop7 (violet), Nug1 (green), and Arx1 (orange).

The major class of particles (40.85% of particles after 2D classification), which closely resembles the structural state E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kater et al., 2017</xref>), was resolved at an overall resolution of 2.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>), whereas a minor class corresponded to state D at an overall resolution of 3.0 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F–I</xref>). The latter class contains in addition the Nsa1 module (consisting of assembly factors Nsa1, Rpf1, Mak16, and Rrp1) at the solvent-exposed pre-60S side but is otherwise identical to the better resolved state E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The higher resolution of the state E compared to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kater et al., 2017</xref>) allowed us to identify and build molecular models of assembly factors Spb4, Rrp17, Noc2, and Loc1, as well to resolve additional parts of Noc3, Spb1, Nsa3, and of the ITS2 RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). At the inter-subunit side Spb4 is in contact with Rrp17 and located on top of the immature rRNA helices H62 and H63 in direct vicinity to the Ytm1–Erb1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, H and I</xref>). The intertwined Loc1 is located at the solvent-exposed pre-60S side where it engages in multiple protein interactions with assembly factors Noc3, Spb1, Nip7, Erb1, Ebp2, Brx1, and ribosomal protein Rpl15 (eL15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Next to Loc1, Noc3 interacts with the C-terminal part of its heat-repeat domain with its binding partner Noc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). While the middle part of Noc2 (aa 86–176) is not resolved, the C-terminal Noc2 heat-repeat domain and the N-terminal part of the protein are visible, and both contribute to establish the interaction with Noc3. Besides its interaction with Noc3, Noc2 is anchored to the particle by its elongated N-terminus that protrudes deeply into the 60S core. There, the Noc2 N-terminus contacts the immature H35 rRNA, which likely requires Noc2 dissociation to adopt its mature conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We were also able to resolve additional parts of the ITS2 spacer RNA (nucleotides 60–65 and 213–226) and the C-terminus of Nsa3 (aa 324–353) at the prominent pre-60S ‘foot’ structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

While the essential unstructured Rrp17 N-terminus is meandering across the MTD of Spb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), a more central part of the protein (aa 145–159) is reaching towards Spb4 forming an anti-parallel β-sheet with the N-terminal RecA-like domain of the helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Prompted by this β-sheet augmentation, we analysed the growth of yeast cells upon mutation of the corresponding Rrp17 amino acids (154–160). As observed for N-terminal (Spb1 interaction) but not C-terminal Rrp17 truncation mutants, disruption of the β-sheet augmentation in <italic>rrp17</italic> 154–160&gt;A and 154–160&gt;R mutant cells yielded slow-growth phenotypes, revealing the importance of this Rrp17–Spb4 contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Moreover, a yeast two-hybrid interaction between Spb4 and Rrp17 was observed, mediated by the central part of Rrp17 (aa 106–177) that includes amino acids 154–160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>). The C-terminal part of Rrp17 (aa 209–235) is reaching back and contacts again the Spb1 MTD in proximity of its N-terminus, as well as 25S rRNA H64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Spb4-containing pre-60S intermediates up- and downstream of state E</title><p>In the major class of the obtained state E-like Spb4 particles, Rrp17 and Spb1 including its N-terminal MTD were already incorporated as described above. In addition, the Spb4 purifications contained a mixture of distinct NE1-like states downstream of Ytm1–Erb1 removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>) as well as state E-like particles with only weak densities for the L1 stalk, Rrp17, and the Spb1 MTD, potentially representing intermediates upstream of state E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, analysis of another independent dataset of purified Spb4 particles, which underwent an only partially efficient maturation reaction, revealed an additional E-like state (resolved at 3.1 Å) lacking the corresponding Rrp17 and Spb1 MTD densities but show stable incorporation of the L1 stalk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). We conclude that this state may indeed represent a novel maturation intermediate directly preceding state E. Taken together, our cryo-EM analyses suggest that Spb4 is assembled around state D/E shortly prior to final Spb1 MTD and Rrp17 incorporation, which agrees with the biochemical protein data of purified pre-60S particles upon Spb4 and Rrp17 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Spb4 accommodates ADP and promotes H62/H63/H63a restructuring</title><p>Our cryo-EM structure gave several insights into the molecular interactions of the Spb4 catalytic and C-terminal domains on the pre-60S particle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C , and H–L</xref>). Most importantly, we observe a single-stranded rRNA (nucleotides U1942 to A1945 of 25S rRNA H63) within the helicase core active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The accommodation of the rRNA substrate between the two RecA-like domains induces bending and strand separation of the rRNA around the base of ES27, resulting in an alternate base-pairing of helices H62/H63/H63a compared to nucleoplasmic maturation intermediates and mature 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and K</xref>). This may explain why the rRNA area at the base of 25S domain IV initially appears to form stable duplexes, while it becomes more flexible and accessible for chemical modification in presence of Spb4, suggesting that the helicase disrupts this region upon its association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burlacu et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to the catalytic domain, Spb4’s essential CTD appears significantly involved in inducing substrate RNA strand disruption and establishing this alternate conformation. In the obtained substrate-bound state, the first half of the CTD (aa 406–499) is tightly docked onto the C-terminal RecA-like domain (RecA2) and binds H62/H63 nucleotides A1936 to C1941, thereby maintaining separation of the rRNA strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, K and L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Furthermore, a conserved tryptophan (W536) within the flexible C-terminal tail of the CTD (aa 500–606) intercalates between nucleotides of the immature H62/H63/H63a rRNA, which later adopts its mature-like fold in nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and L</xref>).</p><p>Two main conformations for the catalytic RNA helicase core domains have been described, which depend on the nucleotide and substrate binding state. Cooperative ATP and RNA substrate binding bring the two RecA domains in a closed conformation, while subsequent ATP hydrolysis usually leads to substrate release and re-opening of the RecA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sengoku et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theissen et al., 2008</xref>). Examination of the catalytic Spb4 core in our structure revealed that, while the two RecA domains are in a clear closed conformation and tightly bound to the substrate RNA, the helicase surprisingly accommodates in its binding pocket a nucleotide which we could unambiguously identify as ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D and E</xref>). Thus, Spb4 has already hydrolysed ATP at a previous step but remains associated with pre-ribosomes in a post-catalytic and still ADP-bound closed state and preserves its re-arranged rRNA substrate in the observed immature alternate conformation as also observed in a recent structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). This unusual behaviour can be explained by the requirement of ATP binding and hydrolysis to provide the energy for binding and local strand melting of the rRNA which is then followed by a subsequent stabilization of this state through the observed interactions of Sbp4 with several assembly factors such as Rrp17. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>, it would also allow for a concerted release of Spb4 together with Ytm1 and other factors upon Rea1 activity, thereby facilitating the timely re-annealing of the H62-H63 rRNA module in the mature conformation as observed in the subsequent NE states. Thus, the interaction and activity of Sbp4 appears to set the stage for the correct formation of the H61-H62-H63-H64 rRNA region as an important prerequisite for the further maturation of rRNA domain IV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Rea1-dependent nucleolar pre-60S maturation can be induced on isolated Spb4 particles in vitro</title><p>Next, we wanted to analyse in further detail how the Rea1 ATPase extracts Ytm1–Erb1 from nucleolar pre-60S particles. Therefore, we aimed to induce Rea1-dependent maturation of isolated TAP-Ytm1 pre-60S intermediates in vitro. We incubated Ytm1-derived particles with affinity purified Rea1, the pentameric Rix-complex (i.e. Rix1<sub>2</sub>–Ipi3<sub>2</sub>–Ipi1; this complex is suggested to guide Rea1 to its pre-ribosomal substrates), and ATP. However, upon subsequent re-isolation of pre-60S particles via Rpl3-Flag, the Ytm1–Erb1 complex remained fully associated with the pre-ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Strikingly, performing this maturation assay with Spb4-purified pre-60S particles exhibited an efficient release of the Ytm1–Erb1 complex and, remarkably, the DEAD-box helicase Has1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 8). The release of these assembly factors was more efficient in presence of the Rix1-complex, however, the addition of Rea1 and ATP was in principle sufficient to perform the restructuring step, at least in this in vitro setup with excess of purified Rea1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 7). The in vitro maturation also occurred when the slow growing catalytic <italic>spb4</italic> R360A mutant was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>), which indicates that ATP-hydrolysis by Spb4 is not required for this maturation step. However, since in vitro maturation was inducible on Spb4- but not on Ytm1-derived pre-60S particles that co-purify only small amounts of the helicase Spb4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we conclude that pre-60S recruitment of Spb4 and potentially also Rrp17 is a prerequisite for this remodelling step. Indeed, also incubation of Rrp17 particles with Rea1, Rix1-complex, and ATP resulted in limited but clearly detectable release of the sub-stoichiometrically associated Ytm1–Erb1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Rea1-dependent remodelling induced on isolated Spb4 particles in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rea1 releases the Ytm1–Erb1 subcomplex together with RNA helicase Has1 from pre-60S particles.

Thus, the Rea1-dependent pre-60S release of the Ytm1–Erb1 complex occurs before and independently of Has1, and in turn results in displacement of the helicase, which is potentially pulled off by its interaction with the intertwined Erb1 tail.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Cryo-EM analysis of in vitro matured Spb4-derived pre-60S ribosomal particles</title><p>To follow the conformational re-arrangements induced by Rea1/Rix1-complex on Spb4-derived pre-60S particles, we analysed the in vitro matured particles by single-particle cryo-EM. Initial classification of the untreated Spb4 sample, the in vitro control sample (Spb4 particles, Rea1/Rix1-complex, no ATP), and the in vitro release sample (Spb4 particles, Rea1/Rix1-complex, plus ATP) indicated a significant formation of in vitro matured pre-60S particles (44.1% of all particles), resembling structural state NE1 particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, only 7.4 and 7.0% of such NE1-like particles, respectively, were seen in the untreated Spb4 and Spb4 in vitro control samples. To better compare the ratios and classes within the untreated Spb4 control and the in vitro release samples, and to avoid any sorting bias of the individual datasets, we decided to join the micrographs of both samples and perform uniform data processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). After extensive sorting, we identified six major classes, three state E-like states containing Ytm1–Erb1 and three released states similar to the described NE1 state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>). The Ytm1–Erb1-containing state E-like states were mainly present in the untreated Spb4-FTpA sample (53.36%; only 10.31% in the in vitro release sample), whereas the release states strongly increased in the case of the in vitro release sample (32.06%; only 3.77% in the Spb4 control sample). We conclude that Rea1/Rix1-complex/ATP-induced remodelling of Spb4 particles in vitro resulted in maturation from E-like to distinct NE1-like states. All three release states have strong resemblance to the previously described NE1 state (obtained from Nop53 affinity purifications) but lack the foot-factor Nop53. However, we also find a minor particle class containing Nop53, which indicates that the attachment of Spb4 and Nop53 to pre-60S intermediates might not be strictly mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Notably, all obtained release state particles still contain Rrp17 bound to the Spb1 MTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), which is in line with Rrp17-FTpA purifications suggesting that the protein is still present on intermediates downstream of Spb4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the Ytm1–Erb1 complex, the helicase Has1 and also Spb4 were no longer visible in the in vitro released states. Since Spb4 was our bait for specimen purification, it appears that Spb4 remained attached to the in vitro matured pre-60S particles in a flexible way and hence was not detectible by cryo-EM. Indeed, one of the released states showed a fuzzy density in the area where the Spb4 helicase core is located in the preceding state E, and rigid body fitting of the Spb4 helicase core clearly suggests that the poorly resolved density corresponds to Spb4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Moreover, the densities for several other assembly factors such as Loc1, Brx1, Ebp2, Noc2–Noc3, Nip7, Nop2 at the inter-subunit side, and Nop16 at the solvent-exposed side were not visible in the released NE1-like particles, revealing large-scale remodelling around the area that in state E is accessed and connected by the long N-terminal Erb1 tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Thus, Erb1 removal could result in destabilization of these factors, which may become invisible either by complete removal or flexible attachment to the in vitro matured pre-60S particles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we provided functional insights into key restructuring events occurring on late nucleolar 60S subunit precursors preceding their transition to the nucleoplasmic compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). By combining biochemical and structural cryo-EM analyses, we unveiled how induction of the ATP-dependent release of the Ytm1–Erb1 heterodimer by the AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Rea1 results in large-scale remodelling of pre-60S particles isolated via the RNA helicase Spb4. Such in vitro matured particles, from which a network of assembly factors appeared dismantled, with subtle variations, resembled structural state NE1, while largely lacking assembly factor Nop53. NE1 is the earliest state obtained upon purification of native pre-60S particles isolated via Nop53, which can only join upon release of Erb1 due to overlapping binding sites at the pre-60S foot structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>). While our biochemical data show that the removal of RNA helicase Has1 occurs together with Ytm1–Erb1, they do not suggest the complete release of further assembly factors coupled to this step. In contrast, our single-particle cryo-EM analyses clearly revealed a strong enrichment of NE1-like particle classes in the in vitro release sample, which implicates the synchronized disassembly or at least destabilization of numerous additional assembly factors. The initial release of Ytm1–Erb1 and Has1 may therefore result in pre-rRNA re-arrangement and assembly factor destabilization, which would in consequence be too flexible to be resolved by cryo-EM or become unstably attached and potentially dissociate during cryo-EM sample preparation. Indeed, this is plausible considering the intertwined nature of the Erb1 N-terminus, which, by forming various rRNA and protein contacts, may until its release stabilize nucleolar pre-60S particles. However, it remains open whether in vivo further factors and intermediary maturation steps are required to facilitate assembly factor disassembly and formation of NE1 particles upon Ytm1–Erb1 and Has1 release.</p><p>The ATP-binding pocket of Has1 was found empty in our and also a previous pre-60S cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2019b</xref>). As furthermore a Has1 Walker A mutant protein was efficiently released from the particle in our maturation assay, we conclude that Has1 dissociates in an ATP-independent manner from 60S precursors. This is in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the Has1 function on 90S pre-ribosomes requires its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gnanasundram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liang and Fournier, 2006</xref>), while the role of Has1 in pre-60S maturation could be ATP-independent and may depend only on its physical presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gnanasundram et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, since Has1 binds already to very early nucleolar pre-60S maturation intermediates, its catalytic activity may be required during its initial pre-60S recruitment. On such early nucleolar precursors, Has1 was implicated to play a role for contact formation between the 25S 5’ end and the 5.8S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dembowski et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our previous cryo-EM structures of nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles revealed how the pentameric Rix1-complex recruits the AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Rea1 to these intermediates before nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrio-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>). The Rix1-complex is thereby essential to accurately position Rea1 for interaction and the subsequent release of its direct substrate Rsa4. Previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassler et al., 2010</xref>) and the increased efficiency in Ytm1–Erb1 release contributed by the Rix1-complex in our in vitro maturation assays suggest that the Rix1-complex recruits Rea1 to its earlier pre-60S substrate as well. Nevertheless, since structural insights into the more transient interaction of Rea1 with these nucleolar 60S precursors are missing, it remains unclear how the ATPase extracts Ytm1–Erb1 and how the Rix1-complex mediates this remodelling step.</p><p>The DEAD-box helicase Spb4 is one of around 20 RNA helicases involved in ribosome biogenesis that have been identified so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mitterer and Pertschy, 2022</xref>). While the approximate ribosomal maturation stages at which these RNA helicases are required have been determined, their molecular functions and precise substrates in most cases remain elusive. In addition, most RNA helicases could not be resolved on the so far existing cryo-EM structures of ribosomal precursors, likely due to high flexibility, unstable association or fast dissociation. Two exceptions in which ribosome-bound helicase structures could be determined are the DEAH helicase Dhr1 and the Ski2-like helicase Mtr4, which unwind the U3 snoRNA and RNA spacer substrates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Du et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schuller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to such processive helicases, DEAD-box helicases are proposed to mediate RNA folding by non-processive local strand melting and annealing. In agreement with a most recently published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>), our cryo-EM structure of substrate-bound Spb4 suggests how such RNA strand displacement and re-arrangement by a DEAD-box helicase attached to its pre-ribosomal substrate is orchestrated. The existing general model on the function of DEAD-box helicases suggests that substrate RNA and ATP-binding together induce the closed active conformation of the catalytic RecA domains, whereas ATP-hydrolysis in the active site instantly triggers a re-opening of the catalytic domains going along with the release of the restructured RNA substrate.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bono et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sengoku et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, in contrast to this proposed mechanism, we found ADP instead of ATP in the nucleotide binding pocket of substrate RNA-bound Spb4 with its catalytic RecA domains in a closed conformation. Thus, while Spb4 likely has hydrolysed ATP at a previous stage, ATP-hydrolysis did not facilitate re-opening of the RecA-like domains and the helicase remained bound to ADP and its H62/H63 restructuring target. A reason for the unexpected Spb4 conformation might be the interactions of the first RecA domain with Rrp17, as well as the tight interaction of the CTD with the rRNA, which could potentially lock the rigid Spb4 core in its closed state. We therefore assume that current models on the function of DEAD-box helicases need to be extended since on complex substrates such as pre-ribosomes several additional factors might influence the state of the catalytic domains. In line with this, the DEAD-box helicase Dbp7 was also suggested to rely on an extensive interaction network for its function in rRNA folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aquino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jaafar et al., 2021</xref>) and specific DEAD-box cofactors were shown to modulate the kinetics of the helicase core conformational cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harms et al., 2014</xref>). Upon Spb4 dissociation, the H62/H63/H63a rRNA is then adopting a new stably folded and mature-like state as seen in cryo-EM structures of downstream pre-60S intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kater et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). What eventually triggers substrate release and pre-60S dissociation of Spb4 remains, however, unclear and open for future studies. As we could not recapitulate the H62/H63/H63a folding to a more mature state in our in vitro assays, the release or association of further assembly factors and ribosomal proteins may be required to facilitate this transition. While our manuscript was in revision, another study providing a highly similar cryo-EM structure of pre-60S bound Spb4 was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). The authors report similar results on the function of Spb4 and its rRNA restructuring target and observe Spb4 in a post-catalytic state. However, they observed that the ATP-binding pocket of Spb4 is empty, whereas we clearly identified ADP in the active site. This difference may be a result of slightly different preparation conditions and indicates that after ATP hydrolysis the remaining ADP binds with low affinity.</p><p>Two recent studies reported that the human Spb4 homolog DDX55 is strongly upregulated in various lung cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues promoting HCC cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the obtained insights into the Spb4 function for ribosome biogenesis could be of relevance for medical studies and treatment of such cancer types. Furthermore, our study demonstrated the great potential of structural cryo-EM analyses of in vitro matured pre-ribosomal intermediates, which will be a promising approach to unveil further restructuring and maturation events on evolving ribosomal precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and are derived from the W303 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas and Rothstein, 1989</xref>).

maturation. The authors have purified and determined the structures of several nucleolar ribosome assembly intermediates in yeast using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The study combines genetic, biochemical, and structural analysis to provide compelling support for the conclusions the authors wish to draw. The work will be of broad interest to cell biologists, biochemists, and structural biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84877.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ruben L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj8s172</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Arlen W</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Texas</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Austin</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.14.516466">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.14.516466v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Nonetheless, I wonder whether the resolution of the structure truly allows the authors to distinguish between ADP and ATP. The segmented density for ADP shown in the model of the nucleotide-binding site of Spb4 in Figure 3M doesn't really allow an assessment of this issue. Given the importance of this observation to the work, the authors should provide a deeper assessment of the data in this regard and present a more complete argument excluding the possibility that ATP (or ADP-Pi, see below) might occupy the nucleotide-binding site. More importantly, the authors' conclusion in this regard is supported by the recent publication of Cruz et al., (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-022-00874-9), and this publication should be discussed and cited in this context.</p><p>Related to the previous point, given that the RecA domains are closed, even if ATP has been hydrolyzed, I wonder whether and how the inorganic phosphate (Pi) has dissociated from the nucleotide-binding site. In my view, the question of whether and how the closing/opening dynamics of the RecA domains of DEAD-box helicases are coupled to ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, and/or π release field remains open in the field. My understanding is that the majority of the field expects closing to be coupled to ATP binding and opening to be coupled to ATP hydrolysis or π release. Interestingly, previous work from the Klostermeier group on a different DEAD-box helicase, eIF4A, suggests that the closing/opening dynamics are faster than ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis, or π release (Harms, et al. (2014) NAR 42, 7911), but the mechanism ultimately proposed in that work is that closing is coupled to ATP binding and opening is coupled to π release, in line with what I think is the predominant view. In this context, I think the findings reported here will be of great interest and importance to the DEAD-box helicase field. Assuming they can strengthen their conclusion that Spb4 is bound to ADP (see previous point), the authors should expand their discussion of these issues and contextualize their findings that the RecA domains of Spb4 are closed while Spb4 is bound to ADP relative to previous work and mechanistic models in the field. Related to this, I agree with the authors that the contacts the C-terminal domain of Spb4 makes with the substrate might be relevant and might uniquely stabilize Spb4 in a conformation in which the RecA domains are in the closed conformation while Spb4 is bound to ADP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. &quot;Our cryo-EM structure of substrate-bound Spb4 for the first time suggests how such RNA strand displacement and re-arrangement by a DEAD-box helicase attached to its pre-ribosomal substrate is orchestrated&quot;.

The authors should consider citing the global SHAPE analysis showing that the H62-H63-ES27 region forms stable duplexes (Burlacu et al. 2017) and footprinting experiments showing that Spb4 disrupts this base pairing (Bruning et al. 2018) (also further analysed by Cruz et al. 2022) as this seems to provide further support their proposed model.</p><p>4.

We therefore changed main Figure 3M and added another figure to the supplement (Figure3—figure supplement 4E) displaying this region of the map in a clearer way and together with rigid body fitted RNA helicase models containing ADP, the ATP analogue ADPNP, ADP BeF3 or ADP PI. It can be better appreciated now that the map corresponds to an ADP molecule without any additional density to accommodate the γ-phosphate of an ATP molecule. The local resolution of this region of about 3.0 to 3.5 Å is sufficient to draw this conclusion unambiguously. This notion is further supported by the finding that we can observe density for a nearby magnesium ion in its expected position.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we discuss this issue in the context of the supporting findings or Cruz et al. in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the previous point, given that the RecA domains are closed, even if ATP has been hydrolyzed, I wonder whether and how the inorganic phosphate (Pi) has dissociated from the nucleotide-binding site.

The H61-H62-H64 three-way junction, however, is not well resolved in our Spb4-bound and also not in the Spb4 post-release maps. Therefore, our maps do not provide precise insights on the exact conditions (binding of additional AFs or ribosomal proteins might be required) and time point for the maturation of this junction, apart from the observation that in the Spb4-bound state it is partially disordered and adopts in the known later states (NE1) its defined mature conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;Furthermore, a conserved tryptophan (W536) within the flexible C-terminal tail of the CTD (aa 500-606) intercalates between nucleotides of helices H62/H63/H63a and thereby might prevent this rRNA region to adopt its mature-like fold as seen in the nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles (Figures 3C and 3L)&quot;.
