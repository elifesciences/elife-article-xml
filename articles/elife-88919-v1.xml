Moreover, anesthesia affects both brain functions and the stroke outcome acting as neurotoxic or protective agents. So far, no approaches were well suited to induce stroke while imaging hemodynamics along with simultaneous large-scale recording of brain functions in awake animals. For this reason, the first critical hours following the stroke insult and associated functional alteration remain poorly understood. Here, we present a strategy to investigate both stroke hemodynamics and stroke-induced functional alterations without the confounding effect of anesthesia, i.e., under awake condition. Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging was used to continuously monitor variations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in +65 brain regions/hemispheres for up to 3 hr after stroke onset. The focal cortical ischemia was induced using a chemo-thrombotic agent suited for permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in awake rats and followed by ipsi- and contralesional whiskers stimulation to investigate on the dynamic of the thalamocortical functions. Early (0–3 hr) and delayed (day 5) fUS recording enabled to characterize the features of the ischemia (location, CBV loss), spreading depolarizations (occurrence, amplitude) and functional alteration of the somatosensory thalamocortical circuits. Post-stroke thalamocortical functions were affected at both early and later time points (0–3 hr and 5 days) after stroke. Overall, our procedure facilitates early, continuous, and chronic assessments of hemodynamics and cerebral functions. When integrated with stroke studies or other pathological analyses, this approach seeks to enhance our comprehension of physiopathologies towards the development of pertinent therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>awake rat</kwd><kwd>functional diaschisis</kwd><kwd>functional ultrasound imaging</kwd><kwd>ischemic stroke</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0C9923N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G079623N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12D7523N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunner</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>ERANET, EU Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant number 964215, UnscrAMBLY</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urban</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Montaldo</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional ultrasound imaging was used to monitor brain hemodynamics and sensory-evoked thalamocortical functions in awake rats pre- and post-stroke, advancing our understanding toward new therapeutic developments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is a multifaceted and multiphasic pathology, complex to mimic under experimental conditions. Indeed, when compared to clinics, preclinical stroke models suffer from several limitations that narrow the experimental focus on a few conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Macrae, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fluri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sommer, 2017</xref>). Among these limitations, one can highlight the complexity to combine (i) imaging stroke in conscious animal models, (ii) addressing post-stroke brain functions, and (iii) recording of hyperacute stroke hemodynamics, all crucial to design timely effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>As the first limitation, the use of anesthesia in preclinical studies seems to hamper the transition from animal to patient as most of stroke occurs in awake or sleeping patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mackey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muir, 2023</xref>), but rarely in sedated patients. Moreover, anesthetics disrupt the brain functionality, alters neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reimann and Niendorf, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masamoto and Kanno, 2012</xref>), while differentially affecting metabolism, electrophysiology, temperature, blood pressure, and tissue outcome by acting as neurotoxic or neuroprotective agents (see reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Traystman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hoffmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Slupe and Kirsch, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To date, only a few groups succeeded in inducing a stroke in awake rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balbi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sunil et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, post-stroke network and functional alterations have been addressed by few preclinical studies, providing evidence of functional network reorganization from minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohajerani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunner et al., 2018</xref>) to days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dijkhuizen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dijkhuizen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shih et al., 2014</xref> following stroke onset. However, these studies mostly focused on the cortical readouts and were unable to capture how deeper brain regions, like thalamic relays, were functionally and/or temporally affected remotely from the stroke insult (e.g. diaschisis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carrera and Tononi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, these studies were always conducted using various anesthetics (e.g. ventilated with halothane or isoflurane; medetomidine, urethane) known to differentially impact brain functions, as mentioned above.</p><p>Until recently, live monitoring of the hyperacute stroke-induced hemodynamics was restricted to few methods but often focused to the brain surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balbi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dunn, 2012</xref>).

However, no study has further exploited such strategies to combine stroke hemodynamics and brain-wide functional alteration in awake rodents.</p><p>In this study, we report on the stroke induction and the alteration of somatosensory brain functions in awake rats.

Rat #1 was excluded after the control session as the imaging window was too anterior to capture both cortical and thalamic responses. Rat #2 was excluded as hemodynamic responses were inconsistent during baseline (pre-stroke) period.

Each rat was subjected to two cranial windows accessing independently the distal branch of the left MCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Left) and the selected brain regions to image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Right). The latter was performed between bregma –2 and –4 mm allowing for jointly monitoring the bilateral thalamocortical circuits of the somatosensory whisker-to-barrel pathway, including the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM) and the primary somatosensory barrel-field cortex (S1BF). Moreover, the selected coronal cross-section includes the posterior nucleus of the thalamus (Po), the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the ventral part of the zona incerta are known for relaying information related to whiskers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>), and also direct efferent projections from the S1BF to other cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zakiewicz et al., 2014</xref>). Prior to imaging sessions, rats were extensively trained to accept comfortable restraints in the experimental apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suitable for fUS recording of brain functions and stroke induction under awake conditions. After data acquisition, the coronal cross-section was registered and segmented on a custom-developed digital rat atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brunner et al., 2022a</xref>) to provide a dynamic view of the changes in perfusion induced either by the stroke or evoked activity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental procedure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for brain imaging of awake head-fixed rats including, from left to right: animal preparation (habituation to the bench, implantation of cranial windows, training), functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging of stroke induction and brain functions, data processing, and histopathology.

It should be mentioned that the rats did not show any obvious signs of pain or discomfort (e.g. vocalization, aggressiveness) during the restrain period and occlusion procedure. The MCA occlusion (MCAo) was captured live with fUS and confirmed by the large drop of signal, i.e., ischemia, localized in the cortex of the left hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as shown with µDoppler image taken 3 hr and 5d after the stroke onset (dashed outline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Top row). Bmode images accounting for the brain tissue echogenicity remain unchanged early after stroke onset (3 hr) while showing focal hyper-echogenicity (dashed outline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Bottom row) lately after stroke onset (5d) as a marker of focal lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gómez-de Frutos et al., 2021</xref>). The stroke-induced hemodynamic changes have been continuously recorded for up to 3 hr after stroke onset, registered and segmented into 69 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first extracted the average change in rCBV (∆rCBV in %) in the S1BF cortex of the left hemisphere (blue region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and detected an abrupt drop of rCBV down to ~40% of the baseline level after the occlusion of the MCA, followed by a progressive decrease of the rCBV to 30% of baseline level 3 hr after the stroke onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Second, we extracted the average rCBV change from a cortical region supplied by the anterior cerebral artery directly after the MCAo. The signal extracted from the retrosplenial granular cortex (RSGc; purple and black regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) shows successive and transient increases of signal. It characterizes hemodynamic events associated with spreading depolarizations (SDs) in the left hemisphere (in purple; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) while resulting in a slight and stable oligemia in the right hemisphere (in black; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). SD events were observed in the peri-ischemic territory of all rats subjected to MCAo and occurred in an ostensibly random fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); however, hemodynamic events associated with SDs showed a similar bell shape and time-course across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Indeed, the use of FeCl<sub>3</sub> requires less manipulation, allows to maintain the dura intact, and strongly reduces the risk of hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karatas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Syeara et al., 2020</xref>) and animal loss. In addition, the FeCl<sub>3</sub> model closely mimics key features of human stroke, including focal ischemia, clot formation, minutes-long progressive occlusion of the vessel, possibility of vessel recanalization, and penumbral tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karatas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Syeara et al., 2020</xref>). However, to adequately and efficiently occlude the vessel of interest, it is necessary to open the skull and to stabilize the cranial window under chronic conditions (i.e. case of delayed occlusion). It is worth noting that optimal preparation of the MCA window is highly critical, as the application of FeCl<sub>3</sub> is performed with a reduced field-of-view. In fact, as mentioned in the animal use report, one rat was excluded from the analysis due to spontaneous MCA re-perfusion, thus reducing the success rate of the model.</p><p>The FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced MCAo showed an abrupt and massive drop of blood perfusion remaining constant during the entire recording period.

Functional responses to mechanical whisker stimulation were detected in several regions relaying the information from the whisker to the cortex, including the VPM and Po nuclei of the thalamus, and S1BF, the somatosensory barrel-field cortex. Responses were also observed in the S2 cortex involved in the multisensory integration of the information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lohse et al., 2021</xref>), the auditory cortex as it receives direct efferent projection from S1BF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zakiewicz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lohse et al., 2021</xref>), and the VPL nuclei of the thalamus are connected via corticothalamic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zakiewicz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Functional responses extracted in the left hemisphere affected by the focal ischemia (i.e. ipsilesional) show a primary alteration of the whisker-to-barrel pathway within the first hour after the stroke onset. While the abrupt loss in S1BF responses was mainly driven by the focal ischemia, the immediate but partial drop in VPM responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) might result from the direct the loss of the excitatory corticothalamic feedback to the VPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Landisman and Connors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourassa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Temereanca and Simons, 2004</xref>), or even from a dampening of thalamocortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tennant et al., 2017</xref>). The absence of such cortical feedback suggests that the dampened functional responses might be driven by the intrinsic activity of the VPM in response to whisker stimulation. Five days after the initial injury, nuclei of the thalamus (VPM and Po) were subjected to a delayed and robust functional alteration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) as previously confirmed in other thalamic relay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tokuno et al., 1992</xref>), probably associated with diaschisis, as previously characterized by tissue staining, reduction of metabolism, functions and perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carrera and Tononi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viaene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tokuno et al., 1992</xref>).

Therefore, further studies will be needed to accurately dissect the complex and long-lasting post-stroke alterations of the functional whisker-to-barrel pathway, including at the neuronal level by direct electrophysiology recordings and imaging, as fUS only report on hemodynamics as a proxy of local neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sieu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macé et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Urban et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aydin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sans-Dublanc et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nunez-Elizalde, 2021</xref>). Another limitation relies on the experimental condition as our brain imaging paradigm was constrained to a single cross-section, thus missing out-of-plane brain regions also affected by the stroke (e.g. ischemic size, infract extension, origin, and propagation pattern of SDs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Topchiy et al., 2009</xref>) or involved in the whisker network (e.g. superior colliculus, striatum, amygdala and cerebellum)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi, 2019</xref>). To overcome such limitation, one can extend the size of the cranial window to allow for larger scale imaging either by sequentially scanning the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sieu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macé et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brunner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brunner et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hingot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sans-Dublanc et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brunner et al., 2022b</xref>), or by using the recently developed volumetric fUS which provides whole-brain imaging capabilities in anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rabut et al., 2019</xref>) and awake mice/rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brunner et al., 2020</xref>).

The habituation to head-fixation started by short (5–30 s) and gentle head-fixation of the headpost between fingers. The headpost was then secured between clamps for fixation periods progressively increased following the same procedure as with the sling.

Thus, the effective delay between two stimulations delivered to the same whisker pad is 80 s from start to start.

This configuration allowed us to image the brain vasculature with a resolution of 100 μm laterally, 110 μm in depth, and 300 μm in elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brunner et al., 2021</xref>).

Each plane wave is repeated six times, and the recorded echoes are averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ration. The five plane-wave images are added to create compound images at a frame rate of 500 Hz. To obtain a single vascular image we acquired a set of 250 compound images in 0.5 s, an extra 0.3 s pause is included between each image to have some processing time to display the images for real-time monitoring of the experiment. The set of 250 compound images has a mixed information of blood and tissue signal. To extract the blood signal, we apply a low pass filter (cut off 15 Hz) and an SVD filter that eliminates 20 singular values. This filter aims to select all the signals from blood moving with an axial velocity higher than ~1 mm/s. To obtain a vascular image we compute the intensity of the blood signal i.e., Power Doppler image. This image is in first approximation proportional to the cerebral blood volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Macé et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Montaldo et al., 2022</xref>).

The authors leveraged a chemically induced occlusion of the rat Medial Cerebral Artery (MCA) with ferric chloride in awake rats, while imaging with fUS cerebral perfusion with high spatial and temporal resolution (100µm x 110µm x 300µm x 0.8s).

All these regions are involved in the sensory processing of whisker stimulation. By investigating these regions the authors present the hyper-acute effect of the stroke with these main results:</p><p>- MCA occlusion results in a fast and important loss of perfusion in the ipsilesional cortex.</p><p>- Thrombolysis is followed by Spreading Depolarisation measured in the Retrosplenial cortex.</p><p>- Stroke-induced hypo-perfusion is associated with a significant drop in ipsilesional cortical response to whisker stimulation, and a milder one in ipsilesional subcortical relays.</p><p>- Contralesional hemisphere is almost not affected by stroke with the exception of the cortex which presents a mildly reduced response to the stimulation.</p><p>In addition, the authors demonstrate that their protocol allows to follow up stroke evolution up to five days postinduction.

Using functional ultrasound (fUS), they report immediate and lasting (up to 5 days) depression of sensory-evoked responses in somatosensory thalamic and cortical regions.</p><p>Strengths: This a technically challenging and proof-of-concept study that employs new methods to study brain-wide changes in sensory-evoked neural activity, inferred from changes in cerebral blood flow. Despite the minor typos/grammatical errors and small sample size, the authors provide compelling images and rigorous analysis to support their conclusions. Overall, this was a very technically difficult study that was well executed. I believe that it will pave the way for more extensive studies using this methodological approach. Therefore I support this study and my recommendations to improve it are relatively minor in nature and should be simple for the authors to address.</p><p>Weaknesses: The primary weakness of this paper is the small sample sizes. Drawing conclusions based on the small sham control group (n=2) or 5-day stroke recovery group (n=2), is rather tenuous. One way to alleviate some uncertainty with regard to the conclusions would be to state in the discussion that the findings (ie. loss of thalamocortical function after stroke) are perfectly consistent with previous studies that examined thalamocortical function after stroke. The authors missed some of these supporting studies in their reference list (see PMID: 28643802, 1400649). A second issue that can easily be resolved is their analysis of the 69 brain regions. This seems like a very important part of the study and one of the primary advantages of employing efUS. As presented, I had difficulty seeing the data. I think it would be worthwhile to expand Fig 3 (especially 3C) into a full-page figure with an accompanying table in the Supplementary info section describing the % change in CBF for each brain region.</p><p>Other Recommendations for the authors:.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Since there is variability in spreading depolarizations, was there any trend in the relationship between # SD's and ischemic volume?

We have provided a supplementary full-page version of the current Figure 3C (see Supplementary Figure 3).</p><p>Regarding the recommendations, we strongly agree that it would be of interest to link SDs and ischaemia, but unfortunately this can't be done because our experimental design, i.e. narrow cranial window and single static plane, does not allow brain-wide quantification of ischemic volume.

This is particularly significant given how significant a stressor physical restraint has been established to be in rodent models of stress. Furthermore, assessment of the robustness of these measurements is of particular significance for supporting the wide applicability of this approach to preclinical studies of brain injury: the individual animal data (effect sizes, activation areas, kinetics) should thus be displayed and the statistical analysis expanded. Both within-subject, within/across sessions, and across-subjects variability should be evaluated. Thoughtful comments on the relationship between power doppler signal and cerebral blood volume are important to include and facilitate comparisons to studies recording other blood volume-weighted signals. Finally, the contextualization of the observations with respect to other studies examining acute and subacute changes in brain hemodynamics post focal ischemic stroke in rats is needed. It is also quite helpful, for establishing the robustness of the approach, when the statistical parametric maps are shown in full (i.e. unmasked).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the comments, recommendations and concerns he/she/they raised. We have addressed all the points to clarify our article and make it more relevant and informative for readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The work described by Brunner et al is primarily a methodological paper, with potentially interesting, yet not robust enough, novel biological insight into the mechanisms of stroke. Nonetheless, the method employed is interesting and potentially well-validated.</p><p>General comments/suggestions</p><p>1- One potential concern I have is related to the relatively low sample size used, with n=5 for the main results and only n=2 for the follow-up after 5d. I am not sure much can be generalized using only two animals in any research study and this N = 2 dataset should probably be removed entirely from the study. Moreover, I found the statistical methods used were only superficially described, which prevented me from assessing whether the results reported by the authors are biologically relevant or not (including some signiﬁcant differences in rCBV well below 1% estimated over two individuals).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s comment and balanced our claim by considering this work as a proof-of-concept on brain imaging of multiple aspects of stroke hemodynamics (ischemia, spreading depolarization-like events, cortico-thalamic functions) in awake head-fixed rats. Therefore, we attenuated our message along the entire manuscript to prevent misunderstanding and over statement (e.g., Lines 356, 441, 455), we also remove statistics from the analysis at d5 post-stroke, see Figure 4 and associated paragraph from Line 356.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2- Based on their investigations, the authors propose a model where the loss of infarcted cortex induces reduced activity in connected regions, whether by cortico-thalamic or cortico-cortical loss of excitatory drive. This is an intriguing framework but this hypothesis would require a more complete, well-powered study to be substantiated.</p><p>I think a clear recognition of the fact that these findings are just preliminary and not validated should be more explicitly reported. I also marginally note here that these results are in contrast with previous reports from the same team where occlusion of the MCA induced increased response to whisker stimulation in anaesthetised rats. These contradictory findings are not discussed in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we explicit more on the proof-of-concept proposed in this work as well as clearly stating on the preliminary aspect of the findings described in this work. As mentioned above, we attenuated our message along the entire manuscript to prevent misunderstanding and over statement (e.g., Lines 348, 433, 447), we also remove statistics from the analysis at d5 post-stroke, see figure 4 and associated paragraph from Line 348.</p><p>We thanks the reviewer for pointing out the missing link with our previous work performed under anesthesia. We therefore provided a discussion point on this contradictory finding (Line 441).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3- In a previous study from the same group perfusion was imaged in 3D either by means of a motorized probe or by using a 2D matrix arrays. It would be interesting to discuss why a 2D approach was chosen in this study over those previous methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, brain-wide coverage would be of great interest in such experiment context. As mentionned by the reviewer, two strategies can be used:</p><p>• One can scan the brain using a motorized probe as performed for different purposes by Sieu et al., Nature Methods, 2015; Hingot, Brodin et al., Theranostics 2020; Macé et al., Neuron 2019 and also by our group in Sans-Dublanc, Chrzanowska et al., Neuron, 2022; Brunner et al. Frontiers in Neuroscience 2022 and Brunner et al., JCBFM 2023. (This list of publication is not exhaustive).</p><p>• A second approach aims at using a 2D matrix array to capture functions at brain-wide scale. So far, this strategy has been employed in a couple of studies (Rabut et al., Nature Methods, 2019 and Brunner, Grillet et al., Neuron, 2020).</p><p>The strategy consisting of scanning (manually or using a motor) strongly limits investigation on brain functions, as performing an accurate covering of the functional regions requires an extensive and time-consumming scanning: brain functions must be addressed several time to capture a reliable and robust signal for all the brain section scanned (see Brunner et al., 2022). Unfortunately, this strategy prevents us to accurately capture other brain hemodynamics like the dynamic of the ischemia or the spreading depolarization event.</p><p>On the other hand, the volumetric functional ultrasound imaging (vfUSI) would be suited for brain-wide coverage capturing large-scale brain functions (see Brunner, Grillet et al. Neuron 2020) and hemodynamic events (see Rabut et al., Nature Methods, 2019) but at the cost of the resolution, frame rate and larger cranial window. Unfortunately, this technology was not available when this work was conducted.</p><p>Such experimental opportunities have been suggested at the end of the manuscript: “To overcome such limitation, one can extend the size of the cranial window to allow for larger scale imaging either by sequentially scanning the brain27,28,31,32,59,69,71,72, or by using the recently developed volumetric fUS which provides whole-brain imaging capabilities in anesthetized73 and awake rats30.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4- Overall the registration scheme seems suboptimal which ultimately questions the speciﬁcity of the ﬁndings in thalamic regions. It would be interesting to validate this procedure, especially the probe repositioning five days after the stroke.</p></disp-quote><p>Positioning was not difficult part of this experiment. First, all head posts were implanted in the same position relative to the skull references bregma and lambda. Second, the head fixation ensures the same placement of the headpost for all animals. Finally, fine adjustement of the ultrasound probe position were done using a micromanipulator by finding key landmarks from the µDoppler image. In practice, minimal adjustements were needed to find back the same imaging plane. We provide additional information about the positionning in the Materials and Methods section.</p><p>New text – Line 126: “Positionning.</p><p>The mechanical fixation of the head-post ensures an easy and repeatabe positionning of the ultrasound probe across imaging session. The ultrasound probe is indeed fixed to a micromanipulator enabling light adjustements To find the plane of interest (containing both S1BF and thalamic relays: bregma - 3.4mm), we used brain landmarks (e.g., surface of the brain, hippocampus, superior sagittal sinus, large vessels). Note that as the headpost was carefully placed in the same position relative to the skulls landmarks (bregma and lambda), the position of the region of interest was minimal across animals.”</p><p>Second, at d5 post-stroke, we positionned the ultrasound probe over the imaging window as described in the Materials and Methods section and use brain landmarks from baseline/post-stroke image to maximize the position of brain image.

For some work, a pause between 2 frames is used (mostly due to technical limitations in the software (processing time , or execution of a real-time display/processing by the user)), however this reduces the frame rate.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparing with the sequences used in references 26 and 28, we have the following timing parameters.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Frequency (Hz)</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">N Compound</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Acquisition time (s)</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Pause (s)</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Frame rate (Hz)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Macé et al.,</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High sensibility</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">500</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">200</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.4</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Neuron, 2018</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High speed</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">500</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">50</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Brunner et al.,</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High sensibility</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">500</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">250</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nat Prot, 2021</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High speed</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">500</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">50</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">500</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">250</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1.25</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In this work, we decided to reduce the frame rate to have less images but with higher SNR.

The 5 plane-wave images are added to create compound images at a frame rate of 500Hz. Each set of 250 compound images is 142 filtered to extract the blood signal. Finally, the intensity of the filtered images is averaged to obtain a 143 vascular image of the rat brain at a frame rate of 1.25Hz. Then, the acquired images are processed with a dedicated GPU architecture, displayed in real-time for data visualization, and stored for subsequent off-line analysis.”</p><p>New text – Line 146:” The ultrasound sequence generated by the software is adapted from Macé et al.31 and Brunner, Grillet et al.34 Ultrafast images of the brain were generated using 5 tilted plane-waves (-6°, -3°, +0.5°, +3°, +6°). Each plane wave is repeated 6 times and the recorded echoes are averaged to increase the signal to noise ration. The 5 plane-wave images are added to create compound images at a frame rate of 500Hz. To obtain a single vascular image we acquired a set of 250 compound images in 0.5s, an extra 0.3s pause is included between each image to have some processing time to display the images for real-time monitoring of the experiment. The set of 250 compound images has a mixed information of blood and tissue signal. To extract the blood signal we apply a low pass filter (cutt off 15Hz) and an SVD filter that eliminates 20 singular values. This filter aims to select all the signal from blood moving with an axial velocity higher than ~1mm/s. To obtain a vascular iimage we compute the intensity of the blood signal i.e., Power Doppler image. This image is in first approximation proportional to the cerebral blood volume26,28. Overall, this process enables a continious acquisition of power Doppler images at a frame rate of 1.25Hz during several hours.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Ultrasound data processing: The filtering process should have more description. It would be highly instructive to explain that the power Doppler signal is being used and comment clearly on its relationship to blood volume, commenting on stalled flow mircrovessels/RBC-devoid micrrovessels, and considerations of vessel orientation.</p></disp-quote><p>The compound image has a mixed information of blood and tissu signal.

Does the SVD processing have the same cut off (20 singular values) as in prior publications as a standard value, or is that adjusted for each study? There are enough minor differences between sequences that these details are uncertain. Do the overall hemodynamics measurements (Fig 2) include all data acquired, or do they exclude the whisker stimulation events, and if so, how long of a window is excluded? The explanation of the activity maps should be rephrased e.g. &quot;... recordings are segmented in shorter 40-s time windows encompassing the whisker stimulation trials...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these details are important, all these information have been added to the manuscript</p><p>• SVD processing: We eliminate 20 singular values as in cited studies.</p><p>• Sequence: we have included more details about the sequence.</p><p>• Processing: all data during the whisker stimulation is used.</p><p>• We have rephrased the explanation about the activity maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Rats received a lethal injection of pentobarbital (100mg/kg i.p. Dolethal, Vetoquinol, France). Using a peristaltic pump, they were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Brains were collected and post-fixed overnight. 50-μm thick coronal brain sections across the MCA territory were sliced on a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and analyzed using the cresyl violet (Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA) staining procedure (see Open Lab Book for procedure). Slices were mounted with DPX mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and scanned using a bright-field microscope</p></body></sub-article></article>
