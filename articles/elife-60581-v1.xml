causative agents of malaria. The mobility, infectivity, and ultimately pathogenesis of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> rely on a macromolecular complex, called the glideosome. At the core of the glideosome is an essential and divergent Myosin A motor (PfMyoA), a first order drug target against malaria. Here, we present the full-length structure of PfMyoA in two states of its motor cycle. We report novel interactions that are essential for motor priming and the mode of recognition of its two light chains (PfELC and MTIP) by two degenerate IQ motifs. Kinetic and motility assays using PfMyoA variants, along with molecular dynamics, demonstrate how specific priming and atypical sequence adaptations tune the motor’s mechano-chemical properties. Supported by evidence for an essential role of the PfELC in malaria pathogenesis, these structures provide a blueprint for the design of future anti-malarials targeting both the glideosome motor and its regulatory elements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>mliding motility</kwd><kwd>erythrocytes invasion</kwd><kwd>myosin A</kwd><kwd>PfELC</kwd><kwd>antimalarial drugs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 132378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trybus</surname><given-names>Kathleen M</given-names></name><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGY0066/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baum</surname><given-names>Jake</given-names></name><name><surname>Houdusse</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100993/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baum</surname><given-names>Jake</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109007/Z/15/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>Thomas C A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of full-length myosin A provides some hints about its atypical mechanism, and reveals that the light chain PfELC is a target to block malaria pathogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parasites from the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the causative agents of malaria, are responsible for half of a million deaths per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">WHO, 2018</xref>). Despite significant effort and money having been devoted for developing vaccines and new preventive treatments, the malaria parasites are becoming resistant to current artemisinin-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haldar et al., 2018</xref>). The global death rate from malaria has recently started to rise after many years of decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">WHO, 2018</xref>), emphasizing the necessity to develop new interventions, particularly because climate change may further expand the range of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hertig, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The mosquito-borne parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the deadliest species that infects humans, alternates between motile and non-motile stages. Locomotion of apicomplexan parasites occurs by a process called gliding motility (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>). This mode of displacement and the infectivity of the parasite rely on a macromolecular assembly called the glideosome that is anchored in an inner membrane complex located ~25 nm below the parasite plasma membrane (PPM). The core of the glideosome consists of an atypical class XIV myosin A (PfMyoA) and a divergent actin (PfAct1). PfMyoA is a short myosin with a conserved globular motor domain and a lever arm that binds two light chains: an essential light chain (PfELC) and <underline>m</underline>yosin <underline>t</underline>ail <underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>rotein (MTIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bookwalter et al., 2017</xref>). The N-terminal extension of MTIP binds to integral membrane proteins called GAPs (<underline>g</underline>lideosome <underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>p</underline>roteins), which anchors the myosin so that it can interact cyclically with actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>). PfMyoA is a critical molecule in the parasite life-cycle because it powers the fast motility (~2 µm.s<sup>−1</sup>) required during motile sporozoite stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Münter et al., 2009</xref>), and is essential for providing the force (up to 40 pN) needed for non-motile merozoites to invade erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of PfMyoA in the Post-rigor (PR) and the Pre-Powerstroke (PPS) states.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (Left) The PfMyoA motor is located in the intermembrane space of the parasite. PfMyoA (blue) binds two light chains, PfELC and <underline>m</underline>yosin <underline>t</underline>ail <underline>i</underline>nteracting <underline>p</underline>rotein (MTIP). MTIP connects the motor to the glideosome-associated proteins (GAP) complex, which is anchored in the inner membrane complex (IMC). PfMyoA cyclically interacts with PfAct1 filaments, which are bound to adhesins from the parasite plasma membrane (PPM); these adhesins also bind receptors from the host cell plasma membrane (HPM). The displacement of PfAct1 filaments by PfMyoA drives parasite gliding motility. (Right) The crystal structure of the motor domain of PfMyoA has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>), but the lever arm structure was not known. (<bold>b,c</bold>) Overall structures of the full-length PfMyoA motor in the PPS and PR states, displayed so that their N-terminal subdomains adopt a similar orientation. As expected, the orientation of the converter and lever arm differs in these two states. (<bold>d</bold>) The lever arm has been built in these two states of the motor, revealing the structure of the two bound light chains, PfELC and MTIP, displayed here in a similar orientation. The kink in the lever arm helix at the end of the converter (pliant region in orange; last helix of the converter in deep olive green) induces different converter/PfELC interfaces in the PPS (interface A, left) compared to the PR state (interface B, right). To illustrate that the two interfaces are different, two reporter residues are displayed as spheres, A722 from the converter and V83 from PfELC. These residues are the part of interface A but not the part of interface B.

The nucleotide free state, strongly bound to actin, is called rigor. Binding of ATP in the rigor state detaches the head from actin. Upon detachment, the motor first populates the post-rigor state (PR) with ATP bound. Isomerization toward the pre-powerstroke state (PPS) allows ATP hydrolysis. This state binds weakly to actin. The sequential release of the products of hydrolysis drives the lever arm swing and thus the powerstroke, which generates force. Detachment of the motor upon ATP binding starts a new cycle. (<bold>b</bold>) PfMyoA properties are tuned by a phosphorylation in the N-terminal extension of the motor domain (SEP19). When the motor is phosphorylated, it moves actin with a high velocity spending a short fraction of the cycle strongly bound to actin. When the motor is dephosphorylated, it produces more force at the expense of speed. (<bold>c</bold>) and (<bold>d</bold>) show the mechanism of force production in scallop myosin 2 (ScMyo2) and PfMyoA, respectively. In ScMyo2, the mobility of the SH1-helix is a key element for the mechanism driving the powerstroke of most myosins and requires the presence of a conserved glycine (G695), the so-called fulcrum, at the basis of the SH1-helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinose et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Preller et al., 2011</xref>). In PfMyoA, the SH1-helix is immobile, due to the presence of a serine at the fulcrum (S691). The lack of mobility of the fulcrum is compensated by a phosphorylatable N-terminal extension (SEP19) and sequence adaptations in the connector.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60581-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>The crystal structure of the PfMyoA-PR state displays a kink at the pliant region.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overall structure of PfMyoA•ΔNter-PR.

Structural reorganization initiated at the active site is transmitted allosterically by connectors, and amplified by the lever arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, c and d</xref>) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robert-Paganin et al., 2020</xref>). We recently solved the X-ray structures of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> MyoA motor domain in three states of this ATPase cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>), which revealed how the lack of consensus residues in the connectors is compensated by the presence of a unique N-terminal extension of the heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser19 within this extension directly tunes speed and force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>). The motor moves actin at high-speed and exerts low ensemble force when phosphorylated; conversely, it produces more force at the expense of slower speed when unphosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). According to this model, phosphorylated PfMyoA would allow the parasite to move at high velocity during motile stages such as the sporozoites, and when unphosphorylated, would provide the high force necessary for merozoites to enter erythrocytes in invasive stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The motor domain is not the only region of PfMyoA lacking myosin consensus sequences. The lever arm typically contains ‘IQ motifs’ (consensus sequence IQxxxRGxxxR) that binds light chains or calmodulin. In PfMyoA, both the first IQ motif and the PfELC that binds to it are so degenerate in their sequence that the existence of an essential light chain was only recently recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bookwalter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The structure of MTIP in complex with a Plasmodium IQ2 peptide is the only structural information available for the PfMyoA lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Douse et al., 2012</xref>). Further structures are required to establish how interactions between the motor domain and the lever arm influence the overall dynamics and properties of the motor.</p><p>Here, we present the X-ray structures of full-length (FL) PfMyoA complexed to PfELC and MTIP in two states of the motor cycle. These structures, together with molecular dynamics and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), reveal the specific orientation of the lever arm in the pre-powerstroke state (PPS). This atypical priming, which enables a larger powerstroke, is stabilized by the converter and PfELC forming specific interactions with the motor domain. Kinetic and motility assays on mutant PfMyoA constructs show how the specific priming and unique sequence adaptations tune the motor properties of this atypical myosin. The lever arm structure explains how the PfELC and MTIP light chains evolved to recognize degenerate IQ motifs. The PfELC, a weak link in forming a fully functional motor, is shown here to be essential for red blood cell invasion, thus providing a novel target for the design of anti-malarial compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FL structures of PfMyoA reveal a specific priming of the lever arm</title><p>We determined the crystal structures of FL PfMyoA with two light chains bound (PfMyoA/PfELC/MTIP-Δn) in the post-rigor (PfMyoA•FL-PR) and in the pre-powerstroke (PfMyoA•FL-PPS) states at 2.5 Å and 3.9 Å resolution, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). To investigate the structural consequences of the deletion of the N-terminal extension (N-ter) of the PfMyoA heavy chain (HC), we also crystallized the truncated construct (PfMyoA-ΔNter/PfELC/MTIP-Δn). The structure was solved in the post-rigor (PR) state at 3.3 Å resolution (PfMyoA•ΔNter-PR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>). In all the constructs, MTIP was truncated and lacking the N-terminal extension (residues 1–60) because this extension is predicted to be intrinsically disordered. For all three structures, the electron density was well-defined for the motor domain and the lever arm, in particular for the interfaces between the HC and the PfELC and the interface between the two light chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>These structures allow the description of the lever arm that was not present in the previously published PfMyoA motor domain (MD) structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>).

In the PPS states, crystallized with ADP and Pi analogs, however, the converter orientation is less primed by ~30° in the MD structure compared with that found in the FL structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>). SAXS experiments validated that the PPS of PfMyoA adopts the more primed orientation in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>). The MD structure with ADP.VO<sub>4</sub> bound thus likely corresponds to an intermediate state populated during the recovery stroke, close to that of the fully primed PPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c and d</xref>).

These residues are part of the environment between the Relay and SH1 helix, two critical connectors for the control of converter repriming and the powerstroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The presence of S691 at the base of the SH1 helix, which is typically a glycine in all other myosins, restrains the mobility of the SH1 helix. S691G is the only mutant to date that showed faster in vitro motility and faster ADP release than WT, implying that the mutation destabilizes the strong-ADP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The enhanced speed could be attributed to an increased flexibility of the SH1 helix or a decrease in steric hindrance that favors converter movement, resulting in faster ADP release. The maximal actin-activated ATPase activity was half that of WT and not rate-limited by ADP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). S691 is involved in the communication between the Relay and the SH1 helices by maintaining an electrostatic bond with <sup>Relay</sup>Q494, which is part of the sequence compensation specific to PfMyoA. This bond is formed in the PR and PPS states but must be lost during the powerstroke. The absence of this bond in the mutant could reduce actin-activated ATPase because of altered communication between the connectors that affects the kinetics of the transitions in the motor cycle, introducing a slower step most likely early in the powerstroke. The nine-fold higher basal ATPase activity in the absence of actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) indicates that the pre-powerstroke (PPS) state of the mutant is less stable than WT, while the similar rate of dissociation of acto-PfMyoA by MgATP implies that the stability of the rigor state and the transition to PR are like WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The mutant retains the ability to undergo conformational transitions when bound to actin under strain, with a modestly enhanced ensemble force (1.4-fold) compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The role Ser691 plays in PfMyoA is thus to stabilize the PPS state and to slow the steps that are involved in rearrangements on F-actin to control the powerstroke.</p><p>Thr586 from the Wedge was replaced by the bulkier aromatic residue Phe that is present in conventional myosins (T586F). The wedge guides the movement of the relay-helix and the SH1-helix connectors depending on L50 subdomain movements that result from events in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). This mutation had relatively little effect on in vitro motility speed or on ADP-release rates compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), despite the fact that the bulkier Phe would likely reduce the mobility around the wedge due to steric hindrance and thus impede the communication between the active site and the lever arm during the lever arm swing. The rate-limiting step for motility is not the first transition of the powerstroke that leads to the strong-ADP state on actin, but the following ADP-release step, which is not affected by this mutation. Rearrangements near the wedge thus play a minor role for ADP release, consistent with previous structural results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>). The ~40% faster transition to the PR state suggests that rigor is slightly destabilized, while the elevated basal ATPase indicates a reduced stability of the PPS state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The reduced maximal actin-activated ATPase activity of the mutant indicates that other transitions in the motor cycle have slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Similar to the other two point mutants (E6R and S691G), its ability to generate motion under force was better than WT, implying more time spent in actin-bound states of the powerstroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

In addition, the inter-lobe linker is shorter than canonical ELCs and forms an internal hairpin-like structure, that interacts strongly with the N-lobe and does not contact residues of the HC helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>).

In particular, PfIQ1 lacks the glutamine and the proximal arginine that makes specific polar interactions with the C-lobe intra-lobe linker (between α6 and α7) in other myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Houdusse and Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In PfMyoA, these two residues are replaced by a valine (V781) and a glutamate (E785), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). While they also bind the intra-lobe linker of the semi-open C-lobe, the change in the nature of these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>) results in a shift of the position of the intra-lobe linker relative to the HC helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>). Interestingly, compared to other myosins, the IQ1 motif starts one residue earlier in the PfMyoA HC sequence because a HC residue is missing in the pliant region at the end of the converter. This feature, in addition to a kink in the pliant region itself, contributes to a different orientation of the PfIQ1 HC helix (and thus the PfELC C-lobe) compared with other myosins when the converter regions are superimposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). A different converter/ELC interface is thus established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>) and specific recognition of the semi-open C-lobe occurs both by its interaction with the converter and with the HC helix. An atypical Trp (W777) in this helix strengthens the hydrophobic interactions between PfIQ1 and PfELC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). Conventional myosins have a smaller side chain (I782) that interacts weakly with the C-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

These interactions between W777 and the α5* and α5’* helices are not present in the folded-back PR structure that displays a much larger kink at the pliant region and thus moves W777 away. The absence of electron density for the two helical turns of α5* and α5’* in this crystal structure indicates that lack of stabilization by the converter and the W777 side chain affects the fold of these atypical PfELC structural elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

We describe below the converter/PfELC interface (interface A) seen in the PfMyoA•FL-PPS crystal structure, which is similar to the solution structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e–h</xref>).</p><p>The shift in the PfELC position as compared with other myosins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) results in a different converter/ELC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). In canonical myosins, the converter/ELC interface is established between residues from the converter and the α5 helix and includes mainly polar and few apolar interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In PfMyoA, a more rigid interface forms because it involves mainly hydrophobic contributions from the α5*, α5’*, and α6 helices whose conformations are stabilized by W777 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The PfELC/MTIP interface is also mainly hydrophobic, involving residues from the MTIP α5 and α6 helices (H150, F151, I167, W171) and residues from the PfELC α1 helix and the following loop1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Interestingly, this interaction is possible only after the formation of a ~ 130° kink in the HC helix between the two IQs motifs of the PfMyoA lever arm. The kink is facilitated by proline (<sup>HC</sup>P802) and is similar in all molecules of the asymmetric units of the structural states we crystallized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>). The contacts at the MTIP/PfELC interface contribute to stabilizing the kink and providing a specific conserved feature for this rather rigid lever arm.</p><p>To further investigate the dynamics of the PfMyoA lever arm, we performed molecular dynamics with explicit solvent on the PfMyoA•FL-PPS structure, an approach successfully used to investigate other myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robert-Paganin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>). The first insight from this experiment is that priming of the PfMyoA lever arm is maintained throughout the time course. Even if the lever arm position slightly diverges at the beginning of the simulation, the priming is restored quickly and thus stays stable during the entire simulation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). As expected, the converter/PfELC and PfELC/MTIP interfaces are rigid. All the hydrophobic interactions between PfELC and MTIP are maintained during the simulation and the Converter/PfELC interface is more rigid as compared with conventional myosins (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). In β-cardiac myosin, the converter/ELC interface displays a controlled dynamic driven by labile polar interactions, the so-called ‘musical chairs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robert-Paganin et al., 2018</xref>). These interactions between charged residues are located at the pliant region, and involve the α5 helix of the ELC and the specific top-loop of the converter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The dynamic associations between the musical chairs govern the flexibility of the converter/ELC interface and the conformations allowed for the top-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robert-Paganin et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, in PfMyoA, most of the converter/ELC interface is hydrophobic and the bulky W777 introduces rigidity at this interface. The only musical chairs of the PfMyoA lever arm are located in two regions. Charged residues from the top-loop (E725 and D726) interact alternatively with residues of the α6 helix (<sup>PfELC</sup>D88, <sup>PfELC</sup>N89), restricting the top-loop conformation. Other musical chairs involve residues from the converter (D720; K773 and E776) with polar residues from the α5* and α5’* helices (<sup>α5*</sup>N75; <sup>α5’*</sup>N77; <sup>α5’*</sup>E78; <sup>α5’*</sup>Q79) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

The two sets of mutations are expected to disrupt the converter/MD interface and thus to reduce the priming of the PPS. Both triple mutants greatly impact and tune the properties of the motor similarly: they reduce the maximum actin-activated ATPase to ~30% of WT, and decrease both in vitro motility speed and the ADP release rate to a similar extent (~35% of WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). The decreased ADP-release rate implies that these converter residues play a role in the stability of the strong-ADP state the motor populates when attached to actin. It is likely that a smaller step size also contributes to the reduced speed at which the mutant motor moves actin, because in silico studies show that the AAA mutant fails to maintain the WT lever arm orientation, although the Converter stays oriented in a primed orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The PfELC is essential for <italic>Plasmodium</italic> invasion</title><p>As described above, the PfELC is uniquely suited to bind to the degenerate IQ motif and is also engaged in stabilizing the unusual priming of this motor, as well as being an essential element to maintain the rigidity of the lever arm.

Integration of the introns did not affect parasite asexual growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Treatment with rapamycin, inducing DiCre dimerization and gene excision, led to gene truncation (as validated by PCR <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Truncation was also confirmed by immunoblot and immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b, c and d</xref>).

The PPS-FL structure of the PfMyoA motor reveals how critical adaptations in the converter and PfELC play a central role in defining and stabilizing the PPS lever arm orientation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the lever arm of PfMyoA is ~30° more primed upon reattachment to the actin track than it is in conventional class II myosins. Designed from structural insights, in vitro and in silico experiments reveal that specific interactions stabilize the priming of PfMyoA and define specific adaptations tuning the properties of this motor. These interactions are not present in ScMyo2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Myo10 and Myo1c are two motors for which the lever arm priming position is also large in the PPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Münnich et al., 2014</xref>), but their lever arm orientation is stabilized by a different set of interactions when compared with PfMyoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The contribution of the transducer in the stabilization of the primed lever arm also differs in the three myosins. It is thus tempting to speculate that the nature of these interactions will tune each motor for its specific functions. Increasing the amplitude of the lever arm priming could be a way to lengthen the step size of the motor and thus to increase the speed at which it can move actin. This is consistent with the reduced speed of in vitro motility obtained with PfMyoA mutants designed to reduce the priming of the lever arm as well as data for Myo10 indicating that this motor is tuned for performing large steps on actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>). Specific interactions with the transducer may also be involved in enlarging the stroke and tuning the orientation of the powerstroke for high duty-ratio motors able to resist rearwards load, as with the Myo1b motor that anchors the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2005</xref>). As it is the case for class I myosins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shuman et al., 2014</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenberg et al., 2015</xref>), the duty-ratio of PfMyoA is regulated by a specific N-terminal HC extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>). The observation that converter mutations involved in priming PfMyoA also decrease the ADP-release rate suggests that these converter residues might be involved in facilitating the transitions occurring during the PfMyoA powerstroke.</p><p>Atomic structures of the PfMyoA lever arm indicate how degenerate IQ motifs of the HC are recognized by PfELC and MTIP, as well as how unusual apolar interactions occur between PfELC and the converter. These unusual features could not have been predicted from recently solved TgMyoA structures of the lever arm bound to TgELC or TgELC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pazicky et al., 2019</xref>), because TgELC is a poor model for PfELC considering the low sequence identity (20% and 21% between PfELC and TgELC and TgELC2, respectively). Interestingly, TgELC1 and TgELC2 are homologous to classical ELCs and do not display the specific inter-lobe linker nor the atypical α5* and α5’* helices found in PfELC, which are also part of the interface with the Converter. This structural difference illustrates again that Myosin A from different organisms differ in detail due to the high divergence of the different taxa from the Apicomplexa phylum. The structure of PfELC and its specific association with the HC and MTIP also explains the cooperative binding of these elements and why PfELC does not bind to the HC in the absence of MTIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bookwalter et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the structures reveal a sequence shift near the pliant region resulting in a specific orientation of the HC helix to stabilize the converter/PfELC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The PfELC α5* and α5’* helices are involved in this interface but may not be properly folded prior to its establishment. In addition, PfELC cannot surround the IQ1 motif due to its unusual inter-lobe linker, which may contribute to diminishing a stable association with the HC. According to this hypothesis, PfMTIP may need to bind first to the IQ2 motif and its presence could add stabilizing interactions to cooperatively recruit PfELC to the PfIQ1 motif via formation of the interfaces with PfMTIP and the Converter, allowing stabilization of the PfELC α5* and α5’* helices. PfELC is thus a weak point in the assembly of the fully functional motor complex, and compounds targeting PfELC may be a good strategy for decreasing motor activity. PfMyoA lacking the ELC moves actin at half the speed of the motor containing both light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bookwalter et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, the ensemble force of PfMyoA lacking the PfELC is comparable to that of the motor with both light chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This is in contrast to what was seen with skeletal muscle myosin, in which the absence of the ELC results in a twofold reduction in isometric force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">VanBuren et al., 1994</xref>). One possibility is that the atypical priming of the PfMyoA lever arm in the PPS state, which results from several interactions that are not present in conventional myosins, is responsible for allowing force to remain high in the absence of the ELC. It should be noted that video microscopy showed that PfELC cKO merozoites can still deform red blood cells, unlike cKO of PfMyoA heavy chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake et al., 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, cKO of either PfMyoA or PfELC left merozoites entirely incapable of invasion. The reduced speed of PfMyoA in vitro without PfELC may thus be sufficient to disrupt invasion. Alternative possibilities are that in vivo other factors need to be considered that are not assessed by the in vitro assays. In vivo, the lack of the PfELC may result in proteolysis that would effectively decrease the number of functional motors. In addition, the shortened neck in the absence of the PfELC may not allow the motor to reach the actin filaments as effectively as the WT does, within the constraints of the space between the plasma membrane and inner membrane complex.</p><p>Taken together, the data presented here reveal important new findings about the PfMyoA motor, and how the lever arm is involved in tuning the specific mechano-properties of this atypical myosin. While the N-terminal HC extension of PfMyoA is involved in regulating the transition between the strong -ADP and the rigor states, the sequence adaptations located in the relay, the SH1-helix or the wedge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>) influence other structural transitions essential for motor function. We show that the overall stabilization of the PPS differs in this myosin compared with all other myosins in the superfamily. Control of the recovery and powerstroke transitions differ in detail although the overall sequence allows conservation of the essential properties of a motor: the ability to couple the lever arm priming with ATP hydrolysis and control of the powerstroke via interaction with F-actin, associated with sequential controlled release of the products phosphate and ADP.</p><p>Lastly, we have also demonstrated that PfELC, like PfMyoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>), is essential in parasite asexual invasion of the red blood cell and therefore a second attractive target within the glideosome for targeting malaria parasite asexual replication, where absence of either alone or in combination would block red blood cell entry. While strategies to disrupt the glideosome have already been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perrin et al., 2018</xref>), inhibition of the PfMyoA motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>) or the association of the PfELC light chain opens up new strategies toward therapeutic solutions. Importantly, the structures described here provide a precise blueprint for designing just such small molecules that could prevent binding of PfELC or target PfMyoA full-length motor activity and thus diminish glideosome function. These results inform the design of new therapies that specifically target life-cycle progression in the pathogenic blood stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>Full-length PfMyoA heavy chain (PlasmoDB ID PF3D7_1342600/GenBank accession number XM_001350111.1), with Sf9 cell preferred codons, was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac (pFB) (Thermo Fisher).

Heavy chain mutants (point mutants E6R, T586F, S691G; triple mutants R707A/E711A/Y714A and R707L/E711R/Y714A) were generated on this backbone using site directed mutagenesis. An N-terminal truncation of MTIP (MTIP-Δn, residues 1-E60 deleted and an N-terminal HIS tag), and an N-terminal truncation of the heavy chain (ΔN-terminal HC extension (ΔNter), residues 1-S20 deleted) were also cloned for use in constructs that were crystallized. Recombinant baculovirus was produced using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system (Thermo Fisher). The mouse utrophin (NP_035812) clone was a gift from Kathleen Ruppel and James Spudich. It was modified so that utrophin residues 1-H416 were followed by C-terminal biotin and FLAG tags.

Here, Moussaoui et al. report three new crystal structures and associated functional studies of the PfMyoA complex. Specifically, they determined the structures of an N-terminally truncated pfMyoA in the post-rigor state (3.3A), as well as full-length PfMyoA with both light chains bound in the post-rigor and the pre-power stroke conformations at 2.5 Å and 3.9 Å, respectively. The authors also simulated WT versus structure-based mutant motions using MD, and fit their solution-state shapes using SAXS to identify the orientation and range-of-motion of the lever-arm in the pre-power stroke state. Using their structures as a foundation, they go on to generate mutant PfMyoA motors and compare their kinetic and motility assays with the WT complex. This analysis confirmed the altered properties of the mutants and suggested how lever arm &quot;priming&quot; contributes to the unique mechanochemical properties of PfMyoA. The two states of the full-length PfMyoA in complex with PfELC and MTIP further enabled the authors to determine how the &quot;degenerate&quot; IQ motifs of the lever arm engage PfELC and MTIP. Finally, using knockout genetic studies, the authors nicely demonstrate that PfELC is requisite for a functional glidesome and that without it, the parasite cannot invade red blood cells. Pending the resolution of mostly minor issues, this work will be of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers because of its insights into malaria pathogenesis and motor protein biophysics.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors point out that the 'folded-back' position of the lever arm in the post rigor state is not primarily populated in solution (demonstrated by SAXS experiments) and argue that this state is selected/stabilized by crystal contacts. What is the primary motive to discuss this result with a figure and again in the subsection “Specific recognition of the degenerate IQ motifs in the atypical PfMyoA Lever Arm” in terms of the contacts between W777 and the α5 helices of the PfELC. It is not clear from the manuscript how significant the 'folded-back' position for this study. If this state arises from crystal packing artifacts, are the authors arguing that this state is functionally essential but too transient to capture in solution? Please clarify.</p><p>2) Prior work (Bookwalter et al., 2017), showed that in the absence of PfELC, PfMyoA-MTIP could move actin filaments at a velocity of ~1.8 µm/s and had an ATPase Vmax of ~130 s<sup>-1</sup>. These data suggest that PfMyoA is still functional without PfELC. However, in this study, a conditional knockout of the Pfelc gene led to a ~complete ablation of red blood cell invasion. Please cite and discuss these data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60581.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors point out that the 'folded-back' position of the lever arm in the post rigor state is not primarily populated in solution (demonstrated by SAXS experiments) and argue that this state is selected/stabilized by crystal contacts.

The conclusion is that the pliant region is unlikely to kink in a significant manner. This can be seen as a minor point compared to the rest of what is presented in the paper, but it is also a way to extend our understanding of how stable the Converter/ELC interactions are. This information is important to define the angles explored by the lever arm in each structural states explored during the motor cycle. Whether the pliant region could play a role in an auto-inhibited form of the motor and the characterization on how the Converter/ELC interface could allow the lever arm to uncouple under strain was the primary motive but since SAXS excludes the presence of this form in a significant amount, we do not discuss this further in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Prior work (Bookwalter et al., 2017), showed that in the absence of PfELC, PfMyoA-MTIP could move actin filaments at a velocity of ~1.8 µm/s and had an ATPase Vmax of ~130 s<sup>-1</sup>.

We thus performed ensemble force measurements expecting to see a reduction, but the data showed that the force was very similar to the motor with both light chains (new Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). This is unlike what was seen with skeletal muscle myosin lacking the ELC that showed a 2-fold reduction in isometric force (VanBuren et al., 1994). One possibility that we plan to pursue in the future is whether the atypical priming of the PfMyoA lever arm in the PPS state, which results from several interactions that are not present in conventional myosins, is responsible for allowing force to remain high in the absence of the ELC.</p><p>It should be noted that a recent pre-print by two of the co-authors (Blake et al., 2020) showed via video microscopy that PfELC cKO merozoites can still deform red blood cells, unlike cKO of PfMyoA heavy chain. Nonetheless, cKO of either PfMyoA or PfELC left merozoites entirely incapable of invasion. The reduced speed of PfMyoA in vitro without PfELC may thus be sufficient to disrupt invasion. Alternative possibilities are that in vivo other factors need to be considered that are not assessed by the in vitro assays. Perhaps in vivo the lack of the PfELC allows proteolysis to occur that would effectively decrease the number of functional motors, or that the shortened neck in the absence of the PfELC does not allow the motor to reach the actin filaments as effectively as the WT does within the constraints of the space between the plasma membrane and inner membrane complex. These possibilities are mentioned in the Discussion at the end of the third paragraph as follows:</p><p>“Surprisingly, the ensemble force of PfMyoA lacking the PfELC is comparable to that of the motor with both light chains (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E). […] In addition, the shortened neck in the absence of the PfELC may not allow the motor to reach the actin filaments as effectively as the WT does, within the constraints of the space between the plasma membrane and inner membrane complex.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
