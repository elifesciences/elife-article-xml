Chronic pain-related memory impairment has susceptible and unsusceptible features. Therefore, exploring the underlying mechanisms of its vulnerability is essential for developing effective treatments. Here, combining two spatial memory tests (Y-maze test and Morris water maze), we segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations in a chronic neuropathic pain model induced by chronic constrictive injury of the sciatic nerve. RNA-Seq analysis and gain/loss-of-function study revealed that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is a determinant for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment. Knockdown of the S1PR1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) promoted a susceptible phenotype and led to structural plasticity changes of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology as observed in susceptible mice, while overexpression of the S1PR1 and pharmacological administration of S1PR1 agonist in the DG promoted an unsusceptible phenotype and prevented the occurrence of memory impairment, and rescued the morphological abnormality. Finally, the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and biochemical evidence indicated that downregulation of S1PR1 in susceptible mice may impair DG structural plasticity via interaction with actin cytoskeleton rearrangement-related signaling pathways including Itga2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade. These results reveal a novel mechanism and provide a promising preventive and therapeutic molecular target for vulnerability to chronic pain-related memory impairment.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that chronic pain impairs memory or accelerates memory decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whitlock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). Memory impairment is also a potential contributing factor to the maintenance of chronic pain and poor treatment response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiech, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moriarty et al., 2011</xref>). Although memory deficits in chronic pain patients are substantial and common, some clinical observations indicate high heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whitlock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Innes and Sambamoorthi, 2020</xref>), suggesting that chronic pain-related memory impairment exhibits susceptible and unsusceptible features. However, few preclinical studies model this clinical scenario and explore its underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Findings from both human and animal studies have indicated that cognitive dysfunction associated with chronic pain is linked to structural and functional deficits within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tajerian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tajerian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mutso et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, the dentate gyrus (DG), as part of the hippocampus, plays a crucial role in memory formation processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>). The DG has been postulated to perform a variety of mnemonic tasks, such as pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>), novelty detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunsaker et al., 2008</xref>), and processing information related to spatial contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Jung, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the impact of pain-related cognitive syndromes on the dendritic morphologies of DG neurons, such as dendritic complexity, is inconsistent across different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tajerian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tajerian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tyrtyshnaia and Manzhulo, 2020</xref>), and the molecular mechanisms remain minimally understood. The principal cell type of the DG is the dentate granule cells (DGCs), which are divided into immature and mature ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>). Immature newborn DGCs undergo neurogenesis and play key roles in learning and memory due to their high excitability and enhanced synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kempermann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ninkovic et al., 2007</xref>). Our previous study found that mice with chronic pain-related memory impairment showed significantly reduced adult neurogenesis in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). Contrarily, mature DGCs are less excitable and exhibit reduced synaptic plasticity to an extent, but emerging evidence suggests that this cell population is equally recruited in memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tronel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramirez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). It is intriguing to understand how mature DGCs would change in the state of chronic pain and by what molecular mechanism they facilitate chronic pain-related memory impairment.</p><p>Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, functioning as a key signaling molecule in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell division, adhesion, migration, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiegel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel and Milstien, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2022</xref>). S1P acts both through extracellular and intracellular modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spiegel and Milstien, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maceyka et al., 2012</xref>). In its extracellular mode, increasing evidence has suggested that the S1P system is a modulator of pain and memory processing pathways through S1P receptors 1–5 (S1PR1–5), particularly S1PR1. For instance, in models of traumatic nerve injury, astrocyte-mediated S1PR1 neuroinflammation contributes to central sensitization through increased S1P production and IL-1β release in the spinal cord, and beneficial effects of pain alleviation can be observed following IL-10-dependent S1PR1 antagonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). While there is evidence on S1P signaling regulating pain perception in the spinal cord, its role in higher pain centers remains largely unexplored. In regard to S1P function in memory processing, a recent study has hinted at the possibility of CNS S1PR1 agonism in the cellular repositioning of new DGCs and in regulating the integration of new neurons into pre-existing circuits, which may govern the process of memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, activation of S1PR1 after traumatic brain injury in rats can significantly enhance neurogenesis and neurocognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, increasing evidence suggests that the S1P receptor signaling pathway has profound effects on the regulation of synaptic strength, including modulating synaptic architecture and plasticity, and mediating excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riganti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitroi et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is limited understanding regarding the involvement of S1P signaling in chronic pain-related memory impairment, as well as the interactive pathways that may underlie the effects.</p><p>In the present study, by employing an array of techniques including rodent-based behavioral tests, RNA-Seq, imaging, pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we elucidated a pivotal role of S1PR1 within the hippocampal DG in the context of chronic pain-associated memory impairment. Memory impairment-susceptible mice exhibited decreased S1PR1 expression in the hippocampal DG. Knockdown of S1PR1 in the DG facilitated the development of a vulnerable phenotype and led to abnormal structural plasticity in DGCs. Conversely, overexpression of S1PR1 or pharmacological administration of an S1PR1 agonist in the DG, promoted an unsusceptible phenotype, thereby averting the onset of memory impairment, and alleviated morphological abnormalities in DGCs. Subsequent mechanistic investigation demonstrated that, loss of S1PR1 in the DG results in actin dysregulation via interaction with integrin α2 (ITGA2) and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade, leading to abnormal structural synaptic plasticity and ultimately causes memory impairment. Taken together, this study identified potential molecular mechanisms and promising therapeutic targets for preventing and treating vulnerability to memory impairment associated with chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Segregation of chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations</title><p>We utilized sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI) in C57BL/6J mice to model chronic pain state and tested the memory performance of mice with chronic neuropathic pain.

After assigning each data point to its closest <italic>k</italic>-center, we drew a median between both the centroids as a cutoff value. One cluster, including mice displaying a ratio of time more than the cutoff value, was defined as the unsusceptible mouse cluster. The other cluster, including mice exhibiting a ratio of time less than the cutoff value, was defined as the susceptible mouse cluster. Using this algorithm, a ratio of 40% (percent time spent in the novel arm) and a ratio of 36% (percent time in the target quadrant) were set as cutoff values for Y-maze test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left) and MWM test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left), respectively. Accordingly, in the Y-maze test, 43% of CCI-Chronic mice were unsusceptible, and the remaining 57% were susceptible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right). In the MWM test, 52% of CCI-Chronic mice were unsusceptible, and 48% were susceptible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, right).</p><p>We then used a four-quadrant chart to plot the data of CCI-Chronic mice memory performance for examining the consistency between the two behavioral assays. One variable, the percent time in the quadrant, was represented on the <italic>x</italic>-axis, and another variable, the percent time in the novel arm, was represented on the <italic>y</italic>-axis. The quadrants are determined by dividing the chart into four parts based on the cutoff values of Y-maze and MWM tests. As shown in the chart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, left), quadrants 1 (top right) and 3 (bottom left), respectively, displayed unsusceptible and susceptible mice in both Y-maze and MWM tests, while quadrants 2 (top left) and 4 (bottom right) displayed mice unsusceptible in one test but susceptible in the other one. The bar graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, right) showed that the majority of CCI-Chronic mice exhibited consistent memory performance in the two behavioral tests (susceptible: 47%; unsusceptible: 43%), and only 10% of mice displayed susceptibility in a single test (Y-maze: 8%; MWM, 2%), suggesting good agreement between the two different assays. Given that the MWM test cannot be conducted once a week for multiple repeated measurements for the same batch of mice, the Y-maze test was used to investigate the duration of memory impairment induced by chronic pain. The results showed that memory impairment can last at least 63 days post CCI surgery, providing a workable time window for further investigations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether the susceptibility or insusceptibility to memory impairment in mice with chronic pain is associated with the pain threshold.

These proteins promote filopodia formation by stimulating actin polymerization through WAVE and the ARP2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donati and Bruni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Green and Cyster, 2012</xref>). Additionally, we analyzed the RNA-Seq data to identify genes that may be involved in S1PR1-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics in our animal model. In the KEGG analysis comparing Sham versus susceptible mice and the trend analysis (Sham versus unsusceptible versus susceptible mice), integrin α2 (encoded by Itga2) was found to be enriched and downregulated among cell adhesion molecules and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). Integrins serve as linkers between the extracellular matrix and intracellular actin cytoskeleton, mediating cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorno-Cruz and Liu, 2019</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether S1P/S1PR1 induces structural plasticity in susceptible mice by regulating actin dynamics in the DG. To address this, we verified the expression levels of actin regulatory proteins, including RAC1, CDC42, ARP2, ARP3, and ITGA2, in 7-day CCI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref>), unsusceptible mice, and susceptible mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E, F</xref>). To figure out the regulation is specifically S1PR1-dependent, but not through other S1PRs and Rho GTPase, we also checked the expression level of S1PR2 and Rho GTPase RhoA which interacts with S1PR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donati and Bruni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reinhard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed a significant decrease in the levels of RAC1, CDC42, ARP2, ARP3, and ITGA2 in susceptible mice, but not in Sham and unsusceptible mice. As expected, there is no change in the expression level of S1PR2 and RhoA in CCI animals. To determine whether the reduction in levels of these proteins is associated with downregulated S1PR1 signaling, we examined lysates of hippocampal DG tissue extracted from S1PR1 DG conditional knockdown mice, revealing decreased levels of RAC1, CDC42, ARP2, ARP3, and ITGA2 as assayed by WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G, H</xref>). Conversely, S1PR1 overexpression in the DG led to increased levels of RAC1, CDC42, ARP2, ARP3, and ITGA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I, J</xref>). These data indicate that S1pr1 functions upstream of Rac1, Cdc42, Arp2/3, and Itga2. Given a previous study suggesting the involvement of an isoform of integrin ITGB4 in S1pr1-mediated Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ephstein et al., 2013</xref>), our results raise the possibility that dysregulated actin rearrangement elicited by S1PR1 downregulation in the DG may be influenced by Itga2-dependent activation of the Rac1/Cdc42 signaling cascade and Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Susceptible mice, S1PR1-knockdown mice, and S1PR1 overexpression mice exhibit altered CDC42/RAC1 activity, ARP2/3-dependent actin signaling and engage ITGA2 in the dentate granule cells (DGCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bubble diagram showing significant enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in top 20 KEGG pathways for Sham versus susceptible mice.

The polymerization of monomeric actin (G-actin) into actin filaments (F-actin) to form the actin cytoskeleton frequently occurs primarily at or near the plasma membrane. The organization of actin filaments determines the shape, stiffness, and movement of the cell surface and also facilitates spine morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper, 2000</xref>). Thus, we first examined actin polymerization by quantifying the transition from G- to F-actin transition. Densitometric analysis of F-/G-actin western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B</xref>) indicated a significant decrease in the relative percentage of F-actin in the DG of susceptible mice compared with that of Sham and unsusceptible mice. Immunofluorescence observations using a fluorescently conjugated phalloidin, which binds only to F-actin, revealed that HT-22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells with knockdown of S1PR1 had accumulated F-actin aggregates mostly around the nuclei and lost the majority of the thinner filament bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) compared with control cells. Similarly, we utilized primary hippocampal cells to investigate the neuron morphology and distribution of F-actin. We observed less branches and accumulated F-actin aggregates rather than diffused distribution compared with control cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether S1PR1 regulates actin polymerization via interaction with ITGA2. We conducted yeast two-hybrid screening in vitro and a co-immunoprecipitation assay in vivo to examine the interaction between the two proteins. To identify putative interaction between S1PR1 and ITGA2, the full sequences of S1PR1 (cloned into the pBT3-STE vector) and ITGA2 (cloned into the pPR3-C vector) were used as bait and prey, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The auto-activation test showed that positive controls (the pNubG-Fe65 and pTSU2-APP vector together) grew on the DDO (SD/-Trp/-Leu), TDO (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His), and QDO (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade) plates. Meanwhile, the negative control (the pPR3-N and pTSU2-APP vectors together), the pPR3-N empty vector, and the pBT3-STE vector with S1pr1 grew on the DDO and TDO but not on the QDO plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results indicated that S1PR1 did not exhibit auto-activation activity in yeast. Next, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed by co-transforming pBT3-STE-S1pr1 and pPR3-C-Itga2 in the NMY51 yeast strain. Yeast cells harboring both S1pr1 and Itga2 grew vigorously on both DDO media and QDO/X-gal media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Additionally, in a CoIP assay, total protein extracts from the mice DG were immunoprecipitated by the anti-S1PR1-specific antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting probed with the anti-S1PR1 and anti-ITGA2 antibodies with immunoglobulin G as the negative control. The in vivo CoIP assay showed that S1PR1 interacts with ITGA2 in the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). The above results indicated that S1PR1 may physically interact with ITGA2. To determine the functional interaction between S1PR1 and ITGA2 in regulating chronic pain-related memory impairment, a recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9 (AAV2/9) expressing a small hairpin RNA targeting <italic>Itga2</italic> was generated (rAAV-CaMKIIa-EGFP-5′miR-30a-shRNA (<italic>Itga2</italic>)-3′-miR30a-WPREs, the sequence of shRNA referred to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

We first confirmed the knockdown efficiency of the virus in the hippocampal DG using WB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>).

To further demonstrate that S1PR1 and ITGA2 participate in the same pathway, we knocked down the two proteins at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9L, M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4</xref>). As expected, it did not elicit addictive effects on behavioral tests of Y-maze and MWM tests compared to the knockdown of each one of them in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9N, O</xref>).

We established a paradigm to segregate mice with chronic pain into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations. Susceptible mice displayed long-lasting memory impairment 21 days after CCI surgery, while unsusceptible mice continued to maintain normal memory function. Importantly, TEM and Golgi staining assays revealed that susceptible mice exhibited signs of reduced excitatory synapse formation and abnormal spine morphology in the brain area of the hippocampal DG involved in cognition/memory. Interestingly, the phenotypic variability in mice is attributed to dysregulation of S1P/S1PR1/integrin α2 signaling-induced disorganization of actin cytoskeleton through the Rac1/Cdc42 signaling and Arp2/3 cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

For example, the hippocampal extracellular matrix exhibits aberrated structural synaptic plasticity connected to deficiencies in working location memory in a mouse model of chronic pain. These deficits are also correlated with decreased hippocampus dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tajerian et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, rodents with neuropathic pain show altered short-term synaptic plasticity related to the decrease in hippocampus volume detected in patients. The anomaly may be the cause of the typical learning and emotional deficiencies seen in people with chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mutso et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the hippocampus regions involved in the processing of pain information show abnormalities in neurite arborization, dendritic length, and dendritic spine architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tyrtyshnaia and Manzhulo, 2020</xref>). Consistently, we found that hippocampal DG neurons displayed decreased excitatory synapses and altered spine morphology in susceptible mice. Although extensive investigations have proven the link between hippocampal DG function with memory formation, it remains unclear what regulates the plastic changes in the hippocampal DG, a well-studied brain area responsible for memory formation, and how it participates in the modulation of memory impairment in chronic pain. Interestingly, using RNA-Seq, we detected significant transcriptional downregulation of sphingolipid metabolism in the DG, which we verified at protein levels due to dysregulation of S1P/S1PR1 signaling. A previous study found that the expression of S1PR1 is upregulated in freshly formed DG cells, which is required for neurite arborization and horizontal-to-radial repositioning of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). They also raised a question of whether S1PR1 regulates mature DGC activity. In the current study, we mainly focused on S1P function in mature DGCs. We knocked down DG S1PR1 and found that the loss of S1PR1 in the DG induced more susceptible mice to memory impairment without affecting pain threshold. Additionally, we also overexpressed DG S1PR1 and noticed that it promoted mice to be unsusceptible to memory impairment, similarly irrelevant to sensitivity to thermal pain stimuli. These findings imply that S1PR1 in the DG may exclusively negatively regulate chronic pain-related memory impairment. Nevertheless, CNS S1PR1 activation has also been reported in conditions with cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Squillace et al., 2022</xref>), and peripheral administration of either agonist or functional S1PR1 antagonist can ameliorate spatial memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asle-Rousta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Herein, the mechanisms of action of S1PR1 signaling (agonism or antagonism) with regard to the memory performance remain controversial.</p><p>Furthermore, our study pointed out that S1PR1 activation in the DG may not be involved in the processing of pain. To date, a growing body of evidence has shown that activation of S1P axis at spinal cord triggers the occurrence of peripheral sensitization of pain. Activation of S1PR1 in astrocytes in the spinal cord contributes to neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and mice with astrocyte-specific alterations of S1PR1 in the spinal cord did not experience neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stockstill et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, elevated S1P levels at spinal cord injury sites attract macrophages and microglia, and their activation worsens the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, a S1PR1 antagonist lessens neuropathic pain induced by spinal cord injury by inhibiting neuroinflammation and glial scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamazaki et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast with the evidence available in the spinal cord, the role of S1P signaling in higher pain centers is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Squillace et al., 2020</xref>). The present study provides evidence that in the hippocampal DG, S1P/S1PR1 signaling is irrelevant to pain perception.</p><p>Then how does S1PR1 regulate the structural plasticity in the DG and further affect memory formation in chronic neuropathic pain? Our study provides a notable insight by uncovering an integrin α2-dependent modification of the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of the Rac1/Cdc42 signaling cascade and Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Actin cytoskeleton rearrangement is associated with synapse formation, spine architecture and function, thus affecting numerous processes such as memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). Rho GTPases (RhoA, RAC1, and CDC42) are key regulators of cytoskeleton assembly and are masters in maintaining spine morphology and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu and Lamprecht, 2018</xref>). For example, RAC1 induces branching of actin filaments in lamellipodia by mediating actin polymerization via activating the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchoin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). CDC42 is also an important signaling protein for reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and morphogenesis of cells. Loss of CDC42 causes deficits in synaptic plasticity and remote memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Given the evidence that S1P/S1PR1 modulates significant cytoskeletal rearrangements via actin regulatory proteins of Rho GTPases RAC1 and CDC42, but not through RhoA which interacts with S1PR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donati and Bruni, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reinhard, 2017</xref>), we therefore examined the expression of RAC1 and CDC42 at protein levels. Our findings revealed a significant downregulation of Rac1 and Cdc42 expression in susceptible mice and mice with S1PR1 knockdown in the DG, suggesting that S1PR1 functions upstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the DG. Consistent with this observation, we detected a downregulation of the actin polymerization modulator Arp2/3 complex. Actin remodeling involves the dynamic alterations in actin polymerization that contribute to the structural changes observed at neural synapses. Actin polymerization of the transition of G- into F-actin is crucial for orchestrating all the modifications necessary to facilitate synaptic communication by increasing spine volume. Conversely, the inability to form F-actin results in contrasting outcomes of decreased spine volume and diminished synaptic communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dillon and Goda, 2005</xref>). To further elucidate the causal relationship between DG S1PR1 and actin remodeling, we quantitated F- and G-actin in the mouse DG, and generated a S1PR1 knockdown HT-22 cell line to visualize F-actin by phalloidin staining. Our findings in susceptible mice indicate a significant inhibition of the transition from G- to F-actin, suggesting the involvement of S1P/S1PR1 in DG actin polymerization. RNA-Seq data further revealed that integrin α2 may participate in this regulatory process. Integrins are linkers of the extracellular matrix and intracellular actin cytoskeleton mediating cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miranti and Brugge, 2002</xref>). The concomitant alteration in expression levels of Itga2 with S1PR1, and the physical and functional analysis between the two proteins of S1PR1 and ITGA2, indicate their collaboration in the regulation of cytoskeleton arrangement.</p><p>This study has potential limitations. First, the memory performance in the chronic pain model is exclusively evaluated based on spatial cues which mainly rely on the hippocampal functions. Further validation using various types of memory tests would strengthen the evidence for the categorization of mice into susceptible and unsusceptible subgroups. Additionally, the study would also benefit from a comprehensive exploration on the impact of different types of chronic pain on memory impairment. Different chronic pains including chronic nociceptive pain, chronic neuropathic pain, composite pain, and chronic psychological pain have different pathological mechanisms and impacts on memories. It is worth noting that preclinical and clinical research has demonstrated that the influence of pain intensity on memory function in chronic pain patients remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, future research needs to facilitate the investigation of differences between the various subtypes of chronic pains and comorbid memory impairment. Furthermore, the reliance on animal models may limit the generalizability of the findings to humans. Based on the current data, decreased serum S1P level could be a potential biomarker for evaluating the susceptibility of memory impairment. In future studies, it would be interesting to examine whether S1P levels in the serum of patients with pain is associated with memory impairment. Besides, except for S1PR1 and ITGA2 there are also other potential molecular targets implicated in this study, more work is needed to define their roles on the disease occurrence.</p><p>In summary, our study develops a paradigm for separating the susceptible and unsusceptible subgroups to chronic pain-induced memory impairment and delineates the key role of S1P/S1PR1 signaling in vulnerability to memory impairment. Since there are currently few pharmacological alternatives for the treatment of the comorbidity, these findings may serve as a foundation for the development of optimal preventive and therapeutic medications. Additionally, the strategy this study used to categorize memory impairment susceptibility may inspire new methods for stratifying patient populations in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57BL/6J mice (8–10 weeks old) were housed 4–6 per cage with ad libitum access to food and water, at a constant temperature (22– 25°C) and humidity (40–60%).

In particular, the work starts from a very interesting observation, that WT mice can be divided in susceptible and unsusceptible to memory impairment upon modelling chronic pain with CCI. This observation represents the basis of the work where the authors identify the sphingosine receptor S1PR1 as down-regulated in the dentate gyrus of susceptible animals and demonstrate through an elegant range of experiments involving AAV mediated knockdown or overexpression of S1PR1 that this receptor is involved in the memory impairment observed with chronic pain. Importantly for translational purposes, they also show that activation of S1PR1 through a pharmacological paradigm is able to rescue the memory impairment phenotype.</p><p>The authors also link these defects to reduced dendritic branching and reduced number of mature excitatory synapses in the DG to the memory phenotype.</p><p>They then proceed to explore possible mechanisms downstream of S1PR1 that could explain this reduction in dendritic spines. They identify integrin α2 as an interactor of S1PR1 and show a reduction in several proteins involved in actin dynamic, which is crucial for dendritic spine formation and plasticity.</p><p>They thus hypothesize that the interaction between S1PR1 and Integrin α2 is fundamental for the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and consequently for the polymerisation of actin; a reduction in this pathway upon chronic pain would thus lead to impaired actin polymerisation, synapse formation and thus impaired memory.</p><p>The work is of great interest and the experiments are of very good quality with results of great importance.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have replied satisfactorily to my previous concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99862.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain-related memory impairment by focusing on S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Through behavioural tests (Y-maze and Morris water maze) and RNA-seq analysis, the researchers segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations. They discovered that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is crucial for determining susceptibility to memory impairment, with decreased S1PR1 expression linked to structural plasticity changes and memory deficits.</p><p>Knockdown of S1PR1 in the DG induced a susceptible phenotype, while overexpression or pharmacological activation of S1PR1 promoted resistance to memory impairment and restored normal synaptic structure. The study identifies actin cytoskeleton-related pathways, including ITGA2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, as key mediators of S1PR1's effects, offering new insights and potential therapeutic targets for chronic pain-related cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>This manuscript consists of a comprehensive investigation and significant findings. The study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of chronic pain-related memory impairment, highlighting the critical role of S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The clear identification of S1P/S1PR1 as a potential therapeutic target offers promising avenues for future research and treatment strategies. The manuscript is well-structured, methodologically sound, and presents valuable contributions to the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is well-structured and written in clear, concise language. The flow of information is logical and easy to follow.</p><p>(2) The segregation of mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations is innovative and well-justified. The statistical analyses are robust and appropriate for the data.</p><p>(3) The detailed examination of S1PR1 expression and its impact on synaptic plasticity and actin cytoskeleton reorganization is impressive. The findings are significant and contribute to the understanding of chronic pain-related memory impairment.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed all the issues

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This work from Cui, Pan, Fan, et al explores memory impairment in chronic pain mouse models, a topic of great interest in the neurobiology field. In particular, the work starts from a very interesting observation, that WT mice can be divided into susceptible and unsusceptible to memory impairment upon modelling chronic pain with CCI. This observation represents the basis of the work where the authors identify the sphingosine receptor S1PR1 as down-regulated in the dentate gyrus of susceptible animals and demonstrate through an elegant range of experiments involving AAV-mediated knockdown or overexpression of S1PR1 that this receptor is involved in the memory impairment observed with chronic pain. Importantly for translational purposes, they also show that activation of S1PR1 through a pharmacological paradigm is able to rescue the memory impairment phenotype.</p><p>The authors also link these defects to reduced dendritic branching and a reduced number of mature excitatory synapses in the DG to the memory phenotype.</p><p>They then proceed to explore possible mechanisms downstream of S1PR1 that could explain this reduction in dendritic spines. They identify integrin α2 as an interactor of S1PR1 and show a reduction in several proteins involved in actin dynamic, which is crucial for dendritic spine formation and plasticity.</p><p>They thus hypothesize that the interaction between S1PR1 and Integrin α2 is fundamental for the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 and consequently for the polymerisation of actin; a reduction in this pathway upon chronic pain would thus lead to impaired actin polymerisation, synapse formation, and thus impaired memory.</p><p>The work is of great interest and the experiments are of very good quality with results of great importance. I have however some concerns. The main concern I have relates to the last part of the work, namely Figures 8 and 9, which I feel are not at the same level as the results presented in the previous 7 Figures, which are instead outstanding.</p><p>In particular:</p><p>- In Figure 8, given the reduction in all the proteins tested, the authors need to check some additional proteins as controls. One good candidate could be RhoA, considering the authors say it is activated by S1PR2 and not by S1PR1;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We tested the expression level of RhoA in mice 7 days and 21 days post CCI as negative controls (Supplemental Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In addition to the previous point, could the authors also show that the number of neurons is not grossly different between susceptible and unsusceptible mice? This could be done by simply staining for NeuN or performing a western blot for a neuronal-specific protein (e.g. Map2 or beta3-tubulin);</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed immunofluorescence using NeuN antibody to detect the number of neurons in susceptible and unsusceptible mice. The number is not significantly different between the two populations (Supplementary Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 8, the authors should also evaluate the levels of activated RAC1 and activated Cdc42, which are much more important than just basal levels of the proteins to infer an effect on actin dynamics. This is possible through kits that use specific adaptors to pulldown GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive suggestion. An elevated level and hyperactivation of Rac1 protein are both associated with actin dynamics and dendritic development [1]. We agree that showing the levels of activated RAC1 is better to infer its effect on actin dynamics. Here in Figure 8, the purpose of this experiment is to prove the levels of actin organization related proteins are altered according to the expression level of S1PR1, thus drawing a conclusion that the actin organization was disrupted, but not to specifically emphasize that S1PR1 activated these proteins. We apologize for the confusion made but we think the current data is enough to support the conclusion.</p><p>Thanks again for your advice. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 9C, the experiment is performed in an immortalised cell line. I feel this needs to be performed at least in primary hippocampal neurons;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. As suggested, we performed the experiment in primary hippocampal neurons. Knockdown of <italic>S1pr1</italic> in primary hippocampal neurons induced reduction in the number of branches and filamentous actin. Please refer to the updated Figure 9C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 9D, the authors use a Yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate the interaction between S1PR1 and Integrin α2. However, as the yeast two-hybrid system is based on the proximity of the GAL4 activating domain and the GAL4 binding domain, which are used to activate the transcription of reporter genes, the system is not often used when probing the interaction between transmembrane proteins. Could the authors use other transmembrane proteins as negative controls?;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your question. We apologize for the unclear description in the method part. Traditional yeast two-hybrid system can only detect protein interactions that occur in the nucleus, but cannot detect ones between membrane proteins. Here, we utilized the split-ubiquitin membrane-based Yeast two-hybrid system. Briefly, in the ubiquitin system, ubiquitin, a protein composed of 76 amino acid residues that can mediate the ubiquitination degradation of target proteins by proteasomes, is split into two domains, namely Cub at the C-terminus and NbuG at the N-terminus, which are fused and expressed with the bait protein “Bait” and the prey protein “Prey”, respectively. At the same time, Cub is also fused with transcription factors. If Bait and Prey proteins could bind, Cub and NbuG would be brought together and a complete ubiquitin would be formed, which would be recognized by the proteasome and the fused transcription factor would be cut off and enter the cell nucleus to activate the expression of the reporter gene. We then determine whether the Bait and Prey proteins interact with each other through the growth of the yeast.</p><p>Thanks again for pointing this out. We reworded the method in M&amp;M (Line 678-696).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 9E, the immunoblot is very unconvincing. The bands in the inputs are very weak for both ITGA2 and S1PR1, the authors do not show the enrichment of S1PR1 upon its immunoprecipitation and the band for ITGA2 in the IP fraction has a weird appearance. Were these experiments performed on DG lysates only? If so, I suggest the authors repeat the experiment using the whole brain (or at least the whole hippocampus) so as to have more starting material. Alternatively, if this doesn't work, or in addition, they could also perform the immunoprecipitation in heterologous cells overexpressing the two proteins;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question and suggestion. We used DG lysates from both the dentate gyrus of a single mouse as the starting material. We updated the result which showed clearer bands (Figure 9E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- About the point above, even if the results were convincing, the authors can't say that they demonstrate an interaction in vivo. In co-IP experiments, the interaction is much more likely to occur in the lysate during the incubation period rather than being conserved from the in vivo state. These co-IPs demonstrate the ability of proteins to interact, not necessarily that they do it in vivo. If the authors wanted to demonstrate this, they could perform a Proximity ligation assay in primary hippocampal neurons, using antibodies against S1PR1 and ITGA2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your concern. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) is the gold standard to identify protein-protein interactions [2], and it is one of the most efficient techniques to study these protein-protein interactions in vivo [3]. We repeated the experiment and followed the experimental procedure exactly to avoid the protein interaction due to over-incubation. Over-incubation, particularly at room temperature, may result in non-specific binding and therefore high background, thus we performed Co-IPs at 4°C to preserve protein interactions. We agree that Proximity ligation assay is better suited for studies of endogenously expressed proteins in primary cells [4]. Since we optimized the experiment procedure to avoid non-specific binding and particularly, Co-IP utilized proteins from DG lysates which could validate the specificity of the protein interaction in native tissue, we prefer to keep the Co-IP result in Figure 9E.</p><p>Thanks again for your suggestion. We appreciate your understanding on this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 9H, could the authors increase the N to see if shItga2 causes further KD in the CCI?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we repeated the experiment and increased the N to 6. As shown in the following picture, shItga2 did not cause further KD in the CCI.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99862-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- To conclusively demonstrate that S1PR1 and ITGA2 participate in the same pathway, they could show that knocking down the two proteins at the same time does not have additive effects on behavioral tests compared to the knockdown of each one of them in isolation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. As suggested, we knocked down the two proteins at the same and did not observe additive effects on behavioral tests compared to the knockdown of each one of them in isolation. Please refer to Figure 9L-O.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major concerns:</p><p>- Supplementary Figure 5: the image showing colocalisation between S1PR1 and CamKII is not very convincing. Is the S1PR1 antibody validated on Knockout or knockdown in immunostaining?;</p></disp-quote><p>S1PR1 is a membrane receptor and the S1P1 antibody (PA1-1040, Invitrogen) shows membranous staining with diffuse dot-like signals (Please refer to the image “A” provided by ThermoFisher Scientific). Here, we utilized the antibody to detect the expression of S1PR1 in DG granule cells. We can see the diffuse dot-like signals aggregated in each single granule cell. CaMKII shows intense staining around the border of the granule cell soma (Image “B”) [5]. According to the images shown in Supplementary Figure 5B, we concluded that S1PR1 is expressed in CaMKII+ cells.</p><p>Besides, as suggested, we validated the S1PR1 antibody on knockdown in immunostaining (Image “C” and “D”). The expression of S1PR1 is significantly decreased compared with the control.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99862-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It would be interesting to check S1PR2 levels as a control in CCI-chronic animals;</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we quantified the S1PR2 levels in Sham and CCI animals, and there is no significant difference between groups (Supplementary Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1: I am a bit concerned about the Ns in these experiments. In the chronic pain experiments, the N for Sham is around 8 whereas is around 20 for CCI animals. Although I understand higher numbers are necessary to see the susceptible and unsusceptible populations, I feel that then the same number of Sham animals should be used;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your concern. In the preliminary experiment, we noticed that the ratio of susceptible and unsusceptible populations is around 1:1. After the behavioral tests, we need to further take samples to investigate molecular and cellular changes of each group. Thus, we set sham around 8 and CCI around 20 to ensure that after characterization into susceptible and unsusceptible groups, each group has relatively equal numbers for further investigations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figures 1E and 1G have much higher Ns than the other panels. Why is that? If they have performed this high number of animals why not show them in all panels?;</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your concern. For Figure 1B, C, D and F, we showed the data for each batch of experiment, while for Figure 1E and 1G, we used data collected from all batches of experiment. To show the data from a single batch, we would like to demonstrate the ratio of susceptible to unsusceptible is relatively stable, but not only based on a big sample size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the experiments where viral injection is performed, the authors should show a zoomed-out image of the brain to show the precision of the injection and how spread the expression of the different viruses was;</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we showed the zoomed-out image in Supplementary Figure 6. The viruses are mainly expressed in the hippocampal DG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should check if there is brain inflammation in CCI chronic animals. This would be interesting to explain if this could be the trigger for the effects seen in neurons. In particular, the authors should check astrocytes and microglia. This is of interest also because the pathways altered in Figure 8A are related to viral infection.</p><p>- If the previous point shows increased brain inflammation, it would be interesting for the authors to check whether a prolonged anti-inflammatory treatment in CCI animals administered before the insurgence of memory impairment could stop it from happening;</p><p>- In addition, the authors should speculate on what could be the signal that can induce these molecular changes starting from the site of injury;</p><p>- Also, as the animals are all WT, the authors should speculate on what could render some animals prone to have memory impairments and others resistant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the above four suggestions. We have observed inflammation including T cell infiltration and microglia activation in the hippocampal DG in CCI chronic animals and also used S1PR1 modulator which has anti-lymphocyte mediated inflammatory effect to prevent the insurgence of memory impairment from happening. We also examined the alteration in the numbers of peripheral T-lymphocyte subsets and the serum levels of cytokines. Furthermore, we found a neuron-microglia dialogue in the DG which may promote the resilience to memory impairment in CCI animals. Since these are unpublished results, we apologize that we would not give much detailed information to the public at the current stage. We will publish these data as soon as possible. Thanks for your understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying chronic pain-related memory impairment by focusing on S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Through behavioural tests (Y-maze and Morris water maze) and RNA-seq analysis, the researchers segregated chronic pain mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations. They discovered that S1P/S1PR1 signaling is crucial for determining susceptibility to memory impairment, with decreased S1PR1 expression linked to structural plasticity changes and memory deficits.</p><p>Knockdown of S1PR1 in the DG induced a susceptible phenotype, while overexpression or pharmacological activation of S1PR1 promoted resistance to memory impairment and restored normal synaptic structure. The study identifies actin cytoskeleton-related pathways, including ITGA2 and its downstream Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, as key mediators of S1PR1's effects, offering new insights and potential therapeutic targets for chronic pain-related cognitive dysfunction.</p><p>This manuscript consists of a comprehensive investigation and significant findings. The study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of chronic pain-related memory impairment, highlighting the critical role of S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The clear identification of S1P/S1PR1 as a potential therapeutic target offers promising avenues for future research and treatment strategies. The manuscript is well-structured, methodologically sound, and presents valuable contributions to the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The manuscript is well-structured and written in clear, concise language. The flow of information is logical and easy to follow.</p><p>(2) The segregation of mice into memory impairment-susceptible and -unsusceptible subpopulations is innovative and well-justified. The statistical analyses are robust and appropriate for the data.</p><p>(3) The detailed examination of S1PR1 expression and its impact on synaptic plasticity and actin cytoskeleton reorganization is impressive. The findings are significant and contribute to the understanding of chronic pain-related memory impairment.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Results: While the results are comprehensive, some sections are data-heavy and could be more reader-friendly with summarized key points before diving into detailed data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. For the first sentence in each part/paragraph, we used statement that summarises what will be investigating in the following experiments to make it more reader-friendly. They are labeled as blue in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Discussion: There is a need for a more balanced discussion regarding the limitations of the study. For example, addressing potential biases in the animal model or limitations in the generalizability of the findings to humans would strengthen the discussion. Also, providing specific suggestions for follow-up studies would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we discussed more on the limitations of this study and outlined some directions for future research (Line 481-498).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Conclusion: The conclusion, while concise, could better highlight the study's broader impact on the field and potential clinical implications.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We reworded the conclusion to better highlight the impacts of this study (Line 501-505).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary of the Authors' Objectives:</p><p>The authors aimed to delineate the role of S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the dentate gyrus in the context of memory impairment associated with chronic pain. They sought to understand the molecular mechanisms contributing to the variability in memory impairment susceptibility and to identify potential therapeutic targets.</p><p>Major Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study:</p><p>The study is methodologically robust, employing a combination of RNA-seq analysis, viral-mediated gene manipulation, and pharmacological interventions to investigate the S1P/S1PR1 pathway. The use of both knockdown and overexpression approaches to modulate S1PR1 levels provides compelling evidence for its role in memory impairment. The research also benefits from a comprehensive assessment of behavioral changes associated with chronic pain.</p><p>However, the study has some weaknesses. The categorization of mice into 'susceptible' and 'unsusceptible' groups based on memory performance requires further validation. Additionally, the reliance on a single animal model may limit the generalizability of the findings. The study could also benefit from a more detailed exploration of the impact of different types of pain on memory impairment.</p><p>Assessment of the Authors' Achievements:</p><p>The authors successfully identified S1P/S1PR1 signaling as a key factor in chronic pain-related memory impairment and demonstrated its potential as a therapeutic target. The findings are supported by rigorous experimental evidence, including biochemical, histological, and behavioral data. However, the study's impact could be enhanced by further exploration of the molecular pathways downstream of S1PR1 and by assessing the long-term effects of S1PR1 manipulation.</p><p>Impact on the Field and Utility to the Community:</p><p>This study is likely to have a significant impact on pain research by providing a novel perspective on the mechanisms underlying memory impairment in chronic pain conditions. The identification of the S1P/S1PR1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target could guide the development of new treatments.</p><p>Additional Context for Readers:</p><p>The study's approach to categorizing susceptibility to memory impairment could inspire new methods for stratifying patient populations in clinical settings.</p><p>Recommendations:</p><p>(1) A more detailed explanation of the k-means clustering algorithm and its application in categorizing mice should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we explained the k-means clustering algorithm in details (Line 697-711).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The discussion on the potential influence of different pain types or sensitivities on memory impairment should be expanded.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We discussed this point in the limitations of this study (Line 484-491).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The protocol for behavioral testing should be clarified and the potential for learning or stress effects should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion. We clarified the order of the battery of behavioral tests in this study (Line 537-542). We start with the least stressful test (Y-maze) and leave the most stressful of all for last (Morris Water maze) [6]. Besides, we also conducted behavioral assays to prove that a one-day rest is enough to decrease carryover effects from prior test (Y-maze). We examined the stress related behaviors one day after Y-maze (23d post CCI) using open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM). As shown in Author response image 3, the tests did not reflect the mice were under stressful circumstances. Thus, the order in which the tests were performed are appropriate in this study.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99862-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Conduct additional behavioral assays for other molecular targets implicated in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that other molecular targets on susceptibility to memory impairment would be interesting to know. Our study was designed to focus specifically on ITGA2 this time and we'd like to keep the focus intact, but we have included your point as a consideration for future study (Lines 496-498). Thank you for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The effective drug thresholds and potential non-specific effects of pharmacological interventions should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we emphasized this point of drug SEW2871 in Line 242-245.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>- In Figure 6E the lines of the different groups are not visible. Showing the errors as error bars for each point would probably be better;</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake of using mean ± SD here instead of mean ± SEM. After changing to mean ± SEM, the lines of Figure 6E, Figure 7E and 7L become much clearer. It looks a little bit messy to show the error bars since there are numerous points, so we prefer to keep the line style.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Do the authors have any speculation on why the % time in the quadrant is not further affected in the KD Itga2 in CCI animals (Figure 9K)?;</p></disp-quote><p>In CCI animals, the level of S1PR1 expression is decreased. ITGA2 may participate in the same pathway with S1PR1. Thus, knocking down ITGA2 in CCI animals will not further affect the animal behaviors. This has been proved by knocking down the two proteins at the same time and no additive effects were observed on behavioral tests compared to the knockdown of each one of them in isolation (Figure 9L-O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the methods, it's unclear if in the multiple infusion, the animals were anaesthetised or kept awake;</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this point in the method. mice were deeply anesthetized by 1% pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg, i.p.). (Line 649-650)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As the DG is quite small, could the authors clarify if, when performing western blots, they used the two DGs from one animal for each sample or if they pulled together the DGs of several animals?;</p></disp-quote><p>We used the two DGs from one animal for each sample. The amount of protein extracted from each sample is enough for 20-30 times of Western Blot assays. We have now added this to the method for clarity (Line 612).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is it possible to check the correlation between performance in the YM and MWM with S1PR1 levels?;</p></disp-quote><p>We would also be interested in this point. The data that we have cannot reveal this for it is difficult to manipulate the S1PR1 levels by using KD and overexpression viruses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- EM images have a poor resolution in the figures, could the authors show higher-resolution images?;</p></disp-quote><p>We have inserted 300 DPI images for high resolution output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In line 268 there is a mention of an &quot;ShLamb1&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake and it was revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This study explored the role of S1P/S1PR1 signaling within the dentate gyrus (DG) in chronic pain-related memory impairment using a murine model. The authors identified decreased expression of S1PR1 in the DG of mice susceptible to memory deficits. They demonstrated that S1PR1 knockdown increased susceptibility to memory deficits, whereas its overexpression or pharmacological activation mitigated these effects. Further biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses indicated that disruptions in S1P/S1PR1 signaling were related to disruptions in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influenced by molecular pathways involving ITGA2, Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, and the Arp2/3 complex. These findings offer intriguing insights and suggest a potential therapeutic target for treating memory impairment in chronic pain.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p></disp-quote><p>The following five major concerns are the same with the five recommendations from Reviewer 3 on Page 9-10. Please refer to the answers above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The division of subjects into 'susceptible' and 'unsusceptible' categories requires further clarification regarding the methodologies and rationale employed, particularly concerning the use of the k-means clustering algorithm in data analysis. This explanation will strengthen the scientific grounding of the categorization process.</p><p>(2) The categorization of 'susceptible' and 'unsusceptible' groups might also benefit from a more detailed analysis or discussion concerning the influence of different pain sensitivities or types of pain assessments. Although the study mentions that memory impairment stands independent of pain thresholds, a more nuanced exploration could provide deeper insights.</p><p>(3) The article could benefit from more clarity on the protocol of behavioral testing, especially regarding the potential effects of repeated testing on performance outcomes due to learning or stress.</p><p>(4) While the connection between S1P/S1PR1 signaling and the molecular pathways highlighted (ITGA2, Rac1/Cdc42, Arp2/3) is intriguing, only ITGA2 underwent further behavioral validation in vivo.

The signal intensity obtained can then be normalized by being divided by the signal intensity of the loading internal control (GAPDH) detected on the same blot. The average of the ratios from the control group is calculated, and all individual ratios are divided by this average to obtain a new set of values, which represent the normalized values (Line 619-625).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Details about the control groups in behavioral assessments were subjected to comparable handling and experimental conditions as the chronic pain groups are crucial, barring nerve injury, for maintaining the integrity of the comparative analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a control group and an experimental group is identical in all respects except for one difference-nerve injury.
