dictated by coordinated interactions between adipocytes and resident stromal-vascular cells; however, the functional heterogeneity of adipose stromal cells has remained unresolved. We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and FACS to identify and isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of PDGFRβ+ stromal cells within visceral WAT of adult mice. LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells represent highly adipogenic visceral adipocyte precursor cells (‘APCs’), whereas LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells represent fibro-inflammatory progenitors (‘FIPs’). FIPs lack adipogenic capacity, display pro-fibrogenic/pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and can exert an anti-adipogenic effect on APCs. The pro-inflammatory phenotype of PDGFRβ+ cells is regulated, at least in part, by NR4A nuclear receptors. These data highlight the functional heterogeneity of visceral WAT perivascular cells, and provide insight into potential cell-cell interactions impacting adipogenesis and inflammation. These improved strategies to isolate FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT will facilitate the study of physiological WAT remodeling and mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

When grown in the right conditions in petri dishes, the adipocyte precursor cells were able to form new fat cells. They could also make new fat cells when transplanted into mice that lacked fat tissue. By contrast, the FIPs can suppress the activity of adipocyte precursor cells and activate immune cells. They may also help fibrosis to develop.</p><p>It is not yet clear whether FIPs are present in human fat tissue.

site for safe and efficient energy storage in mammals. WAT, as a whole, is considerably heterogeneous. WAT is composed of energy-storing adipocytes, various immune cell populations, vascular cells, adipocyte precursor cells (APCs), and largely uncharacterized stromal populations. The development and function of adipose tissue is highly dependent on critical interactions between adipocytes, APCs, immune cells, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>WAT has a unique and remarkable capacity to expand and contract in size in response to changes in demand for energy storage. In the context of positive energy balance (nutrient excess), WAT expands to meet the increased demand for energy storage, leading ultimately to the condition of obesity. The manner by which WAT expands is a critical determinant of metabolic health in obesity. It has long been appreciated that individuals who preferentially accumulate WAT in subcutaneous regions are at a relatively lower risk for developing insulin resistance when compared to equally obese individuals with central (visceral) adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kissebah et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krotkiewski et al., 1983</xref>). It is now widely believed that visceral and subcutaneous WAT depots represent fundamentally distinct types of WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karastergiou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Macotela et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamamoto et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, visceral and subcutaneous WAT depots emanate from distinct developmental lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, another clear determinant of metabolic health in obesity is manner in which individual WAT depots expand and ‘remodel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepler and Gupta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). WAT ‘remodeling’ associated with obesity can be described as both quantitative and qualitative changes in adipocyte numbers and stromal-vascular cell composition. Pathological WAT expansion is characterized by the presence of enlarged adipocytes, excessive macrophage accumulation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Divoux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gustafson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hardy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klöting and Blüher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The prevailing hypothesis is that as ‘overworked’ fat cells reach their storage capacity, adipocyte death, inflammation, and fibrosis ensue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hepler and Gupta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). This is often associated with the deleterious accumulation of lipids in the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and heart (termed ‘lipotoxicity’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Unger and Scherer, 2010</xref>). Healthy WAT expansion occurs when adipose tissue expands through adipocyte hyperplasia (increase in adipocyte number through de novo differentiation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denis and Obin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klöting et al., 2010</xref>). This is associated with a lower degree of chronic tissue inflammation and fibrosis. These adipose phenotypes of the ‘metabolically healthy’ obese tightly correlate with sustained insulin sensitivity in these patients. To date, the factors dictating a healthy vs. unhealthy WAT expansion in obesity remain poorly defined. In particular, the array of cell types within the adipose stromal-vascular compartment contributing to the remodeling of WAT in obesity has remained largely undefined.</p><p>The growing appreciation for the casual link between adipose tissue distribution and remodeling with systemic metabolic health has sparked considerable interest in defining the adipocyte precursors giving rise to fat cells in adults and the mechanisms controlling their differentiation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hepler et al., 2017</xref>). In male C57BL/6 mice, adipose tissues expand in diet-induced obesity in a depot-selective manner. The epididymal WAT depot expands through both adipocyte hypertrophy and adipocyte hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffery et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013b</xref>). The inguinal subcutaneous WAT depot expands almost exclusively by adipocyte hypertrophy. We recently reported that visceral adipocytes emerging in association with HFD feeding originate, at least in part, from perivascular precursors expressing <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> encodes the platelet-derived growth factor receptor β chain (PDGFRβ protein) and is a widely used marker of perivascular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>). We previously employed a pulse-chase lineage tracing mouse model to track the fate of <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells in adipose tissue. Following HFD feeding, <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells give rise to white adipocytes within visceral WAT depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). The ability of these precursors to undergo de novo adipogenesis in the setting of diet-induced obesity is critical for healthy visceral WAT expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). Inducible genetic disruption of <italic>Pparg</italic>, the master regulatory gene of adipocyte differentiation, in <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells leads to a loss of de novo adipogenesis from <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells in the visceral WAT depot of diet-induced obese mice; this exacerbates the pathologic remodeling of this depot (i.e. increased inflammation and fibrosis). Driving de novo adipogenesis from <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells through transgenic <italic>Pparg</italic> expression leads to a healthy expansion of visceral WAT (lower inflammation and small adipocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shao et al., 2018</xref>). The highly adipogenic subpopulation of PDGFRβ+ cells in gonadal WAT (gWAT) is quantitatively enriched in the expression of <italic>Pparg</italic>, as well as its upstream regulatory factor, <italic>Zfp423</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). PDGFRβ+ cells enriched in these adipogenic factors express several mural cell (pericyte/smooth muscle) markers and reside directly adjacent to the endothelium in WAT blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). Using <italic>Zfp423</italic> reporter mice (<italic>Zfp423</italic><sup>GFP</sup> BAC transgenic mice), we revealed that PDGFRβ+ cells expressing high levels of <italic>Zfp423</italic> (GFP+ or <italic>Zfp423</italic><sup>High</sup>) represent highly committed preadipocytes while <italic>Zfp423</italic><sup>Low</sup> cells (GFP-) lacked significant adipogenic capacity, and exhibited significantly different global patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggested that the pool of PDGFRβ+ cells in visceral WAT is functionally heterogeneous, with cells possessing distinct cellular phenotypes.</p><p>In this study, we set out to explore the functional heterogeneity within <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells of visceral WAT from adult mice. Furthermore, our objective was to identify improved strategies to purify adipocyte precursor populations from these depots. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identified functionally distinct subpopulations of <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing progenitor cells. We identified a unique population of cells that display fibrogenic and functional pro-inflammatory phenotypes, and lack inherent adipogenic capacity. These fibro-inflammatory progenitors (termed here as ‘FIPs’) can be purified by the use of commercially available antibodies (LY6C + PDGFRβ+). On the other hand, LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells represent a distinct pool of highly adipogenic visceral adipocyte precursor cells (‘APCs’) that robustly differentiate spontaneously in vitro in growth media containing insulin. The frequency of these PDGFRβ+ subpopulations is highly regulated under physiological conditions. These data reveal the functional heterogeneity of perivascular progenitors within visceral WAT and provide insight into how the adipose stroma can control WAT remodeling. Moreover, the molecular profiles obtained for FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT, along with the strategies to isolate these cells, will facilitate the study of physiological WAT remodeling in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals molecularly distinct <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing subpopulations in visceral adipose tissue</title><p>We previously derived a doxycycline-inducible (Tet-On) lineage-tracing model that allows for the indelible labeling of <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing perivascular cells in adipose tissue of adult mice (<italic>Pdgfrb</italic><sup>rtTA</sup>; <italic>TRE-Cre; Rosa26R</italic><sup>mT/mG</sup>; herein, ‘MuralChaser mice’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>).

was molecularly quite distinct from Clusters 1A/B and 2. Interestingly, Cluster 3 had a mesothelial-like cell (herein, ‘MLCs’) expression profile. Mesothelial cells are epithelial cells of mesodermal origin that form a monolayer (mesothelium) lining the visceral serosa. Mesothelial cells and mural cells share a common developmental lineage. Multiple genetic lineage tracing studies in mice indicate that various stromal cell populations within visceral tissues, including APCs, descend from embryonic mesothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rinkevich et al., 2012</xref>). Mesothelial cells have been linked to multiple aspects of adipose tissue development and remodeling, including adipogenesis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darimont et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupta and Gupta, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mutsaers et al., 2015</xref>). Cluster 3 was enriched for genes representing common mesothelial/epithelial markers, such as <italic>Msln</italic>, <italic>Upk3b</italic>, <italic>Krt8</italic>, and <italic>Krt14</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref>). The presence of this cluster suggested that the <italic>Pdgfrb</italic><sup>rtTA</sup> transgene targets at least a subset of visceral WAT associated mesothelial cells. Indeed, following transient doxycycline treatment of MuralChaser mice, a few mGFP+ cells can be observed within in the outermost epithelial layer of gonadal WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, mGFP+ cells can be occasionally observed within cultures of isolated mesothelial cells obtained from gWAT of doxycycline-treated MuralChaser mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We performed a second scRNA-seq analysis utilizing independently isolated mGFP+ cells from gonadal WAT MuralChaser mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). From the second scRNA-seq dataset, we again identified the same major subpopulations of <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells.

For this purpose, we treated Cluster 1A and 1B as one broad ‘APC’ population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Candidate cell surface markers were selected on the basis of their corresponding gene expression in the three PDGFRβ+ subpopulations and the availability of commercial antibodies suitable for FACS. Of note, <italic>Ly6c1</italic> expression was abundant in FIPs but not APCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The expression of <italic>Cd9</italic>, a recently described marker of fibrogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcelin et al., 2017</xref>), was abundantly expressed in both the FIPs and MLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, we isolated the three populations based on these markers using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. PDGFRβ+ cells (CD31- and CD45-) were subdivided on the basis of LY6C and CD9 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Three distinct subpopulations of PDGFRβ+ cells were apparent: LY6C- CD9- (APCs), LY6C+ (FIPs), and LY6C- CD9+ (MLCs) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis consistently revealed that LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells were more abundant than LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells and Ly6C- CD9+ PDGFRβ+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, gene expression analysis by qPCR revealed that LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells were enriched in the expression of genes that defined the APC population (Cluster 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells enriched for the mRNAs that initially defined the FIPs (Cluster 2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>), and LY6C- CD9+ PDGFRβ+ cells expressed the mesothelial/epithelial markers that defined Cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,H</xref>).

We explored this hypothesis by testing the ability of these subpopulations to undergo adipocyte differentiation in vitro. We isolated and cultured all three subpopulations in growth medium containing 2% FBS and 1% ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium). These represent culture conditions that we previously established for growth and differentiation of gWAT-derived PDGFRβ+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vishvanath et al., 2016</xref>). Under these growth conditions, LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells proliferate at a greater rate than LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells; however, the two subpopulations appear morphologically indistinguishable, with both populations appearing fibroblast-like until reaching confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C,E</xref>). LY6C- CD9+ PDGFRβ+ cells (MLCs) grow to confluence and adopt a cobblestone-like morphology characteristic of cultured mesothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Remarkably, upon reaching confluence, only LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells (APCs) underwent spontaneous adipocyte differentiation at a high efficiency, while very few adipocytes emerged in the other two PDGFRβ+ subpopulations or within cultures containing all PDGFRβ+ cells from gWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). FIPs appeared to possess some latent capacity to undergo adipogenesis. Confluent cultures of LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells stimulated with a more commonly used hormonal adipogenic cocktail (dexamethasone, IBMX, insulin, and PPARγ agonist, Rosiglitazone) underwent to adipocyte differentiation to some degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite this strong adipogenic stimulus, LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells still did not differentiate to the same extent as LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells stimulated with insulin alone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Following 4 weeks of HFD-feeding, the expression of <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members remained significantly enriched in FIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In vitro, the expression of all <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members in FIPs was increased following exposure to recombinant TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the consequences of retroviral-mediated overexpression of individual <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members on the inflammatory response of FIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–G</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, <italic>Nr4a2</italic>, or <italic>Nr4a3</italic>, attenuated the pro-inflammatory response to TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–K</xref>). Moreover, we assessed the impact of retroviral-mediated knockdown of <italic>Nr4a1</italic> on the inflammatory response in FIPs. Knockdown of <italic>Nr4a1</italic> using three independent shRNAs led to an exaggerated response of FIPs to TNFα treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L–P</xref>). These gain- and loss of function studies suggest that FIPs activate <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, perhaps as a means to counter-regulate a sustained cellular inflammatory response. These data provide proof of concept that FIPs may be utilized as a tool to identify additional regulators of inflammatory signaling pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Visceral adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity is driven, at least in part, by chronic tissue inflammation, collagen deposition, and a loss of adipocyte precursor activity. WAT remodeling involves substantial qualitative and quantitative changes to the composition of the stromal compartment of the tissue; however, the functional heterogeneity of WAT stromal-vascular fraction has remained poorly defined and tools to isolate and study distinct subpopulations have been lacking. Here, we unveil functionally distinct PDGFRβ+ stromal cell subpopulations in visceral WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Importantly, we have developed strategies to prospectively isolate these distinct populations using commercially available antibodies.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39636.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Functional heterogeneity of PDGFRβ+ perivascular cells in visceral adipose tissue of mice.</title><p>The pool of PDGFRβ+ cells in visceral WAT of mice is molecularly and functionally heterogeneous. LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells represent visceral adipocyte precursor cells (APCs), whereas LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells represent fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs). FIPs are fibrogenic, pro-inflammatory, and inhibit adipocyte differentiation from APCs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-39636-fig9-v1"/></fig><p>Functional analyses indicate that a relatively large subpopulation of PDGFRβ+ perivascular cells in visceral gonadal WAT exert fibrogenic and pro-inflammatory phenotypes. These cells, termed here as ‘FIPs,’ lack adipogenic capacity in vitro but instead exhibit a fibrogenic phenotype. FIPs are physiologically regulated; the frequency of these cells increases upon HFD feeding. Clement and colleagues previously reported that fibrogenic cells residing in WAT could be identified by the expression of CD9 and PDGFRα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcelin et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, FIPs express CD9 and PDGFRα; however, both CD9 and PDGFRα are also expressed in at least a subpopulation of mesothelial cells isolated from visceral WAT. As such, the selection of FIPs on the basis of LY6c and PDGFRβ expression (LY6C+ PDGFRβ+) represents a strategy to prospectively and specifically isolate FIPs from mouse gonadal WAT. Importantly, our data reveal a number of previously unappreciated ways in which perivascular cells may impact WAT remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The LY6C+ PDGFRβ+ cells described here have the capacity to inhibit adipocyte differentiation from APCs through the release of secreted factors. The presence of highly anti-adipogenic stromal cells within the total PDGFRβ+ population may explain the apparent lack of adipogenic capacity that crude/unpurified visceral PDGFRβ+ cultures possess vitro, despite the presence of APCs. It is notable that visceral adipose FIPs appear distinct from the recently identified Aregs of inguinal WAT. Stromal cell heterogeneity may be depot-specific, with different depots utilizing distinct cell types to control their function and plasticity. The exact identities of the secreted factors and mechanisms that mediate the anti-adipogenic activity of FIPs and Aregs are still unknown. Importantly, whether FIPs and Aregs act to suppress/restrain adipocyte hyperplasia under physiological settings in vivo needs to be further explored.</p><p>FIPs also exert a functional pro-inflammatory phenotype in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. It is notable that the frequency of FIPs increases following the onset of HFD feeding. This raises an intriguing hypothesis for future studies that perivascular stromal cells can modulate local tissue inflammation. This notion is in line with recent studies indicating that vascular mural cells can serve as ‘gatekeepers’ of inflammation in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, one may expect that the increased frequency of FIPs would also completely blunt the differentiation of APCs in this depot. This is clearly not the case as gonadal WAT in mice is able to expand through adipocyte hyperplasia in the setting of diet-induced obesity. One possibility is that the anti-adipogenic activity of FIPs (rather than the frequency per se) is diminished by local signals in an attempt to facilitate adipogenesis within the depot. Another possibility lies in the spatial distribution of activated FIPs and APCs; their proximity to one another may influence their activity. The identification of these populations from the MuralChaser mice essentially places them within the perivascular compartment of adipose tissue; however, where APCs and FIPs are localized and become activated within the tissue is still unknown. Clearly, additional studies of these cells will be needed in order to determine their precise contribution to WAT inflammation and health in various settings in vivo. Furthermore, it is certainly plausible that FIPs contribute to WAT remodeling beyond fibrosis, inflammation, and adipogenesis.</p><p>The ability to isolate functionally distinct subpopulations of mural cells affords the possibility of identifying factors regulating these diverse mural cell phenotypes. Our gene expression analysis revealed the enrichment in mRNA levels of <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members in FIPs. Several studies have implicated NR4A nuclear receptors as modulators of inflammatory signaling; the precise impact of NR4A members on inflammation appears context/cell type specific. In some studies, NR4A family members are observed as being pro-inflammatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pei et al., 2006</xref>). In other settings, NR4A expression is induced in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli but acts as a molecular brake on inflammatory signaling. Our gain- and loss of function studies suggest that FIPs activate <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli to serve as a transcriptional brake on inflammatory cytokine gene expression. This counter-regulatory response may be a mechanism to limit cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis driven by inflammatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodríguez-Calvo et al., 2017</xref>). Chao et al. previously demonstrated that NR4A family members are potent regulators of adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, NR4A members may play multiple roles in controlling of the fate and function of adipose perivascular cells. Additional studies involving the genetic manipulation of <italic>Nr4a</italic> family members in PDGFRβ+ cells in vivo will be needed to elucidate the exact requirements of NR4A members in WAT remodeling in vivo. Importantly, the ability to isolate FIPs and APCs affords the possibility of employing several different types of genomic approaches in an effort to reveal novel molecular mechanisms controlling adipose tissue inflammation, fibrosis, and adipogenesis.</p><p>As described above, there has been tremendous interest in elucidating the identity of adipocyte precursors in adult adipose tissue. Pioneering studies from Friedman and colleagues led to a now widely-used strategy to prospectively isolate adipocyte progenitor cells from freshly isolated WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodeheffer et al., 2008</xref>). APCs have been isolated on the basis of CD29, SCA-1, and CD34 expression (CD29+ CD34+ SCA-1+ CD31- CD45-). These markers have proven to be quite useful for the selection of APCs from inguinal WAT and other WAT depots; however, a notable observation made here is that SCA-1 expression is in fact enriched in FIPs rather than APCs of the gonadal WAT depot. As such, the selection of cells on the basis of SCA-1 expression from this particular WAT depot yields a functionally heterogeneous population that likely includes FIPs, and perhaps even enriches for these cells. This may explain, at least in part, the notable lack of adipogenic potential that isolated gonadal CD34+ SCA-1+ cells possess in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Church et al., 2014</xref>). Our prior work pointed to <italic>Zfp423</italic> as a marker of committed preadipocytes; however, our scRNA-seq data reveal that <italic>Zfp423</italic> expression is not confined exclusively to the APC subpopulation of PDGFRβ+ cells; <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing MLCs and FIPs also express <italic>Zfp423</italic>. Nevertheless, the selection of GFP<sup>High</sup> PDGFRβ+ cells from gWAT of <italic>Zfp423</italic><sup>GFP</sup> reporter mice enriches for committed APCs, perhaps reflecting increased promoter/transgene activity in these cells.</p><p>Recent scRNA-seq analyses from Granneman and colleagues provide a cellular atlas of putative adipocyte precursor populations in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burl et al., 2018</xref>). Their analyses included all non-hematopoetic, non-endothelial cells of the isolated adipose stromal-vascular fraction. The strength of their approach is that it allows for one to capture both perivascular (PDGFRβ+) and non-perivascular precursor populations. Our approach will identify precursor populations that express <italic>Pdgfrb/rtTA</italic> at the time of the pulse labeling. <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> expression declines as cell undergo differentiation into adipocytes. This means that cells even further committed to the adipocyte lineage (i.e. no longer express <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>) may not be captured through our analysis. Moreover, putative stem cell populations not yet expressing <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> may also be present and not captured (e.g. Pref1<sup>rtTA</sup> targeted cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hudak et al., 2014</xref>]). Nevertheless, it is notable that most of the adipocyte precursor populations represented in the study by Burl et al. were indeed captured in our analysis. One cannot rule out the existence of additional adipocyte progenitor populations in any particular adipose depot; however, the congruency of the two independent studies suggests the MuralChaser model can identify and target the major APC populations residing within visceral WAT of mice. Moreover, the selection of LY6C- PDGFRβ+ cells from gWAT using commercially available antibodies represents a refined and convenient strategy to isolate visceral adipocyte precursors from wild type mice or genetic mouse models of interest.</p><p>Single-cell transcriptomics has become very useful in revealing molecular heterogeneity amongst seemingly homogenous populations of cells. The challenge, however, is to determine whether molecularly distinct populations of cells represent distinct ‘cell types,’ or rather ‘cell states’ which are influenced by their local microenvironment. Here, we reveal molecular heterogeneity amongst PDGFRβ+ cells within visceral white adipose tissue and begin to define the functional differences between the identified subpopulations. Our functional analyses suggest that the properties of visceral FIPs are at least somewhat stable; FIPs are quite limited in adipogenic potential in vitro and upon transplantation. They do not readily activate <italic>Pparg</italic> expression under the conditions examined. The phenotype of visceral APCs may be less stable. Visceral APCs have the potential to adopt characteristics of FIPs. In vitro and in vivo following HFD, APCs can activate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A caveat to most of our functional studies is that the cells are studied outside their native microenvironment. Under some physiological conditions, it is certainly plausible that multiple PDGFRβ+ subpopulations give rise in vivo to adipocytes; such adipocytes might even possess unique functional characteristics. Our prior lineage-tracing studies using the MuralChaser model clearly established that adipocytes emerge from <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells; efforts to define the relative contribution of individual mural cell subpopulations will require more precise lineage-tracing approaches with more specific Cre drivers. Moreover, our current studies cannot exclude the possibility that even further heterogeneity exists amongst PDGFRβ+ cells or within the identified subpopulations. Deeper sequencing, refined analyses, and further functional studies may unveil even more heterogeneity than appreciated.</p><p>It is noteworthy that <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> is expressed in a subset of WAT associated mesothelial cells and that <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing mesothelial cells express <italic>Pparg</italic> and some level of <italic>Zfp423</italic>. As described above, several lines of evidence point to a lineage relationship between embryonic mesothelial cells, APCs, and perivascular stromal cells within the visceral compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rinkevich et al., 2012</xref>). PDGFRβ+ MLCs did not exhibit robust adipogenic potential under the culture conditions utilized here, despite their expression of <italic>Pparg</italic> isoform two and <italic>Zfp423</italic>. Additional signals may be needed in order to drive adipocyte differentiation from these cells. Alternatively, this subpopulation of mesothelial cells may represent developmental intermediates between mesothelial cells and perivascular progenitors. Further insight into the functional significance of these various stromal subpopulations, their developmental origins, and their cellular plasticity will require additional genetic tools to manipulate individual populations selectively in vivo. Nevertheless, the molecular profiles obtained for FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT, along with the strategies to isolate these cells, will facilitate the study of physiological visceral WAT remodeling in vivo. Ultimately, unraveling the cellular and molecular determinants of WAT expansion and remodeling may lead to strategies to improve adipose tissue function and defend against metabolic disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The authors had previously reported a population of PDGFRβ+ cells that give rise to white adipocytes in visceral fat. Using scRNA-Seq, the authors in this manuscript characterize various cell population within the PDGFRβ expressing cells. The manuscript reports FIP cell population that have highly compromised adipogenic potential and inhibits APCs adipogenic capacity in a paracrine-manner. The findings in the manuscript are interesting and the experiments are well-designed.

The bioinformatic analysis identified unique populations, including adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) and fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs). The authors also established a robust sorting method to isolate APCs and FIPs by using their unique cell surface markers. Intriguingly, the authors found that FIPs acts on APCs to suppress their adipogenic potential via secretory factors, likely pro-inflammatory molecules. The authors further examined the extent to which a high-fat diet feeding affects the transcription profile of APCs and FIPs.</p><p>This is an outstanding paper that provides important insights into adipose progenitor heterogeneity and also useful information regarding the sorting method and the transcriptome data. Identification of Nr4a transcriptional factors suggests new regulators of FIPs. Overall, the data are convincing and the manuscript is well-written. Given the high significance and impact, this paper should be published in a timely manner. I have only minor comments that the authors wish to supplement in the paper.</p><p>1) A recent paper by Granneman's group (Burl et al., 2018) reported scRNA-seq analysis and defined subpopulations of Lin- epididymal WAT. It would be interesting to cross the dataset and if any common genes/pathways are seen.</p><p>2) TZDs are known to suppress inflammation and fibrosis pathways. Does TZD treatment inhibit pro-fibrosis and pro-inflammatory genes in FIPs?</p><p>3. The authors wish to comment on any difference in APC and FIP populations between male and female mice.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>I think the study is rigorous.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Hepler et al. is part of a recent wave of studies using single cell RNA sequencing to define the adipocyte precursor cell population. Studies for many years prior suggest that adipocyte precursor pools are heterogeneous, but it has been difficult to define at the molecular level.</p><p>Here, the authors take advantage of recent advances in single cell transcriptomics combined with FACS to molecularly define the heterogeneity of a population of PDGFRβ-positive cells that they previously described, which reside in the adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction, and are highly enriched for adipogenic precursors. Base on gene expression signatures, they identify 4 distinct clusters of PDGFR-β expressing cells that in their model represent adipocyte precursors, committed preadipocytes, fibro-inflammatory progenitors, and mesothelial-like cells. They also find that the fibro-inflammatory progenitor pool (termed FIPs) lack adipogenic capacity, and have anti-adipogenic effects that may be linked to a secreted factor.</p><p>The study is timely, well done, interesting, and follows a logical course of investigation. The stated hypothesis is that PDGFRβ expressing cells in gonadal WAT are heterogeneous. This fairly safe hypothesis is supported by the data, and while these data are not overly surprising, they add important details to the molecular definition of what are currently considered to be &quot;APC&quot; pools. A particular strength of the study is the identification of unique markers that define each subpopulation of cells. The major weakness of the study is that it falls short of showing that these subpopulations, in particular the FIP population, are present and have anti-adipogenic potential in vivo. In summary, these data support the notion that current protocols used to isolate APCs result in highly heterogeneous populations, and will help in defining the hierarchy of adipocyte lineages, but await in vivo functional confirmation.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>My major concern is that the clusters of cell types identified by sequencing and shown to have different functions in vitro have not been confirmed in vivo. The authors have nicely identified unique markers of the FIP population; could these markers be used to define the in vivo populations (without the caveats of isolating and purifying cells by FACS)? For example, can they distinctly localize the FIP, APC, and mesothelial-like cells? Could the authors show high in vivo expression of the NR4A receptors selectively in the FIP cells? Can the authors somehow confirm the role of NR4A in FIPs in vivo?</p><p>In a related point, the authors' previous work suggests that all of the cells they sequenced here should express, or have previously expressed, <italic>Pparg</italic> (e.g. it was stated that PDGFRβ+ cells in gonadal WAT can be identified by <italic>Pparg</italic> expression). It is thus curious that non-adipogenic FIPs would express PPARg. It seems there could be an interesting biological reason for this (e.g. identity switching dependent on nutrient availability or other stimulus), but also potential technical caveats triggered by the isolation and purification strategy itself. This is why I think it is important to show that PDGFRβ+ (<italic>pparg</italic>+) FIP cells exist in the SVF in vivo (e.g. by immunofluorescence or similar strategy) and perform some type of in vivo loss-of-function analysis to demonstrate that these cells are (1) non-adipocyte forming and (2) anti-adipogenic to the APCs.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>Could the authors comment on the PDGFRβ-negative population of stromal vascular fraction cells that were selected against? Are there any adipogenic cells in this population and could the bias towards the PDGFRβ pool have caused the authors to miss important adipocyte progenitors?</p><p>A recent study by Deplancke, Wolfrum and colleagues in Nature similarly identified a population of anti-adipogenic cells they termed Aregs. In contrast to FIPs, Aregs appear to represent a small fraction of the APC pool. Are FIPs similar to Aregs? The same? Could the authors compare their gene signatures and comment on this?</p><p>Regarding the current studies' rationale, it is stated (Introduction, second paragraph) that it has long been appreciated that individuals who preferentially accumulate WAT in subcutaneous regions are at lower risks for insulin resistance compared to those who accumulate visceral adiposity. It is stated in the third paragraph of the Introduction, that healthy WAT expansion occurs by hyperplasia. Yet, in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, it is stated that (in mice) epididymal (visceral) WAT expands by hypertrophy and hyperplasia, but subcutaneous WAT almost exclusively by the stated unhealthy modality of hypertrophy. Thus, there is disconnect between subcutaneous being healthy but expanding by unhealthy means. Could the authors clarify this? It also raises the important question of whether subcutaneous WAT precursors also exhibit the same heterogeneity as the visceral WAT precursors described here by the authors. Could the authors show this and discuss their findings?</p><p>Using their gene expression data, could the authors show whether there is additional heterogeneity within the 4 clusters, or whether these populations represent fairly homogenous populations? This, is important towards the overall theme of &quot;heterogeneity&quot; in the APC pool and for helping readers understand how much the current strategy improves purity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39636.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Gupta and colleagues combine single cell transcriptomics with FACS to define the heterogeneity of a population of PDGFRβ-positive cells that reside in the adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction and are enriched for adipogenic precursors.

Deplanke/Wolfrum and colleagues defined an anti-adipogenic population of cells within inguinal WAT, termed Aregs (Schwalie et al., 2018). We now demonstrate that the visceral adipose FIPs described here are not enriched in the expression of markers used to define inguinal WAT Aregs. Despite some functional similarities (e.g. lack of adipogenic potential; anti-adipogenic), FIPs appear to be molecularly distinct from Aregs. These new data have been added to the new Figure 5.</p><p>Granneman and colleagues independently performed scRNA-seq of adipose SVF cells (Burl et al., 2018). The authors identified 2 prominent adipose stem cell (ASC) populations (termed ASC 1 and ASC 2) with the gonadal WAT depot. The identified populations were not isolated and explored functionally in their study; however, a comparison of the molecular profiles (now included here) strongly suggests that ASC 1 defined by the authors bears close resemblance to APC population defined in our study. Moreover, ASC 2 bears close resemblance to the FIPs discovered here. Importantly, the similarity in results between the two independent approaches suggest that the MuralChaser model captures a significantly large portion of the apparent visceral WAT adipocyte precursor pool, and that our new sorting strategy can be used to capture these cells. These new data are added to the Figure 3—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please discuss the implications of the findings for visceral fat expansion as mentioned by reviewers 1 and 3.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers ask a number of great questions here. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further in the revised Discussion section. Our responses to the individual reviewer critiques are provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please consider whether it might be possible to use the new markers revealed by scSeq here to identify cell populations in tissue (e.g. by immunofluorescence) as suggested by reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this important question. The identification of APCs and FIPs through the use of the MuralChaser mice essentially places these cells in the perivascular region of adipose tissue. As shown in the manuscript and in our prior publications (Hepler et al., 2017a; Hepler et al., 2017b; Shao et al., 2018; Vishvanath et al., 2016), mGFP expression in these reporter mice is confined to perivascular cells and to a few cells within the mesothelial layer of visceral WAT. Nevertheless, a simple tool to identify the specific subpopulations is needed for the field and is essential for understanding the spatial relationship between FIPs and APCs in vivo.</p><p>We have tried hard over the past year to find antibodies that 1) recognize proteins enriched in either FIPs or APCs, and 2) are suitable for immunohistochemistry (paraffin embedded sections). Specifically, we tested multiple commercial antibodies from Abcam, Cell Signaling, and other vendors, against LY6C, CD9, and other potential markers (AGT, DACT2, NR4A1, etc.). We do in fact observe staining patterns suggestive of heterogeneity within the PDGFRβ+ cells; however, we simply do not have confidence in any of these antibodies as the concentrations needed to obtain signal are quite high and we lack genetic controls to confirm their specificity. We are still actively working on developing these tools. We now discuss this issue in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Adipose tissue is remarkably heterogenous and various cell types in adipose contribute to its overall function.

We performed these studies by transplanting isolated APCs and FIPs into a recently described mouse model of complete lipodystrophy (Adiponectin-Cre; <italic>Pparg<sup>l</sup></italic><sup>oxP/loxP</sup>) (Wang et al., 2013). As expected in these types of assays, there was some degree of variability; however, in all four mice injected with APCs, adipocytes emerge and are readily detectable. On the other hand, transplanted FIPs did not give rise to adipocytes in any of the four mice tested. Even under these extreme lipodystrophic conditions, FIPs appear refractory to adipocyte differentiation.

Knockdown of NR4a1 indeed led to an increase in the expression of <italic>Pparg</italic> in FIPs; however, this appeared to be insufficient in rendering cells more adipogenic, at least under the differentiation conditions utilized. This may be due to the fact that other NR4a family members serve in this capacity (Chao et al., 2008). We have opted not to include this in the manuscript as we are developing animal models to address this more thoroughly.

Will deleting some of the identified genes in the FIP population (Figure 1 or Figure 2G) rescue the non-adipogenic phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. We have not yet performed a comprehensive functional screen of potential anti-adipogenic factors within FIPs (e.g. transcription factors) and/or secreted from FIPs (e.g. WNTs, TGFβ, etc.). This is the focus of ongoing/future studies in the lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do the FIPs share some cellular and genetic identities with adipose CD142+/ABCG1+ SVF cells or vice-versa? These cells were also recently reported to be refractory to adipogenesis (PMID:29925944). Interestingly, CD142+cells were also shown to populate perivascular region in adipose.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. We now demonstrate that the visceral adipose FIPs described here are not enriched in the expression of markers used to define inguinal WAT Aregs. Despite some functional similarities (e.g. lack of adipogenic potential; anti-adipogenic), FIPs appear to be molecularly distinct from Aregs. These new data have been added to the new Figure 5.</p><p><italic>5) In Figure 6A, FIP population increases and APC population markedly decreases under high-fat diet. Visceral fat expands by both hypertrophy and hyperplasia and APCs could be responsible for healthy adipose expansion and accounts for the majority of de novo adipogenesis within PDGFR</italic>β<italic>+ cells. Please explain this paradox.</italic> </p><p>This is a great question. “New” adipocytes originating from <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells first emerge within visceral WAT depots after 4 weeks of HFD feeding. The fact that the frequency of APCs decline by this time point may suggest that they have gone down the differentiation pathway (and no longer actively express <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>) and by this point are possibly depleted. With these new tools in hand, we are now revisiting the pattern of visceral fat expansion in obese mice, with a closer focus on the temporal and spatial events occurring following on the onset of HFD-feeding.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewer is correct that the increase in the frequency in FIPs is also somewhat puzzling. On one hand, the increase in this population correlates with the pathologic features of WAT expansion occurring following HFD feeding (inflammation/fibrosis). On the other hand, one may expect that the increased frequency of FIPs would completely blunt the differentiation of APCs. One possibility is that the anti-adipogenic activity of FIPs (rather than the frequency per se) is shut-off by local signals. Another possibility is that the spatial relationship between the two cell populations in vivo ultimately impacts how the cells interact. As now described in the revised Discussion section, further functional studies of these cells in vivo, using existing and perhaps new genetic tools, will be needed to further clarify the importance of these distinct mural cell phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Will the conditioned media from FIPs also affect adipogenic potential of tdTomato expressing cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not address this directly in our current study; however, we have observed that tdTomato expressing cells from gonadal WAT do not differentiate as readily as the mGFP+ cells in the model. This is not to say that other preadipocyte populations do not exist; the presence of immune cells, endothelial cells, and perhaps other tdTomato+ cell types in the SVF cultures may mask these cells, under the conditions we utilize.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3, the authors should also test the proliferative capacity of the isolated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Consistent with our observations in vivo, FIPs appear to proliferate much more rapidly than APCs upon plating in vitro. These new data are added to the new Figure 3—figure Supplement 1.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript by Hepler et al. employed single-cell RNA sequencing and analyzed cellular heterogeneity in the stromal fraction of visceral adipose tissue. The bioinformatic analysis identified unique populations, including adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) and fibro-inflammatory progenitors (FIPs). The authors also established a robust sorting method to isolate APCs and FIPs by using their unique cell surface markers. Intriguingly, the authors found that FIPs acts on APCs to suppress their adipogenic potential via secretory factors, likely pro-inflammatory molecules. The authors further examined the extent to which a high-fat diet feeding affects the transcription profile of APCs and FIPs.</p><p>This is an outstanding paper that provides important insights into adipose progenitor heterogeneity and also useful information regarding the sorting method and the transcriptome data. Identification of Nr4a transcriptional factors suggests new regulators of FIPs. Overall, the data are convincing and the manuscript is well-written. Given the high significance and impact, this paper should be published in a timely manner. I have only minor comments that the authors wish to supplement in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive feedback and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) A recent paper by Granneman's group (Burl et al., 2018) reported scRNA-seq analysis and defined subpopulations of Lin- epididymal WAT. It would be interesting to cross the dataset and if any common genes/pathways are seen.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We discuss this issue above and repeat our response here for convenience:</p><p>Granneman and colleagues independently performed scRNA-seq of adipose SVF cells. The authors identified 2 prominent adipose stem cell (ASC) populations (termed ASC 1 and ASC 2) with the gonadal WAT depot. The identified populations were not isolated and explored functionally in their study; however, a comparison of the molecular profiles strongly suggests that ASC 1 defined by the authors bears close resemblance to APC population defined in our study. Moreover, ASC 2 bears close resemblance to the FIPs discovered here. Importantly, the similarity in results between the two independent approaches suggest that the MuralChaser model captures a significantly large portion of the apparent visceral WAT adipocyte precursor pool, and that our new sorting strategy can be used to capture these cells. These new data are added to the Figure 3—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) TZDs are known to suppress inflammation and fibrosis pathways. Does TZD treatment inhibit pro-fibrosis and pro-inflammatory genes in FIPs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. In fact, we recently published that the beneficial effects of TZDs on gonadal WAT remodeling depend on PPARγ expression in <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>-expressing cells (Shao et al., 2018). Specifically, inducible deletion of PPARγ selectively in PDGFRβ+ cells blocks the ability of TZDs to promote adipocyte hyperplasia and suppress WAT inflammation. Whether the latter is due to an impact on FIPs is a great question. We are pursuing this question as part of a separate and extensive study (i.e. new mouse models) that focuses more broadly on the role of FIPs in regulating WAT inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors wish to comment on any difference in APC and FIP populations between male and female mice.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. The sorting strategy that we employ to isolate FIPs and APCs from visceral WAT can be used in both female and male mice. We added this new data to the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>I think the study is rigorous.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The study is timely, well done, interesting, and follows a logical course of investigation. The stated hypothesis is that PDGFRβ expressing cells in gonadal WAT are heterogeneous. This fairly safe hypothesis is supported by the data, and while these data are not overly surprising, they add important details to the molecular definition of what are currently considered to be &quot;APC&quot; pools. A particular strength of the study is the identification of unique markers that define each subpopulation of cells. The major weakness of the study is that it falls short of showing that these subpopulations, in particular the FIP population, are present and have anti-adipogenic potential in vivo. In summary, these data support the notion that current protocols used to isolate APCs result in highly heterogeneous populations, and will help in defining the hierarchy of adipocyte lineages, but await in vivo functional confirmation.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>My major concern is that the clusters of cell types identified by sequencing and shown to have different functions in vitro have not been confirmed in vivo. The authors have nicely identified unique markers of the FIP population; could these markers be used to define the in vivo populations (without the caveats of isolating and purifying cells by FACS)? For example, can they distinctly localize the FIP, APC, and mesothelial-like cells? Could the authors show high in vivo expression of the NR4A receptors selectively in the FIP cells? Can the authors somehow confirm the role of NR4A in FIPs in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point, and certainly a question that arises from all single cell sequencing studies. As noted above, we have made several attempts to localize these cell populations using commercially available antibodies recognizing FIPs and/or APC-selective proteins. We observe heterogeneous expression patterns within PDGFRβ+ cells; however, we are not yet confident enough in the specificity of the antibodies to suggest their use by the field.</p><p>A number of lines of evidence (independent of cell fractionation/FACs) suggest that mural cell heterogeneity exists in vivo. In fact, what motivated this study is the initial observation made from <italic>Zfp423</italic><sup>GFP</sup> reporter mice (Gupta et al., 2012; Vishvanath et al., 2016). Through the use of immunohistochemistry, we found that GFP expression in the adipose tissue of these animals can be found in a <italic>subset</italic> of perivascular cells. This is in line with earlier work from Graff and colleagues indicating that a subset of mural cells express <italic>Pparg</italic> (Tang et al., 2008).</p><p><italic>In a related point, the authors' previous work suggests that all of the cells they sequenced here should express, or have previously expressed, Pparg (e.g. it was stated that PDGFRβ+ cells in gonadal WAT can be identified by Pparg expression). It is thus curious that non-adipogenic FIPs would express PPARg. It seems there could be an interesting biological reason for this (e.g. identity switching dependent on nutrient availability or other stimulus), but also potential technical caveats triggered by the isolation and purification strategy itself. This is why I think it is important to show that PDGFRβ+ (pparg+) FIP cells exist in the SVF in vivo (e.g. by immunofluorescence or similar strategy) and perform some type of in</italic> vivo <italic>loss-of-function analysis to demonstrate that these cells are (1) non-adipocyte forming and (2) anti-adipogenic to the APCs.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point and we thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify. Our work, along with the work of others (primarily Graff and colleagues), demonstrate that PDGFRβ+ adipocyte precursors (i.e. the subpopulation of PDGFRβ+ cells with adipogenic potential) are enriched in <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Zfp423</italic> expression. The reviewer is correct that FIPs express <italic>Pparg</italic> and <italic>Zfp423</italic>; however, the levels appear quantitatively lower in FIPs vs. APCs.</p><p>Regarding function, we have now performed transplantation assays of FIPs/APCs into lipodystrophic mice. As noted above, in all four mice injected with APCs, adipocytes emerge and are readily detectable. On the other hand, transplanted FIPs did not give rise to adipocytes in any of the four mice tested. Even under these extreme lipodystrophic conditions, FIPs appear refractory to adipocyte differentiation. These new data have been added to Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>We completely agree with the sentiment of the reviewer that the new populations described here, along with other recently identified populations from other groups, need to be explored further in vivo. We have a number of on-going animal studies that involve genetic manipulation of inflammatory and fibrogenic signaling cascades in PDGFRβ+ cells. We expect that these studies, when completed, will shed insight into the importance of these various mural cell phenotypes in adipose tissue remodeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>Could the authors comment on the PDGFRβ-negative population of stromal vascular fraction cells that were selected against? Are there any adipogenic cells in this population and could the bias towards the PDGFRβ pool have caused the authors to miss important adipocyte progenitors?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. We have not explored the PDGFRβ- pool in any great depth. As such, we certainly cannot rule out that other precursors populations exist. In fact, our approach will only identify precursor populations that express <italic>Pdgfrb/rtTA</italic> at the time of the pulse labeling. <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> expression declines as cell undergo differentiation into adipocytes. This means that cells even further committed to the adipocyte lineage (i.e. no longer express <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>) would not be captured through our analysis. Moreover, putative stem cell populations not yet expressing <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> may also be present and not captured. All that being said, it is notable that our approach captured most, if not all, the precursor populations recently identified in the study by Granneman and colleagues. Their group performed single cell sequencing of the SVF from gonadal WAT, allowing them to capture (in principle) both PDGFRβ+ and PDGFRβ- precursors. As we now highlight in the revised manuscript, our analysis appears to capture the adipocyte precursor populations defined in their study. This does not exclude any possibility that additional populations exist; however, the similarity in results between the two independent approaches suggest that the MuralChaser model captures a significantly large portion of the apparent visceral WAT adipocyte precursor pool, and that our new sorting strategy can be used to capture these cells. We now discuss this more thoroughly in the revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A recent study by Deplancke, Wolfrum and colleagues in Nature similarly identified a population of anti-adipogenic cells they termed Aregs. In contrast to FIPs, Aregs appear to represent a small fraction of the APC pool. Are FIPs similar to Aregs? The same? Could the authors compare their gene signatures and comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we certainly agree that this is important. Deplanke/Wolfrum and colleagues defined an anti-adipogenic population of cells within inguinal WAT, termed Aregs. We now demonstrate that the visceral adipose FIPs described here are not enriched in the expression of markers used to define inguinal WAT Aregs. Despite some functional similarities (e.g. lack of adipogenic potential; anti-adipogenic), Visceral WAT FIPs appear to be at least somewhat distinct from the inguinal WAT Aregs described. These new data have been added to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the current studies' rationale, it is stated (Introduction, second paragraph) that it has long been appreciated that individuals who preferentially accumulate WAT in subcutaneous regions are at lower risks for insulin resistance compared to those who accumulate visceral adiposity. It is stated in the third paragraph of the Introduction, that healthy WAT expansion occurs by hyperplasia. Yet, in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction, it is stated that (in mice) epididymal (visceral) WAT expands by hypertrophy and hyperplasia, but subcutaneous WAT almost exclusively by the stated unhealthy modality of hypertrophy. Thus, there is disconnect between subcutaneous being healthy but expanding by unhealthy means. Could the authors clarify this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further here. Indeed, in male mice, the subcutaneous inguinal WAT depot expands almost exclusively by adipocyte hypertrophy. It should be noted that all of our studies, and almost all related studies, have been done with C57BL/6 mice. These animals are often utilized in our field because it is a model of pathologic diet-induced obesity. The inability of the subcutaneous WAT depot to expand in a healthy manner may contribute to the overall systemic phenotype of diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice. In fact, engineered animal models exhibiting hyperplastic subcutaneous adipose expansion in obesity (examples: Adiponectin transgenic, mitoNeet transgenic, Glut4 transgenic) maintain insulin sensitivity despite becoming obese. What is certainly puzzling is that PDGFRβ+ cells isolated from this depot are highly adipogenic in vitro (as shown here), but are not activated in vivo to undergo adipogenesis, even when a <italic>Pparg</italic> transgene is expressed (Shao et al., 2018). As such, there appear to strong suppressive signals in the tissue microenvironment that restrain adipogenesis. Such signals may emanate from the recently identified Aregs, or from other cell types.</p><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, it is then somewhat surprising that visceral WAT depot expands by both cell hypertrophy and cellular hyperplasia. It is in our view that the level of de novo adipogenesis naturally occurring in this depot following the onset of HFD is beneficial, but insufficient to protect from pathological WAT expansion. This view is based on our recently published models in which allow for inducible expression or deletion of <italic>Pparg</italic> in PDGFRβ+ cells (Shao et al., 2018). Loss of <italic>Pparg</italic> in PDGFRβ+ cells leads to a loss of de novo adipogenesis from PDGFRβ+ cells in the visceral WAT depot of diet-induced obese mice; this exacerbates the pathologic remodeling of this depot (i.e. increased inflammation and fibrosis). However, driving further de novo adipogenesis from PDGFRβ+ cells through transgenic <italic>Pparg</italic> expression leads to a healthy expansion of visceral WAT (lower inflammation and small adipocytes).</p><p>This leads to the question raised by reviewer 1: Why don’t the FIPs block de novo adipogenesis from the mural cell lineage in this depot? As noted above, it is possible that the anti-adipogenic activity of these cells is somewhat shut-off in the setting of nutrient excess, or turned on during later HFD feeding timepoints. In order to address this, we first need to identify the putative anti-adipogenic factor. Importantly, and as noted in the manuscript, further in vivo studies of FIPs and APCs will be needed in order to clarify their exact roles in WAT remodeling in vivo. We now address this issue directly in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also raises the important question of whether subcutaneous WAT precursors also exhibit the same heterogeneity as the visceral WAT precursors described here by the authors. Could the authors show this and discuss their findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Great point. Transcriptional programs of white adipocyte precursors are depot- dependent. The question raised by the reviewer here motivated us to ask whether similar functional heterogeneity exists amongst PDGFRβ+ cells within various WAT depots, and whether functionally distinct subpopulations could be selected for using the same FACS strategy described above. Indeed, the same three populations can be observed within the mesenteric and retroperitoneal depots of adult male mice, with LY6C- CD9- PDGFRβ+ cells representing the highly adipogenic subpopulation (new Figure 4A-H).</p><p>We also examined LY6C expression within PDGFRβ+ SVF cells obtained from the inguinal and anterior subcutaneous WAT depots. We previously demonstrated that the total pool of PDGFRβ+ cells from inguinal WAT is very highly adipogenic in vitro; however, remarkably, all PDGFRβ+ cells within the inguinal and anterior subcutaneous WAT depots expressed LY6C (new Figure 4I). These data suggest that if heterogeneity exists amongst PDGFRβ+ cells in these subcutaneous depots, they could not be discriminated on the basis of LY6C expression. Therefore, functionally distinct stromal populations from visceral, but not subcutaneous, WAT depots can be revealed on the basis of LY6C and CD9 expression.</p><p>On-going single cell sequencing studies in our lab are examining whether cell populations representing APCs and FIPs exist within subcutaneous WAT depots and brown adipose tissue depots, perhaps bearing distinct markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using their gene expression data, could the authors show whether there is additional heterogeneity within the 4 clusters, or whether these populations represent fairly homogenous populations? This, is important towards the overall theme of &quot;heterogeneity&quot; in the APC pool and for helping readers understand how much the current strategy improves purity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important question. Through further Cell Ranger analysis of APCs and FIPs, we did not see any clear and obvious subdivision of the two populations. This does not mean that APCs/FIPs are not and/or cannot be heterogeneous under any circumstance (e.g. in obesity). We are interested in further evaluating heterogeneity of potential subpopulations of FIPs and APCs in future studies, through 1) single cell-derived clonal analyses in vitro, and 2) additional scRNA-seq analyses (re-sequencing) of purified FIPs and APCs. In the revised Discussion section we further emphasize the potential importance of further analyses going forward.</p></body></sub-article></article>
