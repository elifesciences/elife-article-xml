Regeneration (ALR) results in mitochondrial myopathy with cataracts; however, the mechanism for this disorder remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that loss of ALR, a principal component of the MIA40/ALR protein import pathway, results in impaired cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, MIA40/ALR facilitates the mitochondrial import of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-B8, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein required for cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation, through physical interaction with ABCB8. Downregulation of ALR impairs mitochondrial ABCB8 import, reduces cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation, and increases cellular iron through the iron regulatory protein-iron response element system. Our finding thus provides a mechanistic link between MIA40/ALR import machinery and cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation through the mitochondrial import of ABCB8, and offers a potential explanation for the pathology seen in patients with ALR mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial protein import</kwd><kwd>augmenter of liver regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL127646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL140973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL138982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12PRE12030002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Hsiang-Chun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Hsiang-Chun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammalian cellular iron homeostasis and the maturation of the cytosolic iron sulfur cluster proteins are dependent on the mitochondrial protein import machinery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic loss of Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) results in mitochondrial myopathy and cataract, and combined respiratory chain deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambot et al., 2017</xref>). Several mutations in <italic>ALR</italic> have been described for this disorder. Some of these documented mutations result in premature stop codon, while the R194H mutation has been shown to affect the protein stability through increasing dissociation of its cofactor FAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daithankar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambot et al., 2017</xref>). Cellular studies demonstrated that R194H mutant ALR is not functional, and mutant cells can be complemented by ectopic expression of wild type (WT) ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>). While patients with <italic>ALR</italic> mutations lack its protein expression, how reduced ALR protein levels are linked to human pathology remains to be determined.</p><p>ALR is a sulfhydryl oxidase with two isoforms â a full-length isoform that is predominantly in the mitochondria, but has also been observed in other locations depending on the cell type, and a shorter cytosolic isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ibrahim and Weiss, 2019</xref>). The cytosolic isoform of ALR, which is thought to function in hepatic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ibrahim and Weiss, 2019</xref>), lacks the first 80 amino acids, but retains the catalytic domain necessary to oxidize cysteines. Within the mitochondria, the full-length isoform of ALR localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Although the function of ALR is not entirely understood, it has been implicated in hepatic regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Polimeno et al., 2011</xref>), protection against hepatic and renal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), facilitation of cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dabir et al., 2013</xref>), and maintenance of embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Todd et al., 2010</xref>). Mice with liver-specific deletion of ALR from birth develop steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma and have exacerbated hepatic injury when exposed to alcohol, while postnatal deletion of ALR in the liver induces oxidative stress and promotes hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gandhi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that ectopic expression of mitochondria-targeted human ALR rescues the cytoplasmic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster maturation defects in <italic>Erv1</italic>-null yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that ALR may be the functional homolog of yeast Erv1p and play a role in Fe/S cluster biogenesis. However, a recent paper demonstrated that the defects of cytosolic Fe/S clusters in <italic>Erv1</italic>-null yeast may be related to a second mutation leading to decreased glutathione levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ozer et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the involvement of yeast Erv1p and mammalian ALR in cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis still requires further investigation.</p><p>The synthesis of Fe/S clusters occurs in the mitochondria on the scaffold protein iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme (ISCU). Iron destined for Fe/S cluster synthesis is imported into mitochondria by mitoferrin 1/2 and is delivered to ISCU by frataxin. The fully assembled Fe/S clusters are then transferred to Fe/S cluster-containing proteins. Because several cytosolic proteins also require Fe/S clusters for their function, another set of cytosolic proteins, collectively named as the cytosolic iron/sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) machinery, facilitates the incorporation of Fe/S clusters into cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lill et al., 2006</xref>). However, the identity of the molecule that supplies CIA machinery and how it gets out of mitochondria has not been identified. To date, ABCB7 and ABCB8 are the two mammalian mitochondrial transporters thougth to be critial for cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ye and Rouault, 2010</xref>). Proper cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation is critical for cell health. Deletion of <italic>Abcb8</italic> in mouse heart leads to cytosolic Fe/S cluster deficiency and spontaneous cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>). Conditional deletion of <italic>Iop1</italic>, one component of CIA machinery, in mice results in complete lethality, and deletion of this gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to cellular iron accumulation and rapid cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song and Lee, 2011</xref>). Previous studies in yeast have implicated three essential players for cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster biogenesis â Atm1p, Erv1p, and glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lill et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, Erv1 has also been shown to mediate cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis in the parasitic trypanosome <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haindrich et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To support adequate Fe/S cluster biogenesis, iron first enters the cells through transferrin receptor-mediated uptake. It can subsequently be stored in the cytoplasm or incorporated into heme and Fe/S clusters in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hentze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ye and Rouault, 2010</xref>). While adequate supply of iron is required for normal cellular function, excess iron can catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the levels of cellular iron are tightly regulated. The iron regulatory protein (IRP)-iron response element (IRE) system is the master regulator of cellular iron in mammals. There are two IRPs in mammalian systems, IRP1 and IRP2. In the iron-replete state, IRP1 acquires an Fe/S cluster and functions as a cytosolic aconitase, while IRP2 is proteolytically degraded in an iron- and oxygen-dependent process. In the iron-starved state, IRP1 loses its Fe/S cluster and becomes activated, and IRP2 is stabilized. Both proteins then bind to IREs within the 5â- and 3â-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA and posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Domenico et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hentze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, Erv1p, together with Mia40, is part of the oxidative folding machinery required for the import of a subset of mitochondrial proteins. Mia40 oxidizes the cysteine residues within imported proteins, and the reduced Mia40 is re-oxidized by Erv1p, effectively recycling Mia40 for further use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MÃ¼ller et al., 2008</xref>). A similar electron transfer process has also been demonstrated using recombinant human MIA40 and ALR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banci et al., 2011</xref>). A subset of proteins imported by the Mia40/Erv1p machinery, including Tim 13 and Tim 22, are involved in the mitochondrial import of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MÃ¼ller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wrobel et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, the functional significance of this protein import system on cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation and cellular iron regulation in mammalian systems remains unclear.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation depends on a functional mitochondrial protein import system consisting of ALR and MIA40. Mitochondrial ALR facilitates the mitochondrial import of ABCB8, a protein needed for the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins. Thus, a reduction in ALR and eventual reduction in the cytosolic Fe/S clusters leads to activation of IRP1 and subsequent cellular iron accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Downregulation of <italic>Alr</italic> results in cytosolic Fe/S maturation defects</title><p>Previous yeast studies demonstrated that loss of Erv1p resulted in cytosolic Fe/S cluster deficiency, which was rescued with forced overexpression of human ALR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 2001</xref>). Although the defect is restricted to cytosolic protein, humans with chronic loss of ALR demonstrate mitochondrial myopathy with respiratory chain defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambot et al., 2017</xref>). In MEF, we identified the full-length and short isoforms, with the former one predominantly in the mitochondria and the latter one in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ibrahim and Weiss, 2019</xref>). To elucidate the role of ALR in cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation and mitochondrial function in mammalian cells, we first downregulated <italic>Alr</italic> in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using pooled siRNA and demonstrated a significant reduction of <italic>Alr</italic> at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, three out of the four siRNAs in the pooled siRNA target regions shared by the full-length and the short isoform of ALR, and we observed reduction of protein levels of both isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). While previous literature in moue embryonic stem cell described significant cell death after <italic>Alr</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Todd et al., 2010</xref>), we did not observe significant cell death at 72 hr after downregulation of <italic>Alr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This discrepancy likely reflects distinct roles for ALR in differentiated versus undifferentiated cell types. As the quantity of cytosolic Fe/S clusters cannot be measured directly, the protein levels of glutamine PRPP amidotransferases (GPAT), a cytosolic protein whose maturation requires Fe/S clusters, and the activities of xanthine oxidase (XO) and cytosolic aconitase, both of which use Fe/S clusters as cofactors, were used as surrogate markers for cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation. Downregulation of <italic>Alr</italic> decreased GPAT protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and reduced XO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and cytosolic aconitase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We also measured the activity of the Fe/S cluster-containing mitochondrial complexes I and II, and found no change in complex I and II activity with <italic>Alr</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). To further assess mitochondrial function, we measured oxygen consumption in intact cells fueled with glucose and L-glutamine using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Assay, and did not observe significant difference in mitochondrial oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Our results therefore demonstrated that acute reduction in ALR impairs specifically cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation in mammalian cells similar to the previously published yeast studies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Downregulation of <italic>Alr</italic> results in cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mRNA (n = 6) and (<bold>B</bold>) protein (n = 3) levels of <italic>Alr</italic> in wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with or without <italic>Alr</italic> downregulation.

We first performed alignment of ABCB8 protein sequences in vertebrates, and identified five highly conserved cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). While mutating each of these residues had minimal effect on the interaction between ABCB8 and MIA40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), mutation of all five cysteines to serines (5CS-ABCB8) greatly diminished the interaction of ABCB8 to MIA40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To further support this model, we perform pulldown experiment of wild type MIA40 and ABCB8 in the presence of 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT greatly diminished the interaction between MIA40 and ABCB8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), similar to the 5CS mutant. The five conserved cysteine residues are not conserved between ABCB7 and ABCB8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), thereby explaining the differential dependency of MIA40/ALR protein import system on mitochondrial import of these two proteins. Thus, these five cysteine residues are collectively needed for recognition by MIA40, and the absence of one is not sufficient to disrupt the interaction between ABCB8 and MIA40. Taken together, these observations suggest that MIA40 and ABCB8 interact through disulfide bond formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mutations in ALR have been linked to mitochondrial myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambot et al., 2017</xref>), but how dysfunctional ALR drives the disease phenotype remained to be determined. Previous studies hint that ALR may function similar to its yeast homolog Erv1p and involve in cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 2001</xref>). We hereby demonstrated that through its role in mitochondrial intermembrane space, ALR is critical for cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis. The iron overload phenotype of cells with ALR deletion is reminiscent of loss of components of the CIA machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Song and Lee, 2011</xref>) or other mitochondrial protein required for cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, we discovered that downregulation of ALR prevents mitochondrial import of ABCB8, which in turn can result in cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation defects. Although ALR localizes to various compartments of the cells, our data strongly indicate that the role of ALR in the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S cluster proteins in mammalian systems depends on its localization to the mitochondria and its function in the MIA40/ALR protein import pathway. Our paper thus elucidated the molecular link between ALR and cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation in mammalian systems.</p><p>Patients with mutations in <italic>ALR</italic> that result in reduced ALR protein level develop a syndrome consisting of mitochondrial myopathy, cataract and combined respiratory chain deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambot et al., 2017</xref>). Our mechanistic studies demonstrated that <italic>ALR</italic> downregulation impairs mitochondrial import of ABCB8 protein, and decreased ABCB8 levels have been shown to cause defective cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>). This decreased mitochondrial ABCB8 level and ensued cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation defect activate IRP1 and increase cellular iron uptake. Additionally, reduction in mitochondrial ABCB8 levels is also associated with increased sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>). These two mechanisms may explain the profound muscle damage observed in patients carrying <italic>ALR</italic> mutations. It is also worth pointing out that elevated iron level has been causally linked to the cardiomyopathy phenotype in mice with cardiac-specific ABCB8 deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it would be of great interest to determine genetic or pharmacologic modulation of cellular iron as a therapy for these patients.</p><p>Tissue samples from patients with ALR mutation demonstrated depressed mitochondrial respiratory chain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Fonzo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calderwood et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>) and yeast studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 2001</xref>) demonstrated that ALR downregulation does not affect mitochondrial Fe/S cluster assembly, and similar results have been demonstrated with ABCB8 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>). There could be two potential explanations for the discrepancy. First of all, not all reported patients with ALR mutations have complex IV deficiency. Therefore, there are likely other disease modifier genes explaining this incomplete penetrance of phenotype. Additionally, the difference between these findings may be due to acute versus chronic depletion of ALR. Chronic mitochondrial iron overload, a cellular response seen in many models of cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lange et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">PondarrÃ© et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>), has been linked to mitochondrial damage. Extensive mitochondrial damage has also been demonstrated in tissue samples from patients with <italic>ALR</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nambot et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that respiratory complex activities will also be reduced in cells full of defective mitochondria. Taken together, respiratory chain deficiency in those patients is likely to be a secondary effect of chronic cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster deficiency.</p><p>Mitochondrial proteins utilize different sets of importers to reach their final destination. Import of intermembrane space proteins requires cooperation between the TOM complex and the MIA40/ALR machinery. On the other hand, proper insertion of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins requires both the TOM complex and either the TIM22 or the TIM23 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Webb and Lithgow, 2010</xref>). Both Atm1p, the yeast homolog of ABCB7, and Mdl1p, which shares significant sequence homology with ABCB8, utilize the Tim23 complex for mitochondrial import in a membrane potential-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Webb and Lithgow, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stiller et al., 2016</xref>). In this paper, we demonstrated that the transport of mammalian ABCB8 into the mitochondria is not only TIM23-dependent but also MIA40/ALR dependent. One potential explanation for the dual dependence of ABCB8 on MIA40/ALR protein import machinery as well as TIM23 complex for mitochondrial transport is that MIA40/ALR import machinery is important for the function of TIM23 complex. However, downregulation of MIA40 or ALR does not affect mitochondrial import of the canonical TIM23 complex substrate SU9-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>), and the function of the Tim23 complex was not altered in yeast lacking Mia40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wrobel et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, modulation of MIA40/ALR complex likely affects the mitochondrial of ABCB8 import upstream of TIM23 and import into the inner mitochondrial membrane. We thus propose a model where a nascent ABCB8 peptide interacts with the MIA40/ALR import system and TIM23 complex sequentially during mitochondrial import, similar to the mechanism that is reported for p53 and Mrp10 for mitochondrial import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhuang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Longen et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, we have identified the MIA40/ALR system as a novel player in mitochondrial import of ABCB8 through direct interaction with the newly synthesized peptide, which occurs prior to peptide insertion into the inner mitochondrial membrane via the TIM23 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate physical interaction between MIA40 and ABCB8 and suggest that ABCB8 is a novel substrate for the MIA40/ALR protein import system. Our sequence alignment identifies five cysteine residues that are preserved throughout higher vertebrates. These cysteines likely play a redundant function in the interaction between MIA40 and ABCB8, as the physical interaction between these ABCB8 and MIA40 did not diminish until all five cysteines were mutated. Furthermore, significantly less ABCB8 was copurified with MIA40 under a reducing condition, thereby supporting the model that ABCB8 interacts with MIA40 partially through disulfide bond formation. It is worth noting that the five conserved cysteines, or any other cysteine residues in ABCB8, do not form a CX<sub>2</sub>C or a CX<sub>9</sub>C consensus motif that is characteristic of most MIA40 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sideris et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, how MIA40 recognizes these residues and how this molecular interaction facilitates mitochondrial transport of ABCB8 require further investigation.</p><p>Although our proposed model explains how ALR is involved in cellular iron homeostasis, this mechanism likely presented late in the evolution process. Our multispecies alignment of ABCB8 homologs revealed five conserved cysteines in higher vertebrates, and our experimental evidence argues that all five cysteines are important in the interaction with MIA40. However, not all five cysteines are conserved in lower vertebrates such as zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Additionally, the functional homolog of ABCB8 in yeast has not been identified yet. While it was speculated that Mdl1p was the yeast homolog of mammalian ABCB8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>), Mdl1p only shared 28% sequence identity and additional 34% sequence similarity with human ABCB8 protein. Most of the sequence similarities reside in the ATPase domain of the protein. Therefore, our proposed mechanism is likely a late product of evolution and a similar mechanism may not exist in yeast.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation in mammalian cells depends on the mitochondrial isoform of ALR, which mediates the transport of ABCB8 into mitochondria. ALR thus plays a role in cellular iron regulation through indirectly regulating IRP1 activity. Sequence variation in conserved cysteine residues in ABCB7 and ABCB8 may explain why the mitochondrial import of only ABCB8 but not ABCB7 depends on the MIA40/ALR pathway. This report presents the first mechanism of how seemingly unrelated mitochondrial proteins involved in sulfur redox homeostasis and mitochondrial protein import are linked together in the cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation pathway, and provides additional insights into cellular iron regulation, with possible implications in diseases presenting with altered cellular iron homeostasis and Fe/S cluster maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p><italic>Tfrc</italic> promoter reporter construct was generated by cloning a fragment from â897 bp to +129 bp around mouse TfR1 transcription site into pGL3basic reporter. <italic>Tfrc</italic> 3âUTR luciferase construct was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayeva et al., 2012</xref>).

This has potential implications for ALR in regenerative biology in other systems.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Augmenter of Liver Regeneration Regulates Cellular Iron by Modulating Mitochondrial Transport of ATP-Binding Cassette B8&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Carlos Isales as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas S Weiss (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. While the work is interesting the manuscript suffers from a lack of convincing data with regards to sorting out Alr effects that are driven by the cytoplasmic isoform, versus the mitochondrial isoform. The separation between the different isoforms is shown only from figure 3; therefore, the results shown in figure 1 and 2 may have been interpreted differently if the two isoforms were differentiated. For example, in figure 1 the authors show that downregulating Alr had no significant effect on mitochondrial complex I and II activities, however, since there was no differentiation between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic isoforms, the lack of effect on mitochondrial complexes may imply enrichment of the cytoplasmic isoform. Additional data would be helpful.</p><p>2. The authors describe a stable MEF line expressing Aco1 shRNA that they created in order to test the effects of Aco1 downregulation, however, they achieved only 40% downregulation of Aco1 at the mRNA level. Therefore, they add siRNA for Aco1 and achieved greater decrease in Aco1 transcript levels. Although this technique proved to be more efficient, it is recommended that the authors discuss why the shRNA technique, which is usually very efficient, did not work in this case, as well as how combining shRNA and siRNA is applicable in studying ALR disease.</p><p>3. Mitochondrial function studies are missing from the paper. The authors mentioned in the result section that their limitation in performing mitochondrial function experiments was due to a difficulty to attain large amounts of mitochondria from MEF cells, as compared to 293 cells, which were used for this purposes. To my knowledge, MEFs are pretty easy in obtaining mitochondria for mitochondrial studies; furthermore, the authors could use more cells or bigger plates to obtain a high amount of mitochondria. Therefore, to my opinion, this explanation for using 293 cells is not valid.</p><p>4. In the material and method section as well in the figure caption the authors should present more details about how the experiments are performed enabling scientists to reproduce the data: e.g.</p><p>How long were the cells treated with siRNA before harvesting and analysis? Does the cells after ALR siRNA treatment show signs of apoptosis or cell stress as reported for murine embryonic stem cells after 72h of ALR-siRNA treatment (PMID: 20147447)?</p><p>How much protein is loaded on the gel?</p><p>What are the primer sequences for PCR differentiating endogenous and exogenous ALR (3'-UTR)?</p><p>5. Endogenous expression and localization of ALR isoforms in MEFs and HEK293 cells should be shown (western blot range from 10 to 30 kDa). Figure S3A: There are no visible bands in EV lane in cytosolic and mitochondria fractions, which would correspond to endogenous expression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65158.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

We utilized a pool of 4 siRNA to downregulate ALR in MEF cells. Three out of the four siRNA target regions shared by the long and the short isoform of ALR. Therefore, we would expect that the long isoform of ALR would be targeted equally (if not more preferentially) compared to the short isoform of ALR. Although we only showed the change in full length ALR in the main figure, we included an uncropped gel in Figure 1 figure supplement 1B that demonstrated downregulation of the short isoform of ALR after siRNA treatment. We have also revised the manuscript to better highlight the fact that siRNA targets both long and short isoforms of ALR. To further corroborate our model, we demonstrated the defect of mitochondrial ABCB8 import in cells with Mia40 downregulation. Given the similar phenotype between ALR and MIA40 downregulation and the fact that ALR and MIA40 together form one of the mitochondrial protein import systems, we deduce that mitochondrial ALR is critical for ABCB8 import into the mitochondria and therefore regulates cellular iron homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

It is well-documented that shRNA efficiency can be influenced by multiple factors, including the level of expression, the secondary structure of the shRNA, the location of the targeted sequences, and the exact sequence and thermodynamic property of the shRNA (Li et al., 2007; Taxman et al., 2010). The purpose of combining shRNA and siRNA is to utilize a multiple-targeting strategy to suppress <italic>Aco1</italic> expression, thereby creating an artificial condition to test whether ALR still has an effect on cellular iron homeostasis independent of <italic>Aco1</italic>. We have added discussion in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Mitochondrial function studies are missing from the paper.

Cells were harvested 48 hours after siRNA treatment for RNA analysis and 60-72hr after siRNA treatment for protein analysis. About 20-40ug of whole cell lysate and around 10ug of mitochondrial fraction were loaded to the gel. Additional details are also now included in figure legends. We did not observe significant cell death with ALR downregulation, and the results are now shown in Figure 1 figure supplement 1C. This difference likely reflects the distinct roles of ALR in differentiated versus undifferentiated cell types. The exogenous ALR sequence is human origin, and we have designed primers targeting specifically for human versus mouse ALR mRNA. The primer sequences are included in Supplemental table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The lack of signal in Figure S3A was limited by short exposure period and the relatively low protein amount (6ug) per lane loaded onto the gel. We confirmed the localization of ALR in a separate western blot experiment shown in Figure 1 figure supplement 1A.</p></body></sub-article></article>
