metastases, a potential source of relapse that is targetable only through systemic therapy. Studies of this occult fraction have been limited by a lack of tools with which to isolate discrete cells on spatial grounds. We developed PIC-IT, a photoconversion-based isolation technique allowing efficient recovery of cell clusters of any size – including single-metastatic cells – which are largely inaccessible otherwise. In a murine pancreatic cancer model, transcriptional profiling of spontaneously arising microcolonies revealed phenotypic heterogeneity, functionally reduced propensity to proliferate and enrichment for an inflammatory-response phenotype associated with NF-κB/AP-1 signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB depleted microcolonies but had no effect on macrometastases, suggesting microcolonies are particularly dependent on this pathway. PIC-IT thus enables systematic investigation of metastatic heterogeneity. Moreover, the technique can be applied to other biological systems in which isolation and characterization of spatially distinct cell populations is not currently feasible.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell isolation</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>photoconversion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA229803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanger</surname><given-names>Ben Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK083355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanger</surname><given-names>Ben Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A photoconversion-based isolation technique enables systematic investigation of spatially distinct small metastases (microcolonies) versus large lesions (macrometastases).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-associated mortality and remains a significant therapeutic challenge. A considerable fraction of metastasis is occult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Haeno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vanharanta and Massagué, 2013</xref>) and thus serves a potential source for residual disease and recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sosa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tohme et al., 2017</xref>). While fluorescent reporters allow detection of metastatic colonies in pre-clinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fluegen et al., 2017</xref>), an inability to recover pure micron-scale colonies has precluded systematic phenotypic analysis of early-stage metastases. Several methods have been developed to isolate cells from specific compartments in vivo, laser-capture microdissection representing the most widely used platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basnet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Espina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lovatt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). However, the use of these methods is restricted to compartments of particular size and only for specific applications due to several limitations, including (1) contamination by undesired cells within the capture field; (2) low throughput; (3) a need for expensive and temperamental hardware; (4) loss of cell viability; and (5) lack of control over population composition. Spatial transcriptomics methods continue to improve and can distinguish local patterns across large tumor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moncada et al., 2020</xref>), but resolution limits and low representation of small metastatic colonies in the tissue hinders their isolation. Photoactivable and photoconvertible proteins provide a promising alternative for targeted cell isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Medaglia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nicenboim et al., 2015</xref>). However, existing systems require specialized equipment and extended handling times, thus limiting scalability and precluding effective acquisition of rare or sporadic cells from multiple compartments such as microcolonies. Here, we report ‘PIC-IT’ (‘Photomark and Isolate Cells If Tiny’), which enables unbiased and efficient isolation of size-defined metastatic colonies from live tissues through photoconversion-based marking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PIC-IT allows isolation of size-defined microcolonies and macrometastases from live animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the PIC-IT protocol.

For these studies, we used a version of the photoconvertible protein Dendra2 fused to H2B (H2B–Dendra2). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, exposure of H2B–Dendra2-expressing pancreatic tumor cells (5074 cell line) to a mercury lamp-generated violet light (400–450 nm) for 30 s efficiently marks all cells within the field of view (FOV). Next, we engineered a highly metastatic pancreatic cancer cell line (6419 c5) to express H2B–Dendra2. Use of a clonal cell line was chosen to minimize genetic-based contribution to metastatic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hunter et al., 2018</xref>). To generate metastasis, 10<sup>4</sup> 6419c5–H2B–Dendra2 cells were injected into the pancreas of immune competent C57BL/6 mice, and tumors were allowed to grow for 3–5 weeks, at which point livers were examined under a standard widefield microscope.</p><p>Imaging revealed metastatic foci of various sizes, ranging from solitary tumor cells to micrometastases and larger macrometastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). Importantly, strong nuclear fluorescence in all tumor cells enabled easy detection of metastatic foci of a particular size even with a low magnification 4× objective, allowing for rapid identification of regions of interest. To test whether region-specific photoconversion could be achieved using a widefield microscope in unsectioned, intact tissue specimens, we confined the FOV using the field-stop element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ‘Preconversion’) and exposed cells to 400–450 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ‘Photoconversion’). Exposure for &lt;5 s (40× objective, N.A. = 0.75) led to a robust induction of red fluorescence in all cancer cells within the boundaries of the limited FOV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, ‘Postconversion’). In a different FOV, using a 10× objective, we rapidly photoconverted (15 s, N.A. = 0.4) hundreds of cancer cells within a macrometastasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Spatial precision of labeling was achieved even when a low magnification objective was used, with a rapid drop-off of photoconversion outside the FOV boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, background red fluorescence in non-converted Dendra2–H2B<sup>+</sup> cells was low, indicating minimal spontaneous conversion in our experimental model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>, top left). These results demonstrate that both small and large metastatic lesions can be efficiently photoconverted using a widefield microscope by adjusting the FOV, exposure time, and numerical aperture.</p><p>We next tested whether we could recover photoconversion-marked metastatic cells for flow cytometry-based applications. To maximize accessibility to metastatic foci, we dissected the liver into millimeter-sized fragments and photoconverted cells within each fragment separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Subsequently, each liver fragment was designated for photoconversion of microcolonies (µCol, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top) or macrometastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, middle). In parallel, cells in the primary tumor were also photoconverted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, bottom). This strategy allowed samples to remain chilled throughout the procedure, with exposure to ambient temperatures only during the photoconversion process itself (&lt;6 min). Microcolonies were defined as collections of 10 or fewer metastatic cells, with the majority being one or two cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while macrometastases were defined as lesions of &gt;400 µm in diameter. Following flow sorting, photoconverted cells derived from the different groups showed strong, comparable increases (~30-fold) in red fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Although red fluorescence increased with longer exposure times, 5 s was sufficient to permit detection of photoconverted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results indicate that tissue resident H2B–Dendra2-expressing tumor cells can be readily detected by flow cytometry following brief photoconversion and tissue dissociation.</p><p>Because low throughput has been one of the key limitations impeding studies of microcolonies, we next sought to quantify the throughput of our method. To this end, we photoconverted 200–400 microcolonies in each of 16 different isolation sessions (~2.5 hr per session) and determined the yield of photoconverted tumor cells by flow cytometry. Across these sessions, recovery of photoconverted microcolonies (Dendra-red+ cells detected by flow cytometry as a % of total photoconverted cells quantified by microscopy) averaged at 38% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, a moderate output of 80–170 cells can be acquired per hour using this experimental setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Notably, we typically used less than 30% of the liver in our marking sessions; consequently, cell yield could potentially be improved with longer sessions, as there was minimal decay in the red signal up to 7 hr post-photoconversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Cells remained viable after flow sorting, with a ~70% seeding efficiency measured 24 hr after plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, cells sorted following photoconversion showed no evidence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) or impairment of colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate robust acquisition of hundreds of live cells from size-defined metastatic foci within a practical timeframe.</p><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing of 361 metastatic and primary tumor cells via Cel-seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hashimshony et al., 2016</xref>) revealed expression of dendra2 and <italic>Krt19</italic> but not markers of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, immune cells, and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), confirming the purity of the isolated cell populations. To further validate this RNA-seq expression analysis, we identified two genes – <italic>Clca3a1 and Bnip3</italic> – whose expression was predicted to be significantly higher in macrometastases than microcolonies. We then confirmed this difference in expression by flow cytometry and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>). Taken together, our findings suggest that PIC-IT enables efficient, pure isolation of size-defined metastatic colonies, thereby enabling discovery of genes whose expression differs in the two populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PIC-IT identifies enrichment for a pro-inflammatory phenotype in liver microcolonies</title><p>In various experimental settings, colonizing metastatic cells have been associated with physiological adaptations related to cellular state preceding dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fluegen et al., 2017</xref>) and/or the surrounding microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Linde et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Milette et al., 2017</xref>). However, a systematic analysis of the phenotypic diversity of spontaneously arising microcolonies is currently lacking. We thus examined the transcriptional profiles of PIC-IT-extracted microcolonies and macrometases by Seurat clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) and visualized their features by UMAP dimensional reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>).

UMAP further identified three clusters in microcolonies and macrometastases, annotated as proliferative, inflammatory, or hypoxic/stressed, suggesting that microcolonies are phenotypically diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, the inflammatory cluster, defined by elevated IFN-γ response and complement activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), was enriched in microcolonies compared to macrometastases (30% vs. 16%). In contrast, both the inflammatory and hypoxic clusters displayed decreased abundance of proliferation-related transcripts including CCNA2, TOP2A, CDK1, Ki-67, and PCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), consistent with previous observations on growth arrest mediated by hypoxia in colonizing metastatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fluegen et al., 2017</xref>). Next, we conducted a differential gene analysis using EdgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), comparing the transcriptomes of 94 microcolonies to 111 macrometastatic cells. This revealed 500 genes that were more highly expressed in microcolonies and 366 genes that were more highly expressed in macrometastases (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Functional annotation of the microcolony-associated genes revealed a strong signal for TNF-α-related NF-κB signaling and a prominent increase in inflammatory cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Likewise, an IFN-γ-response signature was enriched in microcolonies, consistent with a pattern of enriched inflammatory gene expression. Furthermore, transcription factor motif analysis (HOMER) revealed enrichment of pro-inflammatory DNA regulatory elements in microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition to the known inflammation-related transcription factors NF-κB, JUN/AP-1, and STAT, motif analysis also revealed enrichment of binding sites for MAFK, which has recently been demonstrated to enhance the transcriptional response to NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>). In line with this enrichment of TNF-related NF-κB signaling, 29 genes associated with the Hallmark ‘TNF-α-signaling-via-NF-κB’ gene set were expressed at significantly higher levels in microcolonies compared to macrometastastic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

However, the frequency of phosphorylated-histone H3-positive cells was lower in microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting fewer mitotic events. Examination of cell cycle suppressors indicated comparable frequencies of pRB-positive cells across metastatic stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). However, expression levels of pRB were consistently higher in macrometastatic cells, indicating higher propensity for cell cycle progression in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Additional staining revealed a trend toward higher prevalence of p21 in microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

These results support our molecular profiling results and suggest that macrometastatic cells are primed for cell division (or, conversely, that microcolonies are primed for cell cycle arrest).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Microcolonies require NF-κB /AP-1 signaling</title><p>We previously reported that solitary pancreatic tumor cells exhibit resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy (gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel) in autochthonous KPCY mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiello et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, we sought to identify vulnerabilities that might be specific to tumor cells in the earliest stages of colonization. As our profiling experiments indicated enrichment of a pro-survival inflammatory response in microcolonies, we hypothesized that this pathway – driven by NF-κB and/or AP-1 – might be important for the persistence of these cells in vivo. First, we performed NF-κB-p65 staining in the 6419 c5 implanted cell line model and the KPCY autochthonous model. These two models confirmed that microcolonies exhibit higher levels of nuclear NF-κB-p65 compared to macrometastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

PIC-IT overcomes these challenges and permits the isolation and systematic characterization of cells comprising both large and small metastatic lesions. Our experiments reveal that microcolonies are a diverse cell population enriched with cells manifesting a pro-inflammatory response. Our findings further highlight a specific role for NF-κB/AP-1-regulated inflammatory pathways in microcolonies not shared by the majority of metastatic cells (macrometastases), demonstrating the utility of our approach in identifying susceptibilities of a micro-fraction of the metastatic population that drives disease recurrence and mortality. Inflammation plays a key role in tumor initiation and progression in PDAC and has also been implicated in metastasis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stone and Beatty, 2019</xref>). Non-uniform NF-kB signaling across the metastatic spectrum in our study is somewhat surprising and could potentially reflect altered levels of TNF-α in the microenvironment of a growing metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Milette et al., 2017</xref>) or a pre-existing ‘NF-kB’ activity associated with tumor dissemination. Of note, this latter possibility is hinted at by marked upregulation of TNF-α-NF-kB signaling in PDAC CTCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, as isolated microcolonies may originate in either primary tumor or metastasis, it remains to be determined whether the pro-inflammatory profile reflects the pre-metastatic state of the ‘seed’ or an acquired adaptation to the ‘soil’.</p><p>Our study also indicated differences in proliferation propensity between tumor cells of microcolonies and macrometastases. Transcriptional profiles and immunohistochemistry profiling together with direct measurement of proliferation capacity ex vivo enabled by PIC-IT, suggested that macrometastases are more ‘poised’ for proliferation compared to microcolonies. Comparable rates of Ki-67 and pRB staining suggest that microcolonies and macrometastatic cells do not differ in their commitment for cell cycle entry. Rather, as implicated by their characteristically lower pRB phosphorylation levels and phospho-histone H3+ fractions, cells in microcolonies are less committed to cell cycle progression and mitosis. Although the mechanism underlying reduced pRB phosphorylation and hypo-proliferative state in microcolonies is unclear, a recent study demonstrated that TNF-α-mediated NF-kB signaling can specifically attenuate cell cycle transition through the G1/S boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ankers et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the current study used PIC-IT to isolate cells at different stages of metastasis, the method has many potential applications. For example, it could be used to isolate cells in different ‘niches’ of the tumor microenvironment (e.g. cells in well perfused vs. poorly perfused regions), thus paving the way for testing functional features such as proliferation, migration, metabolic characteristics, and drug resistance in heterogeneous tumor cell populations. As our identification of CLCA1 shows, the technique can be used to identify protein markers – particularly those residing on the cell surface – with which to prospectively isolate cells of interest by flow cytometry. Finally, the technique is particularly well suited to the isolation of spatially defined rare cells – such as stem cells – in malignant and benign conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Pancreatic tumor cells were isolated from late-stage primary tumors from C57BL/6 background KPCY mice and generated by limiting dilution as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2018</xref>).

The merged UMI table was subsequently imported into R-studio (R version 3.3.3) and used as input for edgeR analysis to assess differentially expressed genes. Samples with more than 5,000 UMI were used for differential gene expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes were also used as input file for online GSEA following provided instruction. Detailed Scripts and parameters used for each steps of analysis could be provided by reasonable request to the authors. Gene signatures were extracted by performing edgeR analysis.</p><p>For visualization of the single cell RNA-seq results, we used the Seurat package. We performed SCT transformation for data normalization and integration. We then performed linear dimensional reduction using PCA, followed by clustering using K-nearest-neighbor graph-based clustering and Louvain modularity optimization (with dimensions = 1:15 and resolution = 1), and non-linear dimensional reduction using UMAP method. Markers for each identified clusters were generated using Seurat with default settings and used as input for function pathway analysis, including online GSEA using the molecular signatures database.</p><p>For motif analysis, top differentially expressed genes were used as input for HOMER (−1000 bp to +300 bp as scanning region) for identification of motifs of potential transcriptional regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Ex vivo culture assay and colony formation</title><p>Sorted tumor cells were seeded at a density of 45 cells per 96 wells on growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD) and allowed to grow for up to 6 days under standard culture conditions (see Cell culture). Retention was estimated 24 hr post-seeding. For colony size quantifications, cultures were evaluated daily, and the number of cells was manually counted per colony. Isolation experiments represent three experiments performed on different days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Software and statistical analysis</title><p>PRISM software and R were used for data processing, statistical analysis, and result visualization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">http://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). The R language and environment for graphics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) was used in this study for the bioinformatics analysis RNA-seq. The R packages used for all analyses described in this manuscript were from the Bioconductor and CRAN. Statistical comparisons between two groups were performed using Student’s unpaired t-test. For comparisons between multiple groups, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post-test was used. On graphs, bars represent either range or standard error of mean (SEM), as indicated in legends. For all figures, p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge Priyanka Verma and Jelena Petrovic for technical assistance with IHC and next-generation sequencing.

isolate metastatic cells, be them single (which they call microcolonies) or within macrometastasis, after injection into an in vivo model. The method consists in the use of a photoconvertible protein which changes emission from green to red when put under blue light. The authors then use their method to describe the biological characteristics of microcolonies and macrometastasis in a murine pancreatic cancer model. This methodology is elegant and has high potential to be adopted by the scientific community due to its easiness and accessibility.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dissecting phenotypic transitions in metastatic disease via photoconversion-based isolation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including C Daniela Robles-Espinoza as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Patricia A Possik (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>In this short report, Sela, Li and collaborators describe an innovative methodology that uses photoconversion of H2B-Dendra2, selective tissue processing and FACS to compare solitary disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and macrometastasis (mainly) in a model of pancreatic cancer (PanC) metastasis to the liver. The reviewers agree that the manuscript is interesting and the work presented is generally sound. However, there are a number of issues that they have raised that would need to be addressed before it can be published. If the suggested experiments cannot be performed at this stage, then the conclusions and interpretation would need to be adjusted to address these comments.</p><p>Major points</p><p>(1) The authors isolate disseminated tumor cells (DTC) and metastasis from tissues where these cells co-exist. It is assumed but not proven that the solitary DTCs came there from the pancreas and remained solitary while others grew out to form the profiled metastasis. However, the profiled DTCs could have separated from the neighboring metastasis large or small. PanC cells can be quite motile as shown by the senior author before and can move long distances (Nature. 2018 Sep;561(7722):201-205.). Further, a caveat for the interpretation of the profiles is that the presence of large metastasis may already alter the micro-environment explaining why the Seurat analysis cannot separate solitary and met populations – it is highly unusual that DTCs and metastasis do not differ in some PCA analysis. Without an exclusive solitary DTC state analysis the true nature of the DTCs may not be accurately resolved.</p><p>To solve the above issue, the authors should perform two controls: (1) take advantage from the label retaining utility of Dendra2 or H2B-Dendra 2 (some papers are cited where this advantage was utilized) and photoconvert the cells in primary lesion. Then they could track and isolate red and green DTCs and later only green clusters and profile those using the same methods. (2) Option 1 is the best as it uses fate mapping reporting on quiescence and proliferation. But an alternative option is that the authors excise livers earlier and photoconvert solitary DTCs when there are still no metastasis. This would be very informative to distinguish the profiles of solitary DTCs in the context of low burden and more homeostatic liver vs. a high burden disease liver. If there are no differences between the DTCs then the isolation of stage IV-like DTCs becomes useful to profile those even in patients. But if there are differences then it may reveal how an earlier stage liver differs in the DTC populations from a late progression liver, information that would be very useful.

On this single experiment, DTCs exhibit reduced propensity to proliferate, which for the authors was sufficient to suggest that these cells may be primed for cell cycle arrest. This conclusion needs more supporting information since no other marker of cell cycle arrest is observed.

The reviewers agree that the manuscript is interesting and the work presented is generally sound. However, there are a number of issues that they have raised that would need to be addressed before it can be published. If the suggested experiments cannot be performed at this stage, then the conclusions and interpretation would need to be adjusted to address these comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the overall positive response of the reviewers. We have edited the text and performed additional analyses to attend to the points they raise, resulting in &lt;milestone-start /&gt;5&lt;milestone-end /&gt; new main figure panels and &lt;milestone-start /&gt;2&lt;milestone-end /&gt; new supplementary figure panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points</p><p>(1) The authors isolate disseminated tumor cells (DTC) and metastasis from tissues where these cells co-exist. It is assumed but not proven that the solitary DTCs came there from the pancreas and remained solitary while others grew out to form the profiled metastasis. However, the profiled DTCs could have separated from the neighboring metastasis large or small. PanC cells can be quite motile as shown by the senior author before and can move long distances (Nature. 2018 Sep;561(7722):201-205.). Further, a caveat for the interpretation of the profiles is that the presence of large metastasis may already alter the micro-environment explaining why the Seurat analysis cannot separate solitary and met populations – it is highly unusual that DTCs and metastasis do not differ in some PCA analysis. Without an exclusive solitary DTC state analysis the true nature of the DTCs may not be accurately resolved.</p><p>To solve the above issue, the authors should perform two controls: (1) take advantage from the label retaining utility of Dendra2 or H2B-Dendra 2 (some papers are cited where this advantage was utilized) and photoconvert the cells in primary lesion. Then they could track and isolate red and green DTCs and later only green clusters and profile those using the same methods. (2) Option 1 is the best as it uses fate mapping reporting on quiescence and proliferation. But an alternative option is that the authors excise livers earlier and photoconvert solitary DTCs when there are still no metastasis. This would be very informative to distinguish the profiles of solitary DTCs in the context of low burden and more homeostatic liver vs. a high burden disease liver. If there are no differences between the DTCs then the isolation of stage IV-like DTCs becomes useful to profile those even in patients. But if there are differences then it may reveal how an earlier stage liver differs in the DTC populations from a late progression liver, information that would be very useful. Such analysis would enhance the paper as it remains limited in mechanism identification and strength of the data and phenotypes described.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data cannot unambiguously assign the source of the metastatic cells as immediate descendants of the primary tumor as opposed to already-established metastases. To avoid confusion, and apply more precise terminology, we now refer to the small metastatic lesions as “microcolonies” rather than DTCs.</p><p>The absence of clear separation in the Seurat analysis also surprised us. However, this result is consistent with findings from a previous study performed by our lab (Aiello et al., 2016). In that study, we characterized phenotypic and molecular changes associated with metastatic growth (small vs. large metastases) and found that the fraction of cycling cells is similar across the spectrum of metastatic disease. Furthermore, these results are consistent with a recent study comparing primary breast cancer cells with matched micrometastatic nodules (Davis et al., 2020). That study reported little to no separation by PCA analysis but did identify differences in specific pathways. These results suggest that transcriptional differences that distinguish cells at different stages of metastatic progression may be insufficiently diverse to drive global differences that would be detectable on a PCA plot. In the revised manuscript, we have clarified this limitation of the study namely that our comparison reflects differences between small and large metastatic lesions rather than differences between newly arrived DTCs and advanced metastases.</p><p>Finally, we thank the reviewer for suggesting several experiments that could potentially help resolve these issues. We note that “option 1” has previously been used to great advantage to dissect events in early dissemination of breast cancer (Fluegen et al., 2017). However, either approach would require substantial work (&gt;1 year) comparable in scope to that performed for the initial study. As an alternative, we turned to the autochthonous KPCY model to test whether our observation that microcolonies exhibit a pro-inflammatory profile holds true in the setting of stochastically arising micro-metastases. IHC analysis of KPC mice that have no overt metastatic disease revealed that nuclear NFkB and phospho-c-Jun staining is indeed prominent in the micro-metastases of these mice. These new data are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) About the proliferative phenotype attributed to DTCs.

To further shed light on the propensity for cell cycle arrest, we conducted comprehensive profiling of the proposed panel of cell cycle markers by immunofluorescence, which is now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 3D-H). In agreement with reduced proliferation ex vivo, tumor cells comprising microcolonies exhibited reduced staining for phospho-histone H3 (Figure 3D), indicative of reduced mitosis. Likewise, staining intensity of phospho-RB+ cells is consistently lower in microcolonies (Figure 3E,G) while cells expressing p21 are more abundant in microcolonies (Figure 3H). (Results from our staining of P16, P27, and P57 indicated lack of nuclear expression in any of the tumor cells.) Taken together, these new data support the conclusion that tumor cells in microcolonies have reduced cell cycle activity compared to macrometastases in situ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Application of DTC and macrometastasis scores to TCGA data and survival.

The results suggest that enrichment for the inflammatory signature in a primary tumor is at least as hazardous as having a high biosynthetic one. We agree, however, that it is impossible to draw conclusions about the behavior of differently sized metastatic lesions based on this analysis, and consequently we have removed these data from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there RNAseq from metastasis available to explore these mechanisms? One would assume that the profiles of the DTCs may not appear there but the macro-metastasis would?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we identified one dataset (Lin et al., 2020) comprising matched primary tumors and macrometastases. (As expected, no datasets for microcolonies could be identified.) We then asked whether the genes showing higher expression in microcolonies in our datasets exhibited higher or lower expression in macrometastases as compared to the matched primary tumors in Lin et al. As can be seen from the UMAP plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, genes that our study found to be enriched in microcolonies showed overall lower expression in macrometastases comparing to primary tumors. Specifically, some of the NF-κB transcription we found to be highly enriched in microcolonies (e.g. CXCL2, PTGS2, and INHBA) were largely absent from macrometastases in the human dataset. In contrast, genes that were enriched in macrometastasis in our dataset exhibited comparable or greater expression in human macrometastases as compared to matched primary tumors. These results overall support our observation that the low pro-inflammatory phenotype observed in our microcolonies is uncommon in macrometastasis. Because these data do not directly compare microcolonies with macrometastases, we have not included them in the revised manuscript but merely present them here for the reviewer. Finally, we note that a study comparing mouse pancreatic tumor CTCs with primary tumors derived from KPC mice (Ting et al., 2014) found that TNFa-mediated NF-κB signaling was the most highly enriched gene category in CTCs, providing independent evidence that this pathway may be active at the earliest stages of metastatic colonization. This similarity between our findings and those of Ting et al. has been noted in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63270-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the survival analyses: Were these controlled for other patient characteristics?
