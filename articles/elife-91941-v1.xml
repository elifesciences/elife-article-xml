used anticancer drugs. Previous studies suggest that lipids may play a role in CIPN. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the particular types of lipids that are regulated as a consequence of paclitaxel administration and may be associated with the occurrence of post-therapeutic neuropathy.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>High-resolution mass spectrometry lipidomics was applied to quantify d=255 different lipid mediators in the blood of n=31 patients drawn before and after paclitaxel therapy for breast cancer treatment. A variety of supervised statistical and machine-learning methods was applied to identify lipids that were regulated during paclitaxel therapy or differed among patients with and without post-therapeutic neuropathy.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Twenty-seven lipids were identified that carried relevant information to train machine learning algorithms to identify, in new cases, whether a blood sample was drawn before or after paclitaxel therapy with a median balanced accuracy of up to 90%. One of the top hits, sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P), was found to induce calcium transients in sensory neurons via the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors.SA1P also showed different blood concentrations between patients with and without neuropathy.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Present findings suggest a role for sphinganine-1-phosphate in paclitaxel-induced biological changes associated with neuropathic side effects. The identified SA1P, through its receptors, may provide a potential drug target for co-therapy with paclitaxel to reduce one of its major and therapy-limiting side effects.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation, DFG, Grants SFB1039 A09 and Z01) and by the Fraunhofer Foundation Project: Neuropathic Pain as well as the Fraunhofer Cluster of Excellence for Immune-Mediated Diseases (CIMD).

Originally isolated from the yew tree <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic>, it inhibits mitosis by stabilizing microtubules and preventing tubulin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gornstein and Schwarz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hershman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang and Horwitz, 2017</xref>). A serious dose- and therapy-limiting side effect, which it shares with other commonly used cytostatic drugs, is the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain (CIPN), which affects up to 80% of treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pachman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Patients report a variety of primarily sensory symptoms, encompassing sensations like numbness, paresthesia, spontaneous pain, and heightened sensitivity to mechanical and/or cold stimuli in their hands and feet. In more severe instances, the loss of vibration sense and joint position sense can further impact their functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cavaletti and Marmiroli, 2010</xref>). Engaging in essential daily activities becomes challenging for patients, leading to difficulties in tasks like fine finger movements (such as buttoning clothing). Walking can induce pain due to mechanical hypersensitivity, while handling tasks like retrieving items from a fridge or exposure to cold weather may exacerbate symptoms (cold hypersensitivity). Chemotherapy can also emerge post-treatment in a state termed ‘coasting’ where mild neuropathy can worsen, or new instances of CIPN may develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flatters et al., 2017</xref>). Currently, there are no pharmacologic treatments for CIPN expert for duloxetine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pachman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavaletti and Marmiroli, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, research on the mechanism of paclitaxel induced CIPN with possible identification of novel treatments is an active research topic.</p><p>Several genes and neurofilament proteins have been implicated in paclitaxel-induced neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diaz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sisignano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huehnchen et al., 2022</xref>). More recently, lipid mediators have been shown to be produced at high levels in sensory neurons, neuronal tissue and immune cells after chemotherapy due to oxidative stress and have been shown to contribute to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and neuropathic pain by modulating neuronal ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hohmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Piomelli and Sasso, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sisignano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stockstill et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, they are of particular interest as signaling molecules and potential markers for chemotherapy-induced neuropathy in patients. In fact, lipids are already considered markers for other neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Igarashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). However, a systematic approach to investigate lipids in patients with paclitaxel-induced neuropathy has not been performed.</p><p>In this prospective clinical cohort study, plasma concentrations of 255 different lipid mediators were evaluated for changes in their concentrations associated with paclitaxel treatment. A comprehensive LC-MS/MS-based targeted and LC-QTOFMS-based untargeted lipidomics screening was performed on plasma samples from paclitaxel-treated patients. Lipid groups measured included eicosanoids, endocannabinoids, oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, sphingolipids, lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, many of which have been previously associated with persistent pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osthues and Sisignano, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shapiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sisignano et al., 2014</xref>). A data-driven approach was used to identify lipid mediators whose concentrations could be used to train machine learning algorithms to identify, in new cases, whether a plasma sample was collected before or after therapy, or from a patient with or without post-therapy neuropathy. The biological relevance of the findings was then validated in vitro by applying SA1P to primary sensory neurons using calcium imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>This was a prospective single-arm study enrolling patients with breast cancer. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany (reference number 4/09). Informed written consent was obtained from each of the participants.</p><p>Sixty patients (one male, 59 females) with breast cancer and undergoing paclitaxel treatment were recruited from the Tumor Center of the University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany (UCT). Most patients (n=47) received the ‘paclitaxel-weekly’ schedule, consisting of 12 cycles of paclitaxel treatment (80 mg/m², each week); a few patients (n=13) received mixed carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A blood sample was collected from each patient before and after chemotherapy, and the degree of neuropathy after chemotherapy was assessed as described below. Plasma was isolated from the blood samples immediately after blood collection to ensure lipid stability. Plasma was stored at –80 °C until analysis.</p><p>All patients provided a blood sample before chemotherapy; however, only 36 patients of the patients provided a second blood sample after chemotherapy. For our analysis, we focused on patients that had two blood samples. Therefore, 72 samples from 36 patients (before and after chemotherapy) were analyzed using both LC-MS/MS-based targeted and LC-QTOFMS-based untargeted lipidomics. A total of 255 individual lipids were detected in each sample. From the resulting data, five patients had to be excluded due to incomplete lipidomics data (more than 20% of the analytes could not be detected).

The reason for the preference for using several but one method is that all statistical models inherently rely on underlying assumptions about a data set, some of which can be tested, but in practical scenarios it is often difficult to determine the best model to describe a real data set. All tests were two-sided, that is without a directed hypothesis, without specific expectations as to which of the d=255 lipid markers would be regulated as an effect of paclitaxel and/or as a sign of neuropathy, and in which direction this regulation might occur. Data visualization followed advisees of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lötsch and Ultsch, 2023c</xref>. The data analysis included unsupervised and supervised methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The former were used to determine whether the lipidomics data contained structures that supported prior classifications into baseline versus post-treatment samples, or into subjects with or without post-treatment neuropathy. Supervised methods were then used to identify lipid mediators that carried information relevant to this class structure of the data set. The detailed analyses are described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>Data preprocessing included examination of the distribution of the variables including evaluation of possible transformations along Tukey’s ladder of powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tukey, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Box and Cox, 1964</xref>), supported by visualizing the data using quantile-quantile plots and assessing the normal distribution using D'Agostino and Pearson tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Agostino and Pearson, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’agostino, 1971</xref>) implemented in the ‘SciPy’ Python package.

Only variables or cases with less than 20% missing values were retained.</p><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Unsupervised analysis of lipid markers to identify class structures</title><p>After log transformation and missing value imputation, lipid marker concentrations were analyzed using unsupervised methods to assess whether they contained structures consistent with a prior class structure, such as pre-/post-treatment samples or samples from patients with or without neuropathy. Z-standardized data were projected from the high-dimensional space onto lower dimensional planes by means of principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hotelling, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pearson, 1901</xref>). However, among limitations of PCA is that it focuses on the dispersion (variance) of the data, while clustering/subgrouping attempts to identify concentrations (neighborhoods) within the data, making PCA and clustering opposing methods in this sense. Furthermore, PCA fails to separate data sets with non-linear relationships, for which other projection methods have been developed, such as the currently popular t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>), which also has limitations and occasionally provides class structure to data sets that do not have class structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lötsch and Ultsch, 2019</xref>). Considering these limitations, a second unsupervised approach was used to verify the agreement between the lipidomics data structure and the prior classification, using unsupervised machine-learning applied as self-organizing maps (SOM) of artificial neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohonen, 1982</xref>). Of note, as mentioned previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lötsch and Ultsch, 2019</xref>), there are two types of SOMs, with one using a small number of neurons that are identified with clusters and a second type of which one feature is the usage of a large number of neurons up to thousands (for details about the number of neurons, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lötsch et al., 2018a</xref>), termed emergent SOM (ESOM), where emergence, that is the appearance of higher-level structures due to micro-scale interactions, can be observed by looking at structures like ridges or valleys consisting of groups of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ultsch et al., 2007</xref>). The latter was used in the present analysis, that is an emergent self-organizing map (ESOM) of artificial neurons, followed by visualization of class structure using a U-matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ultsch and Lötsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ultsch and Locarek-Junge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ultsch, 2003</xref>). In the present implementation, the network consisted of 4000 neurons arranged on a two-dimensional toroidal grid with 50 rows and 80 columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ultsch and Lötsch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ultsch, 2003</xref>). Each neuron has a position vector on the grid and a vector containing ‘weights’ with the same dimensions as the input dimensions, which were the z-standardized lipid marker concentrations. The weights were first randomly drawn from the datasets and then fitted to the data during the 20-epoch learning phase. This resulted in a representation of the dataset instances on a two-dimensional toroidal map as localizations of the respective ‘best matching units’. Furthermore, the distances between the data points were calculated using the so-called U-matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sieman HP, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lötsch and Ultsch, 2014</xref>), where the ‘height&quot; represents the average high-dimensional distance of a prototype with respect to all immediately neighboring prototypes. The corresponding visualization technique uses a topographic map including coloring. These calculations were performed using our R package ‘Umatrix’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=Umatrix">https://cran.r-project.org/package=Umatrix</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lötsch et al., 2018a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Supervised analysis to identify lipid mediators relevant to the class structure of the dataset</title><sec id="s2-5-2-1"><title>Segregation of validation data</title><p>For the supervised machine learning approach, a validation subsample of 20% of cases from each subgroup was reserved for final model validation.

The validation subsample remained untouched during feature selection and classifier training, allowing for robust evaluation of machine learning model performance on unseen data and helping to avoid overfitting. The remaining 80% of the dataset was used for training and testing the models. Thus, the following analyses were performed on the 80% training/test subsample.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Feature selection</title><p>To the relevant lipid mediators for the class structure, that is into pre- and posttreatment or neuropathy positive or negative after therapy, several feature selection methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guyon, 2003</xref>) were used. This used machine learning for knowledge discovery. The approach assumes that if a classifier can be trained to assign a patient to the correct class better than by guessing, then the features, that is the lipid mediators in the dataset needed by the classifier to accomplish this task, contain relevant information about the addressed class structure. In this way, the most informative lipids can be identified. In this use of feature selection, creating a powerful classifier is not the final goal, but feature selection takes precedence over classifier performance. This means that the analysis is considered as successful when the class assignment is just better than guessing and the variables needed for this assignment have been identified.</p><p>Specifically, applied feature selection methods included (i) PCA-based variable importance described above. Second, univariate feature selection methods were implemented as (ii) calculation of effect sizes expressed as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen, 1960</xref>), (iii) based on the false-positive rate, (iv) based on the family-wise error rate, and as (v) selection of the <italic>k</italic> best variables based on F-statistics as implemented in the ‘SelectKBest’ method available in the ‘sklearn.feature_selection’ module of the scikit-learn Python package. There, the number <italic>k</italic> of features to be selected was determined by a grid search of [1,...,18] variables in analyses based on the models specified below. Further feature selection methods were based on assignment of an importance measure to each variable following training of classification algorithms. Specifically, support vector machines (SVM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cortes and Vapnik, 1995</xref>) and random forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breiman, 2001</xref>) were selected as two commonly used classification algorithms of different types, that is class separation using hyperplanes in data projected to higher dimensions, or class separation using an ensemble of simple decision trees (for an overview of machine algorithms suitable for pain-related data, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lötsch and Ultsch, 2018b</xref>). In addition, logistic regression was included as a classical method for class assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cramer, 2002</xref>). Following training of the algorithms, the most relevant variables were selected using methods available in the ‘sklearn.feature_selection’ module of scikit-learn, including (vi) ‘SelectFromModel’ (SFM), which selects features based on importance weights in the trained algorithm, and (vii) recursive feature elimination (RFE), which selects features, by recursively considering smaller and smaller feature sets and generating a feature ranking.</p><p>Algorithm-based feature selection was performed after 20% of the members of each class had been put aside as a validation sample, which was not further touched during algorithm training and feature selection. Subsequently, hyperparameter tuning was performed for the selected algorithms including using a fivefold cross validated grid search scenario as default in the ‘GridSearchCV’ method of the ‘sklearn.model_selection’ module of scikit-learn, during which also the penalty measure was chosen from the regularization methods (i) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santosa and Symes, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>) or (ii) Ridge regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilt and Seegrist, 1977</xref>). The feature selection methods were applied in a 5x20 nested cross-validation scenario provided with the ‘RepeatedStratifiedKFold’ method from the ‘sklearn.model_selection’ module of ‘scikit-learn’, setting the parameters ‘n_splits’=5 and ‘n_repeats’=20. From each cross-validation run, the selected variables were retained. The final feature sets for each selection method were determined by applying cABC analysis to the number by which each variable was selected in the set of 100 runs, from which the variables assigned to ABC category ‘A’ were then retained. The calculations were done using a Python implementation of above-mentioned R library, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/cABCanalysis/">https://pypi.org/project/cABCanalysis/</ext-link> (full method publication pending). The tuning of the algorithms led to the selection of LASSO and Ridge regression as regularization methods for SVM and logistic regression, respectively. Other hyperparameter settings include d=1200 trees with a maximum depth of 10 decisions for random forests trained to detect the time of the sample, 200 trees when trained to distinguish post-therapy samples from patients with neuropathy, a sigmoid kernel for SVM, or the selection of the ‘newton-cg’ solver for logistic regression.</p><p>A reduced feature set was determined from the sum count at which the variables had been selected in the different approaches. The sum score across the selections was subjected to cABC analysis, from which category ‘A’ provided a ‘reduced’ set of lipid mediators. To further narrow the focus to the most relevant variables, a nested cABC analysis was performed, which consists of repeating the cABC analysis for the items in category ‘A’ of a previous cABC analysis, providing a ‘sparse’ set of lipid mediators (separate method publication pending).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Feature validation</title><p>Finally, it was assessed whether these sets of variables provided sufficient information for class separation in a sample not available during feature selection. The included algorithms were therefore trained with the full and reduced feature sets in a 5x20 nested cross-validation, using randomly selected subsets of 80% of the original training dataset for algorithm training, and applying the trained algorithms to random subsets comprising 80% of the validation dataset separated from the full original dataset before feature selection and classifier tuning. The balanced accuracy was used as the main parameter to evaluate the classification performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodersen et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the area under the receiver operator curve (roc-auc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Peterson et al., 1954</xref>) was calculated. As elaborated above, the main goal was that the classification accuracy was better than by guessing, including that the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the balanced accuracy did not include the chance level of 0.5 (=50 %). The final set of lipid mediators was then analyzed for statistical differences according to the prior classification, that is pretreatment versus posttreatment and in the posttreatment sample, neuropathy versus no neuropathy, using Kruskal-Wallis tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kruskal and Wallis, 1952</xref>).

Using permuted data for training resulted in algorithms incapable to separate sample 1 from sample 2 better than by guessing.

However, an independent second cohort was available from another hospital (Oncological Center in Offenbach, Germany). This cohort consisted of 28 patients treated with the ‘paclitaxel weekly’ regimen (paclitaxel 80 mg/m², once weekly) as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy for breast or ovarian cancer. All patients provided informed consent into study participation and publication of the results. Blood samples were available from routine collections and were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In contrast to the main cohort, plasma from patients in the second cohort was collected after six cycles of paclitaxel treatment due to local routines. Therefore, the second cohort cannot be considered a state-of-the-art validation cohort. In addition, only six patients in this cohort had neuropathy after chemotherapy (26.5%), all with grade 1 neuropathy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Despite these limitations, algorithms trained with lipid information from cohort 1 were able to successfully identify whether a probe was taken before or after paclitaxel therapy in the second cohort at a better than guessing level.

As CIPN symptoms are dose-dependent, the number of PIPN patients that receive a high paclitaxel dose is higher than the number of PIPN patients receiving a low dose. The cumulative threshold dose above which paclitaxel causes sensory neuropathy is 300 mg/m² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, we mainly used a low dose paclitaxel, because this therapeutic regimen is the most widely used paclitaxel monotherapy. Previous studies report an occurrence of neuropathy with this therapeutic regimen is around 50–70%, and most patients (80–90%) are expected to experience Grade 1 neuropathy after 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gornstein and Schwarz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hershman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang and Horwitz, 2017</xref>). Our results are within the range reported by these previous studies.</p><p>SA1P induced a direct calcium transient in sensory neurons dependent on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (S1PR) and the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel. The results suggest that lipids are altered during paclitaxel treatment and that alterations in sphingolipid metabolism may be critical for the development of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients. The final (‘sparse’) set of lipids regulated between sampling days (before and after paclitaxel treatment) was enriched for sphingolipids. Specifically, sphingolipids were significantly overrepresented among the top hits of lipids regulated between sampling days (Fisher’s exact test: p=0.01), that is while 46 of the original 255 lipid mediators were sphingolipids (18%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), 11 of the 27 members of the final sparse marker set (40.7%) belonged to the group of sphingolipids. The main pathway in which the top hits are involved is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The classification of patients with regard to neuropathy after paclitaxel treatment was reflected in lipidomics in another sphingolipid, that is dihydrosphingosine sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P), which was elevated in patients with neuropathy.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Sphingolipids and Ceramides (SPT: Serine palmitoyl-transferase; 3KR: 3-ketosphinganine reductase; SPHK: Sphingosine kinase; CerS: Ceramide synthase; DEGS: Dihydroceramide desaturase, GlCerS: Glucosylceramide synthase; LacCerS: Lactosylceramide synthase; SMS: Sphingomyelin synthase; CDase: Ceramidase).</title><p>Structures were drawn with ChemDraw 20.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91941-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The results from an unbiased machine-learning-based analysis are in line with those of previous reports that had used classical statistics mainly. For example, S1P was elevated in the spinal cord of mice after bortezomib treatment and during bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain. Blocking S1P1 receptor S1P1R with fingolimod effectively reduced bortezomib-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stockstill et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, targeting the S1P-S1P1R-axis was also found to reduce paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain in vivo in a preclinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janes et al., 2014</xref>). Further agreements of the present results relate to previous preclinical reports highlighting the significance of the sphingolipid pathway in persistent and neuropathic pain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stockstill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Squillace et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the S1P signaling axis was observed to be relevant in neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, which led to the suggestion of targeting S1P receptors as a novel approach to ameliorate chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salvemini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, present results from lipid screening and unbiased machine-learning approach point towards a relevant contribution of sphingolipid signaling in paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in patients, mainly via sphinganine-1-pshophate and sphingomyelins 33:1 and 43:1.</p><p>Sphinganine is a key branching point in the sphingolipid pathway, where it can either be acylated to form dihydroceramides or phosphorylated to SA1P by sphingosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merrill, 2011</xref>). Accumulation of sphinganine has been previously associated with reduced activity of ceramide synthase CerS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pewzner-Jung et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, low CerS2 expression is a hallmark of various tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). It is conceivable that a subgroup of the patient cohort still exhibits low CerS2 expression after paclitaxel treatment, which is associated with higher SA1P levels and a higher occurrence of neuropathy. We also identified SA1P as a potential proalgesic lipid mediator, as it causes direct calcium transients in approximately 10% of sensory neurons. This effect is mediated, at least in part, by S1P receptors S1P1 and S1P3 and the TRPV1 channel. The TRPV1 channel has previously been identified as an important mediator of neuropathic pain and is associated with exacerbated activity of sensory neurons during paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jardín et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamata et al., 2020</xref>). Our data indicate that an S1P receptor modulator, such as fingolimod may be a potential treatment strategy for reducing the proalgesic effect of SA1P and possibly for reducing paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in patients.</p><p>Several other lipids were found in the extended list of hits previously associated with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy or acute pain in preclinical studies, such as LPC 18:1, sphingosin-1-phosphate (S1P), and 9,10-EpOME. LPC 18:1 has previously been identified as an endogenous activator of TRPV1 and TRM8 and was found at elevated levels in murine DRGs 24 hr after oxaliplatin treatment. This may contribute to oxaliplatin-induced acute pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rimola et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, 9,10-EpOME was elevated in the DRGs of paclitaxel-treated mice. locking its synthesis with the CYP2J2-inhibitor and the approved drug telmisartan was shown to reduce acute paclitaxel-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in vivo and prevent paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia by pretreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sisignano et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the direct TRPV1 agonist LPA 18:1 was found in the extended list of hits. Lipid was shown to bind to the C-terminal binding site of TRPV1 to increase the opening probability of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nieto-Posadas et al., 2012</xref>). Other signaling lipids with potential proalgesic effects and potential TRP channel activators that have been described previously have also been identified as crucial for group separation by our unbiased machine-learning approach, which strengthens the presumption that the identified lipids may indeed be connected with paclitaxel neurotoxicity and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in patients. Additionally, we found several precursor fatty acids in the extended list of hits, including arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid. These results imply a major dysregulation of lipids after paclitaxel treatment, leading to enhanced plasma levels of precursors for eicosanoids and oxidized linoleic acid metabolites, which may explain the observed enhanced concentrations of the eicosanoids of 5-HETE, 5,6-DHET, and the oxidized linoleic acid metabolites 9,10-EpOME, 9- and 13-HODE.</p><p>Several limitations need to be addressed. First, the size of our patient cohort (n=60 patients, n=31 patients who provided blood samples before and after paclitaxel chemotherapy) allowed for errors due to interindividual differences. Second, the paclitaxel treatment regimen differed in some patients included in this study. While the majority of the patients received paclitaxel as ‘pacli weekly’ regime consisting of a weekly dose of 80 mg/m² for 12 consecutive weeks in, some few patients received paclitaxel doses up to 220 mg/m² or a combination chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin/paclitaxel. These variabilities within the patient cohort hamper interindividual correlations between plasma lipid mediator concentrations and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy throughout the treatment course. Third, the assessment of peripheral neuropathy in patients was performed according to the guidelines of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, which ranks the severity of neuropathy into five grades but is rather focused on general adverse events of chemotherapy rather than specifically assessing peripheral neuropathy in detail. We did not perform any neurological testing of sensory parameters, such as quantitative sensory testing (QST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maier et al., 2010</xref>), to determine the sensory status quo of the patients.</p><p>The identification of sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P) as a key lipid marker delineating the effects of paclitaxel was based on a comprehensive analysis performed by a ‘mixture of experts’ of machine learning and classical statistical methods, coupled with in vitro molecular experiments performed on sensory neurons. A rigorous validation process was applied to ensure that the results did not depend on the properties of any single statistical or AI model. This included verifying that the lipidomics data intrinsically supported the existing class structure (days 1/2) using two different data projection methods (PCA, neural network). In addition, the identification of the most relevant lipids associated with past exposure to paclitaxel relied on univariate and multivariate feature selection, and the results were verified by testing three different algorithms that finally could successfully identify from the concentrations of the top hits whether a blood sample was drawn before or after paclitaxel therapy. In addition, all data analyses were subjected to rigorous cross-validation. Results were first validated on a sample split from cohort #1 prior to any feature selection and classifier training, and again on the data from cohort #2. Then, the leading hit from machine learning, SA1P, was validated as a highly active mediator in a neuronal cell model, while a lipid maker deemed irrelevant by machine learning actually showed ineffectiveness in the cell model. The mechanistical details of altered sphingolipid metabolism reflected in their plasma concentrations of paclitaxel patients need to be investigated by further studies.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that the combination of state-of-the-art lipidomics using LC-MS/MS, LC-QTOF-MS, and machine learning-based data analysis can robustly lead to the generation of testable hypotheses and the identification of biologically relevant signaling mediators of neuropathy in an unbiased manner. Lipidomic profiles were compared within the same patients, allowing analysis of individual paclitaxel-induced lipidome changes in the same patients. These analyses led to the identification of a lipid mediator that can directly activate calcium transients in sensory neurons, thereby modulating nociceptive processing and sensory neuron activity. The identified SA1P, through its receptors, may provide a potential drug target for co-therapy with paclitaxel to reduce one of its major and therapy-limiting side effects.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Supervision, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki on Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany (reference number 4/09).

Multiple methods, including machine learning as well as more conventional statistical modelling, were used to classify lipid patterns before and after paclitaxel treatment and in conjunction with neuropathy status. Lipid profiles before and after paclitaxel therapy were analysed from 31 patients. The study aimed to characterize from the lipid profile if plasma samples were collected pre paclitaxel or post paclitaxel and their relevance to neuropathy status. Sphingolipids including sphinganine-1-phosphate (SA1P) differed between patients with and without neuropathy. To examine the potential role of SA1P, it was applied to murine primary sensory neuron cultures, and produced calcium transients in a proportion of neurons. This response was abolished by application of a TRPV1 antagonist. The number of neurons responding to SA1P was partially reduced by the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1) modulator fingolimod.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of this study include the use of multiple methods to classify lipid patterns and the attempt to validate findings from the clinical cohort in a preclinical model using primary sensory neurons.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>These still stand from the original review and are repeated here:</p><p>There are a number of weaknesses in the study. The small sample size is a significant limitation of the study. Out of 31 patients, only 17 patients were reported to develop neuropathy, with significant neuropathy (grade 2/3) in only 5 patients. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the results and discussion sections of the manuscript, but it limits the interpretation of the results. Also acknowledged is the limited method used to assess neuropathy.</p><p>Potentially due to this small number of patients with neuropathy, the machine learning algorithms could not distinguish between samples with and without neuropathy. Only selected univariate analyses identified differences in lipid profiles potentially related to neuropathy.</p><p>Three sphingolipid mediators including SA1P differed between patients with and without neuropathy at the end of treatment. These sphingolipids were elevated at end of treatment in the cohort with neuropathy, relative to those without neuropathy. However, across all samples from pre to pos- paclitaxel treatment, there was a significant reduction in SA1P levels. It is unclear from the data presented what the underlying mechanism for this result would be. If elevated SA1P is associated with neuropathy development, it would be expected to increase in those who develop neuropathy from pre to post-treatment timepoints.</p><p>Primary sensory neuron cultures were used to examine the effects of SA1P application. SA1P application produced calcium transients in a small proportion of sensory neurons. It is not clear how this experimental model assists in validating the role of SA1P in neuropathy development as there is no assessment of sensory neuron damage or other hallmarks of peripheral neuropathy. These results demonstrate that some sensory neurons respond to SA1P and that this activity is linked to TRPV1 receptors. However, further studies will be required to determine if this is mechanistically related to neuropathy.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>Taken in total, the data presented do not provide sufficient evidence to support the contention that SA1P has an important role in paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. Further, the results do not provide evidence to support the use of S1PR1 receptor antagonists as a therapeutic strategy. It is important to be careful with language use in the discussion, as the significance of the present results are overstated.</p><p>However, based on the results of previous studies, it is likely that sphingolipid metabolism plays a role in chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. Based on this existing evidence, the S1PR1 receptor antagonist fingolimod has already been examined in experimental models and in clinical trials. Further work is needed to examine the links between lipid mediators and neuropathy development and identify additional strategies for intervention.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><p>The concerns raised during the review have been incorporated into the discussion of the results, and the need for further research is acknowledged in the paper. This is not possible in the present study, as the clinical project has been completed and further patients cannot be enrolled without starting a new project. We are confident that the results are scientifically valid and that the methodology was scientifically sound and up to date. They were obtained on a dataset that was obviously large enough to allow 20% of it to be set aside and a machine-learned classifier to be trained on the remaining 80%, which then assigned samples to neuropathy with an accuracy better than guessing.</p><p>Furthermore, our results are at least tentatively replicated in a completely independent data set from another patient cohort. The strengths and limitations of the study design, in particular the latter, are discussed in the necessary depth. In summary, the machine-learned results provided major hits on one side and probably unimportant lipids on the other side of the variable importance scale. Both could be verified in vitro. We are therefore confident that we have contributed to the advancement of knowledge about cancer therapy-associated neuropathy and look forward to further developments in this area.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses Reviewer 1:</p><p>There are a number of weaknesses in the study. The small sample size is a significant limitation of the study. Out of 31 patients, only 17 patients were reported to develop neuropathy, with significant neuropathy (grade 2/3) in only 5 patients. The authors acknowledge this limitation in the results and discussion sections of the manuscript, but it limits the interpretation of the results. Also acknowledged is the limited method used to assess neuropathy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the cohort size and assessment of neuropathy are limitations of our study as we already described in the corresponding section of the manuscript. However, occurrence and grade of the neuropathy are in line with results reported from previous studies. From these studies, the expected occurrence of neuropathy with our therapeutic regimen is around 50-70% (54.9% in our cohort), and most patients (80-90%) are expected to experience Grade 1 neuropathy after 12 weeks (13). In these studies, neuropathy is assessed by using questionnaires or by grading via NCTCTCAE as in our study. In summary, assessment and occurrence of neuropathy of our reported cohort are in line with previous reports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Potentially due to this small number of patients with neuropathy, the machine learning algorithms could not distinguish between samples with and without neuropathy. Only selected univariate analyses identified differences in lipid profiles potentially related to neuropathy.</p></disp-quote><p>The data analysis consistently followed a &quot;mixture of experts&quot; approach, as this seems to be the most successful way to deal with omics data. We have elaborated on this in the Methods section, including several supporting references. Regarding the quoted sentence from the results section, after rereading it, we realized that it was somewhat awkwardly worded. What we mean is now better worded in the results section, namely “Although the three algorithms detected neuropathy in new cases, unseen during training, at balanced accuracy of up to 0.75, while only the guess level of 0.5 was achieved when using permuted data for training, the 95% CI of the performance measures was not separated from guess level”. Therefore, multivariate feature selection was not considered a valid approach, since it requires that the algorithms from which the feature importance is read can successfully perform their task of class assignment (4). Therefore, univariate methods (Cohen's d, FPR, FWE) were preferred, as well as a direct hypothesis transfer of the top hits from the abovementioned day1/2 assessments to neuropathy. Classical statistics consisting of direct group comparisons using Kruskal-Wallis tests (5) were performed.”</p><p>It was our approach to investigate the data set in an unbiased manner by different machine learning algorithms and select those lipids that the majority of the algorithms considered important for distinguishing the patient groups (majority voting). This way, the inconsistencies and limitations of a single evaluation method, such as regression analysis, that occur in some datasets, can be mitigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Three sphingolipid mediators including SA1P differed between patients with and without neuropathy at the end of treatment. These sphingolipids were elevated at the end of treatment in the cohort with neuropathy, relative to those without neuropathy. However, across all samples from pre to post-paclitaxel treatment, there was a significant reduction in SA1P levels. It is unclear from the data presented what the underlying mechanism for this result would be.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our study does not identify the mechanism by which paclitaxel treatment alters sphingolipid concentrations in the plasma of patients. It has been reported before that paclitaxel may increase expression and activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) which is the crucial enzyme and rate-limiting step in the <italic>denovo</italic> synthesis of sphingolipids. This may be associated with a shift towards increased synthesis of 1-deoxysphingolipids and a decrease of “classical” sphingolipids (6) and may explain the general reduction of SA1P and other sphingolipid levels after paclitaxel treatment in our study.</p><p>It is also conceivable that paclitaxel reduces the release of sphingolipids into the plasma. Paclitaxel is a microtubule stabilizing agent (7) that may interfere with intracellular transport processes and release of paracrine mediators.</p><p>The mechanistic details of paclitaxel involvement in sphingolipid metabolism or transport are highly interesting but identifying them is beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If elevated SA1P is associated with neuropathy development, it would be expected to increase in those who develop neuropathy from pre to post-treatment time points.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a general trend of reduced plasma SA1P concentrations following paclitaxel treatment. Nevertheless, patients experiencing neuropathy exhibit significantly elevated SA1P levels post-treatment.</p><p>It has been shown before that paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain requires activation of the S1P1 receptor in a preclinical study (8). Moreover, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from two clinical cohorts identified multiple regulatory elements and increased activity of S1PR1 associated with paclitaxel-induced neuropathy (9). These data imply that enhanced S1P receptor activity and signaling are key drivers of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. It seems that both, increased levels of the sphingolipid ligands in combination with enhanced expression and activity of S1P receptors can potentiate paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in patients. This explains why also decreased SA1P concentrations after paclitaxel treatment can still enhance neuropathy via the S1PRTRPV1 axis in sensory neurons.</p><p>We added this paragraph to the discussions section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Primary sensory neuron cultures were used to examine the effects of SA1P application.</p><p>SA1P application produced calcium transients in a small proportion of sensory neurons. It is not clear how this experimental model assists in validating the role of SA1P in neuropathy development as there is no assessment of sensory neuron damage or other hallmarks of peripheral neuropathy. These results demonstrate that some sensory neurons respond to SA1P and that this activity is linked to TRPV1 receptors. However, further studies will be required to determine if this is mechanistically related to neuropathy.</p></disp-quote><p>As we detected elevated levels of SA1P in the plasma of PIPN patients, we can assume higher concentrations in the vicinity of sensory neurons. These neurons are the main drivers for neuropathy and neuropathic pain and are strongly affected by paclitaxel in their activity (10-15). Also, TRPV1 shows altered activity patterns in response to paclitaxel treatment (16). Because of its relevance for nociception and pathological pain, TRPV1 activity is a suitable and representative readout for pathological pain states in peripheral sensory neurons (17, 18), which is why we investigated them.</p><p>We would like to point out the potency of SA1P to increase capsaicin-induced calciumtransients in sensory neurons at submicromolar concentrations.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that further studies need to investigate the underlying mechanisms in more detail. We added this sentence to the final paragraph in the discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses Reviewer 2:</p><p>The article is poorly written, hindering a clear understanding of core results. While the study's goals are apparent, the interpretation of sphingolipids, particularly SA1P, as key mediators of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy lacks robust evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the relevance of SA1P as key mediator of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy might be overstated and changed the wording throughout the manuscript accordingly. However, we would like to point out the potency of this lipid to increase capsaicin-induced calcium-transients in sensory neurons at submicromolar concentrations.</p><p>Also, the lipid signature in the plasma of PIPN patients shows a unique pattern and sphingolipids are the group that showed the strongest alterations when comparing the patient groups. We also measured eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, linoleic acid metabolites, endocannabinoids and other lipid groups that have previously been associated with influences on pain perception or nociceptor sensitization. However, none of these lipids showed significant differences in their concentrations in patient plasma. This is why we consider sphingolipids as contributors to or markers of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy in patients.</p><p>We also revised the entire article to improve its clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction fails to establish the significance of general neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy in anticancer drug-treated patients, and crucial details, such as the percentage of patients developing general neuropathy or peripheral neuropathy, are omitted. This omission is particularly relevant given that only around 50% of patients developed neuropathy in this study, primarily of mild Grade 1 severity with negligible symptoms, contradicting the study's assertion of CIPN as a significant side effect.</p></disp-quote><p>As we already described in the introduction, CIPN is a serious dose- and therapy-limiting side effect, which affects up to 80% of treated patients. This depends on dose and combination of chemotherapeutic agents. For paclitaxel, therapeutic doses range from 80 – 225 mg/m². As CIPN symptoms are dose-dependent, the number of PIPN patients that receive a high paclitaxel dose is higher than the number of PIPN patient receiving a low dose.</p><p>In our study, we mainly used a low dose paclitaxel, because this therapeutic regimen is the most widely used paclitaxel monotherapy. From previous studies, the expected occurrence of neuropathy with this therapeutic regimen is around 50-70%, and most patients (8090%) are expected to experience Grade 1 neuropathy after 12 weeks (1-3).</p><p>Our results are within the range reported by these studies (54.9% patients with neuropathy). Also, as we highlight in Table S1, the neuropathy symptoms persist in most cases for several years after chemotherapy, affecting quality of life of these patients which makes it far from being a negligible symptom.</p><p>We added some more information concerning PIPN in the introduction section in which we emphasize the clinical problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lack of clarity in distinguishing results obtained by lipidomics using machine learning methods and conventional methods adds to the confusion. The poorly written results section fails to specify SA1P's downregulation or upregulation, and the process of narrowing down to sphingolipids and SA1P is inadequately explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to keep the machine learning part in the main manuscript short and moved major parts of it to a supplement. However, as this has been claimed to have led to a lack of clarity, we have expanded the description of the data analysis and added extensive explanations and supporting references for the mixed expert approach that was used throughout the analysis. We hope this is now clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Integrating a significant portion of the discussion section into the results section could enhance clarity. An explanation of the utility of machine learning in classifying patient groups over conventional methods and the citation of original research articles, rather than relying on review articles, may also add clarity to the usefulness of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we moved the relevant parts from the discussion to the results section in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 2 should be better explained or removed. In its current form, it does not add to the interpretation of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have expanded the description of the ESOM/U-matrix method in the Methods section and rewritten the figure legend. In addition, we have annotated the U-matrix in the figure. The method has been reported extensively in the computer science and biomedical literature, and a more detailed description in the referenced papers would go beyond the current focus on lipidomics. However, we believe that this discussion is sufficiently detailed for the readers of this report: &quot;… a second unsupervised approach was used to verify the agreement between the lipidomics data structure and the prior classification, implemented as self-organizing maps (SOM) of artificial neurons (19). In the special form of an “emergent” SOM (ESOM (20)), the present map consisted of 4,000 neurons arranged on a two-dimensional toroidal grid with 50 rows and 80 columns (21, 22). ESOM was used because it has been repeatedly shown to correctly detect subgroup structures in biomedical data sets comparable to the present one (20, 22, 23). The core principle of SOM learning is to adjust the weights of neurons based on their proximity to input data points. In this process, the best matching unit (BMU) is identified as the neuron closest to a given data point. The adaptation of the weights is determined by a learning rate (η) and a neighborhood function (h), both of which gradually decrease during the learning process. Finally, the groups are projected onto separate regions of the map. On top of the trained ESOM, the distance structure in the high-dimensional feature space was visualized in the form of a so-called U-matrix (24) which is the canonical tool for displaying the distance structures of input data on ESOM (21).</p><p>The visual presentation facilitates data group separation by displaying the distances between BMUs in high-dimensional space in a color-coding that uses a geographical map analogy, where large &quot;heights&quot; represent large distances in feature space, while low &quot;valleys&quot; represent data subsets that are similar. &quot;Mountain ranges&quot; with &quot;snow-covered&quot; heights visually separate the clusters in the data. Further details about ESOM can be found in (24).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second patient cohort is only included in the discussion - with cohort details in the supplementary material and figures included in the main text. Perhaps these data should be removed entirely. The findings are described as trends and not statistically significant and multiple issues with this second cohort are mentioned in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that including the second patient cohort in the discussion is inadequate. Of course, there are differences between the patient cohorts that do not allow direct comparison and that are highlighted in the section on limitations of the study. However, we still think it is interesting and relevant to show these data, because we used our algorithms trained on the first patient cohort to analyze the second cohort. And these data support the main results.</p><p>We therefore moved the entire paragraph to the results section of to improve coherence of our manuscript.
