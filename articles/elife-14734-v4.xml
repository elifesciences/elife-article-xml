has transforming activities. However, in the clinic, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status does not accurately predict cancer progression. Here we report, based on clinical analysis corroborated with experimental data, that the p53 isoform Δ133p53β promotes cancer cell invasion, regardless of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status. Δ133p53β increases risk of cancer recurrence and death in breast cancer patients. Furthermore Δ133p53β is critical to define invasiveness in a panel of breast and colon cell lines, expressing WT or mutant <italic>TP53</italic>. Endogenous mutant Δ133p53β depletion prevents invasiveness without affecting mutant full-length p53 protein expression. Mechanistically WT and mutant Δ133p53β induces EMT. Our findings provide explanations to 2 long-lasting and important clinical conundrums: how WT <italic>TP53</italic> can promote cancer cell invasion and reciprocally why mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene does not systematically induce cancer progression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14734.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14734.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14734.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most cancers are caused by a build-up of mutations that are acquired throughout life. One gene in particular, called <italic>TP53</italic>, is the most commonly mutated gene in many types of human cancers. This suggests that <italic>TP53</italic> mutations play an important role in cancer development.</p><p>It is widely considered that the <italic>TP53</italic> gene normally stops tumors from forming, while mutant forms of the gene somehow promote cancer growth. Evidence from patients with cancer has shown, however, that the relationship between <italic>TP53</italic> mutations and cancer is not that simple. Some very aggressive cancers that resist treatment and spread have a normal <italic>TP53</italic> gene. Some cancers with a mutated gene do not spread and respond well to cancer treatments. Recent studies have shown that the normal <italic>TP53</italic> gene produces many different versions of its protein, and that some of these naturally occurring forms are found more often in tumors that others. However, it was not clear if certain versions of <italic>TP53</italic>’s proteins contributed to the development of cancer.</p><p>Now, Gadea, Arsic, Fernandes et al. show that Δ133p53β, one version of the protein produced by the <italic>TP53</italic> gene in human cells, helps tumor cells to spread to other organs. Tests of 273 tumors taken from patients with breast cancer revealed that tumors with the Δ133p53β protein were more likely to spread. Patients with these Δ133p53β-containing tumors were also more likely to develop secondary tumors at other sites in the body and to die within five years.</p><p>Next, a series of experiments showed that removing Δ133p53β from breast cancer cells grown in the laboratory made them less likely to invade, while adding it back had the opposite effect. The same thing happened in colon cancer cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments showed that Δ133p53β causes tumor cells with the normal <italic>TP53</italic> gene or a mutated <italic>TP53</italic> gene to spread to other organs.</p><p>Together the new findings help explain why some aggressive cancers develop even with a normal version of the tumor-suppressing <italic>TP53</italic> gene. They also help explain why not all cancers with a mutant version of the <italic>TP53</italic> gene go on to spread. Future studies will be needed to determine whether drugs that prevent the production of the Δ133p53β protein can help to treat aggressive cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14734.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14734.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>p53 isoforms</kwd><kwd>cancer invasion</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gadea</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name><name><surname>Arsic</surname><given-names>Nikola</given-names></name><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gadea</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name><name><surname>Arsic</surname><given-names>Nikola</given-names></name><name><surname>Roux</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000301</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Campaign</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCC: 2010NovPR50</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernandes</surname><given-names>Kenneth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000301</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Campaign</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCC: 2010NovPR16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Remenyi</surname><given-names>Judit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007391</institution-id><institution>Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AO/3/5099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khoury</surname><given-names>Marie P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000301</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Campaign</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCC: TB2009DUN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quinlan</surname><given-names>Philip R</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Alastair M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009794</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Now</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012MaySF127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourdon</surname><given-names>Jean-Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clinical analysis corroborated with experimental data demonstrate that Δ133p53β, a naturally occurring isoform of p53 protein, induces a pro-metastatic program and is a clinical indicator of metastasis, independently of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer is driven by somatically acquired point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, that are thought to accumulate gradually over time. Recent whole cancer genome sequencing studies have conclusively established that the tumor suppressor gene, <italic>TP53,</italic> is the most frequently mutated gene in a wide range of cancer types. In tumors expressing wild-type (WT) <italic>TP53</italic> gene, numerous experimental and clinical data have shown that viruses or cellular oncogene proteins target the p53 pathway, promoting abnormal cell proliferation. Altogether these data strongly suggest that defects in <italic>TP53</italic> tumor suppressor activity are a compulsory step to cancer formation. In addition, ample data have also demonstrated that <italic>TP53</italic> gene, whether WT or mutant, has a paramount biological and clinical role in response to cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Do et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muller et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that the human <italic>TP53</italic> gene expresses at least twelve p53 isoforms through alternative splicing of intron-2 (Δ40) and intron-9 (α, β, γ), initiation of transcription in intron-4 (Δ133) and alternative initiation of translation at codon 40 (Δ40) and codon 160 (Δ160). This leads to the expression of p53 (α, β, γ), Δ40p53 (α, β, γ), Δ133p53 (α, β, γ) and Δ160p53 (α, β, γ) protein isoforms that contain different transactivation domain, oligomerisation domains and regulatory domains (for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>).</p><p>All animal models (zebrafish, drosophila and mouse) of p53 isoforms and experimental data in human cells of diverse tissue origins have consistently shown that p53 isoforms regulate cell cycle progression, programmed cell death, replicative senescence, viral replication, cell differentiation and angiogenesis. Several clinical studies reported that abnormal expressions of p53 isoforms are found in a wide range of human cancers including breast and colon cancers and that p53 isoforms are associated with cancer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joruiz and Bourdon, 2016</xref>). However, it is not known whether they are just markers or play an active role in cancer formation and progression. Recently, we reported that Δ133p53β promotes cancer stem cell potential and metastasis formation in a xenograft mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arsic et al., 2015</xref>). However, its physiopathological role, its molecular mechanism, its association with cancer progression and the effect of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations on its activities have never been investigated.</p><p>To date, it is currently thought that all the tumor suppressor activities associated with <italic>TP53</italic> or the oncogenic activities associated with mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene expression are implemented by the canonical full-length p53 protein (also named TAp53α or p53α). It is well established that TAp53α , is a transcription factor rapidly activated to restore and maintain cell integrity in response to alteration of cell homeostasis, while most TAp53α missense mutants have compromised tumor suppressor activities and have acquired transforming activities.</p><p>Compelling evidence indicates that WT TAp53α protein, plays a pre-eminent role in preventing human cancer formation and progression to metastasis. In particular, WT TAp53α protein prevents cell migration and invasion which are the main traits of Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), which itself involves global genome reprogramming that drives cancer progression to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suva et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, most TAp53α missense mutant proteins promote EMT, inducing cancer cells to leave their primary tumor site and disseminate, leading to metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gadea et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roger et al., 2010</xref>). However, there remain many enigmas concerning the association of p53 expression with cancer progression and treatment largely due to the natural existence of multiple alternative transcripts from the <italic>TP53</italic> gene. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Roock et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brosh and Rotter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petitjean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soussi, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The main focus of this study is the role of Δ133p53β in cancer progression. We show that Δ133p53β is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, particularly in luminal A breast cancer patients who express WT <italic>TP53.</italic> This indicates that Δ133p53β, which is a physiological gene product of <italic>TP53</italic>, is a predictor of cancer cell invasion and increased risk of death. We corroborate the clinical analysis by demonstrating experimentally that Δ133p53β promotes invasion using a panel of breast cancer cell models expressing WT and mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene. Similar results were obtained in a panel of colon cancer cell lines. Depletion of endogenous mutant Δ133p53β prevents invasiveness despite unaltered strong expression of mutant TAp53α. Reciprocally, introduction of WT Δ133p53β promotes invasion of WT <italic>TP53</italic> cells devoid of endogenous Δ133p53β expression.

As there is no antibody specific of Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β or Δ133p53γ protein isoform, we developed a nested RT-PCR method that specifically detects and identifies Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β or Δ133p53γ mRNA variants in tumor samples. Briefly, the RT-PCR method is based on the previously described RT-PCR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khoury et al., 2013</xref>) but its sensitivity and specificity have been improved (A fully detailed protocol is provided in the 'Extended Experimental Procedure' section and the primer sequences are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). It enables to specifically detect and identify expression of Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β or Δ133p53γ mRNA variants in tumor samples. This nested RT-PCR analysis allows thus to investigate the association of Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β or Δ133p53γ expression with the clinico-pathological markers and/or patient clinical outcome.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14734.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Primers for specific amplification of Δ133p53 isoforms mRNAs by nested RT-PCR.

To clarify the univariate analyses and adjust for possible confounding variables, the association of overall survival and disease-free survival with Δ133p53β, the breast cancer subtypes (luminal-A, luminal-B, HER2+, triple-negative and luminal/HER2+), <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and/or tumor size (&gt;20 mm) were investigated using the multivariate Cox’s regression analysis. The cohort was composed of 112 luminal-A, 43 luminal-B, 49 luminal/HER2+, 20 HER2+ and 49 triple-negative tumors. We observed that the luminal-A subtype was, as expected, the most significant independent predictor of disease-free survival (HR = 3.09, 95% CI, 1.78 to 5.38, p&lt;1.10<sup>–4</sup>) and overall survival (HR = 4.15, 95% CI, 2 to 8.62, p&lt;1.6 10<sup>–4</sup>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5A</xref>).

We determined by an Omnibus test of model coefficient that the Cox-regression model is fitted (χ<sup>2 </sup> = 17.589, 1 df, p&lt;2.7 10<sup>–5</sup>), indicating that the number of luminal-A tumors in our cohort is sufficient to support the conclusions. Among all the parameters included in the analysis (Δ133p53β, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and tumor size [&gt;20 mm]), Δ133p53β stood out as the most significant independent predictor of cancer recurrence and death within the luminal-A subgroup regardless of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status or presence of lymph node metastasis (Hazard ratio [HR], 7.93; 95% CI, 2.52 to 25; p&lt;4.31 10<sup>–4</sup>; [HR], 3.29; 95% CI, 1.125 to 9.63; p&lt;0.03, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5B</xref>, respectively).

Of note, although the SW620 and SW480 cell lines have a mutated <italic>TP53</italic> gene (R273H) and come from the same patient, only SW620 are highly invasive, indicating that the expression of mutant TAp53α-R273H protein is not sufficient to explain invasive activities. We thus measured Δ133p53 mRNA expression by RT-qPCR (Taqman) and found it significantly higher in the invasive cell lines whether they express WT or mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene, i.e. LoVo, SW620 and CoLo205, as compared with HCT116 and SW480 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), in agreement with the results obtained in the breast cancer cell lines. To confirm the role of Δ133p53 isoforms in cell invasion, we knocked-down these isoforms in mutant <italic>TP53</italic> SW620, or WT <italic>TP53</italic> LoVo CRC cells by using si133-1 and si133-2, which led to a significant decrease invasive capacity in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figures supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Importantly, depletion of the p53 protein isoforms with siTA that targets only the p53 proteins containing the transactivation domains (i.e TAp53α, TAp53β, TAp53γ, Δ40p53α, Δ40p53β, Δ40p53γ) without altering expression of Δ133p53 isoform did not change the invasive activity of MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN. This indicates that the simultaneous depletion of all TAp53 (including mutant TAp53α) did not impair MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cell invasion.</p><p>It has previously been reported that overexpression of mutant TAp53α promotes integrin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) recycling, thus driving invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muller et al., 2009</xref>).

MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells showed a significantly higher invasiveness as compared to parental MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN expressed higher levels of Δ133p53 mRNA variants and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Similar results were observed in mutant <italic>TP53</italic> colon cancer cell lines. The SW480 and SW620 colon carcinoma cell lines derive respectively from the primary and secondary tumors resected from the same patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hewitt et al., 2000</xref>). Although SW480 and SW620 cells express the same mutant <italic>TP53</italic>-R273H gene, SW480 cells are far less invasive than the SW620 cells. Interestingly, SW480 cells express much less Δ133p53 mRNAs than the SW620 cells. Importantly, depletion of endogenous Δ133p53 isoforms from SW620 cells reduces cell invasion, despite unaltered and strong expression of mutant TAp53α protein. This indicates that the role of endogenous mutant Δ133p53 isoforms in promoting invasiveness may be extended to other tissue types and that endogenous Δ133p53 isoform expression regulates cancer cell invasion in <italic>TP53</italic> mutant colon and breast cancer cells, irrespective of the full-length p53 (TAp53α) expression.</p><p>Importantly, the invasive activity of Δ133p53 isoforms is not associated with <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status since depletion of ∆133p53 isoforms in WT <italic>TP53</italic> colon carcinoma LoVo cells abolishes their scattering and invasive activities. ∆133p53 isoform expression thus explains the inconsistent clinical association between <italic>TP53</italic> mutation and metastasis.</p><p>Interestingly, the introduction of WT Δ133p53β in the poorly invasive WT <italic>TP53</italic> MCF7 breast cancer cells that express all WT p53 isoforms but Δ133p53β, enhances MCF7 invasive activity. In WT <italic>TP53</italic> HCT116 colon cancer cells, that express all WT p53 protein isoform including low level of Δ133p53β protein, we demonstrated that HCT116 invasive activity can be controlled (enhanced or inhibited) by siRNAs specific of different p53 isoforms to modulate expression of different subsets of p53 protein isoforms. Hence HCT116 invasive activity is inhibited after depletion of Δ133p53 or β isoforms by siRNA si133 or siβ respectively while HCT116 invasive activity is enhanced after depletion of WT full-length p53 proteins (TAp53α, TAp53β, TAp53γ, Δ40p53α, Δ40p53β and Δ40p53γ) by siRNA siTA. Furthermore, ectopic expression of WT Δ133p53β in HCT116 cells enhances their invasive activity.</p><p>Altogether, Δ133p53β expression provides a rationale for invasive cancers expressing WT <italic>TP53</italic> and non-invasive cancers expressing missense mutant <italic>TP53</italic>. These data suggest that epigenetic mechanisms that stem Δ133p53β expression, i.e. alternative splicing and induction of the <italic>TP53</italic> internal promoter favour cancer invasion and dissemination of metastatic cells, regardless of <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status. Our data indicate that all three ∆133p53 isoforms (∆133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ133p53β) promote invasion. This is in accordance with recent reports showing that ∆133p53α stimulate angiogenesis and cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roth et al., 2016</xref>). Here we identified the ∆133p53β isoform as being the most efficient promoter of invasion, corroborating its role as a predictive indicator of cancer relapse and death in the clinic.</p><p>We investigated then how Δ133p53β regulate cell invasion in cancer cell lines. Since EMT leads to profound phenotypic changes due to genome-scale epigenetic reprogramming and post-transcriptional regulation, we studied the regulation of EMT by Δ133p53β to illustrate a molecular mechanism of Δ133p53β. Our data indicate that expression of Δ133p53β promotes acquisition of a rounded-blebbing movement, which is associated with decrease of E-cadherin and β1-integrin in colon cancer HCT116 cells. These phenotypic changes are hallmarks of epithelial-amoeboid transition (EAT), a derivative of EMT which produces highly invasive cells. Depletion of ∆133p53 isoforms also induces E-Cadherin expression and concomitantly inhibits Vimentin expression in invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells. Accordingly, knockdown of Δ133p53 isoforms in colon cancer LoVo cells decreased 3-D cell scattering, a process associated with <italic>EMT/EAT.</italic> Our study supports a critical role for Δ133p53β (whether WT or mutant) in the induction of cell invasion and EMT/EAT.</p><p>In summary, our data lead us to conclude that the biological activities associated with WT or mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene expression are not carried out by the single full-length p53 protein (TAp53α). p53 isoforms underlie the dual role of WT <italic>TP53</italic> gene in preventing or promoting cancer cell invasion. The invasive activities of cancer cells expressing WT or mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene can be enhanced or inhibited by respectively increasing or reducing expression of Δ133p53β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Testing the prognostic discriminatory potential of Δ133p53β could influence clinical practice and may offer appropriate and yet unexplored therapeutic options for mutant or WT <italic>TP53</italic> tumors expressing Δ133p53β.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Breast cancer patients</title><p>Primary, previously untreated and operable breast cancers from 273 Caucasian women, with sufficient tumor tissue surplus to diagnostic requirements and with complete clinical and pathological data, were analyzed.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>TP53</italic> drives invasion through expression of its Δ133p53β variant&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Gadea et al. reports a number of interesting observations about the role of a specific mRNA isoform arising from the <italic>TP53</italic> locus, Δ133p53β, in cancer cell invasion and metastasis.</p><p>The paper starts with a strong set of observations establishing a correlation between Δ133p53β mRNA expression and poor prognosis in breast cancer. The authors performed a first-in-kind expression analysis for the various Δ133 isoforms and observed that only the β isoform correlates with more aggressive disease and lower survival rates.</p><p>Next, the authors embarked on a series of cell-based assays using breast and colorectal carcinoma cell lines and both loss- and gain-of function experiments to demonstrate that Δ133p53β promotes cell motility, invasion and migration, by conferring a sort of 'epithelial to amoeboid' transformation.</p><p>Finally, the authors attempt to dissect the mechanism by which Δ133p53β exerts this function, and present some data hinting at a role for the p53 family member p63 as a mediator of Δ133 pro-metastatic functions.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that the work presented is very interesting and the scholarship is very good, but also noted that the last portion of the manuscript (i.e. molecular mechanisms involving p63 isoforms) is poorly developed and the data is not as strong as in the first part of the manuscript.</p><p>A main issue is that throughout the first part of the paper the authors demonstrate that Δ133 can exert its functions independently of mutations in DNA binding domain within the <italic>TP53</italic> locus that are commonly observed in cancer, suggesting that its effects are independent of DNA binding. However, during their mechanistic investigations in the later part of the paper, the authors sometimes perform experiments with only the wild type or mutant Δ133 protein, involving different p63 isoforms depending on the cell line employed (ΔNp63 in some scenarios, TAp63 in others). The final product is a rather confusing scenario where it is unclear if mutations in the DBD affect Δ133 function, and also unclear which p63 isoform is involved.</p><p>Accordingly, the reviewers agreed to encourage resubmission of a significantly revised manuscript addressing the following Major Points:</p><p>1) Removal of the p63 chapter. The reviewers agreed that the paper would be better served by removing the last chapter on mechanism - basically Figures 6 and 7 - and strengthening the main observations throughout <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> by addressing the various technical aspects listed below. Though the association with p63 is of interest, the experiments presented lack major controls and depth to draw solid conclusions. Reviewers concluded that developing the p63 aspect of the paper would require an amount of work not feasible within the review process and that it could become the subject of a follow up study.</p><p>2) Improved expression analysis in tumor samples:</p><p>2.1) The data on the expression of the different p53 isoforms in tumors only rely on a nested RT-PCR analysis. This could lead to misleading interpretation especially when used to compare expression of different isoforms. For example, are the tumors 5 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> negative or positive for the γ isoform? It is important to verify these data with an orthogonal approach.</p><p>2.2) Since an antibody specific for the β isoform is available, it will be important also to verify expression at protein level.</p><p>2.3) It is not clear if the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-I</xref> was limited to Luminal A tumors. Conducting the analysis without considering breast cancer subtypes could in fact be problematic given the difference p53 isoforms and mutations have different distribution across breast cancer sub-types and given lineage specificities in the behavior of tumors.</p><p>3) Another major concern is related to the specificity of the siRNA and their association with the observed phenotypes. A rescue experiment with the appropriate controls will be required to definitely prove that the described differences are due to Δ133 p53 β isoform. Also to have a better sense of the specific functional role of the different p53 isoforms, it will be important that all experiments be performed with all the described siRNAs and upon over expression of the different p53 isoforms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14734.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Removal of the p63 chapter.

Reviewers concluded that developing the p63 aspect of the paper would require an amount of work not feasible within the review process and that it could become the subject of a follow up study.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the description of the mechanism involving p63 isoforms could be more appropriate in a follow-up of the present study. As suggested by reviewers, we have removed the results related to p63 (Figures 6 and 7) in the Results and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Improved expression analysis in tumor samples:</italic> </p><p><italic>2.1) The data on the expression of the different p53 isoforms in tumors only rely on a nested RT-PCR analysis. This could lead to misleading interpretation especially when used to compare expression of different isoforms. For example, are the tumors 5 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> negative or positive for the γ isoform? It is important to verify these data with an orthogonal approach.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is essential in such study to minimise the number of false positive and false negative data by improving detection threshold and by identifying precisely the different Δ133p53 isoforms. In addition, it is important to take account of the tumor heterogeneity as some p53 isoforms may be only expressed in a small population of tumor cells. It is well-established that only a small percentage of tumor cells can leave the primary tumor site and spread to other organs to form metastasis. Therefore, the methodology to analyse tumor samples should be highly sensitive and specific.</p><p>Two methods could be used: PCR that detects specifically each Δ133p53 mRNA variants and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) of tumor sections using antibodies specific of the different Δ133p53 protein isoforms.</p><p>Currently, there is no antibody specific of Δ133p53α or Δ133p53β or Δ133p53γ. Therefore, the detection and identity of each p53 isoforms in tumor samples can only be ascertained by PCR using different sets of primers that specifically amplify Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β or Δ133p53γ mRNA variants respectively. The reviewers’ comment made us realise that we did not explain well enough that the RT-PCR method used in this manuscript was an improved version of the RT-PCR method previously described (Khoury et al., 2013. Detecting and quantifying p53 isoforms at mRNA level in cell lines and tissues. Methods in molecular biology, 962, 1-14). The RT-PCR method used in this manuscript has a higher sensitivity and specificity that enable to detect and accurately identify the expression of Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ133p53γ mRNA in each tumor sample. It allows thus to compare their respective association with the clinico- pathological markers and/or patient clinical outcome.</p><p>We corrected this in the revised manuscript. We wrote a detailed protocol and described the points that increase the specificity and sensitivity of the nested RT-PCR analysis in the “extended experimental procedures”. The primers sequences are now provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Reviewers suggested to use an orthogonal approach to verify RT-PCR data, notably regarding the expression of Δ133p53γ (For example, are the tumors 5 and 8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> negative or positive for the γ isoform?) We cannot verify expression of the γ p53 protein isoforms by immunoblot or IHC as there is no antibodies specific of the γ isoforms. However, we verified by immunoblot the expression of Δ133p53β protein in some tumor samples (please see below).</p><p><italic>2.2) Since an antibody specific for the β isoform is available, it will be important also to verify expression at protein level.</italic> </p><p>The rabbit polyclonal antibody KJC8 was raised and affinity-purified against the peptide TLQDQTSFQKENC corresponding to the C-terminal region of the different β p53 isoforms. It detects all β p53 protein isoforms. Therefore, it is not currently possible to specifically detect Δ133p53β by IHC in tumors.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ comments, we determined the expression of p53 isoforms by western- blot. However, this technique is rudimentary as it destroys large amount of a tumor sample preventing its use for on-going and future clinical studies. We were thus authorised to extract protein only from few large breast tumors. The western-blot is included in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and shows that Δ133p53β protein is detected only in the samples expressing Δ133p53β at the mRNA level. Actin was used as a loading control and as an indicator of protein degradation that could have occurred during extraction. Only one band was observed for Actin indicating that no protein degradation occurred during extraction. This immunoblot validates the nested RT-PCR analysis used in this study. Furthermore, it shows for the first time that Δ133p53β protein is expressed in human tumor tissues. This is an important observation as it demonstrates its biological relevance and justifies the characterisation of its biological activities. Thank you for the suggestion, it strengthens the manuscript.</p><p>However, in future studies, we would not recommend to verify the nested RT-PCR analysis by immunoblot because it uses large shunk of precious tumor samples. In addition, sensitivity of immunoblot is much lower than PCR analysis; this could lead to misleading interpretation notably for small tumors.</p><p><italic>2.3) It is not clear if the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-I</xref> was limited to Luminal A tumors. Conducting the analysis without considering breast cancer subtypes could in fact be problematic given the difference p53 isoforms and mutations have different distribution across breast cancer sub-types and given lineage specificities in the behavior of tumors.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-I</xref> shows by using Kaplan-Meier univariate analyses that several markers (Breast cancer subtypes, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status, Δ133p53β expression, tumor size, tumor grade, Number of invaded lymph node) are associated with patient clinical outcomes. The analyses were performed on the entire cohort without segregating tumors according to breast cancer subtypes, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status and p53 isoform expression. It was not limited to the luminal A tumors. We clarified this in the figure legend.</p><p>The purpose of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-I</xref> is to justify the use of the multivariate Cox- regression analysis to identify, among all the markers (Δ133p53β, the breast cancer subtypes (triple negative, Luminal A, Luminal/HER2+, Luminal B, and HER2+), <italic>TP53</italic> mutation status, tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and tumor size (&gt;20mm)), the independent markers significantly associated with the patient’s clinical outcome. The multivariate Cox’s regression analysis led to the identification of Luminal-A as the most significant independent predictor of disease-free survival and overall survival (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>The Cox’s regression analysis was then reiterated and limited to the luminal-A breast cancer to identify, among all the markers (Δ133p53β, <italic>TP53</italic> mutation, tumor grade, lymph node metastasis and tumor size (&gt;20mm)), the independent markers significantly associated with the clinical outcome of luminal-A patients. Only Δ133p53β was then identified as the most significant independent predictor of cancer progression and death in the luminal A Breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Δ133p53α and Δ133p53γ were also tested in the multivariate Cox’s regression analysis but it did not lead to significant association with clinical outcome. Therefore, the statistical analysis was performed in considering all markers when they were included in the Cox’s regression multivariate analysis. This point has been clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(Of note, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref> shows that Δ133p53β expression is associated with poor disease free survival in WT <italic>TP53</italic> breast cancer patients using Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis was also performed for Δ133p53α and Δ133p53γin the WT <italic>TP53</italic> breast cancer patient cohort but no significant association was found.)</p><p><italic>3) Another major concern is related to the specificity of the siRNA and their association with the observed phenotypes. A rescue experiment with the appropriate controls will be required to definitely prove that the described differences are due to δ-133 p53 β isoform. Also to have a better sense of the specific functional role of the different p53 isoforms, it will be important that all experiments be performed with all the described siRNAs and upon over expression of the different p53 isoforms.</italic> </p><p>To confirm the specificity of the siRNA used, we performed a rescue experiment to assess whether the difference in invasive phenotype was due to the loss of expression of ∆133p53ß. We analyzed breast cancer MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells depleted of all Δ133p53 isoforms (by using the siRNAs si133-1 or si133-2, which specifically target the 5’UTR of Δ133 mRNAs (Aoubala et al., 2011)). The MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells express mutant <italic>TP53</italic> gene mutated at codon 280 (R280K). Expression of the si133-1- and si133-2- resistant mutant Δ133p53β-R280K cDNA rescued invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, we show that transfection of mutant Δ133p53β-R280K rescued invasion when MDA-MB-231 D3H2LN cells were previously depleted of all β isoforms by siβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also verified that expression of si133- resistant WT Δ133p53β cDNA rescued invasion in the LoVo colon cancer cells previously depleted of all Δ133p53 isoforms. The LoVo cells express WT <italic>TP53</italic> gene. These two experiments confirm the specificity of the siRNAs si133-1, si133-2 and siβ. They confirm that the differences in invasion are mainly due to the ∆133p53ß isoform (whether it is WT or mutated).</p><p>Another question raised by the reviewers is the specific functional role of the different p53 isoforms. This question is important since the siRNAs si133-1 or si133-2 used in this study deplete all Δ133p53 isoforms, i.e. Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ133p53γ. In a rescue experiment, we compared the specific contribution of each Δ133p53 isoforms in rescuing the invasive phenotype promoted by the siRNAs si133-1 or si133-2. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, all three Δ133p53 isoforms rescued invasion in cells depleted of all ∆133p53 variants.</p><p>However, Δ133p53β conferred a significantly higher invasive potential compared to Δ133p53α or Δ133p53γ. The results indicate that all Δ133p53 isoforms promote invasion. However Δ133p53β is significantly more potent than Δ133p53α or Δ133p53γ.</p><p>Altogether, the experimental data corroborate the clinical data and support the conclusion that the <italic>TP53</italic> gene promotes cancer cell invasion through expression of its Δ133p53β variant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
