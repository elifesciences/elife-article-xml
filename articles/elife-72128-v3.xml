Although telocytes can be found in many different tissues including the heart, lung, and intestine, their tissue-specific roles are poorly understood. Here we identify a specific cell signalling role for telocytes in the periodontium whereby telocytes regulate macrophage activity. We performed scRNA-seq and lineage tracing to identify telocytes and macrophages in mouse periodontium in homeostasis and periodontitis and carried out hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signalling inhibition experiments using tivantinib. We show that telocytes are quiescent in homeostasis; however, they proliferate and serve as a major source of HGF in periodontitis. Macrophages receive telocyte-derived HGF signals and shift from an M1 to an M1/M2 state. Our results reveal the source of HGF signals in periodontal tissue and provide new insights into the function of telocytes in regulating macrophage behaviour in periodontitis through HGF/Met cell signalling, which may provide a novel approach in periodontitis treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telocytes</kwd><kwd>periodontitis</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005196</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharpe</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIHR BioResoure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharpe</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A poorly understood cell type, the telocyte, is shown to regulate macrophages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the periodontal ligament (PDL), the tissue that connects teeth to alveolar bone. It is a prevalent, incurable, and continuous degenerative disease that results in bone loss and tooth loss. Individuals with periodontitis often exhibit gingiva recession, bleeding, and tooth mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dentino et al., 2013</xref>). All periodontitis (with attachment loss) develops from gingivitis (no attachment loss) with poor prognosis but not all gingivitis develops into periodontitis.</p><p>Numerous studies have focused on the causes of periodontitis. Briefly, pathogens accumulate on the tooth surface (forming plaque), invade the periodontium tissue, and release lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which results in inflammation and immunological events. LPS causes the polarisation of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1). M1 macrophages release cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-12, which contribute to the development and progression of inflammation-induced tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Viniegra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, understanding the regulation of the inflammatory response is critical to understanding and treating periodontitis. The PDL, albeit only present as a thin layer, contains several different cell types. However, the understanding of cell populations in the PDL, their interactions, signalling pathways, and how these are impacted by disease and inflammation are poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we describe a cell type not previously identified in the PDL, namely, telocytes (interstitial cells). Telocytes are an enigmatic interstitial cell type that are best characterised by their unusual morphology having very long projections that make direct contacts with other cells. They are believed to play a role in direct cell–cell communication establishing three-dimensional networks guiding tissue organisation, mechanical sensing, regulating immune responses, and phagocytic-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cretoiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondo and Kaestner, 2019</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of telocytes shows extracellular vesicles bulging out from their membranes, suggesting active physical communication with other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cretoiu et al., 2016</xref>). To date, possible cell signalling roles played by telocytes have not been fully described. It is only known that in the intestine subepithelial telocytes are identified as an important source of Wnt signals to maintain the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shoshkes-Carmel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Telocytes are identified in tissues by dual immunolabeling, most commonly CD34+/CD31-, CD34+/c-Kit+, CD34+/Vim+, and CD34+/PDGFRα+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kondo and Kaestner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">San Martin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Manetti et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we use CD34+/CD31- to identify PDL-resident telocytes combined with genetic lineage tracing and Sc-RNA sequencing to determine the role of telocytes in homeostasis and periodontitis. We show that quiescent telocytes located near blood vessels are activated in periodontitis and regulate macrophages via the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met signalling pathway. The resulting transition of macrophages from an M1 to M2 state provides a possible therapeutic strategy for treating periodontitis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ScRNA-seq analysis reveals a telocyte population in PDL</title><p>The PDL is made up of both neural crest-derived and mesodermal-derived cell types, and we have previously described the constituent cell populations using single-cell transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This analysis compared adult PDL in homeostasis with PDL tissue from a ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). The two datasets were integrated by performing a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>) identifying 2270 cells for analysis after filtering.

However, in our ScRNA sequencing data, we found that the expressions of <italic>Kit</italic>, <italic>Vim,</italic> and <italic>Pdgfrα</italic> are either low with not much overlap with <italic>Cd34</italic> or ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To confirm these cells as telocytes, we first cultured PDL cells in vitro and searched for cells with a typical telocyte morphology. Typical telocyte cell morphology was observed with small cell bodies and a long cellular process called telopodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Telopodes consist of dilated portions (podoms) and thin segments in between (podomers). To determine whether the telocyte-like cells are derived from neural crest, we collected PDL cells from <italic>Wnt1<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG/+</sup></italic> mice, which labels neural crest-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graves et al., 2008</xref>) and stained for GFP and CD34. GFP-positive cells showed telocyte structures with podoms and podomers, which were also positive for CD34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). To identify telocyte locations in situ, we co-immunostained sections with CD34 and CD31. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, telocytes (CD34+/CD31-) were found in close association with blood vessels (CD34+/CD31+), had small cell nuclei, and long cell protrusions. However, pericytes are also in close proximity to blood vessels. Therefore, to discriminate between telocytes and pericytes, we compared genes that are expressed in pericytes, <italic>Cd146</italic> and <italic>Ng2</italic>. We found that these genes were not expressed in telocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). These data collectively suggest that CD34+/CD31- telocytes are present in the PDL located in the vicinity of blood vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quiescent telocytes are activated in periodontitis</title><p>Since telocytes only account for a small subset of cells in the RNAseq datasets in PDL during homeostasis together with the big overall increase in immune cells in the disease datasets, thereby masking any changes in telocyte numbers, we addressed whether these cells are quiescent or actively proliferating during homeostasis directly on tissue sections. Lineage tracing using <italic>Cd34<sup>creERT2/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>tdTomato/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>) followed by a 1 day–1 year post-tamoxifen chase period revealed that CD34+/CD31- cell numbers did not increase to any significant extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that telocytes are a small, quiescent cell population in homeostasis. To investigate whether telocytes responded to disease, we used our established ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model where sutures are placed around the second molars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The ligature leads to plaque accumulation and thus facilitates the invasion of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 1984</xref>). By measuring the distance between alveolar bone crest and cemento-enamel junction (ABC-CEJ distance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), we found that bone loss reached a maximum between days 4 and 7 for all three molars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Notably, even though only the second molar was subjected to a ligature, the first and third molars also showed some bone loss at early time points, suggesting that they are affected by the ligature-induced periodontitis to some extent. However, the first and third molar bone loss was recovered at longer time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), indicating the self-recovery ability from milder periodontitis.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Cd34</italic><sup><italic>creERT2</italic></sup> lineage tracing showing limited contribution of telocytes to periodontal ligament (PDL) homeostasis in adulthood.</title><p>In the adult stage, <italic>Cd34<sup>creERT2/+</sup>; Rosa26<sup>tdTomato/+</sup></italic> mice were used to trace from 7 weeks for 1 day (<bold>a</bold>), 1 month (<bold>b</bold>), 2 months (<bold>c</bold>), and 1 year (<bold>d</bold>).

The FAC-sorted cells are a heterogenous population as not all adopted a characteristic telocyte morphology following 24 hr in culture. Nonetheless, we obtained sufficient cells with telocyte morphology. For better characterisation of macrophage polarisation markers, we noted that the literature describes a number of markers including <italic>Nos2</italic> (<italic>Inos</italic>) and <italic>Cd80</italic> as M1 markers, and, <italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Cd163</italic> as M2 markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jablonski et al., 2015</xref>).

These cells, telocytes, are in a quiescent state in normal periodontal tissue unless challenged by periodontitis whereupon they increase in number and secrete HGF. Although we did not detect an obvious increase in telocyte numbers in our periodontitis sequencing dataset, this was likely a result of the overall relative decrease in stromal cell numbers caused by the increase in immune cells. In periodontitis, our sequencing data showed a larger proportion of inflammatory cells and relatively fewer stromal cells, indicating the successful induction of the inflammatory disease. In periodontitis, the emergence of a new macrophage population not present in homeostasis, together with signalling changes in telocytes, raised the possibility of a possible interaction between telocytes and macrophages.</p><p>We observed telocytes, as a major source of HGF, making physical contact with macrophages. Cleaved HGF can activate Met and downstream signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joosten et al., 2020</xref>). It is believed that pro-HGF, the inactive precursor, is secreted and processed by HGF activator (HGFAC), a zymogen in the circulation to achieve its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fukushima et al., 2018</xref>). Macrophages receiving HGF signals express <italic>Met</italic>, <italic>iNos,</italic> and <italic>Arg1</italic>, representing an M1/M2 state. The <italic>Arg1</italic>+/<italic>Nos2</italic>+ macrophages have been recently proposed to exist in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Locatelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mould et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bronte et al., 2003</xref>). These cells do not exist in homeostasis but are detected in periodontitis identifying HGF/Met as a key macrophage regulatory pathway. Our findings are consistent with reports that LPS causes M1 polarisation and a shift towards M2 polarisation mediated by HGF signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, expression of two competing enzymes, iNOS and Arg1, in Met-expressing cells results from regulation by telocytes, which shifts M1 macrophages to an M2 phenotype, resulting in an M1/M2 state. The transition can be effectively inhibited by an HGF/Met inhibitor, tivantinib. It is reported that the transition from LPS-induced M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages is controlled by PI3K or CaMKKβ-AMPK signalling pathway in Met-expressing cells via induction of Arg1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishikoba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2019</xref>). We propose the underlying mechanism is possibly the activation of HGF/Met signalling pathway that triggered the activation of PI3K or CaMKKβ-AMPK signalling pathway in macrophages.</p><p>The presence of M1 macrophages can cause bone loss, whereas M2 macrophages can help prevent bone loss in the PDL. Telocytes showed the ability to shift M1 to M2, indicating that HGF secreted by telocytes should be beneficial in reducing bone loss. By comparing the bone loss of the second molars with the first molars and third molars from 1 day to 1 month post ligature treatment, we found that only the molars without ligature treatment showed an ability to recover bone loss caused by periodontitis. Second molars, which have the ligature throughout, showed consistent bone loss, indicating any ability of telocytes to reduce bone loss is limited by constant physical stimuli, supporting the importance of maintaining oral hygiene in future clinical applications.</p><p>Ligature-induced periodontitis is considered as an appropriate model to mimic human periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe and Hajishengallis, 2013</xref>). However, whether telocytes are able to control the progression of human periodontitis requires further investigation. From the aspect of this study, an optimistic outcome is expected given the activation of telocytes or HGF/Met pathway under careful maintenance of oral hygiene. Coincidentally, exogenous application with HGF was found to improve periodontal bone regeneration in swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, telocytes may have a role in angiogenesis as shown in the gene enrichment terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

Vascularisation is considered important for periodontal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the role of telocytes in periodontitis may not only be the regulation of macrophages through HGF/Met signalling pathway but also through angiogenesis. Telocytes are the cells that provide niche signals in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shoshkes-Carmel et al., 2018</xref>). Future work may focus on the signals that telocytes send to adjacent niche cells including stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Popescu et al., 2011</xref>), endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosa et al., 2020</xref>), and nerve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Popescu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our study demonstrates for the first time that telocytes increase in number in periodontitis and communicate with immune cells to positively regulate periodontitis via HGF. The activation of HGF/Met signalling pathway or the exogenous use of activated telocytes may be a promising therapeutic measure against periodontitis. This function of telocytes may also present in other inflammatory diseases where telocytes exist such as arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosa et al., 2018</xref>).

telocytes, in a mouse model of periodontitis. Using single-cell RNA-seq and cellular assays, the authors present convincing evidence that telocytes signal to macrophages using HGF to shift their polarisation state from inflammatory (M1) to a more ‘tissue-remodelling’ state (M1/M2). Since periodontitis is linked to many other illnesses (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, cardiac disease, Alzheimer's disease), new insights into the cell types that play a role in the progression of the disease are important to the field of inflammatory and chronic diseases. Future studies will need to elucidate whether telocytes play similar roles in their other niches.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72128.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Benayoun</surname><given-names>Bérénice A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sugimura</surname><given-names>Rio</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02zhqgq86</institution-id><institution>The University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.03.446871">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.03.446871v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rio Sugimura (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation with the reviewers, the consensus was that although the paper has a lot of potential, some key revisions are needed for full rigor and reproducibility. Specifically:</p><p>1. The reviewers expressed concerns about lack of a sufficient support for direct mechanistic link between HGF production and telocytes, derived solely from the cellchat analysis. Although the use of mouse genetics would be the most direct and clean way to assess this relationship, the reviewers agreed that this would be beyond the scope of a revision. However, the use of a co–culture model between the macrophages and telocytes from the periodontitis model could directly help assess (i) production of cytokines by telocytes, and (ii) direct impact on macrophages phenotypes.</p><p>2. The reviewers expressed that a better justification for the choice of flow cytometry markers would be required in a revised manuscript.</p><p>3. A better characterization of the macrophage polarization markers, by qPCR or immunostainings, would enhance the conclusions on the effects of telocyte derived HGF on macrophages.</p><p>4. For general reproducibility, the custom scripts used to perform the analysis need to be made available for review, either on a GitHub repository or as a supplementary archive (based on <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines). In addition, since software and database versions can impact results substantially in computational analyses, the authors need to provide version numbers for all used software and packages (e.g. R, Seurat, etc.).</p><p>5.

Make an extra sub–figure of this part.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study Zhao et al., reveal Telocytes as the source signal for HGF which regulate macrophages behavior during periodontitis from M1(pro–inflammatory) to M2(anti–inflammatory) state. In this study Telocytes are identified as CD34+CD31– cells. The Wnt1Cre and Cd34 CreERT2 reporter mice were used to trace Telocytes. This study suggest that in homeostasis Telocytes are quiescent and are activated and proliferate following periodontitis. Telocytes are a source of HGF which in terms regulate macrophages that express the HGF receptor Met, from M1(pro–inflammatory) to M2(anti–inflammatory) state. This discovery is important and may suggest new approaches to treat periodontitis if was strongly supported by the data. In order to consider this study for publication main concerns are need to be addressed:</p><p>1. It is not clear what is the physiological significance of HGF signaling from Telocytes to periodontitis. Inhibition of HGF signaling by Tivantinib is systemic and not Telocyte specific and that result in a moderate reduction in a M2 macrophages marker Arg1. The authors should manipulate HGF signaling in Telocytes and detailed analysis of the macrophages state following inhibition is needed.</p><p>2. The authors claim that in periodontitis Telocytes proliferate while quiescent in homeostasis. This conclusion is based on CD34 and Ki67immunostaining, which is not convincing. Ki67 is a nuclear whereas CD34 a surface marker. Due to the structure of Telocytes, correlating nuclear with surface markers is challenging. A cleared whole mount staining might help, otherwise the authors might use a nuclear marker for Telocytes based on their RNAseq data and co–stain for Ki67.</p><p>3. The authors conclude that Telocytes are a neural crest derivative based on staining for CD34 ex–vivo culture cells isolated from Wnt1driven Cre reporter mouse line. In order to trace the developmental origin of Telocytes a detailed in–vivo developmental analysis is needed. This conclusion is not supported by the data and to my opinion doesn't add much insights to the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The identification of telocytes in periodontium is intriguing. However, the analysis has been rather descriptive and superficial at this stage. I encourage the authors to provide the functional significance of telocytes using mouse genetics. Then I would reconsider this manuscript. I appreciate the authors' willingness to let reviewer(s) reanalyze and validate their informatics analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72128.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation with the reviewers, the consensus was that although the paper has a lot of potential, some key revisions are needed for full rigor and reproducibility.

We thus chose to put most of our efforts into developing methods to address this. We co-cultured FACs-sorted telocytes together with human macrophages in the presence or absence of the c-MET inhibitor tivantinib. Through qPCR analyses of marker gene expression, we show that telocytes are indeed the source of HGF that drives M1 macrophages to adopt an M1/M2 phenotype (page 17, lines 352-370). The data is presented as a new figure, Figure 6. The original Figure 5 was modified, and part of the data now appears in the new Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The reviewers expressed that a better justification for the choice of flow cytometry markers would be required in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The best markers currently described in the literature to identify telocytes are by dual immunolabelling with CD34 and either CD31 (telocytes express CD34 but not CD31), c-Kit, Vim or PDGFRα (see refs 10, 12-15). We used CD34+CD31- immunolabelling in our study for FAC-sorting as telocytes, and the morphology of these cells with telocyte characteristics were confirmed in culture prior to downstream experiments. The CD34+CD31- cells were a heterogenous population as not all adopted a telocyte morphology following 24 hr in culture. Nonetheless, we obtained sufficient cells to make a significant difference in downstream qPCR experiments. We provided this explanation in page 17, lines 354-359.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We noticed that when in homeostasis, CD34cre-labelled RFP cells are mostly expressed by endothelial cells (which express CD31 as well) with very strong RFP signal, whereas telocytes express very low levels of RFP. In this case, the RFP signal is probably too strong to see the CD31 signal in the same panel, but such bright signals are more likely to be endothelial cells rather than telocytes. Figure 2 shows the same – majority of the cells are endothelial cells with strong RFP expression unlike telocytes. In disease model, CD34cre-labelled RFP signal is lower in endothelial cells but higher in telocytes. Therefore, in the left panel, the telocyte is the dim cell indicated by the arrow, which does not express CD31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Some quantification of the percentage and number of Ki67 positive cells is needed both for control and perio.</p></disp-quote><p>Reference to Figure 4-c added, page 15, line 309.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 242 &quot;The recipient cells are macrophages that express…&quot; What experimental data is provided in this study?

In this study Telocytes are identified as CD34+CD31– cells. The Wnt1Cre and Cd34 CreERT2 reporter mice were used to trace Telocytes. This study suggest that in homeostasis Telocytes are quiescent and are activated and proliferate following periodontitis. Telocytes are a source of HGF which in terms regulate macrophages that express the HGF receptor Met, from M1(pro–inflammatory) to M2(anti–inflammatory) state. This discovery is important and may suggest new approaches to treat periodontitis if was strongly supported by the data. In order to consider this study for publication main concerns are need to be addressed:</p><p>1. It is not clear what is the physiological significance of HGF signaling from Telocytes to periodontitis. Inhibition of HGF signaling by Tivantinib is systemic and not Telocyte specific and that result in a moderate reduction in a M2 macrophages marker Arg1. The authors should manipulate HGF signaling in Telocytes and detailed analysis of the macrophages state following inhibition is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment is not possible since it requires the cleaved form of HGF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors claim that in periodontitis Telocytes proliferate while quiescent in homeostasis. This conclusion is based on CD34 and Ki67immunostaining, which is not convincing. Ki67 is a nuclear whereas CD34 a surface marker. Due to the structure of Telocytes, correlating nuclear with surface markers is challenging. A cleared whole mount staining might help, otherwise the authors might use a nuclear marker for Telocytes based on their RNAseq data and co–stain for Ki67.</p></disp-quote><p>C-kit was used in some of the TC papers, which is expressed in the nucleus, but in our seq data, it is not strongly expressed nor expressed exclusively in CD34+ TCs:</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-72128-sa2-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors conclude that Telocytes are a neural crest derivative based on staining for CD34 ex–vivo culture cells isolated from Wnt1driven Cre reporter mouse line. In order to trace the developmental origin of Telocytes a detailed in–vivo developmental analysis is needed. This conclusion is not supported by the data and to my opinion doesn't add much insights to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We use Wnt1cre mouse to determine the origin of telocytes, reference paper of using Wnt1cre to label neural crest derived cells is added (page 13, line 244-245).</p></body></sub-article></article>
