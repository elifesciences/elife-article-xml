This difference was recapitulated by a subsequent randomized controlled study. TACE combined with bicarbonate yielded a 100% objective response rate (ORR), whereas the ORR treated with TACE alone was 44.4% (nonrandomized) and 63.6% (randomized).

An alternative option to kill the tumor is to block its blood supply via a process called embolization. This procedure deprives the tumor cells of oxygen and nutrients such as glucose. However, embolization also prevents a chemical called lactic acid – which is commonly found around tumors – from being removed. Lactic acid actually helps to protect cancer cells and also aids the growth of new blood vessels, and so the “trapped” lactic acid may reduce the anticancer activity of embolization.</p><p>Previous works suggested that neutralizing the acidic environment in a tumor while depriving it of glucose via embolization could become a new treatment option for cancer patients. Chao et al. now report a small clinical trial that tested this idea and involved patients with large hepatocellular carcinomas. First, a group of thirty patients received the embolization treatment together with an injection of bicarbonate – a basic compound used to neutralize the lactic acid – that was delivered directly to the tumor. The neutralization killed these large tumors more effectively than what is typically seen in patients who just undergo embolization</p><p>Chao et al. then recruited another twenty patients and randomly assigned them to receive either just the embolization or the embolization with bicarbonate treatment. This randomized trial showed that the tumors died more and patients survived for longer if they received the bicarbonate together with the embolization treatment compared to those patients that were only embolized. In fact, four patients initially assigned to, and treated in, the embolization-only group subsequently asked to cross over to, and indeed received, the bicarbonate treatment as well.</p><p>These data indicate that this bicarbonate therapy may indeed be effective for patients with large tumors that are not amenable to surgery. In future, larger clinical trials will need to be carried out to verify these initial findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>transarterial chemoembolization</kwd><kwd>lactic acidosis</kwd><kwd>bicarbonate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81301707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>China National 973 Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB911303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81272456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81470126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Local infusion of bicarbonate into hepatocellular carcinoma markedly enhances local tumor control by transarterial chemoembolization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We recently found that Lactic acidosis could effectively protect cancer cells against glucose starvation or deprivaiton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). First, lactic acidosis dramatically reduces glycolysis rate with little wasting glucose to lactate, as such, a limited amount of glucose could support cancer cells for a relatively long time otherwise would be exhausted quickly. Second, when glucose was deprived, lactic acidosis transformed cancer cells to a ‘dormant’ state, via arresting cells at G0/G1 phase, initiating autophagy, inhibiting apoptosis, etc. The protective function relies on co-presence of lactate and proton, depriving either of which would abolish the function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). When converting lactic acidosis to lactosis by a base, the protective function is gone; similarly, removing lactate, acidosis conferred cancer cells with little resistance to glucose deprivation.</p><p>The significance of intratumoral lactic acidosis in tumor biology has been extensively revealed by many other investigators. Clinical studies showed that high level of lactate was a strong prognostic indicator of increased metastasis and poor overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gatenby and Gillies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brizel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walenta et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schwickert et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Walenta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yokota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paschen et al., 1987</xref>). The work of Gillies and Gatenby group demonstrated that systematic and tumor pHe alkalization could inhibit carcinogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis, and they also provided integrated models that can predict the safety and efficacy of buffer therapy to raise tumour pHe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Silva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Robey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ibrahim-Hashim et al., 2012</xref>) and related theoretical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Martin et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, many studies reported that lactic acidosis played multifaceted roles in skewing macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colegio et al., 2014</xref>) and inhibiting the function of cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haas et al., 2015</xref>), altering cancer cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sonveaux et al., 2008</xref>), inducing chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dai et al., 2013</xref>), and promoting tumor angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gatenby and Gillies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Végran et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>According to the guideline of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging and treatment strategy, HCC larger than 3 cm in diameter is not suitable for curative therapy (surgical resection, liver transplantation, and ablation) and the recommended treatment is TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Forner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">El-Serag, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2015</xref>). But sadly, it is recognized that TACE is not effective to treat large tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sieghart et al., 2015</xref>). This leaves the patients with large HCC without choice of effective therapy, as also pointed out by Sieghart et al, “maximal restriction of patients selection for TACE would otherwise only improve the results of the treatment modality per se but again would leave those more advanced patients within the intermediate stage without treatment options.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sieghart et al., 2015</xref>)</p><p>TACE is for local control of the targeted tumor. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="-.14em"/><mml:mpadded depth="+.5ex" height="-.5ex"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mpadded><mml:mspace width="-.115em"/><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mtext>equation check</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>TACE kills HCC via 2 mechanisms, delivering concentrated anticancer drugs locally into tumor and occluding tumor feeding arteries to deprive nutrients to starve cancer cells. We would focus on the second mechanism. Occluding tumor feeding arteries effectively deprive nutrients including glucose. The problem is that embolization-created hypoxia condition would stimulate cancer cells to emit strong signals to initiate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2015</xref>) to reestablish tumor vasculature to bypass the occluded tumor feeding arteries. If the tumor cells cannot be rapidly eliminated, tumor vasculature would be re-established, and a certain amount of tumor (ranging from a few percent of the original tumor to even a larger tumor known as progressive disease) would survive and thrive. The lactate concentrations in HCC biopsies were around 20 mM (unpublished data), suggesting a lactic acidosis condition. After TACE, lactic acidosis would be trapped in embolized tumor and it would potentially attenuate the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. If it were true, locally infusion of bicarbonate to neutralize it would result in a severer necrosis in the embolized area.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Local control of targeted large tumors as assessed by viable tumor residues (VTR)</title><p>TACE is to control the targeted tumors rather than to systematically control the disease. As such, to measure the necrosis of the targeted tumors can quantitatively reflect the therapeutic efficacy of TACE. It is known that large size of HCC is a major obstacle to limit the therapeutic efficacy of TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sieghart et al., 2015</xref>), the larger the tumor size, the poorer the efficacy of TACE. Thus, the large HCC is a perfect tumor model to test our hypothesis. If intratumoral lactic acidosis is responsible for the therapeutic limitation, locally neutralizing it should significantly improve the anticancer activity, which can be quantitatively measured by the viable tumor residues. To the best of our knowledge, assessment of the necrosis of tumor after the first treatment is probably most objective with least interferences of known and unknown factors. Unless otherwise indicated, the data presented below are the response to the first TACE treatment.</p><p>We retrieved 27 patients with large HCC (ranging 5.0–14.6 cm) from the pool of patients treated with cTACE in the hospital between 2010 and 2012 according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria as specified in the Materials and methods section. The amount of viable tumor residues after cTACE treatment was calculated. We then recruited 30 patients for the TILA-TACE group using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria between 2012 and 2013. Most of patients’ demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics between the two treatment groups cTACE and TILA-TACE were generally comparable (Table 1). However, patients in the cTACE group were more likely to have multifocal tumors.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical and tumor characteristics of patients treated with cTACE and TILA-TACE in the nonrandomized study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Variables</th><th colspan="2">Patients</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">TILA-TACE</th><th valign="top">cTACE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Patient number</td><td>30</td><td>27</td></tr><tr><td>Median age, years</td><td>57 (Range 32–81)</td><td>54 (Range 37–81)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender (M/F)</td><td>27/3 (90.0%/10.0%)</td><td>27/0 (100%/0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Aetiology</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> HBV</td><td>24 (80.0%)</td><td>25 (92.6%)</td></tr><tr><td> HCV</td><td>0 (0%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td> Non B-non C</td><td>6 (20.0%)</td><td>2 (7.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Cirrhosis (radiology)</td><td>30 (100%)</td><td>27 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td>Bilirubin, μM</td><td>16.9 ± 9.4</td><td>22.5 ± 11.6</td></tr><tr><td>Albumin, g/L</td><td>39.0 ± 6.9</td><td>37.4 ± 5.3</td></tr><tr><td>AST, U/L</td><td>74.9 ± 102.3</td><td>83.5 ± 54.1</td></tr><tr><td>ALT, U/L</td><td>54.1 ± 80.4</td><td>67.3 ± 43.5</td></tr><tr><td>AFP, &gt;400 ng/mL</td><td>9 (30.0%)</td><td>15 (55.6%)</td></tr><tr><td>Child-Pugh class, A/B</td><td>27/3 (90.0%/10.0%)</td><td>25/2 (92.6%/7.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>The size of largest tumor (cm)</td><td>9.2 (range 5.0–13.6)</td><td>10.3 (range 5.0–14.6)</td></tr><tr><td> Tumor &gt;10 cm</td><td>14 (46.7%)</td><td>15 (55.6%)</td></tr><tr><td> Tumor 5~10 cm</td><td>16 (53.3%)</td><td>12 (44.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Multifocal tumors in 1 lobe</td><td>8 (26.7%)</td><td>12 (44.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>Multifocal tumors in 2 lobes</td><td>8 (26.7%)</td><td>12 (44.4%)</td></tr><tr><td>BCLC stage</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td> B</td><td>19 (63.3%)</td><td>18 (66.7%)</td></tr><tr><td> C</td><td>11 (36.7%)</td><td>9 (33.3%)</td></tr><tr><td>Macrovascular invasion</td><td>5 (16.7%)</td><td>4 (14.8%)</td></tr><tr><td> The right branch of portal vein</td><td>4 (13.3%)</td><td>2 (7.4%)</td></tr><tr><td> Hepatic vein</td><td>–</td><td>1 (3.7%)</td></tr><tr><td> The right branch of portal + hepatic vein</td><td>1 (3.3%)</td><td>1 (3.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>Extra-hepatic metastasis</td><td>8 (26.7%)</td><td>8 (29.6%)</td></tr><tr><td> Lung</td><td>1 (3.3%)</td><td>6 (22.2%)</td></tr><tr><td> Lung + bone</td><td>1 (3.3%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td> Soft tissue</td><td>–</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td> Lymph nodes</td><td>5 (12.2%)</td><td>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td> Bone</td><td>1 (2.0%)</td><td>1 (3.7%)</td></tr><tr><td> Bone+lymph node</td><td>–</td><td>1 (3.7%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>HBV, hepatitis B virius;</p><p>HCV, hepatitis C virius;</p></fn><fn><p>AST, Aspartate transaminase;</p><p>ALT, Alanine aminotransferase;</p></fn><fn><p>AFP, alpha-feto-protein.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Geometric means of viable tumor residues after treatment of cTACE or TILA-TACE in the nonrandomized cohort of 57 patients.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="2" valign="top">Geometric mean (95% CI)</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">cTACE (n=27)</th><th valign="top">TILA-TACE (n=30)</th><th valign="top">p value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Crude VTR</td><td valign="top">45.1% (30.3%–67.0%)</td><td valign="top">7.1% (4.4%–11.5%)</td><td valign="top">&lt;0.0001</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Multivariable adjusted VTR*</td><td valign="top">45.6% (28.9%–72.0%)</td><td valign="top">7.1% (4.6%–10.9%)</td><td valign="top">&lt;0.0001</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>VTR: viable tumor residues;</p><p>cTACE: transarterial chemoembolization;</p></fn><fn><p>TILA-TACE: targeting-intratumoral-lactic-acidosis TACE;</p><p>*Adjusted for viable tumor volume prior to treatment and macrovascular invasion using the general linear regression.

Again, most of the selected clinicopathologic characteristics were well matched between two treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). After completion of the first treatment, the VTR in the TILA-TACE group was 5.5-fold lower than that in the cTACE group (4.6% [95% CI: 1.8%–11.4%] vs. 25.4% [95% CI: 10.1%–64.0%]; p=0.008) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Table 4). We also evaluated whether the treatment effect was confounded by aforementioned clinical parameters in the RCT. Among them, only viable tumor volume before treatment was significantly associated with VTR. Adjustment for tumor volume before treatment slightly changed the results, with the VTR in the TILA-TACE of 4.1% (2.0%–8.4%) vs. 28.1% (13.9%–56.8%) in the cTACE (p=0.0009).

The most striking point is that the numbers reflecting the therapeutic improvements by TILA-TACE from the 2 studies were nearly identical (81.1% and 80.1%). This confirms the consistency of anticancer activities of cTACE as well as TILA-TACE with respect to local control of large HCC.</p><p>We compared the ORR in our cTACE practice with those reported globally. The average objective tumor response to TACE is 35% (range, 16%–61%), as systematically reviewed by LIovet and Bruix for the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer Group in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Llovet and Bruix, 2003</xref>). In 2012, Forner, LIovet, and Bruix summarized that more than 50% of patients had an objective response to TACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Forner et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that the objective tumor response to TACE in the 10-year period (2002–2012) had been increased for about 15%.

Obviously, the results obtained from our cTACE practice were similar to those reported globally.</p><p>TACE is for local control of the targeted tumor. Many previous studies have confirmed that better local control was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Riaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillmore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Riaz et al., 2010</xref>). Kim et al and Shim et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shim et al., 2012</xref>) further demonstrated a clear prognostic difference between CR, PR, stable disease and progressive disease. The current study demonstrated that TILA-TACE achieved a remarkable improvement of local tumor control and suggested an early sign of improved survival for patients with large HCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). It is noted that, during follow up, 16 patients in the TILA-TACE arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which may account for the death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These observations suggest that fast CR and timely control of recurrent tumors in the liver would likely improve the survival of patients, especially those with large tumor burden and low liver reserve.</p><p>Nevertheless, the work is limited by the study design. The randomized controlled study designed in this investigation was for local tumor control, not for survival. Although the small sample size allowed us to evaluate the local tumor control, we did not expect that such small sample size would yield statistically significant data for cumulative survival. Evaluation of survival is a matter much more complicated than evaluation of local control. There are many more factors affecting the survival of patients than those affecting the local tumor control, e.g., tumor characteristics, liver function reserve, tumor staging, disease complications, vascular invasion, metastasis, etc., all of which must be well controlled. While we acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT, the preliminary survival data allowed us to rationally calculate the sample size for a subsequent large RCT for evaluating the survival difference between cTACE and TILA-TACE. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further confirm the therapeutic advantage of TILA-TACE with respect to overall and progression-free survival of patients with large HCCs.</p><p>There was no significant difference of adverse effect between TILA-TACE and cTACE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">4</xref>), i.e., TILA-TACE was as tolerable as cATCE.

The tumor feeding arteries were defined by digital subtraction angiography. Then, a coaxial microcatheter (2.8 Fr Marguerite II, ASAHI INTECC GMA CO., LTD, Nagoya, Japan) was selectively inserted through a 5-Fr catheter into the tumor feeding artery, into which, 5% sodium bicarbonate (5% Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, Hunan Kelun Pharmaceutical, Ltd., Hunan, China) was infused alternatively with doxorubicin-lipiodol emulsion and oxaliplatin/homocamptothecin with the dose adjusted to tumor size . The dose of bicarbonate ranged between 50 and 250 ml corresponding to tumor sizes between 5 and 14 cm.

Log-transformation was conducted to normalize the distribution of viable tumor residues and viable tumor volume before treatment in parametric analyses, with assigning 1 to viable tumor residues if the measured value (ranging 0–216.5%) was 0. We also categorized tumor responses to treatment into four categories according to EASL criteria. Differences in the distribution of categories of tumor responses to treatment between two treatment groups were examined using the proportional odds model after adjustment for viable tumor volume before treatment. Overall survival time was calculated from the date of the first treatment to the date of death from any cause or the last follow-up visit (October 31, 2015). Distributions of overall survival were charted by Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The overall survival in the RCT was assessed using both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol methods. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was used for all tests.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has been supported in part by the China National 973 project (2013CB911303), China Natural Sciences Foundation projects (81272456, 81470126, 81301707) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, National Ministry of Education, China.

<italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers as the Senior editor and four reviewers, including Robert Gatenby and Chi Dang, who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors report that local bicarbonate infusion prior to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of large hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) resulted in remarkable improvement in tumor responses in a nonrandomized cohort of 57 patients followed by a randomized control 20 patients, which supported the findings of the nonrandomized study. Specifically, the clinical responses with bicarbonate were remarkable with early signs of improved survival for patients with large HCCs. The authors speculated that reducing or &quot;targeting&quot; intra-tumoral lactic acidosis may improve the clinical outcome and reported an objective response rate of 100% in the therapy group vs. 44% in the control group. The authors conclude that bicarbonate local infusion markedly enhances the anticancer activity of TACE. If validated, this approach could be a significant improvement over current TACE and support the notion that cancer metabolism, and in this case – acidity, could be manipulated in the clinic. While the data are of significant interest, there are some major concerns that must be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide additional details on the clinical protocol for administration of bicarbonate and subsequent chemoembolization so that others could reproduce the study. It is not clear whether and how the area and timing of the &quot;local bicarbonate&quot; injection and TACE overlaps to account for the therapeutic advantages. Since both local bicarbonate injection and TACE are both local treatments, how these two local treatments are related to each other are critical information that are missing from this manuscript.</p><p>2) In the TACE group, were the patients treated with a placebo, such as saline injection to control for the placebo or procedure-related events that contribute to the differences in outcomes?</p><p>3) The control arm with TACE alone achieved a survival of only 14 months, which is far below the expected survival outcomes available in the literature and various treatment guidelines. This may be due to the fact that both BCLC B and C patients were enrolled, which by itself is adding confusion to the interpretation of the data.</p><p>4) The authors report a 100% response rate using EASL. If this was the case, the expected survival should really be much greater in the experimental arm. The authors do not make any comments on this fact. In addition, they do not report whether the tumors recurred or whether the patients had to be re-treated. These are critically important clinical questions that the authors must address. The sample sizes appear small to reach confident conclusions. Additional supplemental data files on the individual patients would add significantly and document the data in more detail. The statistical analysis needs much more details in terms of the local control benefit and how to correct for the patients' cross-over between the two treatment groups.</p><p>5) Given the complexity of the sample recruitment and group changing during the trial, CONSORT Flow Diagram and checklist will be important and helpful to make the data more transparent and interpretable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15691.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide additional details on the clinical protocol for administration of bicarbonate and subsequent chemoembolization so that others could reproduce the study.

Repeat step 3 to 7 on the second and the third tumor feeding artery.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the TACE group, were the patients treated with a placebo, such as saline injection to control for the placebo or procedure-related events that contribute to the differences in outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that the control group should have been treated with placebo (saline), but in this case, we did not use saline as placebo, because saline injection will change our standard cTACE protocol that we performed for years. If we add saline into the procedure, then the comparison would not be between TILA-TACE and standard cTACE.</p><p>In addition to the mechanism by which bicarbonate enhances the anticancer activity of TACE described in our manuscript, there is another mechanism that bicarbonate could enhance the anticancer activity of TACE. As the weakly basic doxorubicin is more toxic in basic pH than in acidic pH condition, intratumoral alkalization by bicarbonate would potentiate the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. This is a critical point that should be clarified. Therefore, we initiated another small randomized controlled study (Title: Randomized controlled study of bicarbonate-enhanced transarterial chemoembolization and transarterial embolization in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma; registration number ChiCTR-IPR-15006025 in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry), in which, patients were randomly assigned to TILA-TACE or TILA-TAE (transarterial embolization, the same as TILA-TACE, except no chemotherapeutic agents). So far, 36 patients have been treated, and the objective tumor response rates between TILA-TACE and TILA-TAE group were virtually the same. The study is ongoing, but the results achieved so far strongly suggest that bicarbonate is the major agent that results in massive death of HCC, because chemotherapeutic agents (with or without) did not make a significant difference (100% objective response rate (ORR) of the targeted tumors in the TILA-TACE arm versus 93% ORR of the targeted tumors in the TILA-TAE arm).</p><p>Although the above evidence cannot directly answer the question as to whether the same amount of saline injection would exert a similar effect to bicarbonate, it demonstrated that local bicarbonate injection into HCC is effective in control of the tumor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The control arm with TACE alone achieved a survival of only 14 months, which is far below the expected survival outcomes available in the literature and various treatment guidelines. This may be due to the fact that both BCLC B and C patients were enrolled, which by itself is adding confusion to the interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The control arm with cTACE treatment achieved a median survival of 14 months. At the first glance, the median survival seems short. However, after close analysis, this median survival is most probably not below the expected survival outcome, if the patients’ disease characteristics, particularly BCLC staging and tumor size, are taken into consideration. In this control arm, 27 HCC patients included 9 BCLC C and 18 BCLC B, among which there were 15 patients with tumor size larger than 10 cm and 3 patients with tumor size close to 10 cm (9.4, 9.1, and 8.6 cm). We did not find a paper that reported survival of patients with disease characteristics comparable to the patients in our study, but we may take the reported survival data of patients with different tumor stages and tumor size as references, as detailed below:</p><p>Overall survival wise, TACE is more effective for patients with less tumor burden and higher liver reserve than those with higher tumor burden and lower liver reserve (Sieghart et al., 2015; Llovet et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2002; Malagari et al., 2012; Burrel et al., 2012; Takayasu et al., 2012) e.g., the 3-year survival rates for ideal TACE candidates (low tumor burden at BCLC stage A or BCLC stage B) could reach 55%-65% (Malagari et al, 2012; Burrel et al., 2012; Takayasu et al., 2012) whereas the 3-year survival rates for less rigorously selected patients were only 26 – 29% (Llovet et al., 2002; Lo et al., 2002). The 3 year survival of the control arm in this current study was 25.9%.</p><p>Tumor size appears to be a major factor to affect survival. LIovet et al. (2002) reported a 30 months median survival of patients at BCLC B and C with tumor size between 4.0 – 5.8 cm; Lo et al. (2002) reported a 17 months median survival of patients at BCLC B and C with tumor size between 4.0 – 14 cm; Huang et al. (2006) Jing-Huan Li (2015), and Paul et al. (2011) reported 9-10 months median survival of patients at BCLC B and C with tumor size larger than 10 cm.</p><p>For HCC patients at BCLC C stage, the recommended treatment is sorafenib. Current situation for patients with advanced HCC is desperate. Sorafenib is recommended for treating patients of BCLC C category. Two landmark studies confirmed that sorafenib could prolong modestly the median survival of patients in comparison to placebo (Cheng et al., 2009; Llovet et al., 2008). Cheng et al. reported a median survival of 6.5 months (sorafenib arm) versus 4.2 (placebo), and LIovet et al. reported a median survival of 10.7 months (sorafenib arm) and 7.9 months (placebo). The median survival of 10.7 months in the sorafenib arm was reproduced by several studies (Cheng et al., 2013; Cainap et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2013).</p><p>If the references listed above and the disease characteristics of the patients in our study were taken into consideration, the median survival time of the patients in the control arm of the current study may be not worse than the reported ones.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Llovet JM, Real MI, Montana X, Planas R, Coll S, Aponte J, et al.

The authors do not make any comments on this fact.</p></disp-quote><p>The 100% ORR in the TILA-TACE group includes CR and PR of the targeted tumors. Many previous studies have confirmed that better local control was an independent prognostic indicator for patient survival (Kim et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2012; Jung et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Riaz et al., 2011; Gillmore et al., 2011; Riaz et al., 2010), and Kim et al. (2015) and Shim et al (2012) further demonstrated that there was a clear prognostic difference between CR, PR, SD, and PD and that PR patients showed a significantly poorer survival than CR patients. Moreover, in the follow up, 16 patients eventually exhibited progressive disease, including 11 patients with new foci in the liver, 1 with new liver foci and lung metastasis, and 3 with lung metastasis, and 1 with bone metastasis, all of which accounted for the death in the experimental arm (Supplementary file 2). These observations also suggest that fast CR and timely control of recurrent tumors in the liver would likely improve the survival of patients, especially those with large tumor burden and low liver reserve. We also mentioned it in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, they do not report whether the tumors recurred or whether the patients had to be re-treated.

In the revised manuscript, we evaluated whether treatment effects (assessed by viable tumor residues, VTR) were confounded by these clinical parameters such as age, BCLC tumor stage, extra-hepatic metastasis, HBV DNA copy numbers, viable tumor volume before treatment, macrovascular invasion, and tumor multifocality using general linear models. Among them, only viable tumor volume before treatment was significantly associated with VTR. We also found a similar association for macrovascular invasion, being of statistically borderline significance. Therefore, we adjusted for these two covariates and estimated multivariable-adjusted VTR using the general linear model. We found that adjustment for these potential confounding factors did not materially alter the results, suggesting that the finding of remarkable improvement in tumor responses in the TILA-TACE vs. cTACE was independent of patients’ clinicopathological characteristics.</p><p>We also used the proportional odds model to adjust for viable tumor volume before treatment when comparing differences in the distribution of categories of tumor responses to treatment between two treatment groups.</p><p>The overall survival in the RCT was assessed using both the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocal (PP) methods. There was no apparent difference in overall survival between two treatment groups in the ITT analysis. However, a survival advantage appears in TILA-TACE treatment over cTACE treatment in the PP analysis. PP analyses may provide a better sense of the actual biological effect of treatment but are like to introduce biases to the study because of abolishment of randomization. We acknowledged these limitations of the present small RCT in the revised manuscript. We are planning a large-scale RCT to further examine both targeted/local tumor responses, overall and progression-free survival with bicarbonate TACE in patients with large HCCs.</p><p>We added the information into in the revised manuscript (Methods, subsection “Statistical analysis”, and Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the complexity of the sample recruitment and group changing during the trial, CONSORT Flow Diagram and checklist will be important and helpful to make the data more transparent and interpretable.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a CONSORT Flow Diagram (Reporting standard 1) and a CONSORT-checklist (Reporting standard 2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
