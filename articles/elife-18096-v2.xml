First, they synthesize a molecule similar to DNA, called RNA, which is a complementary copy of the gene. This process, known as transcription, creates an intermediate RNA molecule that is turned into protein in the second step. RNA polymerase is an enzyme that carries out transcription; it separates the two strands of the DNA helix so that the RNA can be synthesized from the DNA template. By opening up the DNA downstream of where active copying is taking place, and re-annealing it upstream, RNA polymerase maintains a structure called a &quot;transcription bubble&quot;. RNA polymerases do not copy continuously but oscillate back and forth along the DNA. Sometimes larger backwards oscillations, known as backtracking, temporarily block the production of the RNA molecule and slow down the transcription process.</p><p>A protein called NusG helps to couple transcription to the other related processes that happen at the same time. One end of the protein, the N-terminal domain, anchors it to RNA polymerase and stimulates transcription elongation. The other end, the C-terminal domain, interacts with other proteins involved in the related processes and can positively or negatively control transcription elongation. Nevertheless it was poorly understood how NusG carries out these roles.</p><p>Turtola and Belogurov investigated how NusG from the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> affects the individual steps of transcription elongation. A simple experimental system was used, consisting of short pieces of DNA and RNA, an RNA polymerase and NusG. A transcription bubble resembles an opening in a zipper with two sliders; and rather than affecting the synthesis of RNA, NusG affected the part that corresponds to the “slider” located at the rear edge of the bubble. NusG helped this slider-like element to bring the DNA strands at this edge of the bubble back together and modified it so that it behaved as a ratchet that inhibited RNA polymerase from backtracking. This did not affect the smaller backwards and forwards oscillations of RNA polymerase.</p><p>Turtola and Belogurov suggest that these newly discovered effects play a key role in regulating transcription; NusG’s N-terminal domain makes the RNA polymerase more efficient, whilst the C-terminal domain makes it amenable to control by other proteins. Future studies will investigate whether these effects are seen in more complex experimental systems, which include proteins that interact with NusG.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18096.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18096.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>transcription elongation</kwd><kwd>transcriptional pausing</kwd><kwd>translocation</kwd><kwd>base analogues</kwd><kwd>fluorescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Suomen Akatemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>grant #286205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turtola</surname><given-names>Matti</given-names></name><name><surname>Belogurov</surname><given-names>Georgiy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005609</institution-id><institution>Turun Yliopisto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turtola</surname><given-names>Matti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NusG enhances transcription elongation by stabilizing DNA base pairs immediately upstream of the RNA-DNA hybrid but does not measurably affect the nucleotide incorporation and the forward translocation by RNA polymerase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To control when and how fast genes are expressed, the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is tightly regulated. Much of transcription regulation in all domains of life takes place at the initiation stage by modulating activities of promoters. The examples of on/off regulation at the transcript elongation stage, such as promoter-proximal pauses in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>) and antitermination in prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Santangelo and Artsimovitch, 2011</xref>), are also known. In other cases, transcription elongation control is mediated by coupling of transcription to downstream processes, such as RNA translation, processing, and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Proshkin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bubunenko et al., 2013</xref>). The multisubunit RNAPs evolved to elongate relatively inefficiently in the absence of proper coupling, thereby enabling the downstream processes to control the elongation rate. The ubiquitous family of NusG proteins (SPT5/SPT4 in archaea and yeast, DSIF in mammals) are the central components which mediate coupling between transcription and the downstream processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Werner, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The simplest member of the family, a bacterial NusG, consists of two domains connected by a flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The N-terminal domain (NTD or NGN) anchors NusG to the clamp helices of the RNAP β’ subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD or KOW) interacts with the components of the downstream processes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</xref>]). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, NusG CTD interacts with NusE as part of the ribosome on protein coding operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burmann et al., 2010</xref>) or as a part of a so-called antitermination complex (NusABEG) on ribosomal RNA operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zellars and Squires, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shankar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Singh et al., 2016</xref>); in these contexts, NusG inhibits the function of a transcription termination factor Rho. If neither ribosome nor antitermination complex is engaged, which often implies that transcription is futile, NusG CTD binds to Rho and facilitates termination of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cardinale et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peters et al., 2012</xref>). tRNA and other non-coding RNA genes escape the premature termination by Rho possibly due to their extensive secondary structures and small size relative to the transcribed region required for the termination of transcription by Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mooney et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peters et al., 2009</xref>). NusG-mediated coupling of transcription with the pioneer round of translation is likely conserved in prokaryotes, whereas functioning of NusG CTD (and additional KOW domains present in eukaryotic SPT5 and DSIF) in RNA processing/maturation is likely conserved in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18096.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An overview of the bacterial transcription elongation complex (TEC) with bound NusG.</title><p>RNAP core subunits are depicted by simplified differentially colored molecular surfaces. β is depicted transparent to reveal the path of nucleic acids through the enzyme.

Even the housekeeping NusG may exhibit opposite effects on transcription in vivo depending on the protein partner(s) bound to its CTD domain. Furthermore, NusG from different bacteria display seemingly opposite effects on transcription by their cognate RNAPs in a purified in vitro system lacking the downstream components. The <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG has an intrinsic stimulatory effect on transcript elongation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bar-Nahum et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burova et al., 1995</xref>), which persists when an isolated NusG NTD is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>). It is hypothesized that this intrinsic stimulatory effect of NusG NTD may allow RNAP to transcribe more efficiently in vivo when coupled with the downstream processes and slower if the coupling is broken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGary and Nudler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burmann and Rösch, 2011</xref>). However, NusG from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> slows down its cognate RNAP in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010</xref>), whereas <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> NusG stimulates pausing by interacting with specific sequences in the non-template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yakhnin et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2016</xref>). We later suggest that these apparent incongruences result from the superimposition of several distinct consequences of the NusG NTD binding to the RNAP and considerable differences in the elongation properties of these RNAPs. But first we consider the mechanistic details of the elongation stimulation by <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG.</p><p>The RNAP nucleotide addition cycle consists of (<italic>i</italic>) the NTP substrate binding to a post-translocated transcription elongation complex (TEC); (<italic>ii</italic>) a chemical step of the nucleotide incorporation; and (<italic>iii</italic>) the post-catalytic relaxation of the resulting pre-translocated TEC, which involves the release of pyrophosphate and forward translocation (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belogurov and Artsimovitch, 2015</xref>]). The processive repetition of this cycle is sometimes interrupted by off-pathway pause events. The latter can be classified into pauses involving backtracking of the RNAP on the DNA template by two or more registers, which occludes the active site with the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nudler et al., 1997</xref>), and diverse non-backtracked pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</xref>). The non-backtracked pauses involve more complex and less understood rearrangement of the active site and the RNAP structure that impede the nucleotide addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kireeva and Kashlev, 2009</xref>). Notably, many non-backtracked pauses likely involve partial opening of the β’clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weixlbaumer et al., 2013</xref>), a large mobile domain that contributes most of the β’ subunit contacts with the nucleic acids.</p><p>The elongation-enhancing effect of NusG may arise from (<italic>i</italic>) accelerating the on-pathway elongation, (<italic>ii</italic>) diminishing some or all type of pauses, or both. Early studies suggested that NusG acts by reducing pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burova et al., 1995</xref>). Recent reports further specified that NusG homologues enhance elongation by restricting the conformational flexibility of the RNAP β’clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</xref>), which is consistent with biophysical measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulz et al., 2016</xref>) and structural considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klein et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG mainly reduces the frequency and duration of backtracked pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbert et al., 2010</xref>) that are not explicitly known to involve the β’ clamp opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekine et al., 2015</xref>) and has only small stimulatory effect at non-backtracked pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belogurov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kolb et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report a detailed analysis of NusG effects on the individual steps of the nucleotide addition cycle, backtracking, and the conformation of the upstream DNA. Our results suggest that NusG slows backtracking without affecting the on-pathway elongation in non-paused TECs. We also demonstrate that NusG inhibits backtracking by restricting the melting of the upstream DNA, independently of the NusG-RNAP contacts that are important for stabilization of the β’ clamp conformation. We further perform a comprehensive mapping of the upstream fork junction, determine the point of the upstream DNA reannealing, and provide a plausible mechanistic model of the anti-backtracking action of NusG.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NusG does not affect the rates of nucleotide incorporation and translocation in a non-paused TEC</title><p>To determine the effect of NusG on the kinetics of nucleotide addition and translocation, we utilized a TEC design that was extensively validated in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malinen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2015</xref>). The TEC was assembled on a synthetic nucleic acid scaffold and contained the fully complementary transcription bubble flanked by 20-nucleotide DNA duplexes upstream and downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The annealing region of a 16-nucleotide RNA primer was initially nine nucleotides, permitting the TEC extended by one nucleotide to adopt the post- and pre-translocated states, but disfavoring backtracking. The RNA primer was 5’ labeled with the infrared fluorophore ATTO680 to monitor the RNA extension by the denaturing PAGE. We performed parallel, time-resolved measurements of nucleotide incorporation by assembled TEC accompanied by forward translocation and, in a separate experiment, pyrophosphorolysis of extended TEC accompanied by backward translocation in the presence and absence of saturating concentration of NusG (2 µM, see later) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). RNA extension was monitored by a rapid chemical quench-flow method, whereas forward and backward translocation were monitored by measuring the fluorescence of the 6-methyl-isoxanthopterin base (6-MI) incorporated in the template DNA strand in a stopped-flow instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malinen et al., 2015</xref>). NusG did not affect either of these on-pathway reactions. We then tested the effect of NusG on the TEC translocation bias in the equilibrium setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that the predominantly post-translocated TEC can be converted into the pre-translocated state by tagetitoxin (TGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malinen et al., 2012</xref>). TGT was equally potent in biasing the TEC towards the pre-translocated state in the presence and absence of NusG, suggesting that NusG does not affect the equilibrium between the post- and pre-translocated states. Overall, these experiments suggest that NusG does not measurably affect the on-pathway kinetics and thermodynamics of transcript elongation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) in the non-paused TECs examined in this study.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18096.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NusG does not affect on-pathway transcription elongation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The schematics of the system used for monitoring the forward and the backward kinetics of the nucleotide addition cycle.

We developed a system where backtracking of the TEC is driven by the rapid cleavage of the nascent RNA by the RNAP active site. The reaction was initiated by adding 2–8 µM GreA protein that transforms the RNAP active site into a highly efficient RNAse. The TECs were assembled on a synthetic nucleic acid scaffold and contained the fully complementary transcription bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The annealing region of 18-nucleotide long RNA primer was 11 nucleotides, allowing the TEC to backtrack by one nucleotide. The RNA primer was 5’ labeled with ATTO680 to monitor the accumulation of a 16-nucleotide RNA cleavage product in a rapid chemical quench flow experiment. The RNA primer also contained 2-aminopurine (2-AP) as the penultimate 3’ nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), thereby permitting monitoring of 2-AP-p-C dinucleotide release by measuring an increase in 2-AP fluorescence in a stopped flow instrument. In a subset of experiments, the template DNA contained 6-MI nine registers upstream of the RNA 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to directly monitor RNAP backtracking by measuring the decrease in 6-MI fluorescence in a stopped flow instrument. Importantly, the changes in 6-MI and 2-AP fluorescence were driven by the RNA cleavage and not GreA binding because the addition of the cleavage-deficient D41N GreA variant did not change either fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18096.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NusG inhibits GreA assisted RNA cleavage by slowing backtracking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three assays for monitoring the GreA-assisted RNA cleavage: TEC backtracking (6-MI fluorescence decrease), RNA cleavage (PAGE), and the dinucleotide release (2-AP fluorescence increase).

We evaluated the NusG effects on backtracking of TECs assembled with RNAPs lacking β Gate Loop (ΔGL), β’ Lid Loop (ΔLL) and β’ Rudder Loop (ΔRL). We also perturbed the base pairs of the upstream DNA that may affect backtracking.

The assembled TEC16 preparations produced only minute amounts of DNA:DNA crosslinked species as expected: the template DNA thymidine of TA site was anticipated to form the upstream-last base pair of the RNA:DNA hybrid. Upon formation of TEC17, the efficiency of DNA:DNA crosslinking remained low (&lt;15%), despite the entire TA site being potentially available for pairing. In contrast, the crosslinking efficiency exceeded 40% in TEC18, comparable to that observed in a protein-free DNA:DNA duplex (~60%).

We used template DNA-RNA photo-crosslinking by a guanine analogue 6-thioguanine (6-TG), to probe the accessibility of RNA to DNA in the absence and presence of NusG. The TECs contained the fully complementary transcription bubble and the 5’ ATTO680-labeled 16-nucleotide RNA primer with the nine nucleotide annealing region.

The initial TEC16 contained 6-MI base in template DNA positioned eight base pairs upstream of the RNA 3’ end. The TEC was walked along the DNA by up to three positions by the addition of subsets of NTPs and the 6-MI fluorescence was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We attribute the low fluorescence of 6-MI eight nucleotides upstream the RNA 3’ end (the assembled TEC16) to the quenching effect of the upstream guanine that forms the upstream-most base pair of the RNA:DNA hybrid. The elevated 6-MI fluorescence nine nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3’ end is likely due to the unstacking of the upstream quenching guanine because it no longer belongs to the RNA:DNA hybrid. The elevated fluorescence persists ten nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3’ end, arguing that 6-MI does not reestablish the stacking interaction with the upstream guanine. Finally, the 6-MI fluorescence is reduced 11 nucleotides upstream from the RNA 3’ end, likely because 6-MI reestablishes the stacking interaction with the upstream guanine at this position. An experiment performed in the presence of TGT suggests that increased 6-MI fluorescence at the upstream edge of the RNA:DNA hybrid originates from a post-translocated TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The major effect of NusG on the wild-type TEC was the increase in the fluorescence of 6-MI at the upstream edge of the RNA:DNA hybrid (in TEC17).

NusG binds about 30 Å from 6-MI at the upstream edge of the RNA:DNA hybrid and is therefore unlikely to affect the 6-MI fluorescence directly.

Therefore, DNA likely base pairs ten nucleotides from the RNA 3’ end, but the first upstream base pair deviates from the geometry of the conventional B-form DNA duplex and/or is highly dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>To generate a NusG-TEC model, we positioned NusG NTD over the β’ clamp helices in bacterial TEC lacking the upstream DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vassylyev et al., 2007</xref>) guided by the model of NusG-RNAP complex in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</xref>).

Joining the upstream duplex with the RNA:DNA hybrid required altering the sugar-phosphate backbone of the downstream-most nucleotides of the upstream DNA but allowed maintaining the DNA base pairing. In the resulting model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), the upstream DNA has an ample space to move away from the NusG NTD and the β’ clamp surfaces towards the cleft between the β1 and β flap domains by hinging around the downstream most base pair (position ten in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), reflecting the natural flexibility of the upstream DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coban et al., 2006</xref>). However, we suggest that the conformation where the upstream DNA lines β’ clamp and NusG NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) is the most relevant to the NusG effects on transcription elongation. In such a scenario, the two downstream- most base pairs of the upstream DNA (positions ten and eleven in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) occupy a narrow channel walled by NusG NTD and LL, thereby explaining the functional interactions between the NusG, the LL and the upstream DNA in RNA cleavage, crosslinking and fluorescence assays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>NusG inhibits backtracking by acting on the upstream DNA</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> NusG was shown to enhance elongation in vitro over two decades ago, acting mainly by reducing pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burova et al., 1995</xref>).

It was later established that NusG-family proteins bind to, and bridge, the β’ clamp with the β lobe across the RNAP cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Belogurov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klein et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</xref>).

Together, these observations suggest that <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG enhances transcription elongation by means other than restricting the β’ clamp movement.</p><p>Here, we show that NusG slows backtracking but does not affect the on-pathway elongation in the non-paused TEC used in our study. In contrast, Herbert <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbert et al., 2010</xref>) concluded that NusG has a modest stimulatory effect (10–20%) on the pause-free elongation rate, in addition to inhibiting backtracking. One possibility is that a subset of TECs backtracked by one nucleotide display the elongation rates within the pause-free range compiled by Herbert <italic>et al</italic>. Alternatively, NusG may have a marginal effect on the elongation rate in a subset of the non-paused on-pathway TECs with yet to be identified sequence determinants. In any case, the effect of NusG on the pause-free elongation rate estimated by Herbert et al is small comparing with the specific effect of NusG on the backtracking rate (~2.5 fold) that we report here.</p><p>We further demonstrate that two DNA mismatches immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid increase the backtracking rate and render the TEC insensitive to NusG. In contrast, NusG reduced backtracking normally in a TEC missing the GL, a contact point with the β subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that is required for anti-pausing by <italic>E. coli</italic> RfaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</xref>). β’ RL was similarly dispensable, whereas the β’ LL was slightly stimulatory for the anti-backtracking activity of NusG. Overall, our data suggest that the intrinsic action of NusG on the <italic>E. coli</italic> TEC is restricted to inhibiting backtracking and is exclusively mediated through the upstream fork junction. Remarkably, several other transcription factors, including Mfd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deaconescu et al., 2006</xref>) and UvrD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Epshtein et al., 2014</xref>) that link transcription to DNA repair operate through the upstream fork junction.</p><p>Interestingly, ΔGL TEC backtracked two-fold slower than the wild-type TEC both in the presence and in the absence of NusG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). GL is located more than 20Å from the duplex DNAs and the RNA:DNA hybrid but may directly contact the single-stranded non-template DNA. Accordingly, we suggest that GL promotes backtracking by altering the conformation of the non-template DNA in a manner that increases the propensity of the TEC to backtrack, e.g. by facilitating the downstream DNA re-annealing. Indeed, GL restricts the downstream portion of the single-stranded non-template DNA within the main channel in the initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and may therefore have a similar functionality in the TEC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mapping the structure of the upstream fork junction</title><p>The upstream DNA decisively emerged as the major determinant of NusG anti-backtracking effect. However, the upstream DNA is absent from the crystal structures of bacterial TECs, the published models are incompatible with NusG binding, and even the register of the upstream DNA reannealing is uncertain. To gain mechanistic insights into the anti-backtracking action of NusG, we performed a comprehensive mapping of the upstream fork junction using fluorescent base analogues and site-specific crosslinking. Our data are fully consistent with the nine base pairs RNA:DNA hybrid and the upstream DNA duplex that starts eleven base pairs upstream of the RNA 3’ end in the post-translocated TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The effects of DNA mismatches additionally suggest that DNA is paired immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid. In combination, the data obtained with the matched and mismatched TECs suggest that the first pair of the upstream DNA is unstacked from both the RNA:DNA hybrid and the rest of the upstream DNA.</p><p>We then combined our mapping data with the model of the NusG-RNAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</xref>) to sketch a NusG-TEC model with the upstream DNA.

Such an arrangement plausibly explains the cooperation between NusG and the LL in stabilizing the upstream DNA pairing and inhibiting backtracking. Notably, NusG loop facing the upstream DNA is strictly conserved in size in bacteria and archaea (five amino acids, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), but the evidence for the conserved residue-specific contacts between the NusG and the upstream DNA is lacking. We propose that NusG provides a complementary molecular surface to the paired upstream DNA and possibly also affects the overall direction of the upstream DNA duplex. Finally, NusG likely stabilizes DNA pairing only in a subset of the upstream DNA conformations, yet influences the overall backtracking rate by targeting those conformations that are most favorable for backtracking, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the non-template DNA is optimally positioned for the strand exchange with the RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>NusG inhibits backtracking by stabilizing the minimal bubble in the pre-translocated TEC</title><p>NusG inhibits backtracking by stabilizing the DNA base pair eleven nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This pair corresponds to the second DNA pair upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid in the post-translocated TEC (pair eleven in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, NusG does not affect the equilibrium between the pre- and post-translocated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>) and therefore likely acts on the pre-translocated TEC where the base pair eleven nucleotides upstream of the RNA 3’ end lies immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid (pair ten in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, see also schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Accordingly, we propose that NusG facilitates DNA pairing immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid in the pre-translocated TEC, thereby reducing backtracking.</p><p>It remains uncertain how NusG inhibits backtracking without affecting the equilibrium between the post- and pre- translocated states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). One possible explanation is that backtracking and backward translocation are limited by different processes in our system. It has been hypothesized that, rather than moving in sync along the different nucleic acid chains of the TEC, RNAP moves forward by sequentially translocating the RNA:DNA hybrid and the downstream DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brueckner and Cramer, 2008</xref>). The synchronous sliding of RNAP along the nucleic acids is only superficially plausible in the 2D schematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) but is much less likely in the actual 3D structure of the TEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) where the downstream DNA and the RNA:DNA hybrid are separated by a 90° bend. Analogously, the backward translocation may involve the sequential translocation of the downstream DNA and the RNA:DNA hybrid. The former process is NusG independent and may limit the rate of the backward translocation, whereas the latter process is modulated by NusG and may be thus rate limiting for backtracking. We further argue that the difficulty of reconciling the large effect of NusG on backtracking with its small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbert et al., 2010</xref>) or undetectable (this work) effect on the forward and backward translocation in the context of a single-step translocation model lends support to a two-step translocation mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Three distinct effects of NusG NTD on the TEC</title><p>The available data suggest three independent and structurally plausible effects of NusG NTD on the TEC. First, NusG binds near the upstream fork junction and stabilizes the upstream DNA duplex, thereby inhibiting spontaneous backtracking at most template positions ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herbert et al., 2010</xref>] and this work). Second, the NTD restricts the conformational flexibility of the β’ clamp, with different outcomes for the transcription elongation. Archaeal Spt5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulz et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> RfaH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sevostyanova et al., 2011</xref>) exert at least part of their elongation enhancing effects by stabilizing the clamp.

Interestingly, <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> NusG slows down the cognate RNAPs at non-paused sites by an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sevostyanova and Artsimovitch, 2010</xref>). It remains to be determined if this unusual effect is mediated through the clamp or contacts with the non-template and upstream DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Functional significance of the intrinsic stimulation of transcription elongation by NusG family proteins</title><p>We argue that anti-backtracking represents the only conserved functionality of NusG family proteins. Backtracking is a universally conserved and functionally important feature of the multisubunit RNAPs that has been documented in vitro and in vivo in both bacteria and eukaryotes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nudler, 2012</xref>]). The stimulation of RNA chain elongation by NusG has been documented in vitro for bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Burova et al., 1995</xref>), archaeal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirtreiter et al., 2010</xref>) and eukaryotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wada et al., 1998</xref>) transcription systems. The NTD is sufficient for these effects on elongation, but the structural elements that superimpose well between the bacterial NusG NTD and the archaeal Spt5 NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) are limited to (<italic>i</italic>) the beta sheet that comprises the RNAP-binding site, (<italic>ii</italic>) the conserved five amino acid loop that we implicate in the anti-backtracking action of <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG, and (<italic>iii</italic>) the N-terminus of the α-helix that follows this loop and possibly interacts with the single-stranded non-template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crickard et al., 2016</xref>). The lack of the strong conservation of the surface residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) suggests that the anti-backtracking activity may be determined by the overall fold of the NusG NTD and is only weakly dependent on the nature of the individual amino acid side-chains, consistent with the mutational analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> NusG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mooney et al., 2009b</xref>).</p><p>While the above considerations suggest that the stimulation of transcription elongation by NusG family proteins may be important for long-term survival and fitness, in the experimental systems studied to date, functional contacts established by the CTD, such as Rho and S10 in <italic>Bacteria</italic>, appear to be more critical. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the essential function of NusG is to facilitate termination of transcription by Rho, thereby maintaining the operon borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cardinale et al., 2008</xref>), suppressing pervasive antisense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peters et al., 2012</xref>), and inhibiting R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krishna Leela et al., 2013</xref>). Stimulating Rho-dependent termination is also likely the major, albeit a non-essential, function of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> NusG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ingham and Furneaux, 2000</xref>). NusG and its paralog RfaH have also been proposed to mediate transcription-translation coupling via direct contacts with S10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burmann et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burmann and Rösch, 2011</xref>). However, the CTD contacts are not universally conserved: Rho is absent in eukaryotes and even some <italic>Bacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D’Heygère et al., 2013</xref>), whereas S10 and RNAP are separated by a nuclear membrane in eukaryotes, where CTD interacts with proteins involved in splicing, polyadenylation, and other RNA processing pathways.</p><p>In eukaryotes, the intrinsic stimulatory activity of Spt5 NTD on transcription elongation is non-essential, but abolishing it leads to the temperature sensitive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crickard et al., 2016</xref>). In rare circumstances, the stimulatory effect of Spt4/5 may possibly be deleterious: Stp4/5 has been suggested to facilitate transcription through toxic repeat sequences in eukaryotes, thereby contributing to the progress of neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kramer et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, we suggest that the universal conservation of the intrinsic stimulatory activity of NusG family proteins on transcription elongation underscores its importance, but the quantitative assessment of the in vivo role of this functionality in bacteria necessitates the analysis of transcription systems that natively lack Rho and Gre factors, <italic>e.g.</italic>, those of Cyanobacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and oligonucleotides</title><p>DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were purchased from IBA Biotech (Göttingen, Germany) and Fidelity Systems (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).

The impact of the findings is significantly lessened if this effect is observable in vitro but does not come into play in vivo in any significant way.

Although some of these points are straightforward and easily fixed in the manuscript, please note that there were no significant disagreements among the reviewers about these critiques. Every effort should be made to address all these other comments in a revision or to explain why no revision is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a very nice paper from the Belugurov lab concerning the molecular mechanism of the NusG elongation factor in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This factor is extensively described in the literature and has several seemingly independent activities; in addition NusG from different bacterial species has quite opposite effects on distinct RNAP activities. The authors provide rather convincing biochemical and -physical evidence that NusG increases processivity by inhibiting backtracking of RNAP by stabilising the transcription bubble (using in vitro transcription and chemical crosslinking experiments, and fluorescence measurements). This mechanism is in good agreement with the structural understanding of the elongation complex and not unexpected as such. A slight shortcoming of the work is the narrow range of techniques applied, and the absence of any data supporting the in vivo relevance of the suggested mechanism. In other words, does it make any difference to RNAP elongation and gene expression whether NusG modulates the reannealing of the DNA strands at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble? In the cell the elongation complex includes additional factors, NusA and even rho – how would these alter the effect of NusG on RNAP? Its very interesting to study and describe NusG mechanisms by measuring the incorporation of single nucleotides and recombinant factors in vitro, but does e.g. the genome-wide occupancy of RNAP change in strains harbouring NusG mutants which disrupt the predicted mechanism? I feel that these kind of data would elevate the impact of the type of results presented in the manuscript to be of interest of the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. Alternatively, providing structural information of the RNAP-NusG elongation complex (e.g. using cryoEM) would propel the structural hypothesis beyond a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, and subsection “Mapping the structure of the upstream fork junction”) and provide an additional perspective that would raise the impact of the work required for <italic>eLife</italic>. Having said that, the data are of very high quality and the conclusions are generally not over interpreted, and the results are of interest to the transcription community, in particular researchers that are working on the detailed molecular mechanisms of RNAP. I enjoyed reading this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript presents a wide range of related biochemical and biophysical experiments that present a reasonably self-consistent picture of structure and interactions at the upstream edge of the elongation complex in bacterial RNA polymerase, specifically focusing the relative effects on those measurements of the elongation factor NusG. While any one assay in this toolbox has a range of caveats with respect to the precision of its conclusions, that very different assays present a similar picture provides compelling support for the derived model. The authors are appropriately cautious for the most part, in their broad analyses. For example, fluorescent base analogs are sensitive to more than just base pairing (indeed, they are reflective of pairing-related changes in stacking) and cross linking propensities are are not direct measures of distance.</p><p>A bigger picture critique might be that these experiments are all carried out on scaffold complexes and so are 'artificial.' Again, the relative consistency of the results assuages such concerns and the power that this approach uniquely yields cannot be ignored. Most time courses are consistent with biologically relevant time scales.</p><p>In general, the data analysis in this manuscript is thoughtful and careful. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the concentration dependence of kinetic profiles is used to extract forward and reverse rate constants, which are then used to derive binding constants. While the data fit reasonably well, there are some systematic deviations at the extremes. Perhaps more importantly, interdependence of the two fit parameters should be discussed, as they are then used together to calculate Kd and its range. The authors should consider a somewhat more detailed analysis of this fit in the supplementary material. At the very least, they should indicate the equations fit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Turtola and Belogurov report a tour de force of biochemical assays to probe the effect of NusG on the transcription elongation complex. Because NusG (with its ortholog Spt5) is the only universally conserved transcription elongation factor across all kingdoms of life and because NusG/Spt5 is involved in the regulation of transcript elongation known to affect the expression of many genes, understanding the action mechanism of NusG/Spt5 is among the more important extant questions in the field of transcriptional regulation. Overall, Turtola and Belogurov provide compelling evidence that NusG from the model bacterium <italic>E. coli</italic> inhibits backtracking of elongation complexes by favoring pairing of the upstream edge of the DNA bubble. The DNA bubble is integral to the structure and activity of transcription complexes. The authors also provide new insight into the exact configuration of this upstream &quot;fork-junction&quot; by showing compelling evidence that the -10 DNA bp immediately upstream of the RNA:DNA hybrid (counting from the template nt positioned in the NTP binding site) is partially re-paired, but stacked on neither the RNA:DNA hybrid nor the exiting upstream duplex, whereas the -11 DNA bp is fully re-paired into an apparently canonical bp stacked on the exiting DNA duplex. The authors provide a hypothetical structural model that positions a conserved loop of NusG in an appropriate location to aid upstream fork-junction reannealing and that may explain the partially complementary role of the RNA polymerase lid-loop in the reannealing process. Although the authors findings do not explain the entire and surprisingly wide range of effects NusG can have on elongation complexes in different organisms, they provide an important framework for future studies. The work is likely to be a high interest the researchers studying the regulation of transcription elongation, which is an area currently undergoing significant growth because so many metazoan genes turn out to be regulated during the process of RNA synthesis rather than at steps preceding transcription initiation. There are a couple significant points that the authors will need to address before the manuscript would be acceptable for publication. These major points, along with a number of minor points are enumerated below.</p><p>1) I don't buy the argument that the authors have shown that NusG has no effect on steps other than backtracking, in particular on the rate of pause-free transcription elongation. This claim by the authors will need to be revised for the following reasons. First, a previous study that was much more sensitive to small effects that could aggregate across many successive rounds of nucleotide addition reached the opposite conclusion (Herbert et al., 2010), yet the authors do not explain how the present results invalidate these previous results and conclusion. Indeed, their own result shows a modest increase in the overall rate of a single nucleotide turnover reaction even though it is within their experimental error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; see bar graphs). Put another way, the modest effects of NusG on pause-free elongation reported previously are not detectable within the experimental error of the present measurements. Further, the authors have looked at only a single template position, whereas the contribution of translocation to elongation and the effect of sequences on upstream fork-junction reannealing and its contribution to translocation and to elongation are certain to vary at different template positions. At least for the basic contribution of translocation to elongation rate, these effects are demonstrated to vary among template positions (e.g., Dangkulwanich et al., 2013 <italic>eLife</italic> 2: e00971). Given that the authors have provided no evidence to rule out the small effects of NusG previously shown, the authors should modify their conclusion to state that NusG has at most a modest effect on pause-free transcription rate and a greater effect on backtracking, a conclusion indeed essentially the same as that reached by Herbert et al.</p><p>2) The authors can improve their manuscript by slightly expanding the presentation and discussion of their model for NusG interaction with the upstream fork junction. The authors have appropriately presented this model conservatively given the lack of direct evidence for the NusG-DNA interaction they propose. That said, the impact of the manuscript can be significantly improved by more clearly presenting the model and its implications, as described here and in the next point. First, the authors can much better illustrate their proposed structure for the upstream fork junction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is OK as far as it goes, but it does not aid the viewer in understanding the fork-junction structure nor does it identify the 5 aa loop in NusG proposed to aid in junction reannealing. I suggest the authors prepare additional panels that show two things. In one additional panel, they should show the fork junction from a different perspective so that the partially paired nature of the -10 by and stacking of the -11 bp is more easily understood. Why not use actual base structures for this panel, rather than the simplified stick diagrams that don't really illustrate stacking (or the absence of stacking)? In a second additional panel, the authors should show the sequence of the 5 aa loop and parts of the flanking sheet and helix from <italic>E. coli</italic> aligned with small number of examples from a diverse evolutionary range of organisms.

The authors suggest an entirely reasonable hypothesis that hybrid translocation and downstream DNA translocation may be two distinct, if interconnected, steps, rather than a single translocation event, and that NusG will principally affect events, like backtracking, for which hybrid translocation is rate-limiting).

As long as it's stated this way, and not that the results somehow prove the two-step model, then I think the authors could improve the impact of their manuscript by slightly expanding the discussion of this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18096.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Although these findings are of a strong biochemical significance, a major concern of multiple reviewers is that the extent to which backtracking inhibition by NusG contributes to gene expression or regulation in vivo is not established. The impact of the findings is significantly lessened if this effect is observable in vitro but does not come into play in vivo in any significant way. Accordingly, for the manuscript to be suitable for high-profile publication, the authors must provide either experimental evidence for the in vivo significance of their findings or a concise description in the discussion of how already published findings establish the in vivo significance of their results.</italic> </p><p>We have added a section into the Discussion where we contrast the universally conserved stimulatory effect of NusG family proteins on transcription elongation with the role of NusG in promoting Rho-dependent termination, the major functionality of NusG in bacteria. We suggest that the universal conservation of the stimulatory effect of NusG NTD is the major argument underscoring the significance of this activity in vivo. We further suggest that NusG-Rho cooperation masks other effects of NusG in bacteria and refer to the examples from the eukaryotic systems where the stimulatory activity of SPT4/5 has been linked to phenotypes.</p><p><italic>In addition to this major concern, the authors must address the following issues raised by the reviewers.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Both reviewer #1 and reviewer #3 raised concerns about the conclusion that NusG does not affect the stabilities or intercconversion of the pre- and post-translocated states of an elongation complex. These concerns must be addressed and the authors should modify their conclusions accordingly.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers’ concerns are of a different nature. Reviewer #1 doubts the inferences from our experiments. Reviewer #3 questions whether some inferences from our experiments could be generalized as broadly as we did, in light of the existing conflicting evidence. Accordingly, we answer the reviewers’ concerns individually.</p><p>(i) Reviewer #1 raised concern about our conclusions drawn from the TGT titration experiments. We now explain in detail how we infer the effect of NusG on the translocation bias from the TGT titration experiments in Figure 2—figure supplement 4. We also changed the sentence describing the TGT effects in the main text. It now reads as follows:</p><p>“TGT was equally potent in biasing the TEC towards the pre-translocated state in the presence and absence of NusG, suggesting that NusG does not affect the equilibrium between the post- and pre-translocated states.”</p><p>We think that the original sentence might have been confusing because it described the measurement of the affinity of the TEC for TGT instead of emphasizing that the interconversion of the post-translocated TEC into the pre-translocated state takes place upon increasing TGT concentration.</p><p>We further emphasize that TGT experiment is not the only evidence that we use to infer the absence of NusG effects on the backward translocation and the equilibrium between the pre- and the post-translocated states. We measured the effect of two agents, PP<sub>i</sub> and TGT, which bias TEC backward in the presence and absence of NusG. The field largely agrees that TGT is a transcription inhibitor that binds in the RNAP active site and stabilizes the pre-translocated state (Artsimovitch et al., 2011; Malinen et al., 2012; Yuzenkova et al., 2013). We have previously suggested that TGT is in fact a high affinity analogue of PP<sub>i</sub> (Malinen et al., 2012). The advantage of using TGT over PP<sub>i</sub> is that no chemical interconversion takes place and the system can be investigated in an equilibrium setup.</p><p>Pyrophosphorolysis is the reversal of the nucleotide addition and is catalyzed by the pre-translocated TECs. NusG had no effect on the rate of pyrophosphorolysis reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) by initially post-translocated TEC, suggesting that NusG has no effect on the backward translocation rate. Pyrophosphorolysis experiment also indirectly suggests that NusG has no effect on the equilibrium between the pre- and the post-translocated states, because NusG has no effect on the forward translocation rate in a separate experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the lack of NusG effect on the potency of TGT to bias the initially post-translocated TEC into the pre-translocated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) suggests that NusG has no effect on the equilibrium constant between the pre- and post- translocation states (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). TGT experiment also indirectly suggests that NusG has no effect on the backward translocation rate, because NusG has no effect on the forward translocation rate in a separate experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>(ii) Reviewer #2 suggested that results obtained in our system do not rule out a possibility that NusG affects the on-pathway elongation at some other sequence positions as reported by Herbert et al. 2010.</p><p>We addressed the reviewer request in the following way:</p><p>1. We added “measurably” to the sentences about the on-pathway elongation in the abstract and the significance statement. In our view, “measurably” is the concise way to state that no effect on the on-pathway elongation was observed in our experiments taking into account the experimental uncertainty.</p><p>2. We have rewritten the Discussion as follow:</p><p>“Here, we show that NusG slows backtracking but does not affect the on-pathway elongation in the non-paused TEC used in our study. In contrast, (Herbert <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010) concluded that NusG has a modest stimulatory effect (10-20%) on the pause-free elongation rate in addition to inhibiting backtracking. […] In any case, the effect of NusG on the pause-free elongation rate estimated by Herbert et al. is small comparing with the specific effect of NusG on the backtracking rate (~2.5 fold) that we report here.”</p><p>We find it unreasonable to soften our conclusions to the point of full congruence with the conclusions of Herbert et al. Our study agrees with Herbert et al. that NusG stimulates transcription by affecting the lateral position of the RNAP on the template DNA. However, our results suggest that NusG acts exclusively by inhibiting backtracking, whereas Herbert et al. suggest an additional marginal effect of NusG on the bias between the pre- and post-translocated states.</p><p>It is important to note that we measured the forward translocation and nucleotide addition independently. We also investigated the effects of NusG on the backward translocation under conditions where the backward translocation can be distinguished from backtracking. In contrast, the force-velocity single-molecule studies do not measure the forward translocation and nucleotide addition independently and the effects on translocation are inferred indirectly, for example by investigating the load sensitivity. The effects on the forward, backward translocation and backtracking are difficult to tell apart in a situation where backtracking is short, e.g. by only one nucleotide (Depken M, Galburt EA &amp; Grill SW (2009) Biophys. J. 96: 2189–93).</p><p>Most importantly, Herbert et al. concluded that NusG has an additional effect on the on-pathway elongation by assuming that all backtracked TECs are paused and therefore do not contribute to the pause-free elongation rate. We argue that this assumption is only superficially plausible. The fact that many pauses are backtracked does not prove that all backtracked TECs are paused. We suggest that the long-backtracked TECs are perhaps indeed universally paused, but the TECs backtracked by one nucleotide are not necessarily paused and may display a relatively fast elongation rate. For example, backtracking occurs with the rate of ~0.3 s<sup>-1</sup> in the TECs with the mismatched upstream DNA (we chose the fastest to backtrack in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). At the same time, we do not observe a measurable fraction of the backtracked state in that system before GreA is added. Considering the experimental uncertainties, we estimate that the backtracked state occupancy is ≤10%. The above two values suggest that the TEC backtracked by one nucleotide recovers with the rate ≥3 s<sup>-1</sup>, well within the range of pause-free elongation rates observed by Herbert et al. From the thermodynamic standpoint, the Brownian ratchet model of RNAP translocation postulates that there is the same amount of energy available for the forward translocation from the pre- to post-translocated state and from the backtracked to the pre-translocated state. Next, there is no a priori indication that the energy barrier between the 1-nt backtracked and the pre-translocated states is uniformly high to equate short backtracking with pausing.</p><p>Overall, we think that it is reasonable to retain some degree of disagreement between our conclusions and those of Herbert et al. 2010 until the rapidly elongating NusG-responsive TECs are identified and characterized individually, and it is confirmed or disproved that the 1-nt backtracked TECs are uniformly slow and do not contribute to the pause-free rate under the conditions used by Herbert et al.</p><p><italic>2) Both reviewer #1 and reviewer #3 raised concerned about overly categorical statements in the Introduction. Please revise the Introduction to address these concerns.</italic> </p><p>We have altered the Introduction to address the reviewers’ concerns.</p><p><italic>3) Reviewer #3 has made suggestions to improve the impact of your manuscript by more completely illustrating or explaining your model and some of its implications.

This factor is extensively described in the literature and has several seemingly independent activities; in addition NusG from different bacterial species has quite opposite effects on distinct RNAP activities. The authors provide rather convincing biochemical and -physical evidence that NusG increases processivity by inhibiting backtracking of RNAP by stabilising the transcription bubble (using in vitro transcription and chemical crosslinking experiments, and fluorescence measurements). This mechanism is in good agreement with the structural understanding of the elongation complex and not unexpected as such. A slight shortcoming of the work is the narrow range of techniques applied, and the absence of any data supporting the in vivo relevance of the suggested mechanism. In other words, does it make any difference to RNAP elongation and gene expression whether NusG modulates the reannealing of the DNA strands at the upstream edge of the transcription bubble? In the cell the elongation complex includes additional factors, NusA and even rho – how would these alter the effect of NusG on RNAP? Its very interesting to study and describe NusG mechanisms by measuring the incorporation of single nucleotides and recombinant factors in vitro, but does e.g. the genome-wide occupancy of RNAP change in strains harbouring NusG mutants which disrupt the predicted mechanism? I feel that these kind of data would elevate the impact of the type of results presented in the manuscript to be of interest of the general audience of eLife. Alternatively, providing structural information of the RNAP-NusG elongation complex (e.g. using cryoEM) would propel the structural hypothesis beyond a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, and subsection “Mapping the structure of the upstream fork junction”) and provide an additional perspective that would raise the impact of the work required for eLife. Having said that, the data are of very high quality and the conclusions are generally not over interpreted, and the results are of interest to the transcription community, in particular researchers that are working on the detailed molecular mechanisms of RNAP. I enjoyed reading this paper.</italic> </p><p>We have added a section into the Discussion where we acknowledge the importance of NusG-Rho cooperation in bacteria and contrast it with the universally conserved stimulatory effect of NusG family proteins on transcription elongation. We argue that the importance of NusG for regulating the activity of Rho masks the other functionalities of NusG in <italic>E. coli</italic>. At the same time, the anti-backtracking activity of NusG family proteins is likely determined by the fold of the NTD so it is not straightforward to construct a NusG variant with an unaltered fold that is fully devoid of such activity. We further suggest that the quantitative assessment of the in vivo role of elongation stimulation by NusG in bacteria necessitates the analysis of transcription systems that natively lack Rho, e.g., those of Cyanobacteria.</p><p>Next, we fully agree that it is reasonable to gradually increase the complexity of the in vitro system by adding more factors such as NusA, B, E, ribosome, σ, that are normally present in vivo. However, such expansion requires rigorous tests of the effects of several factors in several assays individually and in combination. In addition, many factors require considerably longer RNA for the full functionality than the one that we used to assemble TECs on the nucleic acid scaffold (16-18 nt). It is very straightforward to add NusA to our existing systems, but we do not think that the result of such <italic>ad hoc</italic> experiment will be conclusive. Accordingly, we suggest that the expansion of the study to include more factors is outside the scope of the present manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript presents a wide range of related biochemical and biophysical experiments that present a reasonably self-consistent picture of structure and interactions at the upstream edge of the elongation complex in bacterial RNA polymerase, specifically focusing the relative effects on those measurements of the elongation factor NusG. While any one assay in this toolbox has a range of caveats with respect to the precision of its conclusions, that very different assays present a similar picture provides compelling support for the derived model. The authors are appropriately cautious for the most part, in their broad analyses. For example, fluorescent base analogs are sensitive to more than just base pairing (indeed, they are reflective of pairing-related changes in stacking) and cross linking propensities are are not direct measures of distance.</italic> </p><p><italic>A bigger picture critique might be that these experiments are all carried out on scaffold complexes and so are 'artificial.' Again, the relative consistency of the results assuages such concerns and the power that this approach uniquely yields cannot be ignored. Most time courses are consistent with biologically relevant time scales.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer on the artificial nature of the scaffold system. That said, in this work we use the scaffold system to recreate the effect of NusG previously observed in a conventional promoter initiated TECs. The scaffold setup allows for a more homogeneous preparation and for the modifications that are difficult to introduce into the promoter initiated TECs. Those modifications (unpaired upstream DNA, DNA fluorophores and thiobases) in turn were critical for unraveling the determinants of the anti-backtracking activity of NusG and for the mapping of the upstream edge of the transcription bubble.</p><p><italic>In general, the data analysis in this manuscript is thoughtful and careful. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, the concentration dependence of kinetic profiles is used to extract forward and reverse rate constants, which are then used to derive binding constants. While the data fit reasonably well, there are some systematic deviations at the extremes. Perhaps more importantly, interdependence of the two fit parameters should be discussed, as they are then used together to calculate Kd and its range. The authors should consider a somewhat more detailed analysis of this fit in the supplementary material. At the very least, they should indicate the equations fit.</italic> </p><p>The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> Right serves two major purposes:</p><p>1) It provides additional evidence that the increase in the TEC17 fluorescence upon the addition of NusG (a small effect often accounting for as little as 20% of the total fluorescence in the sample) is the result of NusG binding: the rates are not too fast and not too slow and the kinetics fits reasonably well to the simple binding scheme.</p><p>2) It provides an estimate for the TEC affinity for NusG that in turn reaffirms that our experiments were performed at the saturating concentration of NusG.</p><p>In addition, the experiment provides estimates for the rates of NusG binding and dissociation that are tangential to the present investigation but may be ultimately useful in the mathematical modeling of transcription.</p><p>The kinetics fits the simple binding scheme reasonably well though there are some deviations at extremes. The deviations may originate from the unaccounted changes in the background fluorescence (in this experiment we operate with a small effect and a large background on the milliseconds timescale) or reflect the additional steps in the binding reaction. For example, the change in the fluorescence following the NusG binding may partially limit the overall reaction rate at high concentration of NusG. However, our analysis indicates that adding extra steps to the simple binding scheme leads to the unconstrained parameters.</p><p>We now provided the equations used for the data analysis in Figure 6—figure supplement 2. The equations cannot be explicitly specified in Kintek Explorer but it is implied that they are the simple systems of differential rate equations that are numerically integrated to fit the data.</p><p>We now also describe in Figure 6—figure supplement 2 how we accounted for the interdependence of the binding and the dissociation rate constants when determining the upper and lower bounds of the equilibrium dissociation constant of TEC-NusG complex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) I don't buy the argument that the authors have shown that NusG has no effect on steps other than backtracking, in particular on the rate of pause-free transcription elongation. This claim by the authors will need to be revised for the following reasons. First, a previous study that was much more sensitive to small effects that could aggregate across many successive rounds of nucleotide addition reached the opposite conclusion (Herbert et al., 2010), yet the authors do not explain how the present results invalidate these previous results and conclusion. Indeed, their own result shows a modest increase in the overall rate of a single nucleotide turnover reaction even though it is within their experimental error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; see bar graphs). Put another way, the modest effects of NusG on pause-free elongation reported previously are not detectable within the experimental error of the present measurements. Further, the authors have looked at only a single template position, whereas the contribution of translocation to elongation and the effect of sequences on upstream fork-junction reannealing and its contribution to translocation and to elongation are certain to vary at different template positions. At least for the basic contribution of translocation to elongation rate, these effects are demonstrated to vary among template positions (e.g., Dangkulwanich et al., 2013 eLife 2: e00971). Given that the authors have provided no evidence to rule out the small effects of NusG previously shown, the authors should modify their conclusion to state that NusG has at most a modest effect on pause-free transcription rate and a greater effect on backtracking, a conclusion indeed essentially the same as that reached by Herbert et al.</italic> </p><p>We addressed the reviewer’s request in the following way:</p><p>1) We added “measurably” to the sentences about the on-pathway elongation in the abstract and the significance statement. In our view “measurably” is the concise way to state that no effect on the on-pathway elongation was observed in our experiments taking into account the experimental uncertainty.</p><p>2) We have rewritten the Discussion as follow:</p><p>“Here, we show that NusG slows backtracking but does not affect the on-pathway elongation in the non-paused TEC used in our study. In contrast, (Herbert <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010) concluded that NusG has a modest stimulatory effect (10-20%) on the pause-free elongation rate in addition to inhibiting backtracking. […] In any case, the effect of NusG on the pause-free elongate rate estimated by Herbert et al. is small comparing with the specific effect of NusG on the backtracking rate (~2.5 fold) that we report here.”</p><p>We provide in depth discussion on this issue by addressing the summarized queries put forward by the editor (please see above). Most importantly, we argue that the assumption that 1-nt backtracked TECs are uniformly slow and therefore excluded from the pause-free elongation rate range in Herbert et al. is only superficially plausible. It has not been experimentally proven that short backtracking can be equated with pausing. Accordingly, the action of NusG on the pause-free elongation rate may originate from its effect on the 1-nt backtracked TECs that recover with the rates within the pause-free elongation rate range.</p><p>Next, we understand the reviewer’s suggestion that the bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> of our original submission possibly showed that NusG has an effect on the half-life of the nucleotide addition cycle that is smaller than our error margins. However, the normalized translocation curves obtained in the parallel experiments with the same TEC preparation +-NusG fully overlap in several independent experiments. Admittedly, the combined analysis of the nucleotide addition and translocation data exaggerated the differences between the total half-lives of the nucleotide addition cycle +-NusG. To address this problem we performed analysis using more datasets and altered the data presentation. Specifically, we now acknowledge that the upper and the lower bounds for the half-lives of the translocation and the nucleotide addition steps should not be treated as independent when estimating the total half-life of the nucleotide addition cycle. The updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> provides stronger evidence against the NusG effects on the half-life of the nucleotide addition cycle in our system.</p><p><italic>2) The authors can improve their manuscript by slightly expanding the presentation and discussion of their model for NusG interaction with the upstream fork junction. The authors have appropriately presented this model conservatively given the lack of direct evidence for the NusG-DNA interaction they propose. That said, the impact of the manuscript can be significantly improved by more clearly presenting the model and its implications, as described here and in the next point. First, the authors can much better illustrate their proposed structure for the upstream fork junction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> is OK as far as it goes, but it does not aid the viewer in understanding the fork-junction structure nor does it identify the 5 aa loop in NusG proposed to aid in junction reannealing.
