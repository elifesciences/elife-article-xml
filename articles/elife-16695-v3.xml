We identified a missense mutation in the human Cryptochrome 2 (<italic>CRY2</italic>) gene that co-segregates with FASP in one family. The mutation leads to replacement of an alanine residue at position 260 with a threonine (A260T). In mice, the <italic>CRY2</italic> mutation causes a shortened circadian period and reduced phase-shift to early-night light pulse associated with phase-advanced behavioral rhythms in the light-dark cycle. The A260T mutation is located in the phosphate loop of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain of CRY2. The mutation alters the conformation of CRY2, increasing its accessibility and affinity for FBXL3 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), thus promoting its degradation. These results demonstrate that CRY2 stability controlled by FBXL3 plays a key role in the regulation of human sleep wake behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16695.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16695.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16695.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sleep is an essential process in animals. In humans, the disturbance of normal sleep-wake cycles through shift-work or long-term sleep disorders increases the risk of developing conditions including mental illness, cancer and metabolic syndromes. Understanding how sleep-wake behavior is controlled within cells may help researchers to develop effective therapies to reduce the ill effects of disturbed sleep-wakLouise cycles on health.</p><p>To understand how our sleep-wake cycles are regulated in cells, researchers have been looking for genetic mutations that affect human sleep schedules. For example, some people have a â€˜morning larkâ€™ schedule that makes them prone to go to sleep early and rise early the next day. Others are prone to be â€˜night owlsâ€™, staying up later at night and waking up later in the morning. By studying the mutations that underlie these behaviors, researchers hope to understand precisely how these genes regulate sleep schedules.</p><p>Now, Hirano et al. have identified a particular mutation in a gene called Cryptochrome 2 (<italic>CRY2</italic>) that causes people to have shorter sleep-wake cycles so that they wake up very early in the morning and struggle to stay awake in the evening. For the experiments, mice were genetically engineered to carry the mutant human <italic>CRY2</italic> gene, which shortened the sleep-wake cycles of the mice and their responses to light so that they both woke up earlier and went to sleep earlier.</p><p>Further experiments examined what effect the mutation has on the protein that is produced by <italic>CRY2.</italic> The mutation changes the shape of the protein, which allows an enzyme called FBXL3 to bind to the mutant protein more easily and rapidly break it down. The length of sleep cycles may be determined by how long it takes FBXL3 to break down the protein produced by <italic>CRY2</italic>. The findings of Hirano et al. may help researchers to develop treatments for people with sleep problems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16695.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16695.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circadian clock</kwd><kwd>cryptochrome2</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>FBXL3</kwd><kwd>Familial Advanced Sleep Phase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirano</surname><given-names>Arisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hirano</surname><given-names>Arisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL059596</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>PtÃ¡Äek</surname><given-names>Louis J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010246</institution-id><institution>William K.

Sleep-wake timing is regulated by the internal biological clock driving physiological rhythms with a period of approximately 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takahashi, 1995</xref>). The circadian clock is composed of interlocked transcriptional and translational negative feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reppert and Weaver, 2001</xref>). In mammals, a CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimer binds to E-boxes and activates gene expression of the <italic>Period (Per</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome (Cry</italic>) genes. Translated PERs and CRYs proteins form a complex that enters the nucleus to inhibit their own transcription through direct interaction with CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers. PER and CRY proteins accumulating in the nucleus are then degraded over time. As protein levels fall (depending on rate of degradation), the transcription-translation feedback loop begins anew.</p><p><italic>CRY2</italic> is a principal component in mammalian circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shearman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vitaterna et al., 1999</xref>). While Drosophila and plant CRY proteins act as photoreceptors contributing to photoentrainment of the circadian clock and other biological processes by binding to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Partch and Sancar, 2005</xref>), mammalian CRY2 has light-independent transcriptional repressor activity and strongly inhibits E-box-regulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kume et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shearman et al., 2000</xref>). The protein stability of CRY2 is fine-tuned by post-translational modification including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. In addition, various enzyme modifications play a role in CRY2 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reischl and Kramer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stojkovic et al., 2014</xref>). Among them, FBXL3 is an F-box type E3 ubiquitin ligase which promotes CRY1 and CRY2 ubiquitylation thus leading to proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Busino et al., 2007</xref>). Mutations in mouse <italic>Fbxl3</italic> or knockout of the <italic>Fbxl3</italic> gene dramatically lengthens the period of mouse behavioral rhythms in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Godinho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siepka et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that the protein stability of CRY1 and CRY2 is a critical determinant of circadian period in mice. However, direct evidence supporting the significance of <italic>CRY2</italic> and the post-translational regulation of CRY2 protein in the human circadian clock regulating the sleep-wake cycle has been lacking.</p><p>Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) is a heritable sleep phenotype characterized by stable early sleep and wake times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reid and Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reid et al., 2001</xref>). The FASP phenotype can segregate as a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant trait in human kindreds. Previously, we have identified mutations in clock genes, including <italic>Period2, Period3, casein kinase Iδ</italic>, and <italic>Dec2</italic> causing circadian and sleep homeostasis phenotypes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">He et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Toh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). A mutation at the phosphorylation priming site of PER2 attenuates sequential phosphorylation and consequently destabilizes PER2 proteins. The mouse model expressing mutant PER2 exhibits a shortened circadian period accompanied with large phase-advance in sleep-wake rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). This sequential phosphorylation region of PER2 was later found to be modulated by another post-translational regulation, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation, demonstrating an interplay and competition between phosphorylation and <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of serine residues in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaasik et al., 2013</xref>). These studies highlighted the important role of post-translational regulation of clock proteins in vivo in humans and also revealed mechanistic insight into the regulation of PER2. Thus, human genetic studies have provided valuable and unique opportunities to elucidate novel molecular mechanisms of circadian/sleep regulation.</p><p>Here we report the identification of a novel variant in the human h<italic>CRY2</italic> gene that leads to FASP. Generation of a mouse model carrying the mutation revealed that the mutation causes a FASP-like phenotype in mice with altered circadian period and photic entrainment. We found that the mutation in the CRY2 FAD-binding-domain enhances its affinity for FBXL3, thus destabilizing CRY2 via increased ubiquitylation and targeting for degradation by the proteasome. We conclude that regulation of CRY2 stability by a proper balance of FAD and FBXL3 is essential for the sleep-wake cycle in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a novel mutation in the h<italic>CRY2</italic> gene associated with FASP</title><p>Through candidate gene screening in FASP families, we identified a missense mutation in the human <italic>CRY2</italic> gene, which causes an amino acid conversion from Ala→Thr at position 260 (A260T) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Interestingly, h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> showed reduced phase-delay when mice were subjected to a 30-min light pulse at ZT14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), whereas phase-advance was normal in response to a light pulse at ZT22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The mice were subsequently released into constant darkness (DD) to determine circadian period. The free-running period of h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> (23.52±0.04 hr) was significantly shorter than that of h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> (23.70±0.03 hr) and <italic>WT</italic> mice (23.74±0.02 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Mutations at amino acid residues critical for FAD binding affect CRY2 repressor activity of E-box-mediated transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Czarna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hitomi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanada et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, Ser265 of mouse CRY2 (homologous residue of Ser266 in human CRY2) is a phosphorylation site, and the S265D mutation, mimicking a phosphorylated serine 265, reduces CRY2 repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanada et al., 2004</xref>). Using a Luciferase assay, we found that the A260T mutation weakened CRY2 repressor activity on <italic>Per1</italic> E-box-mediated transcriptional activation by CLOCK-BMAL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, the nuclear CRY2 protein levels in culture cells were decreased by the mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which could potentially account for the reduction of CRY2 repressor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then examined the degradation of CRY2 proteins by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments. Consistent with the cellular distribution of CRY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), CRY2-A260T was less stable than CRY2-WT in HEK293 cells, especially in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Destabilization of CRY2 by the mutation was further verified in a CRY2-LUC based bioluminescence degradation assay, where the protein decay rate can be determined by recording CRY2-LUC bioluminescence in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although Ala260 does not directly bind to FAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hitomi et al., 2009</xref>), amino acid conversion from the hydrophobic and small amino acid, alanine, to threonine could alter the conformation of the phosphate loop. This idea is supported by an observation that a mutation from alanine to aspartic acid (A260D) caused a more severe effect on CRY2 repressor activity and protein stability than the A260T mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We found that human CRY1 harboring the corresponding mutation at position 241 is less stable than CRY1-WT, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for CRY1 and CRY2 by FAD binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We found that treatment of HEK293 cells with FAD increased CRY2-WT protein levels much more than CRY2-A260T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that stabilization of CRY2 by FAD was reduced by the mutation. This result supports the hypothesis that the A260T mutation alters the FBXL3-CRY2 interaction. We thus carried out a competitive assay by adding FAD to complexed CRY2-FBXL3 to examine the effect of the mutation on the release of CRY2 from purified CRY2-FBXL3 complexes in vitro. Free CRY2-WT protein levels increased with addition of FAD in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, mutant CRY2 was released less readily than CRY2-WT from the complexes even though both forms of CRY2 were bound to FBXL3 at the same level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, we tested FBXL3-mediated CRY2 degradation using KL001, a small synthetic molecule known to stabilize CRY1 and CRY2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>) due to its structural similarity to FAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nangle et al., 2013</xref>). KL001 stabilizes CRY2-WT in a dose-dependent manner as was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hirota et al., 2012</xref>). However, KL001 failed to stabilize CRY2-A260T to the same extent it did for CRY2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicate that the A260T mutation weakened the function of FAD and KL001 as inhibitors of FBXL3-mediated degradation of CRY2 and that CRY2-A260T is less stable than CRY-WT, likely due to strengthened interaction with FBXL3. To determine whether the A260T mutation indeed modifies the interaction of CRY2 and FBXL3, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis. As expected, CRY2-A260T binds more strongly to FBXL3 than CRY2-WT in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), consequently leading to more ubiquitylation of the mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The effect of the mutation on the binding affinity under in vivo conditions will need to be further evaluated when better human CRY2 antibodies (for immunoprecipitation) become available.</p><p>We next performed structural modeling of mutant CRY2 to address how the A260T mutation modulates conformation of the phosphate loop. For modeling, we used the mouse CRY2 structure as the crystal structure of mouse CRY2-FBXL3 complex is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xing et al., 2013</xref>) and amino acid sequence in the phosphate loop perfectly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The published CRY2-FBXL3 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xing et al., 2013</xref>) revealed that space between Ala260 (corresponding to A259T in mouse) and Asp442 (mouse Asp441) in FBXL3-binding form (red) is more opened vs. the FAD-binding form (orange, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The amino acid change from Ala260 to Thr increases molecular density in this space and may alter electrostatic interactions between Ala260Thr and Asp442. As a result, the mutation likely renders the CRY2-A260T more accessible to FBXL3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This model is consistent with the results from CRY2-A260D mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, we demonstrated that the A260T mutation in the FAD binding pocket endows mutant CRY2 with a higher accessibility and affinity for FBXL3, therefore leading to faster proteasomal degradation of mutant vs. wild-type CRY2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Decreased endogenous CRY2 protein levels in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice</title><p>Our in vitro studies demonstrate that CRY2-A260T is less stable than CRY2-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

CRY1 protein levels were also decreased by the mutation in nuclear extracts from liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), suggesting that CRY1 is destabilized in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice. At the same time, we found that nuclear expression of PER1 and PER2 were up-regulated in liver extracts from mutant mice, particularly at ZT14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), suggesting that the timing of nuclear accumulation of PER proteins is advanced in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice. Although PER1 and PER2 protein levels were significantly altered, their mRNA levels were not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A similar alteration of PER1 and PER2 protein levels in the absence of noticeable changes in mRNA levels was previously reported for <italic>Psttm</italic> mutant mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Psttm</italic> mice have a mutation in the <italic>Fbxl21</italic> gene and this mutation decreases the protein level of FBXL21, which functionally competes with FBXL3. The <italic>Psttm</italic> mutation resulted in CRY1 and CRY2 protein destabilization and a shorter circadian period in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yoo et al., 2013</xref>), which parallels the phenotype of our h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We found that the expression of clock genes in liver was not significantly altered by the mutation, while the effect was obvious in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We initially identified this as a novel variant. Since that time, it has been recognized as a rare variant in the SNP database (rs201220841). The frequency of the A260T allele (0.00008 in the ExAc database) is much lower than that of FASP (0.5%, our unpublished data) in the general population. This is consistent with the A260T variant found in one of our FASP families being responsible for a small portion of FASP in the general population.</p><p>Among the mutation carriers of this family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the proband, her twin sister, and her mother have clear advanced sleep phase. In contrast, the nephew of the proband (101374) did not have early sleep onset and offset although his genotype is A/G (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Considering his age, we classified him as ‘unknown’, since adolescents and young adults are typically more difficult to categorize as having a definite circadian phenotype due to normal phase delays seen in many people beginning in adolescence and persisting into young adult life (boys/men &gt; than girls/women) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Roenneberg et al., 2004</xref>). When phenotyped at age 21, subject 101374 was at the statistical peak age of maximum phase delay due to these developmental effects and was prone to be even more phase-delayed by his male sex. Therefore, he may become progressively more phase advanced as he grows older as a result of the <italic>CRY2</italic> FASP allele as it is unmasked by these developmental changes. It is also possible that the mutation may not have 100% penetrance and therefore the nephew will never manifest the FASP trait.</p><p>In order to confirm that the A260T mutation is causative of FASP, we generated mice carrying the mutation and subjected them to detailed behavioral analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Consistent with the other FASP mutations previously reported in h<italic>CK1δ</italic> and h<italic>PER3,</italic> the effects of the human mutation observed in mouse models and in vitro are subtle compared to those found in forward mutagenesis screens. This is expected since the mutations that we identified are found in extant humans in the ‘real world’. The circadian body clock plays crucial roles in maintaining normal physiological functions. Thus, any mutation manifesting the strong phenotypes seen in mutagenesis screens would almost certainly have been a selective disadvantage if they arose spontaneously in humans. Furthermore, while the phase advance in mice carrying the human <italic>PER2</italic> mutation appears to be due largely to a shortening of circadian period, the published <italic>PER3</italic> mice and the <italic>CRY2</italic> mice reported here both have altered entrainment. We speculate that some of FASP in humans is caused by altered entrainment properties that would not have been detected in forward mutagenesis screens because they have focused almost entirely on measuring period (not phase) as the target phenotype.</p><p>Previously, we have used wheel-running behavior analysis to characterize mouse models carrying human FASP mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2005</xref>). Here, we investigated an additional behavior analysis method. For the h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mouse model, we also employed continuous video recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that video recording was quite sensitive to detect advanced sleep phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although wheel-running also displays the phase advance of activity offset in the h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the data from wheel-running is less robust for detecting a phase advance of activity onset. This is likely due to a strong light-masking effect for mouse at the light-to-dark transition for activity onset. Thus, when the lights are on, mice are less likely to run on a wheel. However, smaller amplitude movements like grooming behavior and moving in the cage were detected by video recording. Wheel running was quite sensitive to detect phase advance of activity offset as this is seen during the dark phase of LD 12:12.</p><p>In this study, we found that the circadian period was significantly shortened by the A260T mutation in the central and peripheral clocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–E</xref>). Growing evidence indicates that stability of CRY proteins dominantly determines the circadian period length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Godinho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hirano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Siepka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">St John et al., 2014</xref>): stabilization of CRY lengthens circadian period in mice whereas destabilization of CRY shortens the period. Consistent with this model, our human mutation destabilizes CRY2 and leads to a short circadian period of mouse behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Shortened circadian periods have been measured in one FASP human subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jones et al., 1999</xref>), and in mouse models of human FASP mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2005</xref>). Mutant animals having a shorter free-running period such as <italic>tau</italic> mutant hamster also tend to exhibit advanced phase of behavioral rhythms in LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lowrey et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the <italic>CRY2</italic> mutation results in FASP, at least in part, through shortening of the free-running period.</p><p>Interestingly, our data also indicates that another circadian clock feature, phase resetting by light, is dysregulated in the h<italic>CRY2</italic> mutant mouse model. h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice have a smaller phase-shift in response to a light pulse in early subjective night compared to h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In order to live on a 24 hr day in LD 12:12, wild-type mice need to phase delay a small amount each day because the endogenous circadian period is slightly shorter than 24 hr. A reduced ability to phase-delay observed in the h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mouse model could contribute to advanced sleep phase, though the mechanism for the altered phase-shift remains to be elucidated. Although the difference in the free-running period of the transgenic mice was subtle as compared to the degree of phase-advance manifested in human mutation carriers or mice carrying the mutant h<italic>PER2</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,F</xref>), it is reasonable to expect that the alteration of both circadian period and light-induced phase-shifting together will strongly influence the phase angle of entrainment. The <italic>after-hours</italic> mutation in the mouse <italic>Fbxl3</italic> gene causes stabilization of CRY leading to an extremely long circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Godinho et al., 2007</xref>). These mutant mice also exhibit large phase-shifts in response to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guilding et al., 2013</xref>). The authors speculated that reduced amplitude of the circadian clock in <italic>after-hours</italic> mutant mice leads to the abnormal enhancement of phase-resetting. In this study, the A260T mutation elevated PER1 and PER2 levels, especially at ZT14, and the amplitude of PER1 protein rhythm was greater in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> vs. h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the effect of light pulses in the early night may be decreased by the perturbed protein profiles (increased amplitude) of PER1 and PER2 in h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> mice.</p><p>FAD is a chromophore binding to flavo proteins regulating various biological processes and it is required for the light-sensing activity of CRY in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin and Todo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Partch and Sancar, 2005</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> CRY is degraded by the proteasome in response to light signals, which is a trigger for phase-resetting of the circadian clock in flies. However, the ability of mammalian CRYs as a photoreceptor remains controversial as double knockout mice of <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic> are still able to entrain to light and show <italic>Per1</italic> gene induction in SCN in response to light pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Okamura et al., 1999</xref>). These double knockout mice completely lack behavioral rhythms in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the repressor activity of CRY on E-boxes and its interaction with other clock proteins are independent of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>). These findings emphasize the light-independent role of CRY proteins in mammals. Thus, the physiological role of FAD binding in the mammalian clock has been totally unknown, while a previous study implied that FAD can structurally compete with FBXL3. Our findings provide the first evidence that FAD functions as a stabilizer of CRY2 protein by modulating FBXL3-CRY2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The results presented here demonstrate that the protein stability of CRY2 regulated by the balance of FBXL3 and FAD controls clock speed and sleep/wake timing in mice and humans.</p><p>Several genetic studies reported that the human <italic>CRY2</italic> gene is associated with mood regulation, cancer and glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dupuis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kovanen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lavebratt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sjöholm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Although psychiatric disorders, cancer, and metabolic disorders are tightly connected with dysfunction of the biological clock, associations of <italic>CRY2</italic> polymorphisms with morning/evening preference or other circadian phenotypes have not been described. One polymorphism in the <italic>FBXL3</italic> gene was reported to be associated with diurnal preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parsons et al., 2014</xref>), implying the conserved role of FBXL3 in the human circadian clock. However, it remains to be elucidated whether that variant in <italic>FBXL3</italic> is causative (vs. merely be associated with) the human circadian phenotype and whether it acts through CRY regulation. Here, we demonstrate that regulatory mechanisms for CRY2 protein are well conserved between mice and humans and that control of CRY2 stability is critical for appropriate phase angle and period of the circadian clock in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Method summary</title><p>All human subjects signed a consent form approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Utah and the University of California, San Francisco (IRB# 10–03952).

The BAC clone was modified by homologous recombination using the Counter-Selection BAC Modification Kit (Gene Bridges GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, a linear PCR fragment containing a streptomycin/kanamycin counter selection gene was amplified. The primers for this reaction were designed so that 20 nucleotides would anneal to the streptomycin/kanamycin gene and an additional 40 nucleotides homologous to sequences flanking the mutation site. This PCR product was transferred into the RP11-1084E2 BAC to initiate homologous recombination in the DH10B <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain that already contained the plasmid pSC101- BAD-gbaA<sup>tet</sup>.

Mice were kept in individual wheel running cages with free access to food and water. First, mice were entrained to LD 12:12. Activity profiles, offset time and acrophase were analyzed using data from day 10 to day 14 in LD. After entrainment to LD for approximately 3 weeks, mice were released into constant darkness (DD) for measurement of free-running period. Circadian periods were calculated by line fitting of activity onsets from day 7 to day 19 in DD. To analyze for phase-shifts, mice were given a 30 min-light pulse (200 lux) beginning at ZT14 (2 hr after lights-off) or at ZT22 (2 hr before lights-on), and then released into DD. Phase-shifts were determined by line fitting of activity onsets from day1 to day7 in DD. All data collection and analysis was done using ClockLab software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL; RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014309">SCR_014309</ext-link>). Activity onset and offset were defined using the ClockLab software algorithm.

Walking distance and immobility times were calculated using ANY-maze software and data were averaged. Samples with over 500-meter walking distance or below 10,000-s immobility time each day were excluded from the statistical analysis due to the failure of automatic tracking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell culture and constructs</title><p>HEK293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573; RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link>) and NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658; RRID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0594">CVCL_0594</ext-link>) were purchased from ATTC. Authentication of the cell lines was performed using STR profiling by ATCC. Mycoplasma contamination was checked every 6 months and mycoplasma-free cell lines were used for all experiments in this study. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 10% FBS and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, South San Francisco, CA) and maintained by standard methods. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared from E12.5 embryos of h<italic>CRY2-WT</italic> and h<italic>CRY2-A260T</italic> transgenic mice. After removing the head, paws and internal organs, embryos were chopped and incubated in 0.25% trypsin in PBS for 24 hr at 4°C. After incubation for 20 min at 37°C in 0.25% trypsin in PBS, cells were dissociated by pipetting in DMEM. Supernatant was cultured in a cell culture dish with DMEM and maintained by standard methods. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Chris S Colwell, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor and Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identify a rare mutation in the circadian clock gene Cry2, which they find to segregate with advanced sleep phase in a small pedigree. A mouse model carrying the candidate variant exhibits modest shortening of the circadian period as well as altered phase delay, but not phase advance. At the molecular level, the authors provide evidence for altered protein stability of Cry2 due to the mutation. At the molecular level, the authors demonstrate shorter PER2-driven bioluminescence rhythms in the peripheral oscillators. Importantly, the authors examine the impact of the CRY2 mutation on the normally repressing function of the protein, and demonstrate a possible mechanism through altered interaction with a known binding partner, FBXL3. The results provide insight into the regulation of human sleep timing. However, several of the authors' claims are compromised somewhat by an inconsistent quality in the data. Some revisions are required before a conclusion can be reached on whether all of the authors' claims can be supported.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The characterization of the sleep and circadian phenotypes for the subjects is scarce. This section should be expanded to include e.g. typical bed- and wake times, midsleep on free days, H-O scores, etc. Currently there are only gives H-O scores for the sibling pair and DLMO for a single individual. Please provide basis for classification into categories on left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for all subjects. Also, legend on left includes a symbol for 'probably affected', yet all subjects in pedigree are colored as either 'affected', 'unaffected' or 'unknown'. Who is 'probably affected'? Also provide genotypes for all subjects. Depending on how many subjects in this fairly small kindred can be definitively classified, segregation of the allele with FASPS phenotype may or may not be consistent. Similarly, dim light melatonin onset for normal subjects at should be reported so that a lay reader can assess the degree of phase advance shown by the proband.</p><p>2) The tissue/cell rhythms presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref> show a pronounced difference in cycling amplitude between genotypes. This applies especially to lung, which seems to only be borderline rhythmic in the mutant transgenic. Period and amplitude should be determined by appropriate curve-fitting methods rather than selected peak-trough distance and a measure of reliability for both parameters needs to be provided.

In 5D, it remains unclear whether KL001-mediated Cry2 stabilization is indeed reduced, because of the reduction in Cry2 half-life in the absence of the drug. To assess the effect of KL001, the data should be presented as difference in half-life compared to the no-drug control for each construct. Interaction of Cry2 with Fbxl3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) should be confirmed in a physiologically relevant setting (co-immunoprecipitation from transgenic cells/tissues and/or Cry2-deficient cells reconstituted with either Cry2 form, see previous comment).</p><p>4) The CRY2-A260T mice have normal activity onset, which does not recapitulate the phenotype shown by FASP subjects.

This section should be expanded to include e.g. typical bed- and wake times, midsleep on free days, H-O scores, etc. Currently there are only gives H-O scores for the sibling pair and DLMO for a single individual.</italic></p><p>We have added a table summarizing human sleep phenotype in this submission (Figure 1—figure supplement Table. 1). We have interviewed the proband’s mother who also has the A260T mutation. She is not included in the Supplement Table 1. We could not perform sleep log recording or questionnaire diagnosis because she was 91 years old when phenotyped. However, in the interview, she described that she habitually woke up at 5:00 in the morning without alarm clock at least since she was 31 years old when she gave birth to her first child. It was hard to categorize the proband’s nephew because of his young age.</p><p> <italic>Please provide basis for classification into categories on left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for all subjects. Also, legend on left includes a symbol for 'probably affected', yet all subjects in pedigree are colored as either 'affected', 'unaffected' or 'unknown'. Who is 'probably affected'? Also provide genotypes for all subjects.</italic></p><p>The information is included in the Methods section. The figure has been corrected, and genotypes been added accordingly.</p><p><italic>Depending on how many subjects in this fairly small kindred can be definitively classified, segregation of the allele with FASPS phenotype may or may not be consistent.</italic> </p><p>We understand the family in this study is not big enough to conclude that A260T mutation is causative for FASP base on human genetics data alone (i.e. by linkage analysis). That’s why we generated the mouse model and characterized their behavior to see how A260T mutation affects behavioral and cellular rhythms on a homogeneous genetic background. One thing that we’ve learned from study of familial human behavioral traits is the challenge of recruiting additional family members. Sleep is NOT a disease phenotype, so people are not as motivated to participate with all the questionnaires, interviews, and tests that we would like them to do, especially when they are not getting paid for any of these. In order to overcome this challenge, our approach has been trying our best to recruit as many subjects as possible in each family followed by mutation screening. Proving that a mutation is causal requires demonstration of the behavioral phenotype in a mouse model and the altered molecular functions in vitro/in vivo. If the family has many mutation carriers who have the sleep trait but the mouse model does not demonstrate the phenotype, then we cannot follow up with the mutation even if the number of mutation carriers is higher.</p><p><italic>Similarly, dim light melatonin onset for normal subjects at should be reported so that a lay reader can assess the degree of phase advance shown by the proband.</italic> </p><p>We added this information as suggested in the Results of the main text.</p><p> <italic>2) The tissue/cell rhythms presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref> show a pronounced difference in cycling amplitude between genotypes.

However, there is currently no specific antibody for human CRY2 that is good enough to perform co-immunoprecipitation (We in fact have tested all available antibodies for this). This set of experiments will need to be carried out when that reagent becomes available.</p><p> <italic>4) The CRY2-A260T mice have normal activity onset, which does not recapitulate the phenotype shown by FASP subjects. The degree of phase advance in activity offset is also nowhere near that of the human subjects, and the slight change in period (15-20 min decrease) is also unlikely to cause the same degree of advanced sleep phase.</italic> </p><p>It is well known that mice have strong masking effect by light. Here, it appears that activity onset around the LD transition is masked by light signal in wheel-running analysis, although we detected advanced activity offset. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref> shows the advanced “locomotor” activity onset by video recording. Thus, we think that while CRY2-A260T Tg mice wake earlier than WT mice, they are not running on the wheel, likely due to masking to light. In addition, the inconsistency among the analysis tools can be explained by the fact that wheel-running exercise alters mouse behavioral rhythms (Webb et al., Behavioral Neuroscience, 2014) (especially shortens the free-running period). Thus, wheel-running does not reflect the “sleep-wake” pattern perfectly. We also need to remember that humans do not run on wheels all day long, so wheel-running behavior is likely not the best reflection of human sleep wake behavior. We discussed these points and also the differences in the phenotype of our mice in the Discussion section. Also, we understand so little about the relationship between period length and phase angle of entrainment to speak with too much certainty about what is expected in terms of phase advance for any given endogenous period. We accept that there are differences between mouse and human physiology. The conditions under which we measure such things is also different in mice than in humans (see above). Finally, it is also possible that the phase advance in the humans is due to a combination of effects of period shortening and altered entrainment. We have attempted to enroll these subjects in studies in temporal isolation by our collaborator, Jeanne Duffy. Unfortunately, these subjects did not want to do such an intensive study. We did observed abnormal phase-shifting in the mice, which also is likely to contribute to the phenotype.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Although parts of the manuscript are much improved over the previous version, some issues would still benefit from further clarification as follows:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Second paragraph of Introduction section: &quot;Mutations in mouse Fbxl3 or knockout of the Fbxl3 gene dramatically lengthens the period of mouse behavioral rhythms in constant darkness (Godinho et al., 2007; Hirano et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2013; Siepka et al., 2007), indicating that the protein stability of CRY2 is a critical determinant of circadian period in mice.&quot;</italic> </p><p> <italic>This is a misleading statement – all of the references cited studied the combined effects on CRY1 and CRY2 of Fbxl3.

Since we found this mutation before the registration of the database (2008) in a strong physiological candidate, we categorized the mutation as a novel variant and proceeded to generate the mutant mouse line. We looked through several hundreds of normal control subjects plus public genome sequences to confirm novelty in 2008. The recapitulation of a circadian phenotype led to us to the more detailed molecular analysis showing functional consequences in vitro. Since the reported variant in public databases is rare (0.008% in the ExAc database), and FASP is not uncommon (0.5% in general population, our unpublished data), it is not surprising that this variant exists at a low frequency in the general population (~120,000 in the ExAc database). This variant, therefore, explains a small but measurable proportion of FASP in the population. We have discussed this in the modified manuscript.</p><p>Regarding other candidate circadian genes, we did not find any other rare polymorphism co-segregating with the phenotype.

It is likely that he will become more phase advanced as he approaches age 30 (still young enough so as not to be confused with the ASPS of aging). Because non-penetrance does occur, it is also possible that this individual will never manifest FASP.
