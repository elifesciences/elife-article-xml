even lethal outcomes. Past research has revealed a genetic haplotype on chromosome 3 that entered the human population via introgression from Neanderthals as the strongest genetic risk factor for the severe response to COVID-19. However, the specific variants along this introgressed haplotype that contribute to this risk and the biological mechanisms that are involved remain unclear. Here, we assess the variants present on the risk haplotype for their likelihood of driving the genetic predisposition to severe COVID-19 outcomes. We do this by first exploring their impact on the regulation of genes involved in COVID-19 infection using a variety of population genetics and functional genomics tools. We then perform a locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay to individually assess the regulatory potential of each allele on the haplotype in a multipotent immune-related cell line. We ultimately reduce the set of over 600 linked genetic variants to identify four introgressed alleles that are strong functional candidates for driving the association between this locus and severe COVID-19. Using reporter assays in the presence/absence of <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>, we find evidence that these variants respond to viral infection. These variants likely drive the locus’ impact on severity by modulating the regulation of two critical chemokine receptor genes: <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>. These alleles are ideal targets for future functional investigations into the interaction between host genomics and COVID-19 outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group

<italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> has infected more than 160 million people worldwide and claimed more than 3 million lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">WHO, 2021</xref>). The variance in patient outcomes is extreme, ranging from no ascertainable symptoms in some cases to fatal respiratory failure in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vetter et al., 2020</xref>). This wide range of patient outcomes is due in part to comorbidities; however, prior health conditions do not explain the full range of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, efforts have been made to assess a potential genetic component. Repeatedly, a region on chromosome 3 encompassing a cluster of chemokine receptor genes has been reported as having a strong association with an increase in COVID-19 severity in Europeans, with the strongest reported risk variant conferring an odds ratio of 1.88 for requiring hospitalization (p=2.7*10<sup>–49</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2021</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020</xref> identified that the strongest COVID-19 severity locus was introgressed by Neanderthals, with a core introgressed haplotype spanning ~49 kb from chr3:45,859,651–45,909,024 (hg 19) including rs35044562, reported as one of the leading variants of the association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2020</xref>) and a broader, extended haplotype with reduced linkage spanning ~333 kb from chr3:45,843,315–46,177,096. Subsequently, this locus was fine-mapped to two independent risk signals, one which is confirmed to fall within the Neanderthal haplotype and tagged by a set of strongly linked SNPs including rs35044562 and rs10490770, while the other, led by rs2271616, falls just upstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kousathanas et al., 2022</xref>). The core haplotype is at highest frequency in South Asian populations (30%), as well as at appreciable frequency in Europe (8%) and the Americas (4%), yet it is virtually absent in East Asia. The stark difference in frequency between South Asian and East Asian populations implies that the haplotype may have been positively selected in South Asian populations, for which there is support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Racimo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jagoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browning et al., 2018</xref>) and/or subject to purifying selection in East Asian populations. However, the specific phenotypic consequences of this haplotype leading to its potential adaptive effect as well as its effect on COVID-19 severity remain unknown. Moreover, the potential causal drivers of the selective pressure, as well as COVID-19 severity remain unstudied.</p><p>Here, we identify putative functional variants within this haplotype that may be driving its association with COVID-19 severity. To do so, we first examine the haplotype in the context of a broader introgressed segment. We then identify loci within the introgressed segment that are associated with levels of gene expression (eQTLs) in vivo. We next compare the eQTL effects of these variants with differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 and related infection datasets to identify which response genes for these eQTLs are potentially relevant to the COVID-19 phenotype. We follow this computational approach with a high-throughput functional Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) and identify 20 variants along the introgressed segment that directly modulate reporter gene expression. We intersect these 20 variants with a host of molecular and phenotypic datasets to further refine them to 4 which display the strongest evidence of contributing to the genetic association with severe COVID-19 at this locus. We then investigated these four variants (eight alleles) using reporter assays in the context of the promoter of their most likely endogenous target gene (<italic>CCR1</italic> or <italic>CCR5</italic>), and in the presence/absence of replicating <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>, revealing evidence of important functionality. These tested variants primarily modulate expression through their potential effects on <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5 cis</italic>-regulation and are strong candidate variants that should be investigated with future targeted functional experiments.

We used 423 Estonian whole genome samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pankratov et al., 2020</xref>) that constitute a well-studied representative sample of the broader Estonian population as sampled by the Estonian Biobank (EGCUT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leitsalu et al., 2015</xref>). These samples also have available whole blood RNA-sequence data which contributed to eQTLGen, a broad whole blood eQTL analysis study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Võsa et al., 2018</xref>). By utilizing genomes that were part of the eQTL study population, we can be assured that the associations between alleles and gene expression is accurate, as differential linkage disequilibrium (LD) between alleles in different populations can decrease the efficacy of using eQTL data from one population on another.</p><p>We initially conducted the Sprime scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browning et al., 2018</xref>) using the 423 Estonians as the ingroup population along with 36 African samples from the Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) with no evidence of European admixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mallick et al., 2016</xref>) as an outgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

The association between COVID-19 phenotypes and <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> in particular also finds support from expression studies where elevated <italic>CCR1</italic> expression in neutrophils and macrophages has been detected in patients with critical COVID-19 illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>), in biopsied lung tissues from COVID-19 infected patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>), as well as in Calu3 cells directly infected with COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>). Likewise, elevated <italic>CCR5</italic> expression has been detected in macrophages of patients with critical COVID-19 illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, some ligands for <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> (<italic>CCL15</italic>, <italic>CCL2</italic>, and <italic>CCL3</italic>) also show over-expression in these patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>CCRL2</italic>, <italic>LZTFL1</italic>, <italic>SCAP</italic>, and <italic>SACM1L</italic> are also differentially expressed in at least one experiment that measures differential expression of genes in lung tissues and related cell lines infected with COVID-19 or other viruses that stimulate similar immune responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, when considering the effect of the <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs for <italic>CCR1</italic> across the entire segment, we find that the majority of alleles along the introgressed haplotype within the A block are associated with its down-regulation (average Z score = –12.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). On the other hand, the majority of alleles within the B and C blocks are associated with <italic>CCR1</italic> up-regulation (average Z scores = 7.1 and 10.2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is important to note that these eQTL effects are determined based on whole blood from non-infected, healthy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Võsa et al., 2018</xref>). When considered in the context that severe COVID-19 phenotype is characterized by increased expression of <italic>CCR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>), these risk-associated alleles having different directions of effect suggest that a complex change to the <italic>CCR1</italic> regulatory landscape driven by alleles across the introgressed segment may be contributing to the disease phenotype. When we consider <italic>CCR5</italic> expression, it shows a more consistent pattern in which the majority of alleles within the A-C blocks are associated with its down-regulation. This result is interesting as <italic>CCR5</italic> expression in patients with severe COVID-19 illness is higher than those with more moderate cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). However, given the strong LD within each of these segments, discerning the direct connection between one or more alleles driving these regulatory changes and the molecular and phenotypic signatures of severe COVID-19 remains difficult.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MPRA variant selection and study design</title><p>To independently assess the regulatory impact of the alleles on this COVID-19 risk haplotype, we employed a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (MPRA) to investigate which alleles on the introgressed haplotype directly affect gene expression. Alleles which have the ability to modulate gene expression in this reporter assay are candidate putatively functional alleles that may drive the association with COVID-19 severity by altering the expression of genes that facilitate the biological response to COVID-19. To ensure that we tested any potential risk variants on the haplotype, we included in the MPRA all variants directly identified in the Sprime scan as being within the introgressed COVID-19 severity associated segment (361), along with any allele linked (r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.3) to one of these Sprime alleles in the Estonian population (140 alleles) or any 1000 Genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auton et al., 2015</xref>) European (150 alleles) or South Asian population (197 alleles). Therefore, here we are testing not only alleles on the introgressed haplotype that have a confirmed Neanderthal-specific origin, but also alleles along the introgressed haplotype that were either already present in the human population when the haplotype was introgressed, or arose anew in humans (i.e., human-derived alleles) on the introgressed haplotype following its introgression. After filtering for SNPs falling within simple repeat regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benson, 1999</xref>), which are not compatible with MPRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tewhey et al., 2016</xref>), we identified a total of 613 experimental variants. Of these variants, 293 are significantly (p&lt;5*10<sup>–8</sup>) associated with COVID-19 severity and another 15 approach significance (p&lt;5*10<sup>–6</sup>), whereas 118 were not tested in the original GWAS (<italic>The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative Release 5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>We conducted this assay in K562 cells, a leukemia cell line that displays multipotent hematopoietic biology, which allows for comparison between the MPRA data and the eQTLs identified on whole blood samples (see above). Furthermore, K562 cells can be induced into immune cell fates highly relevant to the COVID-19 severity phenotypes including monocyte, macrophage, and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tabilio et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutherland et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler and Hirano, 2014</xref>). Moreover, as K562 cells robustly grow and are transfectable using MPRA reagents, they permit the rapid, repeated acquisition of large numbers of cells, as observed in prior MPRAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ulirsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ernst et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the availability of other published datasets generated on K562 cells (e.g., chromatin ChIP-seq data), allows for comparison between MPRA results, which are episomal in nature, and the endogenous behavior of the genome in the same cell type. However, we do note that MPRA results will also be limited as they will not directly reflect the response of alleles in the endogenous genome and within the in vivo tissues in which the COVID-19 response occurs. We therefore also integrated the MPRA results with datasets derived on endogenous immune tissues/cells to help improve our ability to identify biologically relevant candidate driver variants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MPRA reveals 20 expression modulating variants (emVars)</title><p>We built the MPRA library following Tehwey and colleagues (2016) and performed four replicates of the experiment in K562 cells (Methods).

Because the sample size is quite small (20), CREs containing emVars do not show significant enrichment within any endogenous K562 functional annotations. However, compared with tested sequences that do not contain emVars, CREs containing these emVars trend toward being over-represented within poised promoters, weak enhancers, DHS, insulators, repressive marks, and for depletion in heterochromatin regions (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Properties of emVars and prioritization.</title><p>This table shows a summary of all the functional data we obtained on the 20 significant emVars identified by the MPRA which we used for prioritization of which these 20 emVars show the most evidence for contributing to the severe COVID-19 phenotype.

Of these, rs35454877 and rs71327024 fall within the LD Block A, which shows the strongest GWAS associations for COVID-19 severity and are 195 kb and 275 kb downstream of rs10490770, the most cited tag SNP for this GWAS signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmiedel et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, data from other GWAS studies shows that these four variants are significantly (p&lt;5*10<sup>–8</sup>) associated with other phenotypes that could relate to the COVID-19 severity phenotype including: ‘Monocyte count’, ‘Granulocyte percentage of myeloid white cells’, and ‘Monocyte percentage of white cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Astle et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, all four SNPs above fall within ChIP-seq peaks for at least one transcription factor (TF) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1k</xref>), with rs71327024 and rs35454877 overlapping peaks for as many as 89 and 36 different TFs, respectively (ENCODE TF ChIPseq NarrowPeaks from K562, GM12878 cell lines); among others, peaks for IKZF1, a key lymphocyte regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sellars et al., 2011</xref>), are found overlapping all four SNPs. Nevertheless, we did not find that these SNPs alter TF binding affinity for any of the corresponding binding motifs analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1l</xref>).

Of the two, the response at emVar rs35454877 was the strongest, and was driven by increased activity by the introgressed allele.

While we did not observe expression modulation for emVar rs304041956 in the mock infected state, we did now observe a modest effect size with the non-introgressed allele driving slightly more expression than the introgressed allele (0.9FC Introgressed: Non-introgressed). Interestingly, for emVar rs35454877, our strongest response eQTL in the mock infected state, we now observe no response between alleles, the marked drop resulting from the substantial decrease in the activity of the introgressed allele upon viral infection. This finding could indicate that the heightened effect of the introgressed allele in more normal (mock infected) settings is actively down-regulated in the context of viral infection settings (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We re-examined a previously identified adaptively introgressed segment in Eurasians within the context of the genome-wide signatures of introgression. We identified 613 variants within the introgressed region (chr3:45,843,242–46,654,616) and these were tested for whether they are potential drivers of the association this region exhibits with increased COVID-19 severity. Using MPRA, we tested these variants in a multipotent immune-related cancer cell line and narrowed down the list to 20 emVars where the expression level driven by the allele on the introgressed haplotype was significantly different from the expression driven by the other allele. We did not find support in the MPRA for the expression modulation potential of rs10490770 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, 2021</xref>), rs35044562 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeberg and Pääbo, 2020</xref>), or rs11385942 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellinghaus et al., 2020</xref>), variants previously reported as tagging GWAS signals for COVID-19 severity. These variants may therefore be likely only tagging rather than causative, albeit functional experimentation in other cell lines and conditions may show otherwise. By further mining our MPRA results in concert with datasets on the epigenomic and transcriptional environment of immune cells from other functional genomics sources, here we highlight four emVars that have particularly strong evidence of acting as putatively causal variants and whose archaic alleles are strongly implicated with <italic>CCR1</italic> (rs71327024, rs71327057, rs34041956) and <italic>CCR5</italic> (rs35454877) regulation.</p><p>We next tested these four emVars in reporter assays in a lung cell line (A549-ACE2) capable of expressing ACE2, the receptor for <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>, and in the presence and absence of <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>. This allowed us to gain insight into how these emVars modulate target gene expression in a relevant COVID-19 cell type and infection state. Using this approach we whittled-down these emVars to three whose behavior changes in response to infection. Two emVars, emVar rs34041956 and emVar rs71327024, exhibited expression modulation between introgressed and non-introgressed variants in response to infection by the virus. While rs34041956 showed a very modest effect size, the introgressed allele at rs71327024 drove 1.12 times more expression of GFP driven by the <italic>CCR1</italic> promoter than the non-introgressed allele. Given that a consistent molecular symptom of severe COVID-19 response is elevated cytokine levels, particularly elevated <italic>CCR1</italic>, this variant is a prime causal variant for the association between this genetic haplotype and severe COVID-19.</p><p>Strikingly, one emVar, rs35454877 which had exhibited the strongest expression modulation in the absence of the virus, did not show allelic modulation upon infection. During infection, the introgressed allele at rs35454877 showed markedly reduced <italic>CCR5</italic> promoter driven reporter expression relative to the non-infection condition. Although this allele does not show modulation during infection, the 1.7x increase in GFP expression with a <italic>CCR5</italic> promoter that this allele drives in the non-infected state may translate to a baseline higher level of <italic>CCR5</italic> in individuals with this allele. Upon infection, the enhancer with the introgressed allele was severely down-regulated, to the level of the non-introgressed allele. Although the transcriptional down-regulation occurs during infection, these individuals still will likely have an elevated level of the CCR5 receptor protein at least initially, which may increase their risk of a hyperactive cytokine response. The down-regulation is possibly an attempt to reduce this risk, but it may not act quickly enough. This resting state difference in CCR5 protein levels should be explored as a potential predictor of COVID-19 infection severity.</p><p>We caution that while our experimental design was optimized for detecting <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs variants effects and within a multi-potent immune-related cancer cell line, other longer range interactions between genomic regions and in other cell types may also be mediating severe COVID-19 response. For example, when comparing the response genes of the two identified <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs in the introgressed haplotype to RNA-seq studies testing COVID-19 infection in lung cell lines and tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>), 5 (45%) and 14 (41.2%) of the response genes for the two <italic>trans</italic>-eQTLs in this locus rs13063635 and rs13098911, respectively, were detected as differentially expressed in at least one in vitro experiment, although neither of these variants were detected as emVars in this MPRA. We also stress that our <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> viral transfection reporter experiments represent only one clinically relevant context and that other emVars whose activity does increase upon infection may also be relevant. Therefore, we also urge additional functional studies to consider the effects of these <italic>trans-</italic>eQTLs and, in general, to replicate our findings on <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLS in other lung epithelial and other cell types from which some of the expression evidence we here build on are derived.</p><p>While our study provides strong experimental support for at least four archaic variants, and notably strong functional support for three variants (rs34041956, rs71327024, rs35454877) in the presence of viral transfection, at the introgressed locus, a deeper understanding of the regulatory architecture and the direction of the effect of these alleles in both the healthy and infected state and across different cell types needs further clarification. For example, in the severe COVID-19 phenotype, <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic> are upregulated relative to their expression levels in moderate cases of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2020</xref>) and we saw evidence of upreglation by introgressed alleles in our mock infection experiment as well. However, in our MPRA experiments in K562 cells the three top candidate emVars acting as regulators of <italic>CCR1</italic> all showed down-regulation. Furthermore, alleles in Block A of the introgressed haplotype, which exhibit the strongest GWAS associations with COVID-19 severity, all act as down-regulating eQTLs for <italic>CCR1</italic> in healthy whole blood samples. We hypothesize that this difference between the direction of effect of the alleles in healthy whole blood in vivo and K562 reporter assay in vitro episomal condition relative to in the A549-ACE2 disease state, reflects both differential regulation of these genes in different cell types and upon infection, and possibly that these alleles contribute to the risk of severe COVID-19 by destabilizing the regulatory mechanism of <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5,</italic> such that they have decreased expression in some cell types and conditions, but are hyper-expressed in others. Additional work needs to be done to further explore this potential mechanism as well as to uncover the molecular factors instrumental to it. Indeed, although hypothesizing a role for transcription factors IKZF1 or CEBPB (possibly interacting with another SNP at the locus), our TF binding site analysis could not identify a potential binding-altering mechanism for these variants.</p><p>In light of the efforts of multiple groups devoted to narrowing down the genes mediating the COVID-19 severity association, we conclude that several genes at this locus on chromosome 3, including <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>, display promising evidence for having a role in the underlying biological mechanisms. The involvement of most of them in the chemokine signaling pathway, and the evidence of coregulation provided by eQTL, epigenetic, and expression analyses, bring support to the hypothesis that the COVID-19 response is modulated in a concerted way.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Introgression scans</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Sprime</title><p>We downloaded the Sprime software from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/sprime.jar">https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/sprime.jar</ext-link> and ran it using java-v1.8.0_40.

We then used DESeq2 to model the normalized read counts for each oligo as a negative binomial distribution (NB). DESeq2 then estimates the variance for each NB by pooling all oligo counts across all the samples and modeling the relationship between oligo counts and the observed dispersion across all the data. It then estimates the dispersion for each individual oligo by taking this observed relationship across all the data as a prior to performing a maximum posteriori estimate of the dispersion for each oligo. Therefore, the bias for the dispersion estimate for each oligo is greatly reduced because it relies on pooled information from all other oligos. We then used DESeq2 to estimate whether an oligo sequence had an effect on transcription by calculating the log fold change (LFC) between the oligo count in the cDNA replicates compared with its count in the plasmid pool. We tested whether this LFC constituted a significant difference of expression using Wald’s test and required a stringent Bonferroni corrected p-value of less than 0.01 for a significant result. If an oligo sequence had a significant LFC with either allele, the sequence is considered ‘“active’. Finally, to determine which variants are expression modulating, for oligos which were determined to be active, we used DESeq2 to calculate the fold change between the two versions of the oligo sequences with Wald’s test to calculate the p-values. p-values were then corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg test to correct for multiple hypothesis testing.

The eight custom plasmids referred to as A-I in the subsequent <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> virus infection experiments are listed as below: promoter of the target gene is given first, followed by the four SNP rsID and if the oligonucleotide is introgressed or not. A: CCR1_ rs71327024_non-introgressed; B: CCR1_ rs71327024_introgressed; C: CCR1_ rs71327057_non-introgressed; D: CCR1_ rs71327057_introgressed; E: CCR1_ rs34041956_non-introgressed; F:CCR1_ rs34041956_introgressed; G: CCR5_ rs35454877_non-introgressed; H: CCR5_ rs35454877_introgressed; I: control plasmid (phMGFP vector).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Cell culture and <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> virus infection</title><p>A549-ACE2 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma derived cells overexpressing ACE2) were generated by transducing A549 cells (ATCC) with lentiviruses carrying the ACE2 coding sequence. Lentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of HEK293T/17 cells with a transfer plasmid encoding ACE2 (Addgene #154981), the lentiviral packaging plasmid psPAX2 (Addgene #12260) and an envelope plasmid encoding VSV-G (Addgene #8454). Following transduction and selection with 10 µg/mL blasticidin, bulk cell populations were diluted to single cells by limiting dilution, and single-cell clonal populations were expanded. For this study, we used the clonal population A549-ACE2 B9. A549-ACE2 cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12K (Kaighn’s) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µg/ml blasticidin (Gibco), and Penicillin/Streptomycin (Pen/Strep; VWR). For <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> infections, 1.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/well were seeded in a 12-well plate for 24 hr. After 24 hr, cells were transfected with 200 ng of plasmids A-I (see above) for 24 hr, followed by mock infection or infection with ancestral <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> (VIDO-01 isolate) for 24 hr. After 24 hr of infection, bulk RNA was extracted from mock infected and <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>-infected cells, followed by gene expression analyses using quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR). <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Regarding transfection controls, equal amounts of plasmid I (control plasmid, 200 ng) were transfected for both mock and <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>-infected cells. We noticed comparable amount of eGFP transcripts across all experimental conditions for plasmid I. This demonstrates that transfection efficiency did not vary significantly between experimental conditions in A549-ACE2 cells. Experiments, performed in triplicate with <italic>SARS-CoV-2,</italic> were performed in a BSL3 laboratory at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization, University of Saskatchewan following approved protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-11"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR)</title><p>Bulk cellular RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agree that the topic of the paper, identifying genetic features that contribute to covid-19 severity in a neanderthal introgressed region, is of general interest and the authors impressively combine various annotation and functional assessments of the variants. However, there are a range of concerns about the experimental and functional genomics evidence presented, leading to the conclusion that whether chemokine receptor expression is linked to the clinical phenotype remains unaddressed by the study. The majors concerns are:</p><p>(1) The first concern is the assumption that regulation of GFP expression under a minimal promoter correlates perfectly with regulation of CCR1 and CCR5 under their native promoter. The authors could simply address this in the text, but this will not address the underlying issue. Preferably, having narrowed their regions of interest down to 4 emVars, they would place these on a reporter construct with GFP under control of the CCR1 or CCR5 promoters (or a minimal section of these specific promoters) and repeat either their quantitative PCR analysis or, in this case, a fluorescence-based assay may suffice. This would greatly strengthen the argument that CCR1 and CCR5 are specifically regulated by these emVars. If they believe that an infectious context might change these results, they could conduct this reporter assay during viral infection using viruses that do not require BSL3 containment, or collaborate with a lab able to use SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>(2) The second issue is, as acknowledged by the authors, that the emVars they identify using computational approaches are downregulatory whereas CCR1 and CCR5 are upregulated during severe COVID-19. The authors included some speculation about how these regulatory regions might still be linked to upregulation of the chemokine receptors in a clinical context, but this closing section of the manuscript isn't very strong. The assay described above would be informative as to whether these emVars do in fact downregulate CCR1 and CCR5, and whether they do so during infection. As a further suggestion to address the discrepancy between clinical gene expression data and their MPRA data, the authors could perform the conventional reporter assay (such as luciferase assay) in epithelial or macrophage cell lines (not K562). At least they might want to test the four variants they highlighted in the manuscript.</p><p>(3) Enhancer activity should be defined in a relative manner, by comparing to the background activity of negative control sequences.</p><p>(4) The authors should propose the molecular mechanisms of the SNPs' function that underlie COVID19 severity. For example, the authors could perform TF motif search around the potential causative SNPs they found, see if the SNPs alter the TF motifs, and see if the alteration of the TF motifs can explain the eQTL effect direction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are, in my opinion, two primary weaknesses of the paper.

For each of the four emVars we have now cloned the introgressed or non-introgressed variant emVar oligo upstream of each specific targeted promoter (e.g., <italic>CCR1</italic> or <italic>CCR5</italic>), upstream of eGFP in the targeting vector. These have now been transfected into cells in both the presence as well as absence of <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> by our colleagues (Dr. Arinajay Banerjee et al.) who have BSL3 containment. In this context, we had tried a number of different cell lines including the original K562 cell line used in our MPRA and Single Locus Reporter Assay experiments. However, K562 cells were not capable of being infected by the virus even at extremely low titers. Other cell lines either had similar issues or were killed upon low titer viral infection. As a result, we switched to another cell line routinely used to study <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> and other SARs and MERs infections, and one relevant to COVID-19 disease phenotypes: human lung epithelial (A549) cells that were engineered to express the receptor of <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic>, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Upon performing the transfections of each emVar variant construct in the presence and absence of <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> infection, we were able to identify that three emVars continued to act as response variants as assessed using quantitative PCR (please see new Methods section with our updated experimental strategy for this section as well as new Supplementary File 1m with resulting construct details).

Consistent with several other MPRA papers, including the one from which our design was informed (Tewhey et al. 2016), we defined active enhancers based on the relative relation of each element’s cDNA/pDNA count rather than normalizing to the negative controls. The negative controls in this experiment were taken from a prior MPRA experiment we performed, however, the activity in this assay may be somewhat different because these elements were 270bp whereas in the prior experiment they were only 170bp. The inclusion of additional 100bp of potential regulatory sequence may affect the overall regulatory activity, therefore making these elements less than ideal for normalization of the experimental set as we cannot fully confidently discount their activity. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> we have provided the violin plots as requested. The dashed horizontal lines in the plot show the minimum positive and negative expression changes ascribed to active enhancers as we defined them. As you can see almost all the negative controls have a much smaller effect, with the exception of 3 outlier sequences that were denoted as active in our analysis. We attribute the activity of these negative controls to the addition of the 100bp sequence that was not included in the original assay in which we tested these sequences. Furthermore, the rightmost violin shows the LFC for sequences with significant skew – our 20 emVar sequences which we flagged for further analysis. Again they all have higher LFC than vast majority of negative control sequences. Furthermore, as our paper now integrates follow up experimental analysis on the emVars that we considered the most likely candidates based on the MPRA and subsequent analysis, and we are therefore not only relying on these MPRA analyses, we have an additional avenue of experimental support for the variants that we highlight, reducing the impact of these particular calculations.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-71235-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Do these &quot;active enhancers&quot; significantly overlap with enhancer epigenetic marks (chromHMM enhancers, DHS, and worth including H3K27ac).
