Their central role is to provide energy to the cell in the form of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of four complexes (I–IV), which transfer electrons from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen. A part of the energy gained in electron transfer is used to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The resulting proton gradient is utilized by the mitochondrial ATP synthase to generate ATP. The respiratory chain complexes reside mostly, if not entirely, in the mitochondrial cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kühlbrandt, 2015</xref>), which are deep invaginations of the inner membrane into the matrix.</p><p>NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as complex I, is the largest assembly in the electron transfer chain. Mammalian complex I comprises 44 different subunits, including two copies of subunit SDAP, and therefore consists of a total of 45 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinothkumar et al., 2014</xref>). The 14 core subunits are conserved from prokaryotes to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walker, 1992</xref>). The characteristic L-shape of complex I arises from the association of three different units. The dehydrogenase and hydrogenase-like units constitute the matrix arm and are responsible for the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sazanov and Hinchliffe, 2006</xref>). As a third unit, the membrane-embedded transporter assembly pumps four protons from the matrix to the cristae lumen per catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galkin and Terenetskaya, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leif et al., 1995</xref>). Succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, or complex II, is the only complex in the electron transfer chain that does not translocate protons, but merely feeds electrons into the process. The cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex (complex III) is a symmetrical dimer, with cytochrome <italic>b</italic>, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> as core subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang and Trumpower, 1986</xref>). The Rieske subunit extends across both monomers, stabilizing the dimer that is essential for function. In mammals, complex III contains a total of 11 subunits per monomer, of which eight are supernumerary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schägger et al., 1986</xref>). Complex III transfers electrons from ubiquinone to cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, a small soluble electron carrier protein in the cristae lumen. Finally, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, also known as complex IV, transfers electrons from cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Mammalian complex IV has three core subunits (COX1, COX2 and COX3) and 14 subunits in total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balsa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kadenbach et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>The structural organization of the complexes that carry out oxidative phosphorylation in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been subject to numerous investigations. For many years it was assumed that the respiratory chain complexes exist as separate units in the fluid lipid bilayer of the inner membrane and interact by random collision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackenbrock et al., 1986</xref>). The discovery of supercomplexes by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) after solubilization with mild detergents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>) gave rise to the plasticity model, which postulates that respiratory complexes can exist both free in the membrane and as larger supramolecular entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acin-Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Aurelio et al., 2006</xref>). Since then, several stoichiometric supercomplexes have been identified, amongst which the respirasome (supercomplex I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub>) is the most prominent. The respirasome contains all components required to transfer electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schägger and Pfeiffer, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The possible functional and structural roles of supercomplexes have been hotly debated. At the functional level, advantages due to partitioning of the quinol pool and substrate channeling have been postulated and are supported by several independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>). Other results are inconsistent with a partitioning of the quinol pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaza et al., 2014</xref>). A reduction in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated as side products of electron transfer reactions in the respiratory chain has also been suggested as a possible role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maranzana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seelert et al., 2009</xref>). From the point of view of protein structure, supercomplexes have been proposed to confer stability to complex I or assist in its assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marques et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schägger et al., 2004</xref>). In line with this, a model for the generation of supercomplexes was proposed, where the assembly of catalytic subunits of the complex I NADH:dehydrogenase module occurs at a late stage to activate the supercomplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</xref>). However, recent complexome profiling studies failed to detect supercomplexes containing immature complex I, suggesting that the respirasome forms by association of fully assembled component complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guerrero-Castillo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Several mitochondrial disorders are associated with impaired respirasome formation. Genetic mutations that impair the assembly of complex III result in a loss of complex I and combined complex III/I defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamantea et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schägger et al., 2004</xref>). Complex IV deficiencies associated with a reduction of complex I levels in mouse and human cells have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Aurelio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vempati et al., 2009</xref>). The secondary loss of complex I upon impaired expression of complexes III and IV has been taken to mean that complex I stability depends on physical interaction with other complexes in the respiratory chain, since pharmacological inhibition was not sufficient to reduce complex I levels to the same extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies suggest however that low levels of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (as well as cytochrome <italic>c</italic>) result in an accumulation of reduced quinone, which would trigger reverse electron transfer (RET) and generation of superoxide by complex I. This could result in oxidative damage and complex I degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guaras et al., 2016</xref>). When ROS production by RET was inhibited, complex I levels were restored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guaras et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Structures of the isolated respirasome at estimated resolutions of 20–30 Å have been obtained by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schäfer et al., 2007</xref>), single-particle cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Althoff et al., 2011</xref>) and electron cryo-tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudkina et al., 2011</xref>). However, the map resolution was insufficient to fit the component complexes precisely, or to detect new functionally relevant features. Moreover, the recently published high-resolution cryo-EM structures of bovine complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vinothkumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) contribute to a comprehensive view of the respirasome. Here, we report a cryo-EM map of the supercomplex I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> from bovine heart mitochondria at 9 Å resolution. We show specific protein-protein contacts between the three respiratory chain complexes within the respirasome. Our structure reveals a functionally asymmetric complex III, in which one monomer preferentially catalyzes the reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> in a defined supramolecular organization of the electron transport chain.</p><p>Two cryo-EM studies of the respirasome from ovine and porcine heart mitochondria have been published since this manuscript was submitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Letts et al., 2016b</xref>). Both are at significantly higher resolution than our structure, but neither of them observe the functional asymmetry of complex III, which we regard to be the most important functional insight from the respirasome structure.

While these classes might reflect a partial loss of this module during purification or cryo-EM grid preparation, we cannot rule out the possibility that they represent biologically relevant assembly, disassembly or recycling intermediates of the respirasome. A recent study of respirasome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</xref>) has suggested that supercomplexes form by association of individual subunits of the respiratory complexes or their intermediate assemblies, rather than from the fully assembled respiratory chain complexes. The incorporation of the NADH:dehydrogenase module of complex I has been presented as the final step in the assembly process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreno-Lastres et al., 2012</xref>).

These observations are in agreement with our 8.1 Å global average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>), in which the density for the 51 kDa subunit is weak and could explain why the NADH:dehydrogenase module is absent in several of the 3D class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The iron-sulfur domain is the active part of the Rieske protein subunit of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> complex that carries electrons from the Q<sub>P</sub> site via its iron-sulfur cluster to heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>, where they are picked up by the small, soluble cytochrome <italic>c</italic> protein for transfer to complex IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kühlbrandt, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the iron-sulfur domain that bridges the gap in the electron transfer path between the hemes of one complex III monomer belongs to the Rieske protein of the opposite monomer. In order to transfer electrons to <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>, the iron-sulfur domain has to move on a hinge by 10–15 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwata et al., 1998</xref>).

The fact that one of the two iron-sulfur domains in the supercomplex is resolved means that one of the two complex III monomers is inactive. The inactive monomer is the one in contact with the well-defined iron-sulfur domain. This monomer is exposed to the lipid bilayer on most of its periphery, except for the hydrophobic surface area that is involved in complex III dimer formation.

Therefore, in bacteria only one half of the <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> dimer is required for electron transfer, and this most likely holds true for the mitochondrial complex as well. In the bacterial complex, the choice of the active monomer is thought to be random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Covian and Trumpower, 2008</xref>), whereas in the respirasome, the active monomer is clearly the one in the centre of the supercomplex. At present we do not know what constrains the movement of one of the two iron sulfur domains in the supercomplex. Either electrostatic or steric effects in the asymmetrical environment of the respirasome may be responsible. In an unconstrained complex III dimer, both iron-sulfur domains should be mobile, and hence invisible in the map.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Electron and substrate transfer</title><p>Under normal turnover conditions, the two monomers of complex III are not active simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellani et al., 2010</xref>). A model for electron transfer within complex III has been proposed, in which the activation of either monomer is random and both monomers switch between active and inactive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Covian and Trumpower, 2008</xref>). This model implies that the two branches for electron transfer in complex III are equivalent and, in particular, both iron-sulfur domains will move between their <italic>b</italic> and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwata et al., 1998</xref>) for reduction of heme <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> and, subsequently, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>.</p><p>In the various crystal structures of complex III, the iron-sulfur domains occupy different positions, either as a result of crystal contacts or, more significantly, in response to the occupancy of the Q<sub>P</sub> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2013</xref>). In single particle cryo-EM conformational changes are not subject to such contacts. Therefore, in the absence of inhibitors, and in light of the known mechanism of electron transfer, a cryo-EM map of complex III should reveal two equally unresolved iron-sulfur domains, as a result of averaging particles in different states. In our map, only one iron-sulfur domain is unresolved, and hence active. The observed asymmetry is thus incompatible with an alternating activation of the two complex III monomers and implies that each monomer has a different function. Our data suggest that in the respirasome, the central monomer of complex III preferentially catalyzes quinol oxidation. As electrons can equilibrate rapidly between the two <italic>b</italic><sub>L</sub> hemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castellani et al., 2010</xref>), quinone reduction may occur in either monomer, although it is possible that the distal monomer has no function, except as a scaffold.</p><p>In the respirasome, the quinol oxidation site of the active complex III monomer faces the site on complex I where the reduced quinol is released. The shortest distance between the two sites is about 11 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The quinol oxidation site of the inactive monomer is on the far side of the dimer, at a distance of at least 18 nm from the complex I site, assuming that the quinol cannot pass through the complex III dimer. A quinol diffusing through the lipid bilayer from complex I to complex III would thus encounter the active monomer first. The linear arrangement of complex I, the active complex III monomer and complex IV in the respirasome seems to be particularly favourable for efficient substrate and electron transfer. Significantly, only one of the complex III monomers is well-placed to accept reduced quinol from complex I, which may explain why only this monomer is active. Substrate channeling within the respirasome has been extensively debated. Results inconsistent with the existence of distinct quinone pools and substrate channeling have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaza et al., 2014</xref>), but substrate channeling between complexes I and III is supported by most studies of metabolic flux control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lapuente-Brun et al., 2013</xref>) and in recent reviews discussing the results of Blaza et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enríquez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lenaz et al., 2016</xref>). The asymmetry observed for complex III in our supercomplex structure is in agreement with these results and provides further support for electron transfer by substrate channeling in the respirasome.</p><p>While it is clear that all functional complex III in mitochondria is dimeric, it is not known at this stage what proportion of the complex III dimers is incorporated into respirasomes. The functional asymmetry of complex III and its iron-sulfur domains in the supercomplex provides strong evidence for a spatially organized flow of electrons and substrates in the respiratory chain from complex I to complex IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Turning off one of two electron transfer paths through complex III that are, in principle, equally likely might also offer a kinetic advantage in the electron transfer to complex IV via cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. The cytochrome <italic>c</italic> binding site on the active <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> monomer is about 10 Å closer to complex IV than that of the inactive monomer. Complex IV needs four electrons, and hence four cytochromes <italic>c,</italic> to produce one molecule of water. The proximity of the binding sites, which would minimize the time for each of the four cytochrome <italic>c</italic> transfer steps, may be an important advantage.</p><p>Our observation that in the respirasome only one of two possible electron transfer branches is active is reminiscent of the two near-symmetrical electron transfer chains in photosystem II, one of which has been turned off in the course of evolution to avoid wasteful electron transfer to two identical quinol electron acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nelson and Yocum, 2006</xref>). In some ways, oxygen reduction in complex IV is the reverse of the water oxidation reaction in photosystem II, and it might be equally important in both cases to control the flow of four electrons into, or away from, the reaction site by turning off one of two possible transfer paths.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Supercomplex assembly, complex I stability and human health</title><p>It is widely known that dysfunctional electron transfer complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain cause severe and, at present, incurable genetic disorders. Many of these conditions can be traced to point mutations in subunits of mitochondrial complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodenburg, 2016</xref>) or III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meunier et al., 2013</xref>). Many mutations result in reduced levels or activities of either complex I or III in mitochondrial membranes. However, point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruno et al., 2003</xref>) or truncation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamantea et al., 2002</xref>) of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome <italic>b</italic> subunit of complex III that cause progressive exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis in human patients were found to not only reduce the levels of complex III but also that of complex I. Biochemical studies of similar mutants established that the depletion of complex III levels in the membrane results in a secondary loss of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schägger et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, stable expression of complex I in the absence of complex III has been demonstrated through direct or indirect inhibition of ROS production by RET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guaras et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of cytochrome <italic>bc</italic><sub>1</sub> activity however was insufficient to induce complete degradation of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acin-Perez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guaras et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that physical interaction between the complexes has an at least partially stabilizing effect. These findings point to a central role of the respirasome in complex I stability.</p><p>The nuclear-encoded, supernumerary complex I subunit B14.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) evidently has a major part in the formation and stability of the respirasome. A point mutation in this subunit is associated with complex I deficiency in patients with fatal infantile lactic acidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2008</xref>), and a disruption of the gene of the homologous protein in the fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> results in incomplete assembly of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nehls et al., 1992</xref>). At present it is not known whether these mutations affect the assembly of the respirasome, but on the basis of our structure it seems more than likely.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mammalian respirasome structures</title><p>While this manuscript was under review, two other cryo-EM structures of mammalian respirasomes were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Letts et al., 2016b</xref>). These studies used mitochondria from porcine or ovine, rather than bovine, heart. The ovine complex I has been described as being particularly stable and suitable for structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Letts et al., 2016a</xref>) and the same most likely holds true for supercomplexes. At resolutions of 5–6 Å, both structures corroborate most of the protein-protein contacts we observe in the bovine complex. Several additional subunits were found to participate in the stabilization of the supercomplex, which were not clearly visible at our map resolution. A detailed comparison is possible only for the ovine complex, since neither the map nor the coordinates of the porcine supercomplex have been released.</p><p>Of the two new studies, only one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Letts et al., 2016b</xref>) found a second significant respirasome conformation at an overall resolution of 6.7 Å. The two states are referred to as the tight and loose conformation. The tight conformation of the ovine complex is essentially identical to class 1 of the bovine respirasome, but the arrangement of component complexes in the loose state differs considerably from our class 2. In the bovine respirasome, complex III rotates by 25° relative to complex I, while the position of complex IV remains unchanged. In contrast, in the loose ovine respirasome, complex IV swings away from complex III. Complex III rotates in the same direction as in our class 2, but to a lesser extent. In both the bovine and the ovine respirasome, interactions between complex III and IV are disrupted in these minor classes. In the case of the ovine complex, the proportion of particles in the loose state was found to increase with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Letts et al., 2016b</xref>). This suggests that the loose state of the ovine respirasome and our class 2 of the bovine complex result from incipient denaturation during and after purification. The differences observed between these two classes most likely reflect different degrees of respirasome instability, which may be species-specific, or due to differences in supercomplex purification.</p><p>Surprisingly, the two iron-sulfur domains in the complex III dimer are both resolved in the porcine and ovine respirasome, whereas one of them is disordered in our structure of the bovine complex. Therefore neither of the two other structures shows a mobile and therefore catalytically active Rieske protein, as we observe in the bovine respirasome. Letts et al propose that due to the close proximity between complex IV and the Rieske protein of the outer monomer of complex III, the iron-sulfur domain of the outer complex III monomer cannot undergo the conformational changes required for electron transfer. This is consistent with our findings, although neither structure shows any direct protein-protein contacts that would inhibit domain movements. Letts et al conclude that quinone oxidation is likely to take place in the central complex III monomer. This agrees with our model, which is however based on firm experimental evidence of an unresolved, and hence mobile, iron-sulfur domain. Letts et al also propose that quinone reduction in complex III should be catalyzed by the distal monomer; however the respirasome structures provide no evidence for this. Further studies should clarify the exact transfer path of electrons and quinol substrates through the mammalian respirasome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The 9 Å structure of the mammalian mitochondrial supercomplex shows a well-defined arrangement of the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV from the inner mitochondrial membrane.

Cryo-EM images were collected on a FEI Tecnai Polara operating at 300 kV aligned as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mills et al., 2013</xref>). The microscope was equipped with a Falcon III direct electron detector. Images were recorded manually at a nominal magnification of 59,000x yielding a pixel size at the specimen of 1.77 Å. The camera system recorded 32 frames/s. Videos were collected for 1.5 s with a total of 46 frames with a calibrated dose of about 1.5 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> per frame, at defocus values between −1.3 and −4.3 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image processing</title><p>A set of 3592 micrographs was collected. Whole-image drift correction of each movie was performed using the algorithm developed by Li (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Particles were picked manually using EMAN Boxer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ludtke et al., 1999</xref>), and the micrograph-based CTF was determined using CTFFIND3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mindell and Grigorieff, 2003</xref>) in the RELION 1.4 workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheres, 2012</xref>). The initial dataset contained 156,519 particle images (288 pixels x 288 pixels). Particles were subjected to two-dimensional reference-free classification in RELION 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Visual selection of particle classes with interpretable features resulted in a dataset of 137,606 particle images for the first 3D consensus refinement. The earlier low-resolution respirasome map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Althoff et al., 2011</xref>) was low-pass filtered to 60 Å and used as an initial model for the 3D refinement in RELION 1.4. Individual frames were B-factor weighted and movements of individual particles were reversed by movie frame correction in RELION 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheres, 2014</xref>). The resulting dataset of polished particles was used for 3D classification and the best 3D classes were selected for further processing. UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) was used for visualization of cryo-EM maps and docking of atomic models. Figures were drawn with UCSF Chimera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data deposition</title><p>The cryo-EM maps were deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank with accession code EMD-4107, EMD-4108 and EM-4109 for the cryo-EM maps of class 1, 2 and 3, respectively and the structure coordinates of the complexes fitted to class 1 were deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 5LUF.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Matteo Allegretti for help with cryo-EM data acquisition and image processing, and Natalie Bärland for help with particle picking.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Functional asymmetry and electron flow in the bovine respirasome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Stephen C. Harrison (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary and specific request:</p><p>This manuscript reports the structure of the bovine respirasome at 9 Å resolution. Its principal conclusion concerns a functional asymmetry: one of the iron-sulfur clusters is docked in such a way that electrons cannot be transferred, because the distance to the partner is too great. The authors conclude that one of the two is inactive. The structure is well determined at the stated resolution, but two structures at much higher resolution appeared after this manuscript was submitted. The reviewers request a revised manuscript that places the current conclusions in the context of those reports. In particular, the authors should address the likelihood of a different interpretation – some sort of alternating access model in which only one subunit can access the transfer site at a time, while the other docks in the observed, autoinhibited position. That is, the statement that the resolved Rieske center is immobile and therefore not functional is one possibility, but just because it has a fixed orientation in this structure of the inactive respirasome does not mean it cannot move in the active respirasome.</p><p>The following detailed comments may help with the revision.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>It is strange to show an FSC with phases randomized beyond 20 Å. Use of a phase randomized FSC to correct for effects from masking of maps is excellent, but the corrected FSC should be shown, not the phase randomized FSC.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>First paragraph: The entrance of electrons in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain is branched, therefore CI is the largest complex, but cannot be called the first, because other enzymes that deliver electrons to CoQ are equally first in their branch. Please correct.</p><p>First paragraph: It should be made clear that mammalian CI comprises 44 different subunits, one being duplicated. Quoting Carrol et al. 2002 could be misleading, since in this reference it was considered that CI comprises 45 different subunits. Latter it was demonstrated and generally accepted that NDUFA4 is not a CI subunit.

The historical origin of this proposal is as follows: in 2004 two groups independently proposed that CI stability was compromised in the absence of CIII (Acin-Perez et al., 2004 &amp; Schägger et al. 2004). Latter, the group of Carlos Moraes demonstrated that ablation of CIV or cyt <italic>c</italic>, also compromised the stability of CI (Diaz et al. 2006- Mol Cell Biol 26, 4872-4881 &amp; Vempati, et al. 2009. J. Biol. Chem. 284, 4383-4391). More recently it was demonstrated that CI can be assembled functionally in the absence of CIII, CIV or cyt <italic>c</italic> by recovering the re-oxidation of CoQ (Guarás, 2016. Cell Reports 15, 197-209). This series of reports led to the conclusion that assembly of the individual respiratory complexes can proceed independently and requires neither the presence of other complexes nor interaction with them. In line with this conclusion, kinetic analysis showed that the formation of complexes happened before the formation of supercomplexes (Acín-Peréz et al. 2008. Mol. Cell 32, 529-539). This result does not preclude, however, that incomplete CI or CIII could interact with other complexes and form supercomplexes, as reported by several groups (Marques, I., 2007. Eukaryotic Cell 6, 2391-2405). In 2012 it was proposed that the assembly of the NADH-DH module of CI require that formation of a non-functional respirasome between partially assembled CI with CIII and CIV (Moreno-Lastres et al. 2012. Cell Metab.15, 324-335). This proposal contradicted that of (Acín-Peréz et al. 2008. Mol. Cell 32, 529-539). A very recent reevaluation concluded that CI, CIII and CIV are fully assembled before they associate into supercomplexes, refuting the proposal by Moreno-Lastres (Guerrero-Castillo S, Baertling F, Kownatzki D., Wessels H.J., Arnold S., Brandt U. and Nijtmans L. 2016.

(subsection “Conformational and compositional variability”, last paragraph). The model of for the assembly of CI and SCs proposed by Moreno-Lastres has been questioned, however (see above). Moreover, two different groups proposed that CI damage occurred under natural conditions at the NADH:DH module, and that this can be replaced without the elimination of the rest of the complex (Lazarou, et al. 2007. Mol Cell Biol 27, 4228-4237. Dieteren, et al. 2012 J. Biol. Chem 287, 41851-41860). If so, the observed structures could also be consistent with the prediction of Lazarou and Dieteren and might have come from degradation rather than as assembly intermediates. The data in this manuscript cannot determine whether those structures are natural or artefactual and whether they might represent intermediates of synthesis or degradation. The reviewer's suggestion is to present either all the potential alternative explanations or to simply remove the discussion of the nature of this structures.

On the one hand, the authors propose that the respirasome has a particular defined structure that favors oxidization of quinol not only the by CIII incorporated into the respirasome but also by a defined monomer.

Its principal conclusion concerns a functional asymmetry: one of the iron-sulfur clusters is docked in such a way that electrons cannot be transferred, because the distance to the partner is too great. The authors conclude that one of the two is inactive. The structure is well determined at the stated resolution, but two structures at much higher resolution appeared after this manuscript was submitted. The reviewers request a revised manuscript that places the current conclusions in the context of those reports. In particular, the authors should address the likelihood of a different interpretation – some sort of alternating access model in which only one subunit can access the transfer site at a time, while the other docks in the observed, autoinhibited position. That is, the statement that the resolved Rieske center is immobile and therefore not functional is one possibility, but just because it has a fixed orientation in this structure of the inactive respirasome does not mean it cannot move in the active respirasome.</italic> </p><p>We have added a comparison with the ovine and porcine structures at the end of the Discussion. The main map classes are very similar and the assignment of interacting subunits is essentially the same in all three structures. There are differences between the minor map classes of the ovine and our bovine supercomplexes, which may be either species-specific or purification dependent. It is likely that these minor particle classes are due to destabilization of the respirasomes.</p><p>The possibility of an alternating activation of complex III monomers is now discussed.

In addition, we now discuss the model for direct exchange of CI subunits that suffer most from oxidative damage, which would obviate the need for de novo synthesis of the whole assembly (in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection), as proposed by Lazarou et al. (2007) and Dieteren et al. (2012).

A detailed comparison with the porcine map was unfortunately not possible since neither the map nor the model coordinates are available at this point. We would like to call your attention to the following points:</p><p>Inspection of the released coordinates for the tight conformation of the ovine respirasome reveal distances between subunit 9 and COX7A1 of 16 Å, which is longer than in our bovine complex and would be incompatible with the interaction that we propose. This could be due to differences of the species, preparation or resolution.</p><p>Re-examination of our map in the light of the other published structures revealed that subunit 10 of CIII comes to within 5 Å of the N terminus of COX7A1, and thus also contributes to CIII/CIV interactions.

(2016) is provided in the revised Discussion (last paragraph). The models agree on the participation of the central monomer from complex III in quinone oxidation, in our case based on the asymmetry of the iron-sulfur domains, in their case based on the proximity of the outer iron-sulfur domain to complex IV that might restrict its movement. Letts et al. further propose that quinone reduction should take place in the outer monomer. We do not find evidence in any of the structures that can support or contradict this hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
