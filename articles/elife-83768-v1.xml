To augment the standard-of-care chemotherapy, we examined the possibility of protein-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived proteomes and OS-elevated proteins. While a conditioned medium (CM), collected from MSCs, did not present tumor-suppressing ability, the activation of PKA converted MSCs into induced tumor-suppressing cells (iTSCs). In a mouse model, the direct and hydrogel-assisted administration of CM inhibited tumor-induced bone destruction, and its effect was additive with cisplatin. CM was enriched with proteins such as calreticulin, which acted as an extracellular tumor suppressor by interacting with CD47. Notably, the level of <italic>CALR</italic> transcripts was elevated in OS tissues, together with other tumor-suppressing proteins, including histone H4, and PCOLCE. PCOLCE acted as an extracellular tumor-suppressing protein by interacting with amyloid precursor protein, a prognostic OS marker with poor survival.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent form of bone sarcoma, usually occurring in the lower limb of teenagers and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Taran et al., 2017</xref>). The primary therapeutic regimen is surgery combined with adjuvant chemotherapy. While the standard-of-care MAP therapy using a combination of methotrexate (MTX), Adriamycin (aka doxorubicin [DOX]), and cisplatin (CIS) has significantly improved the survival rate, the metastatic or recurrent OS remains difficult to treat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). To explore targeted therapies, prognostic markers in Wnt, PI3K, RANKL, and Notch pathways have been searched in OS pathobiology. However, few targetable mutations have been identified and the efficacy of immunotherapy is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we examined the possible conversion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into induced tumor-suppressing cells (iTSCs). Paradoxically, the generation of iTSCs requires the activation of tumorigenic signaling. For instance, we have reported that the overexpression of Î²-catenin in canonical Wnt signaling and the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling can produce iTSCs and tumor-suppressive conditioned medium (CM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). To develop a novel option for OS treatment, we examined the generation of MSC-driven iTSCs by activating protein kinase A (PKA) signaling.</p><p>T lymphocytes have been frequently employed for immunotherapy because of their immunomodulatory properties as well as their availability in the peripheral blood of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we employed bone marrow-derived MSCs and occasionally adipose tissue-derived MSCs since MSCs are implantable stem cells that generate osteoblasts and osteocytes. In this study, the activation of three signaling pathways was evaluated, including Wnt, PI3K, and PKA pathways. PKA activation in MSCs was selected since it generated stronger anti-tumor effects than the activation of Wnt or PI3K. PKA is known as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which is triggered by cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Walsh and Van Patten, 1994</xref>). Using a mouse model of OS in the proximal tibia, we examined the efficacy of CM with and without the administration of CIS. CM was given as a daily intravenous injection or a weekly hydrogel-based administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previous iTSC studies have revealed that the activation of tumorigenic signaling elevates the levels of extracellular tumor-suppressing proteins, including calreticulin (CALR), enolase 1 (ENO1), heat shock protein 90ab1 (HSP), moesin (MSN), and ubiquitin C (UBC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun et al., 2022b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2022b</xref>). Importantly, the listed proteins are reported as tumorigenic in many types of cancers, and their pro-tumor actions inside the cells are reversed to the anti-tumor actions in the extracellular domain. To our surprise, the transcript levels of these tumor-suppressing proteins are significantly elevated in sarcoma tissues in the TCGA database. This observation led us to address an intriguing question as to whether the products of transcripts, which are highly expressed in OS tissues, may act as tumor-suppressing proteins in the extracellular domain.</p><p>As for the anti-tumor regulatory mechanism, we focused on CALR and procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer (PCOLCE). CALR was enriched in iTSC CM as a chaperone protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, but it can be located in the cell surface and extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gold et al., 2010</xref>). PCOLCE, an enzyme that cleaves type I procollagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Steiglitz et al., 2006</xref>), was selected because of the elevated level of its transcripts in OS tissues. We have shown that CALR interacts with CD47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2022a</xref>), an integrin-associated transmembrane protein, which stimulates the escape of cancer cells from immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sick et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, both CALR and PCOLCE are reported to interact with amyloid precursor protein (APP) in IntAct molecular interaction database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Orchard et al., 2014</xref>). According to the TCGA database, the elevated level of APP transcripts of patients with sarcoma is a poor prognostic marker. Collectively, this study demonstrates a novel role of the CALR/PCOLCE-APP axis in OS progression and suggests APP as an OS-specific druggable target.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Suppression of the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells by MSC CM</title><p>We first evaluated the efficacy of three pharmacological agents for inducing the tumor-suppressing capability of bone marrow-derived MSC-driven CM. Three agents were BML284, YS49, and CW008, which were known activators of Wnt, PI3K, and PKA signaling pathways, respectively. The MTT-based cell viability of three human OS cell lines (MG63, U2OS, TT2 PDX) was not altered by the control MSC CM without any agent treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, BML284 (BML), YS49, and CW008 (CW) converted CM into the tumor-suppressing agent. Except for MG63 cells with BML284-treated MSC CM, all CM reduced MTT-based viability in three OS cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As a procollagen processing enzyme, PCOLCE is involved in the development of collagenous tissues, and its upregulation may induce an increase in collagen deposition and pathogenic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kessler and Hassoun, 2019</xref>). It thus plays a role in the transformation of the tumor microenvironment. Its marked elevation in OS tissues is reported to promote lung metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and it is also upregulated in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>). APP is an integral membrane protein, expressed mostly in neuronal tissues. It is a precursor of amyloid beta that contributes to producing amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimerâs disease patients. APP is also reported as one of the diagnostic biomarkers for OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang and Yang, 2018</xref>), and its high expression reduces the survival of OS patients but not pan-cancer patients. Taken together, APP can be a druggable target, selective to OS, and PCOLCE is one of its biological blockers.</p><p>In the CALR-CD47 regulatory axis, the results in this study revealed that extracellular CALR inhibited CD47âs tumorigenic actions. CALR is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding endoplasmic reticulum protein and is also detected on the cell surface as well as in extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arosa et al., 1999</xref>), and CD47 is an integrin-associated transmembrane protein. Although the role of CALR is reported context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fucikova et al., 2021</xref>), it in general oppositely mediates phagocytosis. A pro-phagocytic signal of CALR is counteracted by CD47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>), and blockage of CD47 is reported to induce in vivo tumor elimination by stimulating phagocytosis of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chao et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, the inhibition of CD47 is reported to block the progression of OS in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, the level of CALR was upregulated 4.1-fold in CW-MSC CM, and the level of CD47 was higher in three OS cell lines than MSCs and osteocytes.</p><p>Translationally, the application of CM for any cancer treatment is far from mainstream compared to chemotherapeutic drugs. Its potential advantage is its integrity as a therapeutic agent with thousands of protein species. Alternatively, the selection of potent tumor-suppressing proteins such as CALR, ENO1, PCOLCE, etc. can be another option to construct a protein cocktail. The cocktail proteins can be developed based on the transcriptome of OS tissues of individual patients. The advantage of the use of MSCs is their immune privilege, and allogenic MSCs may not elicit inflammatory responses, mainly due to their lack of class-II major histocompatibility complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankrum et al., 2014</xref>). We mainly used bone marrow-derived MSCs in this study, but adipose tissue-derived MSCs were also able to generate iTSCs and tumor-suppressive CM.</p><p>In this study, we presented the marked anti-OS action of PKA-activated MSC CM and CALR, as well as CMâs compatibility with CIS in a mouse model of OS. Although MSC CM contains other biomolecules such as nucleic acids, small metabolites, lipids, etc., we focused herein on proteomes since the treatment with nucleases, a removal of exosomes by ultracentrifugation, and filtering with 3 kD cutoff did not significantly alter CMâs anti-tumor action. Also, we mainly employed CW008 and activated PKA signaling, but CW008 is known to promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) which may indirectly affect the composition of MSC CM. Lastly, the most frequent site of OS-associated metastasis is the lung. We have previously shown that the administration of PI3K-activated MSC-derived CM suppressed breast cancer-associated lung metastasis using a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2022a</xref>). Besides the inhibition of the primary bone tumor, it is recommended to evaluate CMâs inhibitory action for the metastasized tumor in the lung.</p><p>The study disclosed an uncommon use of OS-elevated transcripts as a candidate for producing OS-inhibiting proteins. In addition to tumor-suppressing proteins that were enriched in CW-MSC CM such as CALR, we identified PCOLCE as a novel tumor-suppressing protein and proposed a regulatory axis of PCOLCE-APP for the treatment of OS. In summary, we demonstrated that bone marrow-derived MSCs can be converted into iTSCs and their proteomes can be used to protect the bone, in a combinatorial application with CIS. The therapeutic CM was also given locally to the tibia using a PADO hydrogel-based delivery system. The PADO hydrogels were injectable, cured in situ, and degraded within 1 week in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). We envision that the described approach can be used to identify cell-surface receptors as druggable targets that mediate CMâs anti-tumor action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and agents</title><p>MG63 and U2OS human OS cell lines (#86051601-1VL and #92022711-1VL, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), and a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) TT2-77 xenoline were grown in DMEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pandya et al., 2020</xref>).

earliest identified bone cancer that can spread to other tissues. In this study, the authors have used novel approaches to identify calreticulin and procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer (PCOLCE) as osteosarcoma tumor suppressor proteins that inhibit osteosarcoma growth both in animal and in vitro cell culture models. These important findings may provide a basis for the future development of more efficient targeted therapies for the treatment of osteosarcomas.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83768.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Mohan</surname><given-names>Subburaman</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03z6z3n38</institution-id><institution>VA Loma Linda Healthcare System</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Haibo</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0431mgz06</institution-id><institution>Southern California Institute for Research and Education</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.18.512687">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.18.512687v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.

The metadata in panel F suggests high expression of Calr coupled with low expression of CD47 improves survival for patients with all types of cancer. The only data the authors present to evaluate whether the levels of CD47 affect its interaction with Calreticulin are shown on panel E, but in U2OS cells, low levels of CD47 prevent Calreticulin's tumor suppressor function. Since this suggests that the Calr-CD47 interaction differs between osteosarcoma cells and &quot;all cancer&quot; it would help if this were mentioned more explicitly in the manuscript.
