One of the key players in the progression of cirrhosis to HCC is the hepatic stellate cell, which is activated during liver damage and differentiates towards a contractile myofibroblast-like cell that deposits extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), such as collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coulouarn and Clément, 2014</xref>). Activated stellate cells can induce phenotypic changes in cancer cells through the production of growth factors and cytokines that stimulate tumor cell proliferation and induce a pro-metastatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Malignant hepatocytes secrete high levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), which can contribute to the activation of stellate cells in the nearby stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giannelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nitta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dooley et al., 2009</xref>). These activated stellate cells are then responsible for the deposition of ECM. Several of the ECM-components such as proteoglycans, collagens, laminin, and fibronectin interact with tumor cells and cells in the stroma, which can directly promote cellular transformation and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2016</xref>). The ECM can also act as a reservoir for growth factors and cytokines, which can be rapidly released to support the tumor's needs. In addition, activated stellate cells contribute to a highly vascularized tumor micro-environment, by secreting pro-angiogenic molecules and by recruiting pro-angiogenic (and pro-tumoral) myeloid and lymphoid derived cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). By constricting the hepatic microvasculature, they also cause hypoxia, which contributes to the angiogenic switch and can induce a more aggressive tumor phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taura et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that tumor cells actively secrete growth factors (such as TGFβ) to induce activation and migration of stellate cells, which creates a fibrotic environment that further supports and enhances tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coulouarn and Clément, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caja et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Since activated stellate cells play an essential role in the onset and progression of HCC, blocking their activation has been proposed as a potential therapy for patients with HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carloni et al., 2014</xref>). One strategy to prevent stellate cell activation, is by blocking the IRE1α-pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindryckx et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The UPR serves to cope with the accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an attempt to restore protein folding, increase ER-biosynthetic machinery and maintain cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schröder and Kaufman, 2005</xref>). It can exert a cytoprotective effect by re-establishing cellular homeostasis, while apoptotic signaling pathways will be activated in case of severe and/or prolonged ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lam et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of misfolded proteins is sensed via three transmembrane proteins in the ER: inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA-like ER-kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2018</xref>). The development of solid tumors is characterized by uncontrolled growth and proliferation of malignant cells, resulting in a compact mass of cells and a hypoxic tumor micro-environment, two conditions that are well-characterized ER-stress inducers. Therefore, it is not surprising that activation of the UPR represents a major hallmark of several solid tumors, such as breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liang et al., 2018</xref>), colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2017b</xref>), and HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vandewynckel et al., 2013</xref>). The induction of the UPR in cancer cells may serve as a double-edged sword, which can aid tumor progression as well as prevent tumor growth in a context-dependent manner. Persistent ER-stress can activate pathways that induce cell death, effectively eliminating cells with a potential to become malignant. On the other hand, tumor cells may hijack the ER-stress pathways to provide survival signals required for uncontrolled growth and eventually avoid apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of the UPR has also been shown to affect different fibrotic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heindryckx and Li, 2018</xref>), including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kwanten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dasgupta et al., 2020</xref>), hepatitis-B-induced carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017a</xref>), and biliary cirrhosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>). We have previously shown that inhibiting the IRE1α-branch of the UPR-pathway using 4μ8C, blocks TGFβ-induced activation of fibroblasts and stellate cells in vitro and reduces liver fibrosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindryckx et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study, our aim was to define the role of IRE1α in the cross-talk between hepatic stellate cells and tumor cells in liver cancer. We show that pharmacologic inhibition of the IRE1α-signaling pathway decreases tumor burden in a chemically induced mouse model for HCC. Using several in vitro co-culturing methods, we identified that blocking IRE1α in hepatic stellate cells prevents their activation. This then decreases proliferation and migration of tumor cells in co-cultures, in addition to the direct effect of inhibiting IRE1α in tumor cells. Our results also indicate that there are cell-line-specific differences in how cells respond to IRE1α-inhibition, including differences in the IRE1α-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α reduces tumor burden in a chemically induced mouse model for HCC</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma was induced in mice by weekly injections with N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) for 25 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heindryckx et al., 2010</xref>). From week 10, IRE1α-endonuclease activity was pharmacologically inhibited with 4μ8C. Histological analysis of liver tissue confirmed the presence of liver tumors in a fibrotic background at 25 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Treatment with 4μ8C significantly reduced tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as measured on H and E-stained liver sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stellate cell activation and liver fibrosis was quantified by Sirius Red staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>) and immunohistochemical staining with αSMA-antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>) on liver sections. Mice with HCC had a significant increase in the percentage of collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and αSMA-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), compared to healthy mice. Treatment with 4μ8C restored collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and αSMA-levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) to healthy baseline levels. mRNA-expression levels of <italic>Pcna</italic> were determined on tumor nodules and surrounding non-tumor stromal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As expected, proliferation of cells was increased within the tumor itself, compared to the levels in healthy liver tissue and stromal tissue. Treatment with 4μ8C significantly decreased the levels of <italic>Pcna</italic>-mRNA expression within the tumor, suggesting a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. A proteomics array using the Olink Mouse Exploratory assay revealed that DEN-induced murine tumors had a significantly increased protein expression of 20 oncogenic proteins compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Treatment with 4μ8C also significantly reduced protein expression of two HCC promotors, PRDX5, and DDAH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibiting IRE1α reduces tumor burden in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of liver slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E), Sirius red and αSMA-antibodies.

compared to healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Western blot confirmed the increase of BIP-protein expression in DEN-induced livers, which was reduced after treatment with 4μ8C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The ratio of spliced to unspliced <italic>Xbp1</italic>-mRNA was significantly increased in the surrounding non-tumor tissue of DEN-induced mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Treatment with 4μ8C significantly reduced the ratio of spliced to unspliced <italic>Xbp1</italic>-mRNA in surrounding non-tumorous stromal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Western blot on whole tissue samples – containing both tumor and non-tumoral tissue – also confirmed a significant decrease of XBP1-splicing after treatment with 4μ8C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F and G</xref>). Immunohistochemical straining with XBP1-antibodies against the spliced variant further demonstrate that the expression of spliced XBP1 is mainly located in the peritumoral area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Spliced XBP1 was significantly increased in the DEN-induced liver tissue and treatment with 4μ8C restored these levels to a similar level as seen in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

At a higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), it also becomes clear that the expression of spliced XBP1 is not only cytoplasmic but some staining appears peri-nuclear and nuclear.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased expression of ER-stress markers in mice with HCC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mRNA expression of ER-stress markers <italic>Edem1, Ero1b, Grp94, Herp, Atf4, Eif2ak3, Ddit3</italic>, and <italic>Hspa5</italic> in liver tissue from healthy mice; and tumor tissue and surrounding non-tumoral tissue from mice with DEN-induced HCC.

We and others have shown that ER-stress plays an important role in stellate cell activation and contributes to the progression of liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindryckx et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hernández-Gea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mao and Fan, 2015</xref>). The mechanisms by which the UPR promotes stellate cell activation have been attributed to regulating the expression of c-MYB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindryckx et al., 2016</xref>), increasing the expression of SMAD-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koo et al., 2016</xref>) and/or by triggering autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mao and Fan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we show that IRE1α plays an important role in stellate cell – tumor cell interactions and that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α-endoribonuclease activity slows down the progression of HCC in vivo. We demonstrate that tumor cells can induce the IRE1α-branch of the UPR in hepatic stellate cells, thereby contributing to their activation and creating an environment that is supportive for tumor growth and metastasis. By co-culturing stellate cells with tumor cells, we mainly observed an increase of the IRE1α-branch of the UPR; however, it is important to note that HepG2-cells also significantly induced mRNA-expression of <italic>EIF2AK3</italic>, while Huh7-cells seemed to induce <italic>DDIT3</italic> in the LX2-cells. These results indicate that ATF6α and PERK-pathways may also play an important role in the interaction between stellate cells and tumor cells. In our study, we also observe that overall levels of XBP1 (spliced and unspliced) were very low in the LX2 monocultures and LX2 + HepG2 co-cultures treated with 4μ8C. This is likely the result of low baseline levels of total XBP1 in these conditions. Several studies have shown that constitutive levels of total XBP1 can be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>) and that the levels of spliced and unspliced XBP1 can both increase during ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cassimeris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kishino et al., 2017</xref>). The conditions where we observe low levels of both unspliced and spliced XBP1 correspond to those where we expect to see low levels of IRE1α activation and thus possibly suggest that ER-stress increased the levels of total XBP1 in hepatic stellate cells. Another unexpected finding in our study is the predominant cytoplasmic localization of spliced XBP1 in liver tissue. Spliced XBP1 contains a nuclear localization signal and a transcriptional activation domain, which can activate the transcription of the UPR target genes. In our study, we do not observe a clear nuclear expression of spliced XBP1, which is in contrast to the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>, which shows that spliced XBP1 predominantly localizes in the nucleus of HeLa-cells exposed to acute ER-stress. This study also describes a mechanism whereby unspliced-XBP1 forms a complex with the spliced isoform, thereby exporting it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in subsequent degradation by the proteasome. However, this event has been described during the recovery phase of an acute ER-stress event. In our mouse model, we treated mice with a hepatocarcinogenic compound for 25 weeks, resulting in a chronic inflammation and a subsequent activation of IRE1α-dependent ER-stress pathways. It is therefore not unlikely that different cells in this model are experiencing different phases of ER-stress and recovery. At a higher magnification, it becomes clear that the expression of spliced XBP1 is not only cytoplasmic but some staining appears peri-nuclear and nuclear. This could represent different stages of ER-stress activation and recovery in different cell populations; however, more experiments would be needed to verify this hypothesis.</p><p>Our results show that TGFβ-secretion by tumor cells could be in part responsible for activating stellate cells and for inducing the IRE1α-branch of the UPR. However, this seems to depend on the cell lines used, as the effect was not seen in the LX2 and HepG2 co-cultures. In these co-cultures, an autocrine signaling mechanism may be playing a role in the LX2-cells and the HepG2 cells may even prevent this. One possible alternative mechanism is through CCN protein upregulation, as this has been shown to induce ER-stress and UPR-activation in both stellate cells and hepatocytes by in vitro and in vivo approaches. CCN proteins are ECM-associated secreted proteins which play a role in a with a wide array of important functions, such as wound healing and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Adenoviral CCN gene transfer and overexpression of CCN proteins have been shown to induce ER-stress-mediated stellate cell senescence and apoptosis in later stages of fibrosis, consequently contributing to fibrosis resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkham-Kamphorst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borkham-Kamphorst et al., 2018</xref>). While ER stress is known to play a key role in stellate cell activation and hepatocyte apoptosis during the fibrosis progression, inducing ER-stress-mediated apoptosis in activated stellate cells in advanced stages of fibrosis could be a relevant therapeutic strategy to attenuate liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkham-Kamphorst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borkham-Kamphorst et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Activated stellate cells are known to enhance migration and proliferation of tumor cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2016</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amann et al., 2009</xref>), by producing ECM-proteins and by secreting growth factors. Extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen can act as a scaffold for tumor cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2016</xref>), alter the expression of MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2016</xref>) and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Activated stellate cells are also an important source of hepatocyte growth factor, which promotes proliferation, cell invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the c-MET signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, blocking IRE1α in the stellate cell population reduced tumor-induced activation toward myofibroblasts, which then decreases proliferation and migration of tumor-cells in co-cultures. This suggests that targeting the microenvironment using an ER-stress inhibitor could be a promising strategy for patients with HCC.</p><p>The UPR has been described as an essential hallmark of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shuda et al., 2003</xref>), although its role within tumorigenesis remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vandewynckel et al., 2013</xref>). While a mild-to-moderate level of ER-stress leads to activation of the UPR and enables cancer cells to survive and adapt to adverse environmental conditions, the occurrence of severe or sustained ER-stress leads to apoptosis. Both ER-stress inhibitors and ER-stress inducers have therefore been shown to act as potential anti-cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corazzari et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2018</xref>, demonstrated that IRE1α promotes progression of HCC and that hepatocyte-specific ablation of IRE1α results in a decreased tumorigenesis. In contrast to their study, we found a greater upregulation of actors of the IRE1α-branch within the stroma than in the tumor itself and identified that expression of these IRE1α-markers was mainly localized within the stellate cell population. An important difference between both studies is the mouse model that was used. While Wu et al used a single injection of DEN, we performed weekly injections, causing tumors to occur in a background of fibrosis, similar to what is seen in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heindryckx et al., 2010</xref>). Our in vitro studies with mono-cultures confirm that 4μ8C and transfection with si-IRE1α also has a direct effect on proliferation, migration, and intracellular levels of ROS in HCC-cells – similar to the findings of Wu et al - and the response seems to depend on the tumor cell line. Adding 4μ8C to HepG2-cells significantly increased proliferation, while a significant decrease was seen in the Huh7-cells. This difference in response could be due IRE1α's function as a key cell fate regulator. On the one hand, IRE1α can induce mechanisms that restore protein homeostasis and promote cytoprotection, whereas on the other hand IRE1α also activates apoptotic signaling pathways. How and when IRE1α exerts its cytoprotective or its pro-apoptotic function remains largely unknown. The duration and severity of ER-stress seems to be a major contributor to the switch toward apoptosis, possibly by inducing changes in the conformational structure of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). The threshold at which cells experience a severe and prolonged ER-stress that would induce apoptosis could differ between different cell lines, depending on the translational capacity of the cells (e.g. ER-size, number of chaperones and the amount of degradation machinery) and the intrinsic sources that cause ER-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>). A study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2012</xref>, has specifically looked at how IRE1α regulates cell growth and apoptosis in HepG2-cells. Similar to our findings, they discovered that inhibiting IRE1α enhances cell proliferation, while over-expression of IRE1α increases the expression of polo-like kinase, which leads to apoptosis. Interestingly, polo-like kinases have divergent roles on HCC-cell growth depending on which cell line is used, which could explain the different response to 4μ8C in Huh7 and HepG2-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pellegrino et al., 2010</xref>). Studies on glioma cells show that IRE1α regulates invasion through MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auf et al., 2010</xref>). In line with these results, we also detected a reduction of <italic>MMP1</italic>-mRNA expression after 4μ8C-treatment and observed a direct effect on wound closure in HepG2-cells. These results indicate that IRE1α could play a direct role in regulating tumor cell invasion, in addition to its indirect effect via stellate cells. This is also in line with our findings that silencing IRE1α in the tumor cells affects tumor cell proliferation, although this effect seems to be cell line dependent.</p><p>Another possible mechanism that explains the cell line specific differences in response to inhibiting IRE1α, is through the generation of ROS. Studies have shown that IRE1α plays an important role in mediating ROS-generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuaita et al., 2015</xref>) and 4μ8C has been described as a potent ROS-scavenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). IRE1α generates ROS through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling between the IRE1α-InsP3R pathway in the ER and the redox-dependent apoptotic pathway in the mitochondrion, as well as via activation of CHOP, BIP and through XBP1-splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeeshan et al., 2016</xref>). In line with these findings, we found a significant reduction in intracellular ROS-levels after treatment with 4μ8C in LX2, HepG2 and Huh7-cells. Interestingly, a similar reduction in ROS-generation as in the 4μ8C-treated LX2-cells was seen after transfection of LX2-cells, while an increase of ROS-generation was noted in the transfected HepG2-cells. These results indicate that the reduction in ROS could partially be explained through the decreased activation of the IRE1α-pathway in the LX2-cells. However, how the IRE1α-pathway affects the generation of ROS, seems to be cell-type dependent, as we see different results in the different cell lines we tested. This is in line with previous studies, which also observed this cell line dependent effect on IRE1α-dependent ROS-generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeeshan et al., 2016</xref>). The HepG2 and Huh7-cell lines used in this study are known to have different sensitivities to doxorubicin, a property that has been ascribed to their differences in intracellular ROS-generation after treatment with this chemotherapeutic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubbelboer et al., 2019</xref>). Alterations in oxidative stress can affect cell proliferation, specifically in cancer cells and stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montiel-Duarte et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, ROS is one of the critical mediators of stellate cell activation and ECM-production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kong et al., 2019</xref>). Oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of HCC and treatment strategies aiming at controlling oxidative stress have shown promising pre-clinical results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takaki and Yamamoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Uchida et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, an IRE1α-mediated regulation of ROS-generation might be a contributing factor that explains our findings on stellate cell activation and tumor cell proliferation after inhibiting IRE1α with 4μ8C or transfection. However, more research is necessary to further elucidate the role of IRE1α in mediating ROS-generation in different cell types. In addition, since we see a potent decrease on ROS-levels after treatment with 4μ8C, even in the cells that were transfected with si- IRE1α, we cannot exclude that – at least part – of our results could be explained through the off-target effect of 4μ8C as a ROS-scavenger. Inhibiting oxidative stress has been shown to attenuate tumor progression in different pre-clinical models for HCC and ROS is a known contributor to the chronic liver disease and HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tien Kuo and Savaraj, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klieser et al., 2019</xref>). Further research is necessary to assess to which extent the ROS-scavenging effect in our study has influenced cancer progression.</p><p>In conclusion, the aim of this study was to define the role of IRE1α in the cross-talk between hepatic stellate cells and tumor cells in liver cancer. We show that pharmacologic inhibition of the IRE1α-signaling pathway decreases tumor burden in a DEN-induced mouse model for HCC. Using several in vitro 2D and 3D co-culturing methods, we show that tumor cells can induce the IRE1α-branch of the ER-stress pathways in hepatic stellate cells and that this contributes to their activation. Blocking IRE1α-in these hepatic stellate cells prevents their activation. This then contributes to a decreased proliferation and migration of tumor cells in co-cultures, in addition to the direct effect of inhibiting IRE1α in tumor cells. Our results indicate that there are cell-line-specific differences in the response to IRE1α-inhibition, including intercellular variations in how blocking IRE1α affects the generation of ROS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus)</italic></td><td>Sv129 mice</td><td>Taconic</td><td>129S6</td><td>HCC mouse model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heindryckx et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heindryckx et al., 2012</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HepG2</td><td>ATCC</td><td>HB-8065</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Huh7</td><td>Gifted, Karolinska institute</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>LX2</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SCC064</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (human)</td><td>si-IRE1α</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>s200432</td><td>0,1–1 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (human)</td><td>Si-Ctrl; Scr</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>4390843</td><td>0,1–1 µM</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>KI67 (rat monoclonal)</td><td>eBioscience</td><td>SolA15</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>EPCAM (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab71916</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Spliced XBP1 (goat monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Ab85546</td><td>1:50</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Total XBP1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Ab37152</td><td>5 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>IRE1a (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Ab37073</td><td>1 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>p-IRE1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>AbNova</td><td>PAB12435</td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>αSMA (Rabbit Polyclonal)</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>710487</td><td>1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>αSMA (Goat monocolonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Ab21027</td><td>1–2 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>BIP (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Ab21027</td><td>1 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Vinculin (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>14-9777-82</td><td>1–5 µg/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td><italic>Pst-</italic>I</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>ER0615</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Pierce BCA-protein assay kit</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>233225</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>EZNA RNA isolation Kit II</td><td>VWR</td><td>R6934-02</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNeasy Universal Mini Kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>73404</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Diva Decloacker solution</td><td>Biocare</td><td>DV2004</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>DCFDA - Cellular ROS Detection Assay Kit</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab113851</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>N-Nitrosodiethylamine, DEN</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>1002877809</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>4μ8C</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SML0949-25MG</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heindryckx et al., 2016</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>SB-431541, TGF-ß receptor inhibitor</td><td>Tocris</td><td>1614</td><td>10 μM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Resazurin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>R7017-1G</td><td>1:80 dilution</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Ingenio electroporation solution</td><td>Mirus Bio LLC</td><td>MIR50114</td><td>Ice-cold</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>CellTracker Red CMTPX</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>C34552</td><td>1 μM</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>CellTracker Green CMFDA</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>C2925</td><td>1 μM</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>12-well CorningCostar Transwellplates</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>3460</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calitz et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Corning CostarUltra-Low attachment 96-well plates</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>CLS3471</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calitz et al., 2019</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>CellDirector</td><td>GradienTech</td><td>11-001-10</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuchs et al., 2020</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse model</title><p>A chemically induced mouse model for HCC was used, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heindryckx et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heindryckx et al., 2012</xref>).

In short, cells fluorescently labeled by using CellTracker dye, according to manufacturer's instructions. Cell pellets were incubated 30 min with 1 μM of CellTracker Red CMTPX (C34552, ThermoFisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden) or 1 μM of CellTracker Green CMFDA (C2925, ThermoFisher Scientific, Stockholm, Sweden). Cells were washed twice in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (P4417-100TAB, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and seeded in 12-well plates. The cells were left to reach 100% confluency overnight, after which a scratch was created on the confluent cell layer, using a 200 µL pipette tip. Medium was aspirated from each well and replaced by fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS. Invasion of cells into the scratch wound area was monitored using fluorescence microscopy images and light microscopy images. Scratch size was measured by analyzing light microscopy images in ImageJ, using the MRI Wound Healing Tool plug-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/projects/imagej-macros/wiki/Wound_Healing_Tool">http://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/projects/imagej-macros/wiki/Wound_Healing_Tool</ext-link>).

previously unappreciated role for the unfolded protein response (UPR) in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lynne-Marie Postovit as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to their labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also strongly recommending you to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. <italic>eLife</italic> is aiming to make posting to bioRxiv or medRxiv – either by the authors or the journal – the default for all <italic>eLife</italic> submissions. Authors will be able to opt out, but we will strongly encourage them not to. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The current manuscript by Pavlovic et al. focuses on the role of ER stress and UPR activation in communication between hepatocellular cancer cells (HCC) and hepatic stellate cells. This study builds upon a recent EMBO Molecular Medicine paper by the same group which reported a role for IRE1 in α-SMA activation in stellate cells treated with TGF-β. In the current study, the authors suggest that TGF-β from HCC cells causes the UPR in stellate cells and that these cells subsequently support pro-tumorigenic properties through an IRE1a-RNAse-dependent mechanism. While 4u8C (an IRE1alpha RNAse inhibitor) did seem to prevent pro-tumorigenic phenomena induced when HCC and LX2 stellate cells were co-cultured; the manuscript failed to convincingly demonstrate a role for HCC-derived TGF-β in the process. Moreover, mechanistic insight regarding how IRE1alpha RNAase activity in stellate cells may be promoting a pro-tumorigenic niche was lacking. Hence, the paper would require extensive revision before it would be acceptable for publications in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the experiments related to the activation of the UPR were overly simplified with only certain aspects of each arm explored. For example, the data presented is limited to BiP, IRE1 and in some cases CHOP. To make such generalized statements referring to the UPR other arms PERK and ATF6 should also be included or the text amended to reflect that a full profile of UPR activation has not been completed.</p><p>2) The role of XBP-1 splicing / IRE1a-RNAse activity must be better substantiated, particularly since results often contradict each other, with variability in the effect of 4u8C. Validation or verification strategies must be included to verify the functionality of 4u8c inhibition, particularly in vivo. This could be done, for example, by assessing XBP1 splicing via QPCR or IHC in the DEN induced in vivo model. In addition, genetic approaches such as IRE1 knockdown or knockout are required to solidify those results obtained with 4u8c in the in vitro models, particularly given the potential for off-target effects (such as ROS generation) which may occur at the relatively high concentration of 4u8c (100uM) used in the current study. This was exasperated by the fact that 4u8c reduced phosphorylation of IRE1. In the original study Cross et al. (PNAS 2012) 32uM of 4u8c blocked XBP1 splicing in response to thapsigarin but did not alter IRE1 phosphorylation. Hence, the specificity of the P-IRE1 antibody used in this study should be validated.</p><p>3) The results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 actually refute the hypothesis that HCC-derived TGFβ may be promoting the UPR in stellate cells. In fact, the results rather suggest that an autocrine signaling mechanism may be playing a role in the LX2 cells and that the HepG2 cells may even prevent this somehow. Accordingly, another mechanism of action should be considered using genetic approaches in the stellate versus HCC cells and/or the conclusions drawn from this work should be altered.</p><p>4) The quality of the microscopy images presented could in many instances be improved. The co-localization referred to by the authors in many figures e.g. Supplemental Figure 1D and E is not convincing. In Supplemental Figure 1 E, the staining looks to be in the pericytes. Please include more pictures and/or ensure cells are stellate cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inhibiting IRE1α-endonuclease activity decreases tumor burden in a mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The revised manuscript has been looked at again by the reviewers. While the paper has been improved, a number of concerns remain, which I believe are significant enough to warrant further revisions.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Significant concerns remain regarding the of target effect of 4u8c. While we agree that IRE1 signalling itself could be triggering ROS, it would be prudent to ensure that the observations attributed to 4u8c in this study are due to its on-target effect on IRE1 and not its off-target antioxidant effect as has previously been reported. The authors should add 4u8c to IRE1 knockout cells, at least in the HepG2 cell line wherein it seems that ROS levels are deferentially affected by 4u8c and IRE1 knockdown.</p><p>This revised panels in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 do not convincingly demonstrate co-localisation with XBP1s. Specifically, the level of signal for IRE1, p-IRE1 and BiP is very low, making it difficult to formulate a conclusion. Please improve these panels.</p><p>Please correct labelling and include molecular weight markers in Figure 2E. As it stands, the molecular weights of the bands indicated on the Western blot do not correspond to XBP1 unspliced (which should be 33kDa) and spliced (which should be 55 kDa).</p><p>In Figure 2H, XBP1s localisation seems to be entirely cytoplasmic. This is rather unexpected as at least some XBP1s would be expected to localise to the nucleus. Please comment on this result in relation to the extant literature.</p><p>In Figure 4, lanes 2 and 4 have no product, despite the fact that Pst1 should digest XBP1 unspliced but not XBP1 spliced. The authors should carefully check and/or comment upon this result.</p><p>Please confirm IRE1 knockdown at the protein level.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55865.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Many of the experiments related to the activation of the UPR were overly simplified with only certain aspects of each arm explored.

However, subsequent studies have also shown that 4u8C treatment can reduce IRE1a-phosphorylation. The Nelson et al. (J. Immunol, 2018) study described 4u8C as an inhibitor of IRE1a-phosphorylation in B cells [6, 7]. Similarly, treatment with 4u8C reduced the protein levels of p-IRE1a in Hela cells [8] and in tunicamycin-induced cardiomyocytes [9].</p><p>To assess if the effect is through generation of ROS, we have quantified the intracellular ROS levels after treatment with 50uM and 100 μm of 4u8C (Figure 10). After 6 hours, 4u8C decreased the generation of ROS in LX2, HepG2 and Huh7 cells in both concentrations. This could mean that the results could be partially caused by decreasing ROS-generation. This is in line with the study from Chan et al. (2018), who describes that 4u8C is a potent ROS-scavenger [5]. However, studies have shown that IRE1a itself plays an important role in the generation of ROS [10]. IRE1α generates ROS through Ca<sup>2+</sup>- mediated signaling between the IRE1α-InsP3R pathway in the ER and the redox-dependent apoptotic pathway in the mitochondrion, as well as via induction of activation of CHOP, BiP and through spliced XBP1 [10-12]. Therefore, the relation between IRE1a reduction with 4u8C and the effect on ROS-generation might be more complicated. To support this, we transfected LX2-cells, HepG2-cells and Huh7-cells with si-IRE1a. Interestingly, a similar reduction in ROS generation was seen after transfection of LX2-cells as in the 4u8C-treated LX2-cells, while an increase of ROS generation was noted in the transfected HepG2-cells. These results indicate that the reduction in ROS could partially be explained through the decreased activation of the IRE1a-pathway in the LX2-cells. However, how the IRE1a-pathway affects the generation of ROS, seems to be cell-type dependent, as we see different results in the different cell lines we tested. This is in line with previous studies, which also observed this cell-line dependent effect on IRE1a-dependent ROS-generation.</p><p>To further solidify our results obtained with 4u8C, we have done transfections in the in vitro models (Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1) using an siRNA that silences IRE1a in the hepatic stellate cells and tumor cells. Silencing IRE1a in the LX2 cells significantly decreases mRNA expression of proliferation marker PCNA, as well as the relative cell number measured by resazurin reduction assay in co-cultures. Similarly, silencing IRE1a in the HepG2 cells decreased proliferation by 45% in the monocultures and 30% in the co-cultures. In contrast to this, we saw an increase of 47% and 27% after silencing IRE1a in the Huh7 monocultures and co-cultures. We have now changed the conclusions of the manuscript so that we not only focus on the effect on stellate cells, but also explain that part of the results can be explained through a direct effect on tumor cells, which seems to be cell-line specific.</p><p>To test whether these differences between the cell lines could be attributed to differences in ROS-generation, we measured ROS using DCFDA (Figure 10). We observed that transfecting the different cell lines with si-IRE1a affected the generation of ROS, but the extend and direction of this effect seemed to be cell line dependent. Oxidative stress can affect cell proliferation, specifically in cancer cells and stellate cells. In addition, ROS is one of the critical mediators of stellate cell activation and ECM-production. Therefore, our results can also be explained through IRE1a-dependent mechanisms of ROS-generation. Further studies are needed to verify this interesting link between IRE1a and ROS-generation, however, we feel like this is beyond the scope of our current study. This has now been added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 actually refute the hypothesis that HCC-derived TGFβ may be promoting the UPR in stellate cells. In fact, the results rather suggest that an autocrine signaling mechanism may be playing a role in the LX2 cells and that the HepG2 cells may even prevent this somehow. Accordingly, another mechanism of action should be considered using genetic approaches in the stellate versus HCC cells and/or the conclusions drawn from this work should be altered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added additional data showing the effect of IRE1a-silencing in the HCC-cells compared to the silencing in the LX2-cells, provide an alternative mechanism through the effect of IRE1a-inhibition on ROS-production and also mention other alternative mechanisms in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The quality of the microscopy images presented could in many instances be improved. The co-localization referred to by the authors in many figures e.g. Supplemental Figure 1D and E is not convincing. In Supplemental Figure 1 E, the staining looks to be in the pericytes. Please include more pictures and/or ensure cells are stellate cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more images to the manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and also clarify that there is some co-localization, but that the expression is not exclusively located in the hepatic stellate cells. It is also important to note that hepatic stellate cells are liver-specific pericytes, that reside in the perisinusoidal space of Disse, between endothelial cells and hepatocytes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Significant concerns remain regarding the of target effect of 4u8c. While we agree that IRE1 signalling itself could be triggering ROS, it would be prudent to ensure that the observations attributed to 4u8c in this study are due to its on-target effect on IRE1 and not its off-target antioxidant effect as has previously been reported. The authors should add 4u8c to IRE1 knockout cells, at least in the HepG2 cell line wherein it seems that ROS levels are deferentially affected by 4u8c and IRE1 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>For the revised version of this manuscript, we have added the requested experiment and we indeed see that 4u8C continues to decrease ROS-production in the transfected cells. We agree that part of the results could be explained through an off-target effect and more experiments are needed to assess this possibility. Therefore, we have altered our claims in the Discussion and specify that an off-target effect is also a possible explanation for some of the conclusions drawn in this paper. We are continuing our studies on the effect of 4u8C as a ROS-scavenger, as well as the potential interaction between the IRE1a-pathway and ROS-generation. In a preliminary experiment, we found that treatment with the ER-stress inducer tunicamycin, increases the levels of ROS in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines, thus possibly supporting our hypothesis that there is an interaction between ER-stress pathways and ROS-generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). In this experiment we did not observe the same markable decrease in ROS-production after 4u8C-treatment, however, it is important to note that this was measured after a 2 hour incubation time, while in the manuscript we used 6 hours. Treatment with 4u8C seems to affect ROS-generation in a time-dependent matter, so this would probably explain the discrepancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of ER-stress on ROS production.</title><p>(A) the ER-stress inducer increases ROS levels in HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

The most remarkable finding from this experiment is that transfecting LX2-cells with si-IRE1a increases ROS-generation in the LX2 + HepG2 co-culture, while a decrease is seen in the LX2-monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). More studies are necessary to verify what this means in terms of explaining the interaction between stellate cells and tumor cells. The generation of ROS is a very well-known contributor to stellate cell activation in chronic liver disease, as infiltrated inflammatory cells and Kupffer cells produce ROS to induce activation and proliferation of stellate cells. However, ROS-generation can also have the opposite effect, as exogenous and intracellular oxidative stress can induce cell death of activated stellate cells, thereby contributing to the resolution of fibrosis. We hope to study the role of IRE1a-mediated ROS-generation in the interaction between stellate cells and tumor cells in the future, either by adding additional information to this existing paper (through BioRxiv or <italic>eLife</italic>´s Research Advance) or publish this as a follow-up paper.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of silencing IRE1a in different co-culture conditions.</title><p>(A) LX2-cells transfected with si-RNA targeting IRE1a or mock-transfected (Scr) in mono-culture or co-culture with tumor cells (HepG2 and Huh7).

Please improve these panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added another supplementary figure, where we provide images at a higher magnification. We would like to point out that we do not use the term “co-localization” as it is unlikely that there would be expression of XBP1s and aSMA within the same pixel. What we state in the text is that expression of aSMA and several ER-stress markers is localized within close proximity from each other and that it is probably localized within the same cell, especially when considering the location of the nearby nuclei on Hoechst staining. We hope that the higher magnification clarifies this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please correct labelling and include molecular weight markers in Figure 2E.

This is rather unexpected as at least some XBP1s would be expected to localise to the nucleus. Please comment on this result in relation to the extant literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we do not observe a clear nuclear expression of spliced XBP1, which is in contrast to the study of Yoshida et al., which shows that spliced XBP1 predominantly localizes in the nucleus of HeLa-cells exposed to acute ER-stress [13]. This study also describes a mechanism whereby unspliced-XBP1 forms a complex with the spliced isoform, thereby exporting it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in subsequent degradation by the proteasome. However, this event has been described during the recovery phase of an acute ER-stress event. In our mouse model, we have treated the mice with a carcinogenic compound for 25 weeks, which results in a chronic inflammation and a subsequent activation of the ER-stress pathways. It is therefore not unlikely that different cells in this model are experiencing different phases of acute ER-stress and recovery. At a higher magnification, it becomes clear that the expression of spliced XBP1 is not only cytoplasmic but some staining appears peri-nuclear and nuclear. This could represent different stages of ER-stress activation and recovery in different cell populations; however, more experiments would be needed to verify this hypothesis. A summarized version of this explanation has been added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, lanes 2 and 4 have no product, despite the fact that Pst1 should digest XBP1 unspliced but not XBP1 spliced. The authors should carefully check and/or comment upon this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of that there seems to be no product in lanes 2 and 4 in the image provided in the manuscript. We have first checked several issues to verify that this is not due to a technical artifact. Firstly, all conditions contain the same amount of cDNA. This cDNA has also been used for qPCR, where all samples have a stable expression the reference genes. Secondly, in other biological replicates of this experiment we did observe a faint band in these lanes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Thirdly, when looking at the raw qPCR-data from spliced and unspliced XBP1, we also note that in samples from these conditions have a very low expression of unspliced XBP1, with CT values between 30 and 34, while GAPDH comes up around cycle 20. Therefore, we suspect that this is due to a low expression of total XBP1 (spliced and unspliced). Discrepancies between the baseline expressions of XBP1 can be observed between different studies, depending on the cell type or tissue used. For instance, the study of Cassimeris et al., describes barely detectable levels of both spliced and unspliced XBP1 in epidermal keratinocytes of the healthy hind limbs of animals with endocrinopathic equine laminitis, while a high level of total XBP1 was observed in these cells derived from the diseased front limbs of the same animal [14]. These levels correlated with the overall levels of ER-stress, which differed between diseased and healthy tissue and thereby suggest that both unspliced and spliced XBP1 can be affected by levels of ER-stress. In line with our findings, the study of Kishino et al. (2017) reports constitutively low levels of unspliced XBP1 in untreated auditory cells, which increases during tunicamycin-induced ER-stress. In this study, the expression level of unspliced XBP1 peaked at 24 h and decreased at 48 h after the treatment with tunicamycin, thus suggesting that levels of unspliced XBP1 can also be affected by the levels of ER-stress in a time-dependent matter [15]. The conditions where we observe lower levels of both unspliced and spliced XBP1 correspond to those where we expect to see generally low levels of IRE1a activation, namely LX2-monocultures and LX2+Hep2 co-cultures treated with 4u8C. A summarized version of this explanation has been added to the Discussion.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Visible bands in lane 2 and 4, which corresponds to LX2-monocultures and LX2+Hep2 co-cultures treated with 4u8C.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55865-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please confirm IRE1 knockdown at the protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not have an optimized protocol for western blot using the IRE1a antibody that we use in our lab.

Unfortunately, we have used up all the si-RNA reagents at the moment and cannot repeat this experiment on the LX2 and HepG2 cells.
