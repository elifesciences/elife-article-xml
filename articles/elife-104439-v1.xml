reversible post-translational addition of β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine to serine and threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. It plays an important role in several cellular processes through the modification of thousands of protein substrates. O-GlcNAcylation in humans is mediated by a single essential enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). OGT, together with the sole O-GlcNAcase OGA, form an intricate feedback loop to maintain O-GlcNAc homeostasis in response to changes in cellular O-GlcNAc using a dynamic mechanism involving nuclear retention of its fourth intron. However, the molecular mechanism of this dynamic regulation remains unclear. Using an O-GlcNAc responsive GFP reporter cell line, we identify SFSWAP, a poorly characterized splicing factor, as a trans-acting factor regulating OGT intron detention. We show that SFSWAP is a global regulator of retained intron splicing and exon skipping that primarily acts as a negative regulator of splicing. In contrast, knockdown of SFSWAP leads to reduced inclusion of a ‘decoy exon’ present in the OGT retained intron which may mediate its role in OGT intron detention. Global analysis of decoy exon inclusion in SFSWAP and UPF1 double knockdown cells indicate altered patterns of decoy exon usage. Together, these data indicate a role for SFSWAP as a global negative regulator of pre-mRNA splicing and positive regulator of intron retention.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intron retention</kwd><kwd>O-glcnac</kwd><kwd>OGT</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>SFSWAP</kwd><kwd>decoy exon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM127311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 CA242115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI153175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI123165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SFSWAP was identified in a genetic screen to negatively regulate splicing of OGT and other mRNAs primarily by regulating intron retention and exon skipping.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intron retention (IR) refers to the lack of removal of specific introns in a transcript, resulting in full-length introns in an RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Monteuuis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rekosh and Hammarskjold, 2018</xref>). IR that leads to impaired cytoplasmic export and nuclear retention of the transcript is referred to as intron detention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>). Detained introns are a common feature of mammalian transcriptomes, but, unlike other forms of alternate splicing, intron detention controls the levels and timing of production of mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braunschweig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yap et al., 2012</xref>). Cells regulate the efficiency of splicing of DIs, and therefore mRNA production, in response to specific environmental cues. DI-containing transcripts may serve as nuclear reservoirs that are spliced in response to cellular environment, or they may be transcriptional dead-ends that are subjected to nuclear degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yap et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pendleton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mauger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ninomiya et al., 2011</xref>). Intron detention regulates a wide variety of transcripts in mammals, but the environmental cues and mechanisms that regulate intron detention have been defined for only a few of these RNAs.</p><p>The environmental cues that regulate intron detention of the human O-linked β-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) protein have been defined, but the mechanisms of this regulation are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>). OGT encodes the sole enzyme responsible for the post-translational modification O-GlcNAc, where UDP-GlcNAc serves as the cofactor for addition of GlcNAc residues to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues of thousands of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kreppel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lubas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bond and Hanover, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mannino and Hart, 2022</xref>). Conversely, OGA (O-GlcNAcase) is the sole enzyme responsible for removal of O-GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2001</xref>). Cells maintain O-GlcNAc homeostasis by an intricate feedback mechanism involving intron detention of the OGT transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Under conditions of high cellular O-GlcNAc (such as treatment with the OGA inhibitor thiamet G [TG]), intron 4 of OGT is detained, resulting in reduction in cytoplasmic OGT mRNA. However, under conditions of low cellular O-GlcNAc (such as glucose deprivation or treatment with the OGT inhibitor OSMI-1), the intron is rapidly excised, resulting in increased levels of cytoplasmic OGT mRNA. Interestingly, the OGA transcript is also regulated by intron detention, but with the inverse relationship to O-GlcNAc levels outcomes as OGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified a cis-acting intronic splicing silencer (ISS) situated within OGT intron 4 that is necessary for IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequent work by other groups showed that the ISS overlaps with an ~150 bp unannotated ‘decoy exon’ possessing multiple weak 5′ and 3′ splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>). Deletion of the OGT decoy exon/ISS or even blocking of the decoy 5′ splice sites using morpholino oligonucleotides renders splicing of intron 4 constitutive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parra et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests the somewhat counterintuitive idea that at least partial assembly of the spliceosome around the decoy is necessary for OGT intron detention even though splicing of the decoy exon does not occur. Decoy exons are not unique to OGT and are present in many other retained intron containing genes, specifically those with longer retained introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pirnie et al., 2017</xref>). The decoy exons mediate IR in these genes as well, but the precise mechanism by which decoy exons regulate IR remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to the role of OGT intron detention in buffering changes in cellular O-GlcNAc levels, OGT (and consequently O-GlcNAc) has been proposed to be a ‘master regulator’ of detained intron splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Treatment of cells with the OGT inhibitor OSMI-2 for short time periods (~30 min) induces changes in OGT detention to buffer O-GlcNAc levels. However, longer treatment durations (~2 hr) lead to global changes in detained intron splicing. Differential phosphoproteomics after a short OSMI-2 treatment identified a set of proteins enriched in splicing factors. These ‘early responders’ could potentially mediate downstream effects of OSMI-2 on splicing and included the putative splicing factor SFSWAP.</p><p>SFSWAP (splicing factor, suppressor of white-apricot homolog; SFRS8) encodes the essential human homolog of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> splicing factor SWAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denhez and Lafyatis, 1994</xref>). It is an alternate splicing factor containing an RS domain, but it does not possess a canonical RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Denhez and Lafyatis, 1994</xref>). It contains two suppressor of white apricot/Prp21 (SURP) domains which mediate its binding to other proteins containing an SURP interaction domain. The second SURP domain of SFSWAP has been shown to interact with the mammalian branchpoint binding protein SF1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crisci et al., 2015</xref>). However, the identity of its regulatory targets remains unknown. Its sequence contains a number of known phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2020</xref>) indicating that its function might be regulated by phosphorylation. In addition, it regulates alternate splicing of Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2004</xref>), CD45 and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarkissian et al., 1996</xref>) by inhibiting the inclusion of specific exons.</p><p>Here, we identify SFSWAP as a regulator of OGT intron detention using a CRISPR knockout screen with an O-GlcNAc responsive GFP reporter cell line. We show that knockout of SFSWAP leads to enhanced splicing of the OGT detained intron, particularly under high-O-GlcNAc conditions, indicating its role as a negative regulator of OGT splicing. We also show that SFSWAP is a global regulator of detained intron splicing and exon skipping, with enhanced splicing of retained introns and increased inclusion of cassette exons upon SFSWAP knockdown. Our results suggest that SFSWAP regulates OGT intron detention by modulating the inclusion or recognition of the decoy exon present within the detained intron. Finally, global analysis of decoy exon splicing upon SFSWAP knockdown indicates that SFSWAP may regulate decoy exon splicing globally to mediate its effect on intron detention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A GFP splicing reporter that monitors cellular O-GlcNAc levels</title><p>To enable genetic screens for identification of trans-acting factors that regulate OGT intron detention, we constructed a GFP-based splicing reporter that responds to cellular O-GlcNAc levels. The reporter consists of the entire intron 4 of OGT (the detained intron) and corresponding exons (exons 4 and 5) flanked upstream and downstream by the efficiently spliced β-globin intron 2 (and corresponding exons 2 and 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scarborough et al., 2022</xref>). An eGFP reporter upstream of this assembly is driven by a constitutive CMV promoter and translationally separated from the remaining exons by a T2A element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donnelly et al., 2001a</xref>).

Treatment of cells with the OGA inhibitor TG induces high O-GlcNAc levels. This should promote detention of OGT intron 4, nuclear retention of the transcript, and reduced expression of the GFP reporter. On the other hand, treatment with OGT inhibitor OSMI-1 induces a low O-GlcNAc condition, which should promote intron 4 splicing, cytoplasmic export of the mRNA, and increased GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, right). RT-PCR analysis of reporter RNA from clonal cell lines yielded a predominant single band corresponding to the mature reporter mRNA indicating the absence of unexpected splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Moreover, this band increased and decreased upon OSMI-1 and TG treatment, as expected. Further screening of reporter lines by northern blot analysis also confirmed that the GFP reporter is responsive to cellular O-GlcNAc levels. Treatment of the reporter line with 1 μM TG for 6 hr led to reduced levels of the spliced product, while treatment with 10 μM OSMI-1 for the same time led to enhanced splicing increased levels of the reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). FACS analysis of the reporter lines treated with the inhibitors verified GFP protein expression, with lower and higher GFP fluorescence after TG and OSMI-1 treatment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). To further characterize reporter activity at various O-GlcNAc levels, we treated reporter clones with conditions known to perturb cellular O-GlcNAc levels. Treatment of the reporter cells with glucosamine or the OGA inhibitor PUGNAc (O-(2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-<sc>D</sc>-glucopyranosylidene)amino <italic>N</italic>-phenyl carbamate) resulted in reduced GFP protein levels similar to TG, while treatment with the GFAT inhibitor DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) or glucose deprivation led to increased GFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Finally, we validated the reporter line by knockdown of OGT itself, which will reduce cellular O-GlcNAc levels. As expected, we observed increased levels of reporter mRNA upon OGT knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), and this effect masked the effect of subsequent inhibitor treatments. Together, these results demonstrate that our GFP reporter construct reflects the response of endogenous OGT to intracellular O-GlcNAc levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SFSWAP is a negative regulator of OGT intron 4 splicing</title><p>To screen for trans-acting factors that regulate OGT IR, we performed whole genome CRISPR knockout screens using the Brunello knockout library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doench et al., 2016</xref>) under three treatment conditions – TG, OSMI-1, or untreated. Treatment of reporter lines with TG brings the cells to a ‘low GFP’ state under which knockout of negative splicing regulatory factors (i.e., those promoting IR) are expected to result in a ‘high GFP’ state. Treatment with OSMI-1 results in cells that are ‘high GFP’ and knockout of factors that promote splicing of the retained intron will result in a ‘low GFP’ state. Finally, untreated cells can be selected for either ‘low GFP’ or ‘high GFP’ events. We performed pilot screens at 100× library coverage with a 10-day knockout time period and 24-hr treatment with inhibitors just before selection for either ‘high’ or ‘low GFP’ cells by FACS sorting. Subsequent sequencing of the guide RNA locus from the sorted cells and statistical analysis using MAGeCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2014</xref>) identified candidates to regulate OGT IR. While we did not obtain any hits with the OSMI-1 and untreated ‘low GFP’ screens, we successfully obtained hits with both the TG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and untreated ‘high GFP’ screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Since the list of putative targets from both screens were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>), we performed two additional replicates of the screen at 300× coverage under TG treatment conditions only and obtained similar results.</p><p>As expected, the top hit from the screens was OGT itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In addition, we obtained many hits corresponding to genes involved in glucose metabolism including GFAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and SLC2A1 (a glucose transporter), further boosting our confidence that the genes identified in the screen are relevant to O-GlcNAc homeostasis. We also obtained a few hits corresponding to RNA-binding proteins (e.g., HNRNPU, HuR) and proteins involved in m6A modification (ZC3H13, KIAA1429). Interestingly, the large majority of the hits were splicing associated factors and/or components of the spliceosome. The latter was surprising because loss of core spliceosome factors would be expected to result in reduced splicing of the reporter (and thus low GFP levels), but we selected for ‘high GFP’ cells. Nevertheless, these results indicated that the hits from the screen may be associated with a specific spliceosome-mediated mechanism.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SFSWAP is a negative regulator of OGT intron 4 splicing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top, timeline of CRISPR screen.

To check whether SFSWAP knockdown also results in splicing changes in endogenous OGT, we performed northern blot analysis with a probe corresponding to the 3′ UTR of OGT mRNA.

To characterize the functional role of SFSWAP, we performed RNA-seq in either non-target (siNT) or SFSWAP knockdown (siSFSWAP) cells in the absence of TG or OSMI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Differential expression analysis using edgeR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) revealed 252 downregulated and 633 upregulated genes on SFSWAP knockdown, but did not reveal any functional class of RNAs that was regulated by SFSWAP. Since SFSWAP is a predicted splicing factor, we performed alternate splicing analysis using the rMATS package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). We analyzed five alternate splicing event types – retained introns (RI), skipped exons (SE), alternate 5′ splice sites (A5SS), alternate 3′ splice sites (A3SS), and mutually exclusive exons (MXE). Interestingly, we found global changes in splicing patterns between siNT and siSFSWAP, with the majority of changes occurring across two of the five event types analyzed – retained introns and skipped exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). To visualize this more clearly, we plotted the inclusion level differences between the two conditions (IncLevelDifference, calculated as IncLevel<sub>siNT</sub> − IncLevel<sub>siSFSWAP</sub>) against FDR values obtained from rMATS. A positive value for IncLevelDifference indicates more removal of retained introns in SFSWAP knockdown compared to siNT, while a negative value indicates more retention. Knockdown of SFSWAP resulted in increased excision of retained introns globally, indicated by more events with a positive value for IncLevelDiffference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and as exemplified by genome browser shots of IFRD2 and GFUS/TSTA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This is consistent with the original screen phenotype, where SFSWAP was isolated as negative regulator of OGT retained intron splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Previous observations that SFSWAP autoregulates its own expression by control of splicing of its first two retained introns is also consistent with this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zachar et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zachar et al., 1994</xref>).

We observed a general enhancement of skipped exon inclusion upon SFSWAP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This is in agreement with previous studies where SFSWAP was shown to promote exclusion of CD45 exon 4 and the IICS region of fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarkissian et al., 1996</xref>). Our results are also consistent with the observation that SFSWAP inhibits inclusion of Tau exon 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). For increased rigor, we also performed alternate splicing analysis using two other pipelines, MAJIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2023</xref>) and Whippet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sterne-Weiler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Although the number of differential splicing events identified by these pipelines were lower than with rMATS and largely non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), the trends remained similar. These results are consistent with a role for SFSWAP in splicing regulation and further suggest a more prominent role as a negative regulator of splicing.</p><p>To obtain further insights into the targets of SFSWAP, we looked at the sequence features of these SFSWAP-dependent differentially regulated splice events including length, GC content, and splice site strength. While we did not find any significant differences among the events with respect to length or splice site strength, we observed some interesting trends with respect to GC content. In RIs that are more efficiently spliced upon SFSWAP knockdown (positive IncLevelDifference), we found that the average GC content in the RI and flanking exons was higher compared to those that less efficiently spliced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We observed similar trends toward higher GC content when we examined skipped exon events that result in enhanced inclusion upon SFSWAP knockdown (negative IncLevelDifference). In this case, the skipped exon, upstream and downstream exons all had higher GC content. Together these results suggest that SFSWAP is a global regulator of pre-mRNA splicing that primarily regulates IR and exon skipping events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SFSWAP regulates OGT decoy exon inclusion</title><p>To delineate the mechanism of SFSWAP regulation of OGT IR, we further looked into our RNA-seq dataset. Interestingly, genome browser visualization revealed no obvious changes in sequence coverage at the OGT retained intron locus after SFSWAP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Although surprising, this agrees with the RT-qPCR results on the retained intron junction upon SFSWAP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), where we saw no statistically significant changes in RI junction usage. We reasoned that the lack of junction usage changes could be because the RNA-seq was performed under untreated conditions, while both the CRISPR screen and confirmatory RT-qPCRs were performed under TG-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). To test whether the effect of SFSWAP knockdown on the OGT retained intron is more appreciable under TG-treated conditions, we repeated the RNA-seq analysis after 6 hr of TG treatment. Visualization of OGT detained intron splicing under these conditions using a sashimi plot provided support for enhanced removal of the detained intron upon SFSWAP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>). Alternate splicing analysis using this dataset reproduced previous results that SFSWAP is a global regulator of pre-mRNA splicing.

Since one of the phenotypes of SFSWAP knockdown is a change in skipped exon splicing, and the decoy mimics a skipped exon internal to the RI, we wanted to test if decoy exon inclusion levels were altered upon SFSWAP knockdown.

The decoy exon in OGT has two predicted 5′ splice sites and two predicted 3′ splice sites. To quantify changes in decoy exon inclusion, we mapped the RNA-seq reads to a version of the human genome where decoy exons resulting from all four possible combinations of splice sites were manually added to the reference annotation. Differential splicing analysis using the JCEC model of rMATS indicated lower inclusion of the decoy exon upon SFSWAP knockdown, as expected, but the differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, left). As a control, decoy inclusion levels were significantly higher in either in UPF1 knockdown alone (since the decoy exon form is stabilized) or TG treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, middle panels). We reasoned that detection of changes in decoy exon inclusion would be more sensitive in a siSFSWAP/siUPF1 background owing to the presence of the premature stop codon in the decoy exon. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq analysis of SFSWAP knockdown cells (treated with TG) in a UPF1 knockdown background. Alternate splicing analysis using rMATS detected a significant reduction in decoy usage in SFSWAP knockdown cells in this background, consistent with the qPCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, right). Thus, we conclude that SFSWAP promotes inclusion of the OGT decoy exon. Because decoy exon recognition is a critical component of regulation of OGT intron detention, these data further suggest that SFSWAP regulates OGT intron detention by controlling decoy exon inclusion and/or recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SFSWAP may be a global regulator of decoy exon usage</title><p>Decoy exons have been proposed to regulate IR in a large number of genes in addition to OGT, especially those with longer retained introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>).

Most decoy exons remain uncharacterized to date with the exception of a few like those in OGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>), ARGLU1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pirnie et al., 2017</xref>), and SF3B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>). To obtain annotations corresponding to putative decoy exons, we used coordinates of novel unannotated cassette exons identified in human erythroblasts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>. We also obtained a matching list of known retained introns in the same cells identified based on RNA-seq data. We then filtered the list of novel cassette exons to include only those exons whose positions fall entirely within the corresponding retained introns. This list of 2398 novel cassette exons within known retained introns was used as the list of prospective decoy exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). In principle, all of these may not be splicing decoys, but we think these are reasonable criteria to assay putative decoys.</p><p>We examined the role of SFSWAP in regulating the inclusion of these decoys either in a TG-treated or a TG-treated UPF1 knockdown background by performing alternate splicing analysis using a human reference annotation supplemented with this list of predicted decoy exons. We observed altered patterns of decoy exon inclusion in SFSWAP knockdown conditions compared to non-target. While the changes in retained intron splicing were primarily in the direction of increased splicing (i.e., less RI inclusion) and that of skipped exon splicing were predominantly in the direction of more inclusion upon SFSWAP knockdown, decoy exons were either more or less included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This may reflect the varying mechanisms of action of individual decoys, their splice site strengths, and/or the efficiency of splicing of the intron in which they are found (see Discussion). We further classified these decoy exons based on the predicted translational outcome if the decoys are included in the transcripts (poison cassette, non-poison or untranslated), but we did not see any additional trends for any of these outcome types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We obtained similar trends for decoy exon usage regulation by SFSWAP with our TG-treated dataset in the absence of UPF1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), with the only major change being the loss of some of the poison exon events (blue dots) with highest fold changes as expected in the absence of a stabilizing UPF1 knockdown. To further investigate the role of SFSWAP in modulating decoy exon usage, we analyzed the effect of SFSWAP knockdown on splicing of decoy exon-containing retained introns. In contrast to the enhanced removal of retained introns for most non-decoy exon-containing events upon SFSWAP knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>), decoy-containing retained intron events did not show a trend toward any direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), suggesting a different mechanism of regulation for decoy-containing retained introns. Consistent with this observation and as observed by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>), we observed a trend toward increased intron length for decoy-containing retained introns compared to non-decoy-containing retained introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Thus, while the mechanism of SFSWAP on individual decoy exons may differ, the data support a role of SFSWAP as a general regulator of decoy exon splicing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SFSWAP is a global regulator of decoy exon splicing.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scatter plot of global decoy exon inclusion level changes upon SFSWAP knockdown in a TG-treated UPF1 knockdown background.

The effect is particularly evident in conditions of high O-GlcNAc that strongly favor retention of intron 4. Additionally, we show that depletion of SFSWAP using siRNAs decreases IR in many transcripts and that skipped exons tend to be more included in these conditions. These observations are wholly consistent with previously published single gene focused studies examining splicing of Tau, fibronectin, CD45, and SFSWAP splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sarkissian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zachar et al., 1987</xref>). Together, these results strongly support the conclusion that SFSWAP is a splicing factor that primarily functions as a negative regulator of splicing.</p><p>In addition, our work suggests that SFSWAP may control OGT splicing by regulating function of its decoy exon and that this may extend to other transcripts with decoy exons. OGT intron 4 and other retained introns require decoy exons for their regulation. Exactly how decoy exons function remains unclear, but several observations suggest that they promote assembly of splicing factors, but not splicing, in order to promote IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Parra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pirnie et al., 2017</xref>). First, mutation of the weak 5′ splice sites of the OGT decoy exon leads to constitutive splicing of exons 4 and 5 in reporters. Second, eCLIP data demonstrate that U2AF1 and U2AF2 bind to the decoy 3′ splice sites. Third, addition of a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide targeting the OGT decoy’s 5′ splice site also promotes constitutive splicing of exons 4–5. Fourth, placing decoy exons and their flanking sequences into other heterologous introns leads to IR, indicating that there is not a gene or intron-specific suppression of splicing. Fifth, CRISPR deletion of the endogenous locus containing the OGT decoy leads to constitutive splicing of exons 4 and 5. Sixth, only a small percentage of mature transcript spliced isoforms splice in the decoy, even when assayed in NMD-inhibiting condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Together, these data support the recent proposed models that decoy exons require recognition by the spliceosome but are rarely spliced into the final product.</p><p>While the mechanism of SFSWAP regulation remains unclear, these characteristics of decoy exons suggest that it functions downstream of exon definition. If SFSWAP suppresses assembly of splicing factors on exons, knockdown of SFSWAP would increase decoy exon definition and thereby increase IR of OGT. In addition, increased recognition of the decoy exon may also increase decoy exon inclusion due to better recruitment of splicing factors assembly on the decoy. Our data show the exact opposite of these predictions as splicing of exons 4–5 increase upon SFSWAP depletion and decoy inclusion decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>For these reasons, we favor a model in which SFSWAP functions subsequent to exon definition to repress a downstream event in the splicing cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For skipped exons and retained introns without decoys, SFSWAP represses splicing at canonical sites which can then be used upon SFSWAP depletion. Perhaps its RS domain acts as a negative regulator by competing with RS domains from canonical SR proteins that promote splicing. For OGT, we speculate that SFSWAP represses inclusion of the decoy similar to how it functions for cassette exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, middle and bottom, left). However, in this case, spliceosome assembly at the decoy then indirectly inhibits splicing of exons 4 and 5 by promoting stable unproductive assembly of the spliceosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom left). One piece of data that seems to contradict this model is that there is less splicing of the decoy upon SFSWAP depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We speculate that loss of decoy splicing inhibition by SFSWAP allows competition between the OGT decoy and the exon 4–5 splice sites. Because the latter are stronger sites, decoy inclusion may be lost due to the increase in mRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, for skipped exons and retained introns more generally, SFSWAP knockdown had a clear tendency to increase splicing efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, SFSWAP knockdown led to a more equal distribution of inclusion and exclusion events on those retained introns containing potential decoy exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since the putative decoys are generally weaker exons, releasing the negative regulation by SFSWAP may still not be sufficient to promote inclusion of the decoys whereas derepression of canonical skipped exons leads to their inclusion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for the mechanism of action of SFSWAP on intron retention and exon skipping.</title><p>See text for details. In the case of retained introns without decoy exons or cassette exons (top and middle), we suggest that SFSWAP (green oval) restricts splicing subsequent to definition of the exons by U1 and U2.

Interestingly, we observed enrichment of known SRSF1-binding motifs at the 5′ end of SFSWAP-dependent differentially regulated retained intron events and around differentially regulated exon skipping events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the idea that SRSF1 acts in concert with SFSWAP to mediate its effect. Alternately, SFSWAP could function in conjunction with the branchpoint binding protein SF1 which has been shown to bind SURP domain containing proteins (like SFSWAP) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crisci et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, we also identified SF1 as a potential target regulating OGT IR in our TG-treated CRISPR screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and could also validate SFSWAP-SF1 interactions in cell lines by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), further supporting this idea.</p><p>With respect to the role of SFSWAP in mediating changes in OGT intron detention in response to varying O-GlcNAc levels in the cell, we speculate that SFSWAP binding to the U2 snRNP is regulated by cellular O-GlcNAc levels through an unidentified sensor. Multiple phosphorylation events on SFSWAP downstream of this sensor may modulate its binding to U2 snRNP. This is supported by the observation that SFSWAP is one of the most highly differentially phosphorylated proteins in the cell after a short treatment (30 min) with an OGT inhibitor, OSMI-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Treatment of cells with conditions leading to low O-GlcNAc levels lead to phosphorylation of SFSWAP at multiple residues (primarily S604). We propose that this change in phosphorylation status may regulate its disassociation from U2 snRNP. This then leads to altered recognition of the decoy leading to enhanced removal of the retained intron. On the other hand, high O-GlcNAcylation levels lead to accumulation of an unphosphorylated form of SFSWAP capable of binding to U2 snRNP and mediating decoy exon recognition, leading to IR. While we show that SFSWAP plays a major role in regulating OGT IR, we also realize that there are likely other factors at play in regulating OGT intron detention, especially given the fact that SFSWAP knockdown does not lead to complete excision of the OGT retained intron as is observed upon deletion of the decoy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Park et al., 2017</xref>).

The eluate was resolved on a 7.5% SDS–PAGE gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, probed with rabbit anti-SFSWAP antibodies (1:1000) and detected using IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies on a Licor instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Material availability</title><p>All unique plasmids and cell lines generated for this study are available upon request to corresponding author.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Full list of putative target genes identified by MAGeCK analysis of TG-treated gain of GFP CRISPR screen (<italic>n</italic> = 3).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp1-v1.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Full list of putative target genes identified by MAGeCK analysis of untreated gain of GFP CRISPR screen (<italic>n</italic> = 1).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp2-v1.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>List of differentially expressed genes upon SFSWAP knockdown (unreated samples) as determined by edgeR analysis.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp3-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>List of differential splicing events upon SFSWAP knockdown (untreated samples) as analyzed by rMATS.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp4-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>List of differential splicing events upon SFSWAP knockdown (untreated samples) as analyzed by Whippet.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp5-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>List of differential splicing events upon SFSWAP knockdown (untreated samples) as analyzed by MAJIQ.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp6-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>List of potential decoy exons analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp7-v1.csv" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="octet-stream"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp8"><label>Supplementary file 8.</label><caption><title>List of primers used.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104439-supp8-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-104439-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw sequencing reads for all sequencing experiments described in this paper have been deposited in NCBI GEO with the accession number GSE277952.

This extended incubation time without independent siRNA treatments raises concerns about off-target effects and indirect effects from secondary gene expression changes, potentially limiting confidence in direct SFSWAP-dependent splicing regulation. Rescue experiments and shorter siRNA-treatment incubation times could address these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated our SFSWAP knockdown analysis and analyzed both OGT e4-e5 junction splicing and SFSWAP transcript levels by RT-qPCR (now included in Sup. Fig. S4) from day 2 to day 5 post siRNA treatment. We observed that the time point at which OGT intron 4 removal increases (day 2) coincides with the time at which SFSWAP transcript levels start decrease, consistent with a direct effect of SFSWAP knockdown on OGT intron 4 splicing. Moreover, the effect of SFSWAP knockdown on OGT intron 4 splicing peaks between day 4-5, supporting our use of these longer time points to cast a wide net for SFSWAP targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The mechanistic role of SFSWAP in splicing would benefit from further exploration. Key questions remain, such as whether SFSWAP directly binds RNA, specifically the introns and exons (including the decoy exons) it appears to regulate. Furthermore, given that SFSWAP phosphorylation is influenced by changes in O-GlcNAc signaling, it would be interesting to investigate this relationship further. While generating specific phosphomutants may not yield definitive insights due to redundancy and also beyond the scope of the study, the authors could examine whether distinct SFSWAP domains, such as the SR and SURP domains, which likely overlap with phosphorylation sites, are necessary for regulating OGT intron 4 splicing.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer that the current work stops short of a detailed mechanistic study, and we have made every attempt to be circumspect in our interpretations to reflect that limitation. In addition, we are very interested in delving more deeply into the mechanistic aspects of this regulation. In fact, we have initiated many of the experiments suggested by the reviewer (and more), but in each case, rigorous interpretable results will require a minimum another year’s time.</p><p>For example, we have used crosslinking and biotin labeling techniques (using previously available reagents from Eclipsebio) to test whether SFSWAP binds RNA. The results were negative, but the lack of strong SFSWAP antibodies required that we use a transiently expressed myc-tagged SFSWAP. Therefore, this negative result could be an artifact of the exogenous expression and/or tagging. Given the difficulties of “proving the negative”, considerably more work will be required to substantiate this finding. As another example, we intend to develop a complementation assay as suggested. For an essential gene, the ideal complementation system employs a degron system, and we have spent months attempting to generate a homozygous AID-tagged SFSWAP. Unfortunately, we so far have only found heterozygotes. Of course, this could be because the tag interferes with function, the insert was not efficiently incorporated by homologous repair, or that we simply haven’t yet screened a sufficient number of clones. We’re confident that these technical issues that can be addressed, but they will take a significant amount of time to resolve. While we would ideally define a mechanism, we think that the data reported here outlining functions for SFSWAP in splicing represent a body of work sufficient for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Data presentation could be improved (specific suggestions are included in the recommendations section).

However, we have now indicated the number of up- and down-regulated events for consistency among the volcano plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) What is the overlap of differentially regulated events between the different analytical methodologies applied?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the degree of overlap between the three pipelines used in the paper using a Venn diagram (added to Suppl. Fig. S7). However, as widely reported in literature (e.g., Olofsson et al., 2023; Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2023; doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2023.02.053.), the degree of overlap between pipelines is quite low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) To further substantiate your conclusions, additional validations of RNA-Seq splicing data, ideally visualized on an agarose gel, would be valuable, especially for exons and introns regulated by SFSWAP, and particularly for OGT decoy exons in Figure 4c.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not included these experiments as we focused on other critiques for this resubmission. Because the RNA-seq, RT-PCR and RT-qPCR data all align, we are confident that the products we are seeing are correctly identified and orthogonally validated (Figs 2d, 4a, 4b, and 4c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It would be more informative if the CRISPR screen data were presented in a format where both the adjusted p-value and LFC values of the hits are presented.

Including a Sashimi plot would provide visual support for this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>The data suggesting that SFSWAP autoregulates its own transcript abundance were reported in Zachar et al. (1994), not from our own studies. Validation of those data with our RNA-seq data is confounded by the fact that we are using siRNAs to knockdown the SFSWAP RNA at the transcript level (Fig. S15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In the legend of Figure S2 the authors state that negative results are inconclusive because RNA knockdowns are not verified by western blotting or qRT-PCR. This is correct, but the reviewer would also argue that the positive results are also inconclusive as they are not supported by a rescue experiment to confirm that the effect is not due to off-target effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point with respect to the siRNA experiments on their own. However, the CRISPR screen was performed with sgRNAs, and MAGeCK RRA scores are high only for those genes that have multiple sgRNAs that up-regulate the gene. Examination of the SFSWAP sgRNAs individually shows that three of four SFSWAP sgRNAs had false discovery rates ≤10<sup>-42</sup> for GFP upregulation. Thus, the siRNAs provide an additional orthogonal approach. It seems unlikely that the siRNAs, and three independent sgRNAs will have the same off-target results. Thus, these combined observations support the conclusion that SFSWAP loss leads to decreased OGT intron retention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) For clarity in Figure 3a, consider using differential % spliced in or intron retention bar plots with directionality (positive and negative axis) and labeling siSFSWAP as the primary condition.</p><p>(12) Consider presenting Figure 5D as a box plot with a Wilcoxon test for statistical comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>For both points 11 and 12, we have tried the graphs as the reviewer suggested.

The conclusions are of general interest and advance the field significantly.</p><p>Some specific recommendations.</p><p>(1) The plots in Figure 3 describing SI and ES events are confusing to this reader.

Unfortunately, we were unable to identify a clearer way to present these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The model (Figure 6) is very useful but confusing. The legend and the Figure itself are somewhat inconsistent. The bottom line of the figure is apparent but I fear that the authors are trying to convey a more complete model than is apparent from this figure.

However, we have tried to generate a model that reflects our data, adds some speculative elements to be tested in the future, but remains as simple as possible. We are not quite sure what the reviewer was referring to as “somewhat inconsistent”, but we have attempted to clarify the model in the revised Discussion and Figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is unclear how normalization of the RNA seq experiments was performed (eg. Figure S5 and 6).</p></disp-quote><p>The normalization differences in Fig. S5 and S6 (now Fig S8 and S9) were due to scaling differences during the use of rmats2sashimiplot software.

However, there is no discussion of the various treatments with TG or OSMI. Might quantitation of these lanes not also show the desired effects of TG and OSMI on spliced transcript levels?</p></disp-quote><p>The strong effect of OGT knockdown masks the (comparatively modest) effects of subsequent inhibitor treatments on the reporter RNA. We have edited the results section to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 2c, why is the size difference between spliced RNA and intron-retained RNA so different in the GFP-probed gel (right) compared with the OGT-probed gel (left)? Even recognizing that the GFP probe is directed against reporter transcripts, and the OGT probe (I think) is directed against endogenous OGT transcripts, shouldn't the difference between spliced and unspliced bands be the same, i.e., +/- the intron 4 sequence. Also, why does the GFP probe detect the unspliced transcript so poorly?</p></disp-quote><p>The fully spliced endogenous OGT mRNA is ~5.5 kb while the fully spliced reporter is only ~1.6kb, so the difference in size (the apparent shift relative to the mRNA) is quite different. Moreover, the two panels in Fig 2c are not precisely scaled to one another, so direct comparisons cannot be made.</p><p>The intron retained isoform does not accumulate to high levels in this reporter, a phenotype that we also observed with our GFP reporter designed to probe the regulation of the MAT2A retained intron (Scarborough et al., 2021). We are not certain about the reason for these observations, but suspect that the reporter RNA’s retained intron isoforms are less stable in the nucleus than their endogenous counterparts. Alternatively, the lack of splicing may affect 3´ processing of the transcripts so that they do not accumulate to the high levels observed for the wild-type genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please provide more information about the RNA-seq experiments.

We have edited the methods section to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Relatedly, the several IGV screenshots shown in Figure 3C presumably represent the triplicate RNA seq experiments. In part D, how many experiments does the data represent? Is it a compilation of three experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Fig. 3d is derived from alternate splicing analysis performed on three biological replicates. We have added the number of replicates (n=3) on the figure to clarify this.
