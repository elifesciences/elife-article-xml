leading to saliva secretion are largely established, but factors that underlie secretory hypofunction, specifically related to the autoimmune disease Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) are not fully understood. A major conundrum is the lack of association between the severity of salivary gland immune cell infiltration and glandular hypofunction. SS-like disease was induced by treatment with DMXAA, a small molecule agonist of murine STING. We have previously shown that the extent of salivary secretion is correlated with the magnitude of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (Takano et al., 2021). Contrary to our expectations, despite a significant reduction in fluid secretion, neural stimulation resulted in enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with altered spatiotemporal characteristics in vivo. Muscarinic stimulation resulted in reduced activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, TMEM16a, although there were no changes in channel abundance or absolute sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Super-resolution microscopy revealed a disruption in the colocalization of Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels with TMEM16a, and channel activation was reduced when intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering was increased. These data indicate altered local peripheral coupling between the channels. Appropriate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is also pivotal for mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics. Disrupted mitochondrial morphology and reduced oxygen consumption rate were observed in DMXAA-treated animals. In summary, early in SS disease, dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals lead to decreased fluid secretion and disrupted mitochondrial function contributing to salivary gland hypofunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>xerostomia</kwd><kwd>Sjogrens diseas</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ signaling</kwd><kwd>IP3R</kwd><kwd>TMEM16a</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE014756</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takano</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a mouse model of Sjogren's disease, mitochondrial function and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling are disrupted resulting in altered coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and salivary gland hypofunction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Saliva plays crucial roles in oral health, including lubricating the mouth, maintaining pH balance, defense against microorganisms, aiding taste, and initiating digestion of macronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphrey and Williamson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>). Saliva is produced primarily by three major salivary glands; the submandibular gland (SMG), parotid gland (PG), sublingual gland (SLG), and some minor glands in the lower lip, tongue, and cheek. Saliva is generated in secretory acinar cells, with its content adjusted by ducts before reaching the mouth. The acinar cells are fundamental to the production of the primary salivary secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Paula et al., 2017</xref>). The fluid secretion process is driven by the trans-epithelial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup> across acinar cells. To accomplish vectorial movement of Cl<sup>-</sup>, acinar cells are polarized such that the basolateral plasma membrane (PM) faces the interstitium and is adjacent to blood vessels, while the apical PM forms a lumen with the distinct PM regions physically segregated by tight-junctional complexes. At the basolateral PM, Cl<sup>-</sup> is transported into the acinar cell cytoplasm against their electrochemical gradient <italic>via</italic> the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter, (NKCC1). Following mastication or the experience of the taste and the smell of food, the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) is released from parasympathetic nerves and acts on muscarinic receptors on the basolateral PM. Activated muscarinic receptors promote the production of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), and subsequently Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores <italic>via</italic> IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) situated in the ER in the extreme apical aspects of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Futatsugi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pages et al., 2019</xref>). Elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> activates a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel named TMEM16a that allows Cl<sup>-</sup> to move through the apical PM to the ductal lumen which is continuous with the salivary intercalated duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pedersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melvin et al., 2005</xref>). In turn, Na<sup>+</sup> moves through the paracellular space to balance the Cl<sup>-</sup> and water follows osmotically both paracellularly and through the water channel aquaporin5 (AQP5) to generate the primary saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melvin et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The importance of saliva is underappreciated in the absence of hypofunction. Reduced salivary secretion is termed xerostomia and can result from the iatrogenic effects of drugs, as collateral damage to salivary glands following radiotherapy for malignancy in the head and neck area, and commonly in SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saleh et al., 2015</xref>). SS is a chronic autoimmune disorder, that is predominantly manifested as profound dry eye and dry mouth as ultimately the immune system targets and destroys lacrimal and salivary gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tabbara and Vera-Cristo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramos-Casals et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mavragani and Basiaga, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brito-Zerón et al., 2016</xref>). SS can occur independently (primary SS, pSS) or concurrently with diseases such as arthritis or lupus (secondary SS, sSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiripolsky et al., 2017</xref>). SS affects millions of people, predominantly females in their fourth and fifth decades of life. While treatments can alleviate symptoms, there is no cure or intervention to halt its progression. The etiology of SS remains largely unresolved, but it’s believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, hormonal, and possibly viral factors, causing an aberrant immune response directed against the exocrine glands. The identification of SS usually is scored by the extent of salivary hypofunction, the degree of immune infiltration, evidence of damage to minor salivary glands observed following biopsy, and the presence of autoantibodies, such as anti-SSA (Ro) and Anti-SSB (La) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) which are classically found in SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mavragani and Basiaga, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brito-Zerón et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonsson et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, however, in the early phases of SS, there is minor immune infiltration and little overt damage to exocrine tissue despite profound hypofunction. Provocatively, these data indicate that loss of secretory tissue per se is not the causative event resulting in dryness early in the disease, and further indicates that a defect in the stimulus-secretion coupling mechanism precedes glandular destruction and possibly contributes to the progression of the disease.</p><p>Over the years, numerous mouse models both genetic and ‘induced’ have been developed to study the pathogenesis of SS, with each exhibiting specific aspects of the human condition, including glandular dysfunction, autoantibody production, and lymphocytic infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate the early events in SS, we concentrated on an SS model induced by the activation of the stimulator of the interferon gene (STING) pathway. This is thought to mirror the molecular response to bacterial/viral infection. STING is primarily located in the ER and plays a crucial role in the innate immune response, especially against DNA viruses and intracellular bacteria. Activation of STING occurs upon sensing cytosolic DNA as a result of cell damage or from microbial origin following infection. When cytosolic DNA is detected, it is first recognized by a sensor molecule called cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase). Binding to DNA prompts cGAS to generate cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), which, in turn, binds to and activates STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decout et al., 2021</xref>). Once STING is activated, it undergoes a series of transformations that ultimately result in the transcription of type I interferon genes, especially the gene encoding interferon-β (IFN-β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papinska et al., 2018</xref>). The production of type I interferons is a primary antiviral response and a significant characteristic of SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papinska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huijser et al., 2022</xref>). STING can be activated pharmacologically by exposure to 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9<italic>H</italic>-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA), which faithfully reproduces the immune response observed following physiological STING activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weiss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cerón et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the early events in the initiation of SS-like disease that lead to salivary gland hypo-function using the DMXAA SS model. We first utilized in vivo intravital imaging to investigate any potential dysregulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the DMXAA-induced SS mouse model. Paradoxically, the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels achieved following neural stimulation in mice treated with DMXAA were enhanced despite significantly reduced fluid secretion. Notably, however, the stereotypical spatial characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal were disrupted. Downstream of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, the activity of the TMEM16a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl channel stimulated by muscarinic secretagogues was reduced, despite no changes in the abundance or localization of the protein or absolute sensitivity to activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The intimate localization of IP<sub>3</sub>R and TMEM16a was, however, disrupted, contributing to the reduced activity of TMEM16a upon agonist stimulation as local peripheral coupling between channels is disrupted. Moreover, we observed disordered mitochondrial morphology, abundance, and function in the disease model. These data suggest that early in SS, reduced fluid secretion occurs because of a defect in the secretagogue activation of Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion. Further significant mitochondrial dysfunction is evident, possibly as a result of the aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that may contribute to the dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and/or progression of SS disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Saliva secretion is attenuated in both SMG and PG in the SS mouse model</title><p>Activation of the STING pathway in mice has been established as a model for the initiation of SS. This pathway is normally activated following exposure to foreign nucleic acids and is thought to mimic exposure of cells to DNA/RNA from viruses and bacteria. Activation of this pathway in salivary glands is characterized by initiation of a type-1 interferon response, mild immune cell infiltration, and a marked loss of saliva secretion without obvious morphological damage and, therefore, mimics the early clinical manifestations of SS disease. Thus, to investigate the early cellular events in acinar cells during the initiation of SS in mice, we chose to pharmacologically activate this pathway using DMXAA, a STING pathway agonist. As described in Methods, DMXAA (or control solution) was administered on day 0 and day 21 of the experimental timeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining in sliced SMG tissue indicated that STING protein was increased in SMG in the DMXAA-treated mouse on day 28, seven days after the final DMXAA administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) confirming the activation of the STING pathway. Whole saliva production from the major salivary glands was evaluated on day 28 following systemic stimulation with the muscarinic receptor agonist, pilocarpine. To avoid potential weight-related variations in saliva secretion, the total saliva output was normalized to the individual mouse’s body weight. Notably, the average saliva production was reduced from 130.1±48.96 mg in vehicle-treated mice to 63.71±30.41 mg in DMXAA-treated mice, a reduction in saliva production of 48.97% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consequently, DMXAA treatment resulted in 51.99% saliva production compared to vehicle-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, H&amp;E staining indicated that mild immune infiltration was observed in the DMXAA-treated mice with no overt changes to the morphology of the gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The mass of the SMG was also not significantly different in DMXAA vs. vehicle-treated animals, consistent with no loss of secretory tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that DMXAA-treated mice exhibit characteristics of early-stage SS and could be a useful model for investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying secretory dysfunction and advancing our understanding of the disease’s progression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deficiency in salivary secretion in 5,6-Dimethyl-9-oxo-9<italic>H</italic>-xanthene-4-acetic acid (DMXAA)-induced Sjögren's syndrome (SS) mouse model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic timeline for the generation of the SS mouse model.

Previous research in our lab has established the range and parameters for physiological stimulation of secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). The production of saliva was significantly diminished in DMXAA-treated animals compared with vehicle controls at stimulation frequencies of 7 and 10 Hz in SMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and at 5, 7, and 10 Hz in the PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings confirm that activation of the STING pathway reduces the function of both SMG and PG, consistent with the diminished production of whole saliva. Notably, the reduction in function of PG, the gland responsible for the majority of stimulated saliva secretion, was relatively greater than in SMG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Altered spatiotemporal characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the SS mouse model</title><p>An increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a central role in regulating the cellular machinery underlying the fluid secretion mechanism. In particular, as noted, an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is important for the activation of ion channels localized in particular domains of the polarized acinar cell which play a central role in saliva secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). Given that the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in salivary acinar cells are thought to be fundamental to the appropriate activation of the fluid secretion machinery, we evaluated whether hypofunction following DMXAA treatment resulted from dysregulation of the stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. Previous research in our lab developed a platform to study Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in vivo using Multiphoton (MP) imaging in transgenic mice engineered to express a genetic-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6f, specifically in acinar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). These mice were generated by crossing homozygous mice expressing the fast genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (B6J.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm95.1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup></italic>/MwarJ) floxed with a STOP cassette with heterozygous tamoxifen-inducible Mist1 Cre mice (B6.129-<italic>Bhlha15<sup>tm3(cre/ERT2)Skz</sup></italic>/J). The protocol for STING pathway induction was applied to the mice expressing GCamp6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Salivary gland function was assessed by the amount of pilocarpine-induced saliva secretion. The secretion deficiency observed in wild-type mice was recapitulated in these mice from a different genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We reasoned that decreased fluid secretion could result from reduced or dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in DMXAA-treated mice. Therefore, next, we compared the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal evoked by direct nerve stimulation in DMXAA-treated vs. vehicle control animals in vivo in SMG. SMG were stimulated at frequencies optimum for fluid secretion (1–10 Hz) for 10 s and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were recorded. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows standard deviation (SD)-projection images visualizing the spatial and amplitude changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the field of view during the entire period of stimulation at the indicated frequencies. In vehicle-treated mice, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at low stimulus strengths occurred in a minority of the cells and predominantly propagated below the apical PM. As the stimulation strength increased, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals became more pronounced, and more acinar cells responded. Strikingly, acinar cells in DMXAA-treated mice demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to stimulation. At lower stimulation strengths, a larger number of acinar cells responded, and the spatially averaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in these cells were notably larger when compared to those in the control group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows a time series of images following 7 Hz stimulation.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals stimulated following nervous stimulation in SMG are invariably initiated in the extreme apical pole of acinar cells and subsequently establish a standing gradient that dissipates rapidly to result in apically confined signals that do not substantially propagate to the basal aspects of the cell following physiological stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). We, therefore, investigated if the spatial characteristics of stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were altered in DMXAA-treated animals. SD image projections generated during the period of stimulation demonstrated that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase was tightly localized below the apical PM within the acinar cells in the vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We considered that a reduction in fluid secretion could conceptually occur by a reduction or mislocalization of TMEM16a protein, or by compromised muscarinic receptor-stimulated activation of the channel. Western blotting indicated the TMEM16a protein expression was comparable between the vehicle and SS mouse models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). In addition, immunolocalization using confocal microscopy demonstrated that TMEM16a localization remained largely unchanged in the SS mouse model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, a decrease in protein expression or mislocalization of the protein does not result in a reduction in stimulated saliva secretion. Similarly, the expression and localization of Aquaporin 5 were also not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We next investigated whether the activation of this ion channel was compromised in DMXAA-treated animals using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. In the absence of stimulation, no Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were observed in either vehicle or DMXAA animals following either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of –50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In the presence of 1 μM of the muscarinic agonist Carbachol (CCh), robust Cl<sup>-</sup> currents were measured in acini prepared from vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which were greatly reduced in DMXAA-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>).

We, therefore, next tested whether TMEM16a activity stimulated directly by 0.5, 1 or, 5 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the pipette solution (and thus globally in the cytoplasm) was altered in DMXAA-treated animals.

Therefore, we investigated how the activation of TMEM16a was affected by buffering the CCh-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> with slow and fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators. EGTA is a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer with slow kinetics, while BAPTA has much more rapid kinetics. Experimentally, BAPTA can quickly buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes close to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites and limit local activation of effectors within 20 nm. In contrast, EGTA has been shown to attenuate the rise in the bulk cytosol but is too slow to buffer local Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a restricted microdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eisner et al., 2023</xref>).

This autoimmune disorder affects exocrine glands including salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes, among other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramos-Casals et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mavragani and Basiaga, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brito-Zerón et al., 2016</xref>). SS animal models are crucial for understanding the pathogenesis, progression, and potential treatments for the disease, though like many animal models of disease, none can recapitulate all the aspects of SS. Currently, SS animal models are categorized as either those derived from genetically modified mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiripolsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yanfei Hu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2009</xref>) or those where disease is induced by specific agents or environmental factors. In the context of SS, DMXAA-induced SS can be used to mimic the early stages of the disease which might be triggered in response to bacterial or viral infection. This model is particularly effective in simulating type-1 interferon immune responses seen in early SS, which is thought to contribute to the initial glandular inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tabbara and Vera-Cristo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Papinska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Papinska et al., 2020</xref>). It should also be noted that DMXAA also has been reported to inhibit NAD(P)H quinone oxioreductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Phillips, 1999</xref>) and thus the potential increase in free radical load in cells could contribute to the phenotype. The rapid symptom manifestation of disease in the DMXAA-induced model offers an advantage for investigating the early development of SS disease since DMXAA induction is a temporally controlled process, allowing the precise staging of disease onset, thus facilitating studies on the initiating events and ultimately potential early intervention and prevention strategies.</p><p>Our studies investigated stimulus-secretion coupling when fluid secretion from SMG and PG in response to physiological stimulation was significantly reduced. Previous work has established a crucial link between an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and stimulation of fluid secretion in the salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>). Efficient secretion is reliant on the specific spatiotemporal regulation of secretagogue-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. Given this idea, our initial hypothesis was that a deficiency in secretion after DMXAA administration could be due to reduced or disrupted secretagogue-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. Indeed, previous work has revealed that in human SS patient acinar cells and the IL14α knock-in transgenic SS mouse model, CCh-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] signals were diminished. This reduction was attributed to lower expression levels of the IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and IP<sub>3</sub>R3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teos et al., 2015</xref>). To probe this hypothesis, we employed transgenic animals that express the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator-GCaMP6f specifically in the acinar cells. Firstly, we validated that the activation of the STING pathway leads to similar salivary gland hypofunction in this genetic background. Surprisingly, DMXAA treatment led to a striking increase in the magnitude of neurally-induced spatially averaged [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signals. This observation is not consistent with the loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins being responsible for reduced fluid secretion previously reported in other SS models. Indeed, the expression of IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins was unchanged following DMXAA treatment. The discrepancy could be attributed to the stage of SS disease represented by the previous studies, with our data presenting an earlier initiating phase of SS disease prior to progression, at a time point before any notable decrease in IP<sub>3</sub>R proteins has occurred. The molecular mechanism responsible for augmented global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals following DMXAA treatment requires further study. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release/influx, or conversely reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance might be responsible. It is tempting to speculate that reduced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and/or reduced PMCA and SERCA activity as a result of decreased ATP levels may contribute to enhanced cytosolic signals. Nevertheless, we suggest that the augmented Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals might represent a compensatory mechanism to drive fluid secretion in the face of compromised physiological stimulus-secretion coupling. Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were not reduced, the spatiotemporal characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal were markedly disrupted. Specifically, during neural stimulation, while in control animals there is a pronounced standing gradient of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] such that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is much greater in the apical <italic>vs</italic>. basal aspects of the cell, in DMXAA-treated animals this gradient is largely absent as large changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> are propagated to the basal regions of the cells. It is conceivable that the alteration in magnitude coupled with changes in the spatial characteristics of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal contributes to both the defect in fluid secretion and downstream cellular changes including mitochondrial damage to ultimately result in the progression of disease.</p><p>We investigated whether changes in the secretory machinery per se were altered in DMXAA-treated animals to result in hyposecretion. Salivary gland fluid secretion is dependent on TMEM16a facilitating CI<sup>-</sup> flux across the apical PM as the driving force for water transport paracellularly and through AGP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romanenko et al., 2010</xref>). The loss of either TMEM16a or AQP5 results in markedly attenuated fluid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romanenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsubota et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catalán et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>). These findings indicate that alteration in expression level, localization, or regulation of these channels could potentially impact fluid secretion. Notably, in DMXAA-treated mice, the AQP5 expression and localization remain unchanged, consistent with a study in human labial minor salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gresz et al., 2015</xref>). We next examined whether the TMEM16a channel function was compromised in the model. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed a significant decrease in TMEM16a activity following CCh-induced stimulation. Again, this reduced activity was not the result of overt mislocalization or lower expression levels of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). Interestingly, although the secretagogue-stimulated TMEM16a was reduced in acinar cells from DMXAA-treated animals, the sensitivity of the channel to direct activation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the patch pipette appeared unaffected. IP<sub>3</sub>R3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels on the ER are located approximately 50–100 nm from TMEM16a on the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pages et al., 2019</xref>). In this microdomain, confocal microscopy cannot easily distinguish the distinct localization of TMEM16a/IP<sub>3</sub>R, despite their localization on different membranes. However, STED super-resolution microscopy provides a much higher spatial resolution, achieving 20–80 nm to enable the differentiation of proteins within 20–80 nm of each other. Data using STED microscopy, suggest that the microdomain between apical ER IP<sub>3</sub>R3 and apical PM TMEM16a is disrupted in the disease model. The severe fragmentation of ER observed in EM images from DMXAA-treated animals also is consistent with an alteration in the relationship between ER and other intracellular domains. The disruption of the relative localization of these channels could conceivably result in diminished TMEM16a activity, if activation is dependent on the local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in its vicinity. Our data showing that the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer EGTA eliminates TMEM16a activation in the disease model, but that currents can still be evoked in vehicle-treated controls is consistent with the activation of TMEM16a by the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal surrounding the channel rather than the global cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the disruption of this apical microdomain likely alters the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that TMEM16a experiences leading to reduced activation and fluid secretion.</p><p>While changes in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] are vitally important for stimulating ion flux and hence fluid secretion, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also critical for numerous other physiological processes in salivary gland acinar cells. We focused on the potential effects of the dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal on mitochondrial morphology and function. Secretion is an energy-demanding process, necessitating a constant supply of ATP for numerous functions, including vesicle transport, protein modification, membrane fusion, and maintaining ion gradients. For example, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump generates the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, driving Cl<sup>-</sup> transport into the cytosol of acinar cells through NKCC1, and SERCA pumps replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. In this context, mitochondria are essential as they provide ATP, regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, supply metabolic intermediates, and coordinate with the ER to orchestrate cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Detmer and Chan, 2007</xref>). Notably, recent studies have highlighted that mitochondria are abundant and display varied positioning and dynamics in salivary gland cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Porat-Shliom et al., 2019</xref>). In SS patients, there are notable alterations in mitochondrial structure, including swelling and disrupted cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Correspondingly, mitochondrial-related genes, particularly those involved in metabolism, dynamics, and the electron transport complex, are significantly affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Our data, employing fluorescent immunostaining and EM, mirrors these findings in DMXAA-treated animals. We observed that mitochondrial morphology is altered such that mitochondria are more swollen and rounded, with dispersed cristae, similar to that reported in human SS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrera et al., 2021</xref>). Since optimal mitochondrial bioenergetics are also dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we assessed mitochondrial function by measuring the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using a membrane potential sensitive probe and the OCR using Seahorse technology. Our results show that in the SS mouse model, ΔΨm, which is critical for ATP synthesis, is diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). While the ATP-linked OCR remained unchanged, both the basal and maximal OCR were reduced. This suggests that mitochondrial functionality is compromised in the disease model, indicating a decreased capacity to respond to additional cellular stress. An intriguing question arises from these findings: are defects in the function of mitochondria a primary cause of fluid secretion loss in SS, or alternatively is this a consequence of disrupted [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regulation? Moreover, DNA from damaged mitochondria can activate the cGAS/STING pathway, leading to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decout et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that compromised mitochondria in early SS stages could trigger prolonged inflammation through the STING pathway, potentially contributing to SS progression. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective treatments to halt or slow the progression of SS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bagavant and Deshmukh, 2020</xref>). Briefly, 8–10 weeks old female C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT) mice (Jackson Laboratory; Jax 000664) received subcutaneous injections of DMXAA (Vadimezan; GC16280) at a concentration of 25 mg/kg of body weight on both day 0 and day 21 of the experimental timeline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The control mouse received vehicle (5% sodium bicarbonate; Sigma-Aldrich; S8761), the DMXAA solvent at the corresponding time points. Experiments were performed on day 28 of the experimental timeline. Animals had access to water and were fed ad libitum. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Rochester Committee on Animal Resources (UCAR-2001-214E).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Evaluation of saliva production</title><p>The mice were fasted for 2 hr prior to the evaluation of saliva production. The mice were anesthetized with a solution containing Ketamine (10 mg/mL) and Xylazine (1 mg/ml) by intraperitoneal injection (IP) at a dose of 7 μl/gm body weight over 2 min. The mouse was placed on a heating pad at 37℃ during experimentation. A Salimetrics Children’s swab (Salimetrics; Cat. no. 5001.05) was placed within the oral cavity of each mouse. The mice were administered the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (0.375 mg/kg body weight; Millipore Sigma; P6503) by IP injection. Two minutes after the pilocarpine injection, saliva was collected for the following 15 min. The saliva absorbed was subsequently separated from the moist swab through centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. The measurement of saliva weight served as a quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of whole saliva secretion. To measure neurotransmitter-stimulated saliva secretion more directly, the mouse was anesthetized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>) and a surgical incision was made in the skin to expose the submandibular gland (SMG). The surrounding connective tissue was excised to facilitate positioning within a custom-made 3D-printed gland holder. A pair of stimulation electrodes were attached to the duct bundle and the SMG. The pre-weighed filter paper was positioned within the oral cavity of the mouse to capture saliva secretion. Secretion was initiated by electrical stimulation sequences generated by a stimulus isolator (Iso-flex, A.M.P.I.) set at 5 mA, 200 ms, at frequencies of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 Hz with train frequency and duration (typically 1 min) controlled by a train generator (DG2A, Warner Instruments). The interval between each stimulus was 3 min. After stimulation, the filter paper was removed and weighed. The difference between the weight of filter paper before and after the electrode stimulation represented the saliva produced by the respective salivary gland during the given stimulation period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>To generate mice expressing a fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator in exocrine acinar cells, homozygous mice expressing the fast genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (B6J.Cg-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm95.1(CAG-GCaMP6f)Hze</sup></italic>/MwarJ) floxed by a STOP cassette, were crossed with heterozygous tamoxifen-inducible Mist1 Cre mice (B6.129-<italic>Bhlha15<sup>tm3(cre/ERT2)Skz</sup></italic>/J)A week before the DMXAA or 5% sodium bicarbonate injections, tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich; T5648) was given to the mice <italic>via</italic> oral gavage at a dose of 0.25 mg/g of body weight for three consecutive days to excise the loxP sites flanking the STOP codon allowing expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator within salivary glands. The mice were anesthetized and gland-exposed, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takano and Yule, 2022</xref>). The immobilized gland was secured within the holder using a cover glass and maintained in Hank’s salt solution (HBSS). Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was conducted in vivo via two-photon microscopy using an Olympus FVMPE-RS system equipped with an Insight X3 pulsed laser (Spectra-Physics) utilizing a heated (OKOLab COL2532) 25 x water immersion lens (Olympus XLPlan N 1.05 W MP). GCaMP6f was excited at 950 nm and emission collected between 495–540 nm, with images captured at 0.5 s intervals following stimulation for 10 s with 3 min between stimulation periods. Statistical analyses were performed with two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons using Prism (GraphPad) as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunofluorescent staining for sliced tissue</title><p>Following verification of decreased saliva secretion in mice, glands were processed for immunocytochemistry. Briefly, the isolated salivary glands were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4℃ overnight. The fixed gland was processed, embedded in paraffin, and subsequently sliced into 5 μm thick sections. Two temperature-induced antigen retrieval protocols were used either based on HIER buffer (10  mM Tris-base, 1  mM EDTA-dehydrate, pH 9.2) or sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). Gland sections were blocked with the 10% donkey serum in 0.2% PBSA (PBS + BSA) at room temperature (RT) for 1 hr. Sections were incubated with the primary antibody at 4℃ overnight (TMEM16a (Millipore Sigma; P6593; 1:250), Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (Abcam; ab2872; 1:250), ATP5A (Abcam; ab14748; 1:500), AQP5 (Abcam; ab239904; 1:500), STING (Cell signaling Technology, Cat. 13647; 1:500)). Following washing, the sections were then incubated with the secondary antibody at RT for 1 hr (Donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-21206; 1:500), Donkey anti-mouse Alexa 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A-21203; 1:500)). Nuclei were identified by incubation in DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat. 62248; 1:1000) at RT for 5 min. Tissue sections were mounted using Immu-Mount solution on a slide and then sealed under a coverslip. Images were acquired by Olympus FV1000MP confocal microscopy employing an Olympus UPlanSApo 60 x oil immersion objective. The analysis of images was performed using FIJI software. Statistical analyses were performed with a t-test using Prism (GraphPad) as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title><p>Acinar cells were allowed to adhere to Cell-Tak-coated glass coverslips for 15 min before experimentation. Coverslips were transferred to a chamber containing extracellular bath solution (155 mM tetraethylammonium chloride to block K<sup>+</sup> channels, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). Cl<sup>-</sup> currents in individual cells were measured in the whole cell patch clamp configuration using pClamp 9 and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Recordings were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Pipette resistances were 3–5 MΩ, and seal resistances were greater than 1 GΩ. Pipette solutions (pH 7.2) contained 60 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, 90 mM tetraethylammonium glutamate, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM HEDTA (N-(2-hydroxyethyl) ethylenediamine-N, N’, N’-triacetic acid) and 20 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub> were used to mimic physiological buffering and basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> conditions (~100 nM Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was estimated using Maxchelator freeware. Agonists were directly perfused onto individual cells using a multibarrel perfusion pipette. The pipette solution for the increased basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> contained hEDTA and a free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> of 500 nM, 1 mM, or 5 mM to induce calcium-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents without the addition of any agonists. Experiments comparing EGTA, BAPTA, and HEDTA effects upon chloride currents induced by CCh stimulation contained 5 mM free concentrations of the chelator and 100 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the patch pipette. Chloride currents following agonist application were monitored with a single voltage step to 80 mV from a holding potential of –80 mV every second until current magnitudes reached a plateau. Current-voltage relationships were obtained by 20 mV incremental steps between –80 mv and 120 mV from a holding potential of –50 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>STED microscopy</title><p>3D STED microscopy was performed using an Abberior Instruments Expert Line STED microscope equipped with an Olympus UPLSAPO 100x/1.4NA oil immersion objective. Briefly, lobules &lt;1 mm were isolated following injection of saline beneath the capsule with a 29-gauge needle. The connecting tissue was digested in 0.1 mg/ml collagenase containing image buffer at 37℃ for 5 min. Then isolated lobules were fixed in 100% methanone at –20℃ for 5 min, and subsequently were blocked with 10% BSA in 0.1% PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween20) at RT for 1 hr with gentle shaking. Isolated lobules were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (TMEM16a (Millipore Sigma; P6593; 1:300), IP<sub>3</sub>R3 (BD Transduction Laboratory; Cat. 610313; 1:200)). After being washed with 0.1% PBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at RT for 1 hr (STAR RED, goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Abberior, Cat#STRED-1001–500 UG; 1:1000), Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Cat#A-11037; 1:1000)). The tissue was mounted on the slides with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen; Cat. P36930). Sequential confocal and STED images were obtained following excitation of Alexa Fluor 594 and STAR RED by 594 and 640 nm lasers, respectively. Both fluorophores were depleted in three dimensions with a 775 nm pulsed STED laser. Z-stacks were obtained by collecting images at 50 nm intervals using the 3D STED mode. Rescue STED was employed to minimize the light dosage. Blend mode depth projection images were generated and fluorophore volumes and interfaces between these volumes were analyzed using FIJI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Seahorse XF cell mito stress assay</title><p>Isolated SMGs were finely minced and subsequently resuspended in a solution composed of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). To isolate acinar cells, the minced tissue was incubated in 0.5% BSA/HBSS containing 0.2 mg/ml of collagenase type II (Worthington; LS004204) for 30 min. Following this incubation, the suspension of cells was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 1 min and the cellular pellet was then resuspended in 40 μg/ml of Trypsin inhibitor (Millipore; Cat. 65035) to terminate further digestion. The function of mitochondria was assessed in isolated acinar cells by measurement of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) employing a Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test system (Agilent, USA). Briefly, Equal sized SMG cell pellets were suspended in buffer and 10 μl of the acinar cell suspension was seeded into individual wells of Seahorse cell culture microplates coated with 10 uL of Cell-Tak (0.25 mg/ml) and the OCR was determined utilizing the Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer following sequential exposure to 4 μg/ml oligomycin (Millipore Sigma; O4876), 4 µM carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP; Millipore Sigma; C2920), and 0.5 µM rotenone/antimycin (Millipore Sigma; R8875; A8674) to measure the quantification of basal respiration, ATP-linked respiration, and maximum respiration rate, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed with a t-test using Prism (GraphPad) as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential</title><p>Isolated SMG acinar cells were loaded with 20 nM Tetramethylrhodamine, Ethyl Ester (TMRE; ThermoFisher Scientific: T669), and 1 μM of MitoTracker Green (Invitrogen; M7514). Fluorescence of both TMRE and MitoTracker Green was captured simultaneously using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a 40 x oil immersion objective. The TMRE fluorescence was excited at 560 nm and emitted light collected at 574 nm; MitoTracker Green was excited at 488 nm and emitted light collected at 530 nm. Images were obtained every 1 s with an exposure of 20 ms and 4 × 4 binning using a digital camera controlled by TILL Photonics, TILLvision software. The acinar cells were exposed to 4 μM FCCP for 3 mins by perfusion to rapidly dissipate the membrane potential. Mitochondrial membrane potential was quantified as the change in the ratio of TMRE/MitoTracker Green fluorescence before and after the administration of FCCP. Statistical analyses were performed with a t-test using Prism (GraphPad) as indicated in the figure legends.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Finely minced salivary glands were homogenized in a lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete mini; Roche Diagnostics) for 16–20 strokes.

They show that in this model salivary secretion in response to neural stimulation is greatly reduced, even though calcium responses of individual secretory cells was enhanced. They attribute the secretion defect to reduced activation of Ca2+ -activated Cl- channels (TMEM16a), due to an increased distance between Ca2+ release channels (IP3 receptors) and TMEM16a which is expected to reduce the [Ca2+] sensed by TMEM16a. A variety of disruptions in mitochondria were also observed after DMXAA treatment, including reduced abundance, altered morphology, depolarization and reduced oxygen consumption rate. The results of this study shed new light on some of the early events leading to the loss of secretory function in Sjogren's syndrome, at a time before inflammatory responses cause the death of secretory cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Two-photon microscopy enabled Ca2+ measurements in the salivary glands of intact animals in response to physiological stimuli (nerve stimulation). This approach has been shown previously by the authors as necessary to preserve the normal spatiotemporal organization of calcium signals that lead to secretion under physiological conditions.</p><p>Superresolution (STED) microscopy allowed precise measurements of the spacing of IP3R and TMEM16a and the cell membranes that would otherwise be prevented by the diffraction limit. The measured increase of distance (from 84 to 155 nm) would be expected to reduce [Ca2+] at the TMEM16a channel.</p><p>The authors effectively ruled out a variety of alternative explanations for reduced secretion, including changes in AQP5 expression, and TMEM16a expression, localization and Ca2+ sensitivity as indicated by Cl- current in response to defined levels of Ca2+. Suppression of Cl- currents by a fast buffer (BAPTA) but not a slow one (EGTA) supports the idea that increased distance between IP3R and TMEM16A contributes to the secretory defect in DMXAA-treated cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the Ca2+ distribution in the cells was less restricted to the apical region in DMXAA-treated cells, it is not clear that this is relevant to the reduced activation of TMEM16a or to pathophysiological changes associated with Sjogren's syndrome.</p><p>Despite the decreased level of secretion, Ca2+ signal amplitudes were higher in the treated cells, raising the question of how much this might compensate for the increased distance between IP3R and TMEM16a. The authors assume that the increased separation of IP3R and TMEM16a (and the resulting decrease in local [Ca2+]) outweighed the effect of higher global [Ca2+], but this point was not addressed directly.</p><p>The description of mitochondrial changes in abundance, morphology, membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rate were not well integrated into the rest of the paper. While they may be a facet of the multiple effects of STING activation and may occur during Sjogren's syndrome, their possible role in reducing secretion was not examined. As it stands, the mitochondrial results are largely descriptive and more studies are needed to connect them to the secretory deficits in SJogren's syndrome.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97069.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes a very eloquent study of disrupted stimulus -secretion coupling in salivary acinar cells in the early stages of an animal model (DMXAA) of Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The study utilizes a range of technically innovative in vivo imaging of Ca signaling, in vivo salivary secretion, patch clamp electrophysiology to assess TMEM16a activity, immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and a range of morphological and functional assays of mitochondrial function. Results show that in mice with DMXAA-induced Sjogren's syndrome, there was a reduced nerve stimulation induced salivary secretion, yet surprisingly the nerve stimulation induced Ca signaling was enhanced. There was also a reduced carbachol (CCh)-induced activation of TMEM16a currents in acinar cells from DMXAA-induced SS mice, whereas the intrinsic Ca-activated TMEM16a currents were unaltered, further supporting that stimulus-secretion coupling was impaired. Consistent with this, high resolution STED microscopy revealed that there was a loss of close physical spatial coupling between IP3Rs and TMEM16a, which may contribute to the impaired stimulus-secretion coupling. Furthermore, the authors show that the mitochondria were both morphologically and functionally impaired, suggesting that bioenergetics may be impaired in salivary acinar cells of DMXAA-induced SS mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this is an outstanding manuscript, that will have a huge impact on the field.

The Authors have studied if altered calcium signaling might be a factor in SS development in a commonly used mouse model. They provide a thorough and straightforward characterization of the salivary gland fluid secretion, cytoplasmic calcium signaling and mitochondrial morphology and respiration. A special strength of the study is the spectacular in vivo imaging, very few if any groups could have succeeded with the studies. The Authors show that the cytoplasmic calcium signaling is upregulated in the SS model and the Ca2+ regulated Cl- channels normally localized and function, still fluid secretion is suppressed. They also find altered localization of the IP3R and speculate about lesser exposure of Cl- channels to high local [Ca2+]. In addition, they describe changes in mitochondrial morphology and function that might also contribute to the attenuated secretory response. Although, the exact contribution of calcium and mitochondria to secretory dysfunction remains to be determined, the results seem to be useful for a range of scientists.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>I appreciate the Authors' responses and am satisfied with the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97069.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Kai-Ting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>U.

The description of the disordered Ca2+ signal in the disease model was intended to simply convey that the Ca2+ signal is altered in the model. Whether or indeed how the altered spatial characteristics of the signal are deleterious is not known but we speculate in the discussion that this contributes to the ultrastructural damage observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2. Secretion is decreased but the amplitude of the globally averaged Ca2+ signals are increased. No proof is offered that the greater distance between IP3R and TMEM16a is the reason for decreased secretion in the face of this increased peak signal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added new data that indicates that the local Ca2+ signal is indeed disrupted in the disease model. We show that in control animals, activation of TMEM16a by application of agonist occurs when the pipette is buffered with the slower buffer EGTA but not with the fast buffer BAPTA In contrast, in cells isolated from DMXAA -treated animals both EGTA and BAPTA abolish the agonist-induced currents (new Figure 6). These data are consistent with our super resolution data showing the distance between IP3R and TMEM16a being greaterand thus presumably is enough to allow buffering of Ca2+ release from IP3R such that it does not effectively activate TMEM16a. These data also would suggest that the increased amplitude of the spatially averaged Ca2+ signal is not sufficient to overcome this structural change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3. Lack of evidence that the mitochondrial changes are associated with the defect in fluid secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a causal link between the decreased secretion and altered mitochondrial morphology and function is not established. Nevertheless, we feel it is reasonable to contend that profound changes in mitochondrial morphology observed at the light and EM level, together with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption are consistent with contributing to altered fluid secretion given that this is an energetically costly process. We have altered the discussion to reflect these caveats and ideas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their assessment of our work and constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful appraisal of our manuscript and insightful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 1: Are all the effects of DMXAA mediated through the STING pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point because as noted DMXAA has been reported to inhibit NAD(P)H quinone oxireductase that could contribute to the phenotype reported here. In future studies we intend to test other STING pathway agonists such as MSA-2 and perhaps antagonists of the STING pathway. We have added text to the discussion indicating that all the effects observed may not be a result of activation of the STING pathway.</p><p>Point 2: As noted, and clarified in the text, the driving force for ATP production is the electrochemical H+ gradient which establishes the mitochondrial membrane potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: The reviewer suggested there was a decrease mitochondrial membrane potential in the absence of a change in TMRE steady state.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion generated from the presentation of the figure. We normalized TMRE fluorescence against Mitotraker green fluorescence but as shown, the figure does not reflect that the absolute TMRE fluorescence was indeed decreased. Supplemental figure 4 now shows the basal TMRE fluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4: Indications that the disruption to ER structure seen in Electron Micrographs contributes to the changes in Ca2+ signal and fluid secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not focus on the relative distance between ER and apical PM in the EMs primarily because the ER that projects towards the apical PM is a relatively minor component of the specialized ER expressing IP3R and is difficult to identify. We note that the disruption of the bulk ER as quantitated by altered ER-mitochondrial interfaces and fragmentation is consistent with our super resolution data and thus likely plays a role in the mechanism that results in dysregulated Ca2+ signals and reduced secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations to Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>(1) The Editor suggests that we should use the activity of TMEM16a to directly measure the [Ca2+] experienced by the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present new additional data. First, we show an extended range of pipette [Ca2+] demonstrating identical Ca2+ sensitivity in DMXAA vs vehicle treated cells (Figure 5). Second, importantly, we now present data evaluating the ability of muscarinic stimulation to activate TMEM16a in the presence of either EGTA (slow Ca2+ buffer) or BAPTA (fast Ca2+ buffer). Notably, currents can be stimulated in control cells when the pipette is buffered with EGTA, but not in DMXAA treated cells. BAPTA inhibits activation in both situations (new Figure 6). These data are consistent with TMEM16a being activated by Ca2+ in a microdomain and that this is disrupted in the disease model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The Editor asks whether a decrease in IP3R3 in a subset of the samples could account for the decreased fluid secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is unlikely given, as noted by the Editor, that a reduction only occurred in a subset of the samples and statistically there was no significant difference to vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, we would note that there is also no difference in the expression of IP3R2 between experimental groups and in studies of transgenic mice where either IP3R2 or IP3R3 were knocked out individually, there was no effect on salivary fluid secretion, indicating that expression of a single subtype can support stimulus-secretion coupling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Absolute values for changes in fluorescence (over time) should be included together with SD images.</p></disp-quote><p>These have been added in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) DMXAA has additional effects to STING activation and thus other STING pathway modulators should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional STING agonists should be explored in the future but believe that this is beyond the scope of the present studies. Additional text has been added to the discussion acknowledging the additional targets of DMXAA and that they could contribute to the phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) No causal link between the observed Ca2+ changes and mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that no experimental evidence is offered to directly support this contention. Nevertheless, dysregulated Ca2+ signals are well-documented to lead to altered mitochondrial structure and function and thus we feel it not unreasonable to speculate that this is a possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The paper would be improved by directly assessing mechanistic connections between altered Ca2+ signaling and TMEM16a activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, please refer to point 1 and new figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>(1) Standard Deviation images should be explained and the location of ROI identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We contend that Standard Deviation images provide an effective visualization (in a single image) of both the magnitude of the Ca2+ increase and the degree of recruitment of cells in the field of view during the entire period of stimulation. We have added text to describe the utility of this technique. Nevertheless, we now show kinetic traces of the changes in fluorescence over time in both apical and basal regions in Figure 3. We also clarify that the traces shown in Figure 2 are averaged over the entire cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The Authors should consider that reduced secretion is because cells are dying.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this is unlikely given the lack of morphological changes in glandular structure and the minor lymphocyte infiltration observed in this model. Nevertheless, we now add data showing that the mass of SMG is not altered in the DMXAA-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated (Figure 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The role of mitochondria in the DMXAA phenotype is unclear. What is the effect of acutely de-energizing mitochondria on fluid secretion.</p></disp-quote><p>Since fluid secretion is an energetically expensive undertaking, it is not unreasonable to suggest that compromised mitochondrial function may impact secretion. That being said this could occur at multiple levels- production of ATP to fuel the Na/K pump to establish membrane gradients or to provide energy to sequester Ca2+ among a multitude of targets. This will be a subject of ongoing experiments. We contend that experiments to acutely disrupt salivary mitochondria in vivo while assessing fluid secretion would be difficult experiments to perform and interpret given that local administration of agents to SMG would not effect the other major salivary glands and systemic administration would be predicted to have wide-ranging off target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Could a subset of cells with low IP3R numbers contribute to reduced fluid secretion?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to Reviewing Editors point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) An attempt to estimate the effect of the spatial distruption of IP3R and TMEM16a localization should be made.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to Reviewing Editors point 1.</p><p>Minor Points</p><p>We have amended the statement form “Highly expressed” to increased.</p><p>Regions of the cell have been labelled for orientation in the line scans.</p><p>The molecular weight markers have been added in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>(1) Whether mitochondrial dysfunction is the initiator of the phenotype or a result of the dysregulated Ca2+ signal is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data does not clarify a classic “Chicken vs Egg” conundrum. We plan further experiments to address this issue. Future plans include repeating the mitochondrial and Ca2+ signaling experiments at earlier time points where we know fluid secretion is not yet impacted. This may potentially reveal the temporal sequence of events. Similarly, we plan experiments to mechanistically address why the global Ca2+ signal is augmented- reduced Ca2+ clearance or enhanced Ca2+ release/influx are possibilities. We speculate that reduced Ca2+ clearance, either because mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is reduced or as a secondary consequence of reduced ATP levels on SERCA and PMCA is a likely possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Measurement of ECAR and direct measurements of ATP and Seahorse methods.</p></disp-quote><p>In a separate series of experiments, we monitored ECAR. These data were unfortunately very variable and difficult to interpret, although no obvious compensatory increase was observed. We plan in the future to directly monitor ATP levels in acinar cells using Mg-Green. To normalize for cell numbers in the Seahorse experiments, following centrifugation, cell pellets of equal volume were resuspended in equal volumes of buffer. Acinar cells were seeded onto Cell Tak coated dishes. This information is added to the Methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
