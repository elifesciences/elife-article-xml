constitute the largest family of primary active transporters involved in a multitude of physiological processes and human diseases. Despite considerable efforts, it remains unclear how ABC transporters harness the chemical energy of ATP to drive substrate transport across cell membranes. Here, by random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID), we leveraged combinatorial macrocyclic peptides that target a heterodimeric ABC transport complex and explore fundamental principles of the substrate translocation cycle. High-affinity peptidic macrocycles bind conformationally selective and display potent multimode inhibitory effects. The macrocycles block the transporter either before or after unidirectional substrate export along a single conformational switch induced by ATP binding. Our study reveals mechanistic principles of ATP binding, conformational switching, and energy transduction for substrate transport of ABC export systems. We highlight the potential of de novo macrocycles as effective inhibitors for membrane proteins implicated in multidrug resistance, providing avenues for the next generation of pharmaceuticals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>combinatorial chemistry</kwd><kwd>conformational dynamics</kwd><kwd>ligand-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TA 157/12-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 807/P16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>789121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LOEWE DynaMem</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tampé</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20H05618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suga</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20am0101090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suga</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Research Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P15333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Obexer</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 807/P24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgner</surname><given-names>Nina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery, combinatorial macrocyclic peptides were leavaged that target a heterodimeric ABC transport complex and explore fundamental principles of the substrate translocation cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters utilize the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to move a vast variety of chemically distinct compounds across cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas and Tampé, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szakács et al., 2014</xref>).

ABC transporters are composed of two transmembrane domains (TMDs), forming the substrate translocation pathway, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), converting the chemical energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis into mechanic transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomas and Tampé, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>). The heterodimeric multidrug resistance transporter TmrAB from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> shares structural and functional homology with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and can restore antigen presentation in human TAP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nöll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>). TmrAB is particularly suitable for mechanistic and structural studies, as the various conformers along the translocation trajectory are only accessible at elevated temperatures, thus providing active control over the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nöll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zutz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diederichs and Tampé, 2021</xref>).</p><p>To correlate ATP binding and hydrolysis to substrate transport, several catalytic models for ABC systems have been depicted including alternating sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Senior et al., 1995</xref>), constant contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones and George, 2009</xref>), and processive clamp/ATP switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abele and Tampé, 2004</xref>). In all models, substrate translocation is coupled with conformational transitions, which are linked to the ATP hydrolysis cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas and Tampé, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Szöllősi et al., 2018</xref>). The conformational landscape of a heterodimeric ABC transporter has recently been elucidated through nine high-resolution X-ray and cryo-EM structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nöll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). To functionally integrate these conformers into the substrate translocation trajectory, we performed single-turnover transport studies using a variant with a slowdown in ATP hydrolysis. Using single liposome-based translocation assays, the unidirectional substrate export along a single conformational switch induced by ATP binding was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Many bioactive toxins, antibiotics, and inhibitors are macrocyclic peptides (CPs) with unnatural amino acid modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nicolaou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obexer et al., 2017</xref>). CPs are regarded as next-generation pharmaceutical compounds to target ‘undruggable’ proteins implicated in disease and diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morrison, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vinogradov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zorzi et al., 2017</xref>). To this end, various engineered and modified CPs are clinically approved or under clinical trials, for example, Peginesatide, Linaclotide, and Pasireotide. Compared to conventional small-molecule drugs, CPs usually display an elevated selectivity as well as an increased potency, and they are easy to manufacture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Driggers et al., 2008</xref>). The random nonstandard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) system comprises the identification of synthetic/de novo CPs against desired target protein complexes to enable structural and functional investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murakami et al., 2006b</xref>). As a major advantage, unnatural amino acids such as N-chloroacetyl-<sc>d</sc>-tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goto et al., 2008</xref>), N-methyl alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>), and carboranyl alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2019</xref>) can be incorporated by the Flexible In-vitro Translation (FIT) system, relying on aminoacylating ribozymes called Flexizymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goto et al., 2011</xref>) to construct highly diverse peptide libraries. Using the RaPID system, CPs were identified for receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2019</xref>), ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamagishi et al., 2011</xref>), the Zika virus protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nitsche et al., 2019</xref>), prolyl hydroxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McAllister et al., 2018</xref>), and phosphoglycerate mutases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the catalytic cycle and energy coupling of substrate translocation of a wild-type ABC transporter, we selected and identified high-affinity macrocyclic peptides against TmrAB applying the mRNA display-based RaPID system. Enriched CPs specifically bind to TmrAB and are high-affinity allosteric inhibitors, which prevent substrate transport and ATP turnover. Two mechanistically distinct CP inhibitor classes were elucidated that arrest the ABC transporter either before or right after ATP-binding induced substrate translocation. Thus, these CPs arrest TmrAB in the inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing conformation, respectively. Our work illustrates the important aspects of ATP binding and conformational switching for productive substrate translocation by a heterodimeric ABC transporter, and it also highlights the potential of CPs targeting transient conformers of membrane protein complexes to develop next-generation drug products.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of macrocyclic peptides</title><p>We elicited macrocyclic peptide binders against a heterodimeric ABC transport complex employing the RaPID approach. mRNA-encoded peptide libraries with 10–15 randomized amino acid positions were constructed by transcription of degenerate DNA templates, ligation of a puromycin linker, followed by FIT that relies on a reconstituted <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> translation system. The final library size was on the order of 10<sup>12</sup> macrocyclic peptides. Head-to-side chain cyclization was mediated through ribosomal incorporation of N-chloroacetyl-<sc>d</sc>-tyrosine at the initiator position, which post-translationally undergoes intramolecular thioether formation with a downstream cysteine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Catalytically reduced TmrA<sup>E523Q</sup>B (TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B) complexes reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs with biotinylated membrane scaffold proteins (MSP) were purified by gel filtration and used as bait on streptavidin magnetic beads for affinity selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Empty nanodiscs were utilized for library clearing, purging non-target specific binders from the peptide library. After five iterative rounds of selection, including in vitro translation, affinity panning, reverse transcription, and PCR recovery, high-affinity binders were identified by deep sequencing. Along the affinity selection, several unrelated peptide families were enriched which differed in amino acid composition and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). The most abundant macrocyclic peptides after the fifth selection round, CP6, CP12, CP13, and CP14, constituted 41% of the final sequenced pool and could not be grouped into families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For further analyses, CPs were produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis and extended by a linear C-terminal tail harboring a lysine residue for site-directed labeling by fluorescein (<sup>F</sup>) or biotin (<sup>B</sup>), yielding CP<sup>F</sup>s and CP<sup>B</sup>s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All CPs were cyclized in solution through thioether formation. In the case of CP6, the second cysteine at position 14 was utilized for cyclization, rather than cysteine at position 4, which emerged in the randomized region.

Subsequently, the occluded nucleotides were identified and quantified by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). As a reference, wild-type TmrAB was trapped by orthovanadate in a post-hydrolysis transition state, characterized by the stoichiometric (1:1) occlusion of ATP and ADP, which is in agreement with the 2.8 Å cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>).

In the presence of CP6<sup>F</sup> and CP12<sup>F</sup>, nucleotide occlusion was completely abolished.

To this end, wild-type TmrAB was reconstituted in liposomes with a diameter of ~160 nm at a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:20 (w/w), yielding a random (50/50) orientation, and a reconstitution efficiency of 95% as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>). This procedure resulted in ~30 transport-competent (NBDs outside) TmrAB complexes per liposome. In flow cytometry, single liposomes were gated based on side and forward scatter intensities and then used for the evaluation of mean fluorescence intensities of transported peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Along a single IF-to-OF switch and arrest by CP13<sup>F</sup> or CP14<sup>F</sup>, approx. 10 or 30 C4<sup>ATTO655</sup> peptides per liposome were transported, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). From that, a coupling ratio of 0.3 to 1.0 peptides per transporter along the ATP-induced IF-to-OF switch can be derived. These results are in agreement with the observation that CP13<sup>F</sup> or CP14<sup>F</sup> promote ATP occlusion and inhibit ATP hydrolysis of wild-type TmrAB by stabilizing a pre-hydrolysis state. In contrast, CP6<sup>F</sup> and CP12<sup>F</sup> completely prevented C4<sup>ATTO655</sup> peptide translocation. These findings are consistent with the results that CP6<sup>F</sup> and CP12<sup>F</sup> block C4F multiple-turnover transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and impair the IF-to-OF transition, as demonstrated by their preferential binding to the IF conformation and inhibition of nucleotide occlusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>).

Compared to the positive control in the absence of CP<sup>F</sup>s, CP13<sup>F</sup> and CP14<sup>F</sup> drastically reduced the peptide transport rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). For CP13<sup>F</sup>, a single turnover driving peptide transport was observed before wild-type TmrAB became conformationally arrested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the presence of CP14<sup>F</sup>, we noted a slow turnover of wild-type TmrAB driving peptide transport over a period of 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). To confirm the conformational arrest of wild-type TmrAB by CP13<sup>F</sup> and the slow turnover in the presence of CP14<sup>F</sup>, we examined two successive cycles of conformational transitions by flow cytometry. Liposomes containing wild-type TmrAB were incubated with C4<sup>ATTO655</sup> peptide, ATP/ADP, and CP<sup>F</sup>s for 5 min at 45°C to induce the IF-to-OF switch and for 60 min at 4°C to allow the OF-to-IF return transition. Both steps were repeated to yield two consecutive cycles of conformational transitions. In the presence of CP13<sup>F</sup>, peptide transport was exclusively observed along the first IF-to-OF switch, indicating a conformational arrest of wild-type TmrAB over a period of 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). For CP14<sup>F</sup>, peptide transport was detected in both IF-to-OF switches, which confirmed the slow relaxation of wild-type TmrAB from a pre-hydrolysis to an IF state between both cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

We reveal that CPs can be employed to arrest TmrAB at different stages during a single IF-to-OF switch induced by ATP binding, which drives substrate transport across the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These IF-to-OF and OF-to-IF inhibitors stabilize TmrAB states that are distinct from the vanadate trapped states and allowed us to unravel mechanistic principles of substrate transport for wild-type ABC transproters and illustrate the potential of selective inhibitors as next-generation antibiotics. These findings will help to investigate key functional determinants of membrane proteins involved in multidrug resistance.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Substrate translocation precedes ATP hydrolysis in a heterodimeric ABC transporter.</title><p>In the resting IF state, TmrAB binds nucleotides and substrates independently, which is not affected by CPs.

It has been shown that CPs are powerful agents to stabilize protein conformers or protein complexes for structural and functional investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Passioura and Suga, 2017</xref>). Upon cyclization of the peptide backbone, CPs mimic the complementary-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies penetrating into buried cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGeary and Fairlie, 1998</xref>). Compared to conventional antibodies and antibody fragments, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids largely expands the chemical diversity of paratopes to reach unexplored binding modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Craik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makley and Gestwicki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsomaia, 2015</xref>). By using the catalytically reduced variant TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs as bait during selections, we hypothesized that even transient states could be populated that would allow us to isolate macrocycles with unique bioactivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>). As demonstrated by affinity isolation, gel filtration, and native mass spectrometry, all CPs selected against TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B in lipid nanodiscs also specifically bind to wild-type TmrAB in various lipid models. These findings illustrate the potential of the RaPID system to identify specific binders for delicate membrane proteins and less-populated transition states under carefully chosen conditions, which is a key requirement for pharmaceutical compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vinogradov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zorzi et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, the most enriched macrocyclic peptides also display inhibitory activity, even though the selection is based on target binding alone. Based on deep sequencing, CP6 and CP12, acting on the IF state, showed higher enrichment than CP13 and CP14, acting on the OF state, which is consistent with the selections being performed at 4°C, where TmrAB adopts the IF state. However, due to high binding affinities of OF-specific CP13 and CP14, these CPs were also enriched along the course of the selection. In contrast to CPs elicited against the homodimeric ABC transporter cmABCB1 from <italic>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</italic> (aCAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kodan et al., 2014</xref>) and the MATE transporter (MaD3S, MaD5, MaL6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>), the CPs discovered in this study exclusively target the transporter from the cytosolic side. In the case of aCAP, which was selected against detergent stabilized P-glycoprotein, the CP not only interacts with both protein subunits but also with the membrane, acting as an allosteric inhibitor thus stabilizing this ABC transporter in the IF conformation. Like aCAP, the CPs from this study are also enriched in aliphatic and aromatic amino acids, which could indicate membrane interactions. The ability of the CP6, CP12, CP13, and CP14 to specifically interact with either the IF or OF TmrAB conformer however, again suggests that the success of this selection experiment in discovering multimode inhibitors relied on specific preparation of the bait protein during the selection process.</p><p>In recent years, the molecular understanding of the conformation space of ABC transporters has been largely expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas and Tampé, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Locher, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). High-resolution structures in different conformational states allowed to build a detailed mechanistic model of the substrate transport cycle composed of two major conformational transitions (IF-to-OF and OF-to-IF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manolaridis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Chen, 2018</xref>). We demonstrated unidirectional substrate transport along a single IF-to-OF switch induced by ATP binding for a catalytically reduced variant of TmrAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>). These results were consistent with the processive-clamp/ATP switch model where ATP binding and the subsequent IF-to-OF switch represent the power stroke to drive substrate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins and Linton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abele and Tampé, 2004</xref>). To date, however, it remains an open question whether a single ATP-binding-induced conformational switch drives substrate translocation in the case of fully functional wild-type ABC transporters. Additionally, the relevance of futile ATP hydrolysis cycles as well as factors contributing to energy coupling (ratio of consumed ATP per translocated substrate) have remained unexplained for wild-type TmrAB and other ABC systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bock et al., 2019</xref>). To address these pressing questions, we used the in vitro-selected peptidic macrocycles as mechanistic probes to arrest TmrAB at different stages of the substrate transport cycle. Inhibitors for ABC transporters exploit various modes of action such as substrate competition, conformational arrest, or hampering of ATP hydrolysis to affect substrate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Srikant and Gaudet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozvegy-Laczka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Orlando and Liao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For the selected CPs, we observed a remarkably strong inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport, which did not largely interfere with ATP or substrate binding. We rationalized that these macrocyclic peptides affect conformational transitions within the translocation cycle. Using nucleotide occlusion as readout, we could show that CP13<sup>F</sup> and CP14<sup>F</sup> stabilize wild-type TmrAB in a pre-hydrolysis state, unlike the vanadate-trapped state solved by cryo-EM, which occludes ADP and vanadate in the canonical ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). Our hypothesis was that wild-type TmrAB in the presence of CP13 or CP14 is able to perform the the IF-to-OF transition induced by ATP binding, whereas only the opposite OF-to-IF transitions triggered by ATP hydrolysis are blocked. To test this hypothesis, we performed peptide transport assays with fully functional wild-type TmrAB in the presence of CP13 and CP14 and determined stoichiometric or near-stoichiometric amount of transported peptide per TmrAB complex. This coupling rate is comparable to the almost ideal coupling ratio observed under single-turnover conditions for a catalytically reduced variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>). This energy coupling is substantially higher compared to multiple-turnover steady-state approaches for wild-type TmrAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bock et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>By analyzing peptide translocation of arrested wild-type TmrAB over long periods of time, we observed a slow turnover in the case of CP14, and a full conformational arrest for CP13. These observations were underpinned by analyzing two consecutive cycles of IF-to-OF switches and OF-to-IF return transitions in regard to peptide translocation. In the presence of CP14, wild-type TmrAB was able to transport peptides along the ATP-induced IF-to-OF switch followed by the relaxation from an ATP-bound OF state to an IF state in order to start a new IF-to-OF switch in the second cycle. In contrast, after the translocation of peptide, CP13 arrested wild-type TmrAB in an ATP-bound state and prevented the OF-to-IF return transition and further conformational cycling. On the other hand, CP6 and CP12 block peptide transport to background level as an IF-to-OF transition and ATP occlusion is prevented. Using macrocyclic inhibitors, we demonstrated, for the first time for a wild-type ABC transporter, that substrate translocation is driven along a single IF-to-OF switch triggered by ATP binding.</p><p>In this work, we utilized synthetic macrocyclic inhibitors to reveal fundamental mechanistic principles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, conformational transitions, and energy coupling of substrate translocation of a heterodimeric ABC transport complex. We highlight the versatility of macrocycles and their potential to study mechanistic determinants of membrane protein complexes. In future approaches, conformation-selective compounds along with single-liposome or single-molecule techniques will be essential to uncover unexplored aspects of conformational transitions, translocation events, and energy coupling of membrane translocation complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Monoclonal α-His antibody</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>SAB1305538</td><td>Mouse origin.

The product was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2012</xref>). Puromycin-modified RNAs were translated by FIT supplemented with 50 μM ClAc-D-Tyr-tRNA<sub>fMet</sub><sup>CAU</sup> for 30 min at 37°C at an RNA-puromycin concentration of 1 μM. The used FIT system was deficient in RF1, <sc>l</sc>-methionine, and 10-formyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolic acid to allow reprogramming of the initiator position. Subsequently, EDTA (10 mM) was added, followed by reverse transcription using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Dynabeads M280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen) were loaded with TmrA<sup>EQ</sup>B reconstituted in biotinylated lipid nanodiscs (binding capacity: 0.3 pmol/μl bead slurry) for 20 min at 4°C. Beads were washed with selection buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.001% Pluronic F127) supplemented with acetylated BSA (1 g/l, Nacalai Tesque). Subsequently, the mRNA-peptide library was added and incubated for 15 min at 4°C (without supplementing additional reducing agents). The beads were washed three times with selection buffer followed by elution of cDNA in Phusion buffer for 5 min at 95°C. Recovered cDNA was quantified by real-time PCR using Taq polymerase and SYBR Green and amplified by Fusion polymerase (NEB).

NovaPEG Rink amide resin (Merck Millipore) was used as the solid support, giving rise to C-terminal amides. A combination of HBTU/HOBt (1/1, six equivalents) was utilized for carboxylate activation during the coupling steps. Double couplings were performed for Arg residues. To allow on-resin labeling and cyclization, orthogonally protected amino acids – Fmoc-Lys(MMT)-OH and Fmoc-Cys(StBu)-OH – were used, respectively. Chloroacetylation of the N terminus was achieved by manual coupling of chloroacetic acid using HBTU/HOBt (1/1, 10 equivalents) on resin for 1 hr. For site-directed labeling, the MMT protection group of the C-terminal lysine was cleaved by repeated incubations with 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 5% (v/v) triisopropyl silane (TIPS) in dichloromethane (DCM). The resin was washed with DCM, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 20% (v/v) N,N-diisopropylethylamine in DMF, DMF, methanol, and DCM. Deprotected lysine side chains were conjugated with 5/6-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (ThermoFisher Scientific) or <sc>d</sc>-biotin in combination with HBTU/HOBt. The resin was dried and incubated with TFA/2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol (DODT)/TIPS/water in a 92.5/2.5/2.5/2.5 (v/v) ratio for 2.5 hr at 20°C. Excess TFA was removed using GeneVac centrifugal evaporators (SP Industries), and peptides were precipitated and washed six times with diethylether on ice. Peptides were dissolved in 90% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in water, and the pH was adjusted to 10.0 by addition of triethylamine. For complete macrocyclization, samples were incubated at 20°C for 2 hr. TFA was added to reduce the pH to a value between 1.0 and 2.0. For CP6<sup>F</sup>, the StBu protection group of Cys was removed by adding 20 equivalents of tributylphosphine in 95% (v/v) trifluoroethanol in water. CP6<sup>F</sup> was pre-purified by reversed-phase (RP) HPLC using a SNAP C<sub>18</sub> column (Biotage) on an Isolera-One system (Biotage), applying a linear acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA. All macrocycles were purified by RP-HPLC on a Prominence LC-20AP system (Shimadzu) equipped with a Chromolith column (Merck Millipore) applying a linear acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA.

the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB from Thermus thermophilus to generate high-affinity macrocyclic peptides (MCPs) with conformational-specific preferences. The MCPs reveal novel, allosteric binding sites in TmrAB, which do not inhibit ATP or substrate binding, but block ATP hydrolysis. The MCPs are used as tool compounds to provide evidence that ATP binding, rather than ATP hydrolysis, is sufficient to drive substrate export in this highly-coupled ABC exporter. The authors further demonstrate that MCPs can be generated for membrane proteins embedded in nanodiscs, rather than in detergent, which is an important technical step for peptide-based drug discovery.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;De-novo macrocyclic peptides dissect energy coupling of a heterodimeric ABC transporter by multimode allosteric inhibition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including David Drew as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an excellent technical and mechanistic work describing the discovery and characterization of macrocyclic peptides (MCPs) that target the heterodimeric ABC transporter TmrAB from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>. It is significant because it reports on the discovery of at least two distinct classes of MCPs that trap TmrAB in distinct states, and the authors use these unique MCPs as powerful probes to provide new insight into the catalytic mechanism of TmrAB. The MCPs reveal novel allosteric binding sites in TmrAB and provides evidence that ATP binding, rather than ATP hydrolysis, is sufficient to drive substrate export in this highly-coupled ABC exporter. Overall, this work 1) introduces potent and selective modulators of the model TmrAB transporter, 2) provides key mechanistic insight into the still unsettled transport mechanism of TmrAB through pharmacological arrest, and 3) highlights the potential of MCPs as pharmacological tools and their potential as early drug leads.</p><p>1. While Figure 5A/B are very welcome data, the authors do not systematically determine the affinity of all four MCPs in the liposome and detergent conditions that are used interchangeably throughout this study. Given the potential impact on Kd (i.e. CP6 shows an apparent 6-60-fold decrease in affinity from the liposomes to DDM condition), it seems of particular importance that the K<sub>off</sub> for CP14 can be established (ideally at 45 degrees) in order to fully understand it's propensity to disassociate (i.e. bind/unbind) during the time course and temperature changes of the experiments presented in Figure 5C/D, and Figure 6E, since this has clear implications for the authors present interpretations as summarized in Figure 7. We would expect SPR experiments in detergent and liposomes (or nanodiscs) are important data to present &quot;IF&quot; these experiments are technically achievable. If not, Ki measurements of the CP's for C4-peptide uptake in liposomes with 50:50 orientation, should be able to provide a proxy for the binding affinity that should correlate with the preferences of the peptides for the OF or IF states as determined here in detergent.</p><p>Comments for authors:</p><p>Manuscript strengths:</p><p>1.

Over this period of time, we detected the co-elution of CPs and TmrAB with minute amounts of unbound CPs, demonstrating the formation of kinetically stable complexes. With regard to the experiments shown in Figure 5C/D, nucleotide occlusion was recorded immediately after trapping and rapid gel filtration. In Figure 6E, the proteoliposomes were not washed and the CPs were added at 1 µM, which was up to 50-fold above the equilibrium dissociation constant of CPs to yield high occupancy. In both cases (Figure 5C/D and 6E), CPs were added in excess, and no extensive washing steps were introduced.</p><p>Therefore, we assumed a high occupancy of CPs in the course of the experiments, as depicted in Figures 5C/D and 6E. It is technically extremely challenging and demanding to investigate the accurate binding and dissociation rates by SPR for small molecules and large membrane protein complexes. Although the determination of these rates might increase the impact of this work, we do not feel, that in the COVID-19 situation, this information would largely change the conclusion described in the initial submission. In addition, we have characterized two mechanistically similar inhibitors, additional experiments with the inferior inhibitor CP14 would not produce any other results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments for authors:</p><p>[…] Manuscript weaknesses; support of claims and conclusions:</p><p>1.

The currently described MCPs are not able membrane permeable and so cannot be used in vivo without further chemical modification.</p></disp-quote><p>These peptides were only characterized in in vitro systems. In this context, passive membrane permeability can be excluded. Passive membrane permeability is dependent on peptide conformations that shield all groups involved in hydrogen bond formation (including backbone amides and polar side chains) so that the peptide can, in rare cases, partition into the lipid bilayer. With regard to in vivo contexts, cell permeability is also achieved via endocytosis or endocytosis-like pathways amongst other mechanisms. In this regard, cell permeability has been observed for various RaPID peptides (e.g. Kawamura <italic>et al.</italic> DOI: 10.1038/ncomms14773, Dai <italic>et al.</italic> DOI:10.1038/ncomms14773). Since we did not perform in vivo experiments, which are also beyond the scope of this work, we cannot comment on cell permeability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

If the CPs abolished ATPase activity how is it possible that substrate transport is only partially inhibited by CP13 and CP14 (line 135/136) since transport depends on ATPase activity?</p></disp-quote><p>This question brings up a very important aspect of our manuscript, because many mechanistic determinants of asymmetric ABC transporters remain elusive: What defines the origin of the power stroke that drives unidirectional substrate transport? Which factors control the energy coupling of consumed ATP per translocated substrate? Which conformational transition drives unidirectional substrate transport? To address these key questions in the field, we evolved high-affinity, conformation-selective macrocyclic peptides by combinatorial design using the RaPID system and deep sequencing. The identified macrocyclic peptides arrest the ABC transport complex before and after the power stoke trajectory. For the first time to our knowledge, macrocyclic peptide inhibitors are used to realize single-turnover analyses of a wildtype ABC transporter to extend quantitative mechanistic determinants, a strategy which has not yet been realized with antibody fragments.</p><p>In our study, we demonstrate that selected macrocycles are not simple competitive inhibitors as they block ATP hydrolysis and substrate transport at nanomolar concentrations, while retaining ATP or substrate binding. Macrocycles interact in an allosteric, conformation-selective manner and stabilize a pre-hydrolysis state of the ABC transporter. By employing these macrocyclic peptides, the transport cycle can be dissected in single-turnover events, demonstrating an energetically coupled substrate transport step of a wildtype transporter along a single IF-to-OF switch induced by ATP binding.</p><p>Single-turnover studies are of immediate relevance to membrane transporters and highlight the potential of peptidic macrocycles as next-generation drugs targeting elaborate membrane protein complexes implicated in multidrug resistance. We outline a general framework to identify selective inhibitors against delicate membrane proteins that can be applied to almost any medically relevant protein complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
