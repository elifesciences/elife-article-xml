understood. In this study, we demonstrate that T cell-specific deletion of the IL-6 receptor α chain (IL-6Rα) results in impaired Th1 and Th17 T cell responses in vivo, and a defect in Tfh function. Depletion of Tregs in these mice rescued the Th1 but not the Th17 response. Our data suggest that IL-6 signaling in effector T cells is required to overcome Treg-mediated suppression in vivo. We show that IL-6 cooperates with IL-1β to block the suppressive effect of Tregs on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, at least in part by controlling their responsiveness to IL-2. In addition, although IL-6Rα-deficient T cells mount normal primary Th1 responses in the absence of Tregs, they fail to mature into functional memory cells, demonstrating a key role for IL-6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01949.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01949.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01949.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body's ability to defend itself against pathogens relies on two distinct but connected systems: the innate and the adaptive immune systems. Innate immune cells survey their environment and use receptors located on their surface to distinguish between molecules that are harmless and molecules that stem from pathogens. When the cells of the innate immune system detect a pathogen, they secrete signaling molecules to alert adaptive immune cells to the invaders. Both sets of immune cells then mount a coordinated attack that usually kills the pathogen.</p><p>The adaptive immune system also produces memory cells that retain information about the pathogen: this allows the organism to mount a fast and efficient immune response the next time the same type of pathogen strikes. However, it is not completely understood how the innate immune system communicates with the adaptive immune system to allow these processes to take place.</p><p>One of the signaling molecules involved in the communication between different types of immune cells is a protein called Interleukin 6 (IL-6). This protein must be produced in order to trigger the immune response: however, many immune cells are able to recognize and respond to IL-6, so it has been difficult to study its impact on specific cell types.</p><p>Nish et al. have now investigated the effects of IL-6 on T cells, one of the main types of adaptive immune cell, by creating mice with T cells that are not able to recognize IL-6. The detection of pathogens by innate immune cells normally has several effects: the population of T cells increases; the T cells produce daughter cells—T helper cells—that support innate immune cells in killing pathogens; and memory cells are formed. Nish et al. find that these responses are impaired in the mutant mice.</p><p>To understand why, Nish et al. turn to T regulatory cells; these are adaptive immune cells that control the strength of the immune response. These experiments show that when T cells are ‘blind’ to IL-6, they are more sensitive to the action of T regulatory cells, and this disturbs the delicate balance between the stimulation and inhibition of the immune system. Nish et al. go on to show that IL-6 works together with another signaling molecule, Interleukin 1, to regulate how the T cells respond. The work helps to explain how the adaptive immune system mounts an immune response against pathogens but not against the host's own tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01949.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01949.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>t cell</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI046688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medzhitov</surname><given-names>Ruslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI055502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medzhitov</surname><given-names>Ruslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK071754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medzhitov</surname><given-names>Ruslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Medzhitov</surname><given-names>Ruslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IL-6 signaling in T cells controls how sensitive they are to suppression by T regulatory cells, and the way mature to become memory T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immune recognition is mediated by a variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004</xref>), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Martinon et al., 2009</xref>), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis, 2009</xref>), and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>), all of which recognize conserved molecular structures specific to microbes (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs) and activate adaptive immune responses through the induction of DC maturation. The DC maturation process involves a redistribution of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules from intracellular endocytic compartments to the cell surface, increased expression of costimulatory molecules, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which is essential for the activation of naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banchereau and Steinman, 1998</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that TLR-induced DC maturation and migration to the draining lymph nodes, in the absence of TLR-induced inflammatory cytokines, is insufficient for the induction of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004</xref>). T cell responses are controlled by naturally occurring CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs), which play an important role in maintaining immune tolerance and homeostasis. Accordingly, the absence of Foxp3, the lineage-defining transcription factor that is critical for the generation and function of Tregs results in the development of a fatal autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fontenot and Rudensky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakaguchi, 2005</xref>). We previously found that cytokines produced by DCs following TLR activation are critical for releasing responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from suppression by Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003</xref>). Based on in vitro experiments as well as the analysis of complete IL-6 KO mice, we implicated IL-6 as a mediator for this block of suppressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003</xref>). However, the pleiotropic nature of IL-6 has made it difficult to assess the T cell-specifc function of this cytokine in vivo.</p><p>IL-6 has been previously described as a B cell growth factor, an initiator of acute phase responses, and a mediator of T cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimura et al., 2003</xref>). Recently, IL-6 has also been implicated in the differentiation of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. IL-6 has been demonstrated to be an important cytokine that governs the differentiation of Th17 cells. In particular, it is thought to regulate the switch between the induction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>). Stimulating T cells with TGF-β results in the induction of Foxp3, whereas combining TGF-β with IL-6 represses Foxp3 expression and induces retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR)-γt, resulting in the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ivanov et al., 2006</xref>). IL-6 has also been suggested to be essential for the differentiation of the T follicular helper (Tfh) cell lineage, which is defined by expression of the markers CXCR5 and programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Treating T cells with IL-6 leads to the upregulation of the transcriptional repressor B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), a process that is thought to drive Tfh cell generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>). Tfh cells specialize in providing help to germinal center (GC) B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vinuesa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">King et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The IL-6 receptor complex consists of the ligand-binding subunit, the IL-6Rα chain, and the signal-transducing subunit, gp130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Taga et al., 1989</xref>), which is a common signaling transducer for several cytokines including IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and IL-35. Homodimerization of gp130 upon IL-6 binding results in the activation of the gp130-associated tyrosine kinases JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of the transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimura et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to the membrane-bound receptor, a soluble form of the IL-6Rα chain can be generated through either alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage and is capable of binding to IL-6 and activating cells through association with gp130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimura et al., 2003</xref>). Although both IL-6-deficient mice and mice bearing a T cell-specific deletion of gp130 have been used to examine the in vivo function of IL-6 in T cell responses, the pleiotropic nature of IL-6, as well as the promiscuous use of the gp130 signaling subunit, has complicated these analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimura et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the T cell-specific role of IL-6 signaling in vivo has remained poorly understood.</p><p>In the present study, we therefore used mice carrying a T cell-specific ablation of the IL-6Rα chain, in order to investigate the role of IL-6 in the induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses following TLR activation. Our data not only confirm an important function for IL-6 in Th17 cell differentiation, but also reveal a critical role for IL-6 in the induction of the Th1 cell response in vivo. IL-6 enables T cell activation by acting on responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to make them less sensitive to the suppressive activity of Tregs, in part by blocking Treg-mediated inhibition of IL-2Rα expression in responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in cooperation with IL-1β. Although not absolutely required for the generation of Tfh cells, we also found that IL-6 signaling is important for the ability of these cells to provide help to B cells. In addition, we reveal a role for IL-6 in the generation of functional memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are impaired in the absence of T cell-specific IL-6 signaling</title><p>To examine the function of IL-6 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in vivo, we generated mice in which T cells were specifically deficient of the IL-6Rα by crossing a floxed allele of <italic>Il6ra</italic> with mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the CD4 promoter (hereafter called IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice). Since the Cre-encoding transgene is expressed at the double positive stage in thymic development, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the periphery of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice failed to express the IL-6Rα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Importantly, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice remained deficient of the IL-6Rα after immunization with Ovalbumin (OVA) and LPS emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) as a carrier, suggesting that the release of the soluble form of the IL-6Rα during the immune response does not restore IL-6 signaling in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was blocked in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to control wild-type (WT) T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To evaluate whether deficiency of the IL-6Rα on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compromised the gp130-dependent signaling axis, we stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in vitro with α-CD3e and α-CD28 mAbs in the presence of gp130-dependent cytokines and measured the phosphorylation of STAT3 1 hr later by Western blot. Addition of IL-6 to the cells phosphorylated STAT3 very effectively in WT cells but not in IL-6Rα-deficient cells, thus confirming the results obtained by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, the addition of the soluble form of the IL-6Rα (sIL6Rα) together with IL-6 rescued the phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells whereas IL-11, OSM, or CNTF did not phosphorylate STAT3 in either wild-type or IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that the STAT3-dependent signaling pathway remains intact in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and that other tested cytokines of the IL-6 family do not play a major role in the activation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We therefore demonstrate efficient deletion of the IL-6Rα and abrogation of IL-6 signaling in T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01949.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impairment of both Th1 and Th17 responses in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of the IL-6Rα chain by CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT and IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice was examined by flow cytometry in naive mice (upper panels) and in mice immunized with OVA plus LPS in IFA (lower panels).

Specifically, IL-6 has been shown to protect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from α−CD3-induced apoptosis and Fas-mediated cell death in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, complete IL-6-deficient mice were reported to have reduced T cell numbers in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimura et al., 2003</xref>). We therefore examined how IL-6Rα deficiency affects T cell homeostasis. We verified that complete IL-6-deficient mice had decreased numbers of T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, we found that the absolute numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the thymus and lymph nodes of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were similar to that of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with WT levels of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, we did not observe an increased tendency of IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to undergo apoptosis. These cells became activated (CD44<sup>hi</sup>, CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) and cleaved caspase-3 to the same extent as control cells upon stimulation with α-CD3 and α-CD28 in vitro, irrespective of the presence of IL-6 in the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Likewise, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the thymus or peripheral lymphoid organs of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice stained positive for annexin V in similar proportions as WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-6 signaling in T cells is dispensable for T cell homeostasis. Thus, the reduced T cell numbers in complete IL-6-deficient mice are likely a consequence of IL-6 regulating T cell homeostasis indirectly through other cell types.</p><p>Next, we determined whether IL-6 signaling in T cells is required for the initiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses by immunizing IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> and WT mice with OVA plus LPS in IFA. 7 days following immunization, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells purified from the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were co-cultured with irradiated WT splenocytes from naïve mice, as antigen-presenting cells, in order to examine the recall response to OVA. We found that T cells isolated from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice showed impaired proliferation upon restimulation with the antigen as measured by [<sup>3</sup>H]-thymidine incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice failed to produce IL-17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In order to confirm this phenotype and characterize the IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice further, we also tested for the induction of Th17-dependent autoimmune diseases in these mice. IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> T cells failed to induce colitis when transferred into RAG2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>) and compared to WT mice, IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were also resistant to the induction of EAE following immunization with MOG<sub>35-55</sub>/CFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Thus, the Th17 response of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice was defective, which was expected given the role of IL-6 in Th17 differentiation. However, immunization of the IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with OVA and LPS in IFA also revealed a profound defect in the Th1 response as IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells failed to secrete robust amounts of IFN-γ after restimulation with antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We obtained similar results following immunization with OVA and other TLR ligands, such as peptidoglycan (PGN), CpG DNA, or the more complex Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>).</p><p>To address whether the defective cytokine production in in vitro restimulation assays were a consequence of defective proliferation and/or T cell differentiation, we also analyzed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and cytokine production using CFSE labeling and intracellular cytokine staining, respectively. We confirmed that T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were impaired in their ability to proliferate following restimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although we observed an overall reduction in T cell proliferation, a small fraction of T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice proliferated normally as assessed by CFSE dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and were able to produce IFN-γ at similar levels as WT cells. The cells remained deficient in IL-17, regardless of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results suggest that the defect in the IFN-γ response is not due to a requirement for IL-6 in the differentiation of IFN-γ-producing cells. Instead, our results imply that the IFN-γ response is deficient in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice as a consequence of impaired T cell proliferation. Conversely, the deficient IL-17 response, regardless of proliferative status, reflects a dual requirement of IL-6 for both CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and differentiation of IL-17 producing T cells.</p><p>The experiments so far assessed the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response after restimulation with OVA in vitro<italic>.</italic> Staining CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with MHC class II tetramers is a way to track antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells more directly. In contrast to class II tetramers using OVA-derived peptides, 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers, which stain CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that are specific for the 2W peptide, offer a better staining performance. Furthermore, naive 2W-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are more frequent than OVA-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which facilitates the in vivo analysis of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moon et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore opted to track antigen-specific T cells with 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramers following immunization with 2W peptide and LPS in IFA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moon et al., 2007</xref>). To ensure that the choice of a different antigen did not affect the phenotype of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, we first immunized the mice with the 2W peptide and measured the proliferation and IFN-γ secretion following restimulation in vitro<italic>.</italic> IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not expand and secrete IFN-γ efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). Antigen-specific 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were also less frequent in these cultures compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). These results resembled those obtained with OVA-based immunization and demonstrated that the choice of antigen did not affect the outcome of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. We thus tracked antigen-specific 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells directly in vivo. We found that the percentage of 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup> CD44<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice compared with the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Moreover, relative to WT mice, IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice had fewer numbers of cells in their lymph nodes on day 7 after immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), which resulted in lower absolute numbers of antigen-specific T cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Although the percentage and absolute number of 2W:I-A<sup>b+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were significantly reduced in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice on day 7 following immunization, we found that the small proportion of remaining IL-6Rα-deficient CD4+ T cells in these mice proliferated to a similar extent as the WT, if not slightly better, as assessed by BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Consistently, we failed to see a difference in cell death between WT and IL-6Rα-deficient CD4+ T cells on day 7 following immunization as determined by active Caspase-3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Collectively, these results confirm the expected role of IL-6 signaling in Th17 differentiation, but they also reveal a role for IL-6 signaling in regulating T cell expansion and the subsequent induction of Th1 responses in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IL-6 signaling is required in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to render them refractory to Treg-mediated suppression in vivo</title><p>We previously showed that IL-6 produced by DCs following TLR activation is required to overcome Treg-mediated suppression in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether impaired T cell responses in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice are due to unopposed suppression by Tregs in the absence of IL-6 signaling. To test this possibility, IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice were either left untreated or injected with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD25, which resulted in the depletion of approximately 80% of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) prior to immunization with OVA and LPS in IFA. While CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with an intact Treg compartment showed impaired proliferation and production of IFN-γ upon restimulation, these responses were largely rescued upon depletion of Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This result suggests that IL-6 may control T cell responses by overcoming the suppressive effect of Tregs.

One possibility is that IL-6 targets conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in order to make them refractory to Treg-mediated suppression. Therefore, in the absence of IL-6 signaling, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells would remain susceptible to suppression by Tregs. Alternatively, IL-6 might target Tregs directly to block their suppressive activity. To test this latter possibility, we generated IL-6Rα<sup>FL/FL</sup>; Foxp3<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice (hereafter called IL-6Rα<sup>TREG-KO</sup> mice) to specifically delete the IL-6Rα in Tregs. We found that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>TREG-KO</sup> mice proliferated normally and produced both IFN-γ and IL-17 at similar levels as WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells following immunization with OVA and LPS in IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). These findings demonstrate that, at least under the experimental conditions used here, IL-6 signaling is not required in Tregs, and instead IL-6 acts on conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to make them less sensitive to the suppressive effect of Tregs.</p><p>To further rule out the possibility that the difference that we see in the response of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice after immunization is due to altered Treg function in the absence of IL-6 signaling, we sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> IL-6Rα-deficient Tregs to examine their ability to suppress proliferation of purified conventional C4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>−</sup> T cells. We found that IL-6Rα-deficient Tregs were able to inhibit the proliferative response of WT responder CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to the same degree as WT Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have shown reciprocal regulation of Tregs and Th17 cells and demonstrated that IL-6 inhibits TGF-β-driven induction of Tregs and induces the production of IL-17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, mice bearing a T cell-specific deletion of gp130 as well as IL-6-deficient mice have been shown to have elevated numbers of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs in their secondary lymphoid organs, although this has not been universally observed for the latter mouse strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korn et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2008</xref>). Therefore, it remained possible that in the absence of the IL-6Rα, Tregs were abnormally expanded in vivo, resulting in the defective T cell proliferation observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. To address this, we immunized IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with OVA and LPS in IFA and analyzed the percentages of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells. We found no significant increase in the proportion of these cells among CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In support of this notion, we also did not detect significant expansion of antigen-specific Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells following immunization with 2W peptide and LPS in IFA and the absolute numbers of Tregs were lower in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice compared with WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that expansion of induced Tregs or impairment of their function in the absence of IL-6 signaling does not account for the diminished CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response, at least under the experimental conditions used here. Instead, IL-6 signaling is required in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to render them refractory to Treg-mediated suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IL-6 signaling is not essential for Tfh cell development, but is important for their function</title><p>Induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses is essential for mounting productive T cell-dependent B cell responses.

However, when we immunized IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice with OVA and LPS in IFA and examined Tfh cell percentages 7 days later by staining for CXCR5 and PD-1, we found only a modest reduction of Tfh cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. In these mice, the frequency of Tfh cells, which were also ICOS<sup>hi</sup> and PSGL-1<sup>low</sup>, was reduced by approximately 25% compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), suggesting that IL-6 signaling in T cells does not play an essential role in Tfh cell development, and that IL-6 may affect Tfh cell development indirectly. We then examined Tfh cell function by several approaches. First, we determined the structure of the GCs and the location of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the GCs in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> and WT controls by immunofluorescence. However, we did not observe obvious changes in the GC structure in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice 14 days after immunization with OVA plus LPS in IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also did not observe a strong reduction in the number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells within the GCs of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Next, we analyzed the expression of Bcl-6, the lineage-defining transcription factor for Tfh cells, and IL-21, the Tfh cell-associated cytokine essential for GC formation and antibody production. Indeed, Tfh cells from both WT and IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice upregulated both Bcl6 and IL-21 when compared to non-TFH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). However, IL-6Rα-deficient Tfh cells failed to reach WT levels of expression for either of the two genes, suggesting a defect in the function of these cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01949.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tfh cells generated in the absence of IL-6 signaling have reduced expression of Bcl-6 and IL-21.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequency of CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> PD-1<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells in draining lymph nodes of WT and IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice 7 days following immunization with OVA and LPS in IFA (left panels).

Previously, we demonstrated that while depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs in MyD88-deficient mice restored the primary Th1 cell response, the memory response remained defective in these mice after OVA and LPS in IFA immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004</xref>). This result suggested that a MyD88-dependent signal(s) was required for the generation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Because IL-6 is produced in a MyD88-dependent manner following TLR activation, we investigated whether memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses were dependent on IL-6. First, we determined whether IL-6 signaling is required for the generation or maintenance of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We therefore immunized IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and WT controls with 2W peptide and LPS in IFA in the presence or absence of Tregs and tracked antigen-specific T cells 30–60 days later by 2W:I-A<sup>b</sup> tetramer staining.

Memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can be divided into different subsets based on expression of CXCR5 and PD-1, which are used to identify CXCR5<sup>−</sup> PD-1<sup>−</sup> Th1 effector memory cells, CXCR5<sup>int</sup> PD-1<sup>−</sup> Th1 central memory cells and CXCR5<sup>hi</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>).

Thus, we depleted Tregs twice, prior to the first immunization with either OVA or 2W and again prior to secondary challenge with OVA or 2W 60 days later. This was done because Tregs recover approximately 2 weeks after α-CD25 treatment. We then monitored the memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response after in vitro restimulation. Although depletion of Tregs in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice rescued primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and the induction of IFN-γ-producing cells following OVA and LPS in IFA immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), this was not sufficient for the generation of memory Th1 responses.

Since T cell responsiveness to IL-2 is important for T cell proliferation, we examined the expression of the IL-2 receptor α chain (CD25) by CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>−</sup> responder T cells in the culture on day 3. We found that expression of CD25 by these cells was inhibited in the presence of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, addition of exogenous IL-6 to these cultures resulted in partial recovery of CD25 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Because the effect of IL-6 was partial, we investigated whether other cytokines could fulfill a similar function as IL-6. Separate work in our laboratory indicated that IL-1 may also operate in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore wondered whether IL-6 and IL-1 cooperate in mediating this function.

As expected, CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells failed to proliferate following stimulation with α-CD3ε/CD28 mAbs, when equal numbers of Tregs were added to the culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, the addition of either IL-6 or IL-1β resulted in a partial recovery of proliferation and the presence of both IL-6 and IL-1β in the culture medium allowed CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to proliferate at similar levels as CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells stimulated in the absence of Tregs. These data therefore implied that the IL-6 and IL-1-induced maintenance of CD25 expression in the presence of Tregs enabled CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells to proliferate.</p><p>Next, we asked whether Tregs also have an affect on the expression levels of other cytokine receptors of CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells and, if so, whether IL-6 and IL-1 can reverse this effect. Indeed, Tregs suppressed the expression of the receptors for IL-12 and IFN-γ, two cytokine receptors that are essential for the generation of Th1 responses, and the suppression of these two cytokine receptors was rescued by the addition of IL-6 and IL-1 to the culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We obtained similar data for the expression of the IL-21 receptor and the common γ-chain, although the expression levels for these receptors changed more moderately (data not shown). The regulation of all these receptors, including CD25, occurred at the transcriptional level as the RNA expression of the corresponding genes largely mirrored the protein expression on the cellular surface (data not shown).</p><p>Tregs suppress T cell responses by multiple mechanisms, including via the release of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-β and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shevach, 2009</xref>). To determine whether inhibitory cytokines associated with Tregs can suppress expression of CD25 and whether their activity is countered by IL-6, purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were stimulated in the presence of either TGF-β alone or TGF-β with IL-6. We found that treating T cells with TGF-β also resulted in impaired expression of CD25 in responder T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the negative effect of TGF-β on CD25 expression was hindered when exogenous IL-6 was added to the culture. Additionally, we found that IL-1β also functioned similarly to IL-6 in countering the negative effect of TGF-β on expression of CD25. Moreover, adding both IL-6 and IL-1β resulted in greater recovery of CD25. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-6 cooperates with IL-1β to counter Treg suppression by maintaining T cell responsiveness to IL-2 and other cytokines important for the proliferation and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This mode of action for IL-6 and IL-1β may therefore indeed be a part of the mechanism that renders CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells refractory to Treg-mediated suppression in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Difference in ribosomal genes between IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> and WT mice</title><p>The gene expression profile of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice after immunization with protein and LPS is different from the profile of wild-type T cells and T cells from MyD88<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, whose phenotype is similar to that of IL6-Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>).

However, we found the most striking difference between IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and wild-type controls in ribosomal genes. A large number of these genes were down-regulated in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that protein synthesis is impaired in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which presumably negatively affects proliferation and cytokine secretion in these cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>IL-6 is one of the most pleiotropic cytokines that acts on multiple cell types and regulates many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamimura et al., 2003</xref>). Consequently, the role of IL-6 signaling specifically in T cells has been very difficult to evaluate. In this study, we focused on a specific question about IL-6 signaling, namely its role in the connection between TLR activation and the generation of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Using mice bearing a T cell-specific deletion of the IL-6Rα, we found that the absence of IL-6 signaling in T cells resulted in abrogated expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and impaired development of Th1 and, as expected, Th17 cells following immunization with TLR agonists as adjuvants. In the steady state, IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice had similar numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as their WT counterparts and we did not observe an increase in the fraction of apoptotic T cells in the thymus or periphery of these mice. These results indicate that the impairment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice was not due to a T cell-intrinsic defect in survival in the absence of IL-6 signaling. Because we had previously demonstrated that cytokines produced by DCs in response to TLR activation, in particular IL-6, render CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells refractory to Treg-mediated suppression in vitro, we hypothesized that the defect in T cell responses in these mice might be caused by unopposed suppression by Tregs. Indeed, depletion of CD25<sup>+</sup> Tregs restored the development of the Th1 response in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, while the Th17 response was not rescued, which is consistent with the role of IL-6 in the differentiation of Th17 cells. Moreover, deleting the IL-6Rα specifically in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs revealed that IL-6 signaling is not required in these cells for the generation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and instead suggested that IL-6 signaling in conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was critical for the generation of a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. Collectively, these data therefore support a model in which IL-6 signaling in naive T cells makes them refractory to the suppressive activity of Tregs in vivo.</p><p>We found that Tfh cells were generated following immunization of IL-6Rα T-KO mice, albeit at moderately reduced frequencies, suggesting that IL-6 is not essential as an instructive signal for the induction of this T cell lineage. STAT3 has been demonstrated to be important for Tfh cell differentiation after protein immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nurieva et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, in the absence of IL-6 signaling, another STAT3-dependent cytokine such as IL-21 might compensate for IL-6 in inducing the development of Tfh cells. Indeed, IL-21 has been demonstrated to play an important role in Tfh cell generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nurieva et al., 2008</xref>). Tfh cells play a critical role in providing help for GC B cells. Therefore, to examine the effects of IL-6 on Tfh cell function, we analyzed GC formation, plasma cell differentiation and antibody production in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. Although Tfh cells could develop in these mice, there was a reduction in the GC compartment size the percentage of plasma cells and, importantly, the amount of antigen-specific antibodies following immunization. Defective IL-6 signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells affected predominantly the titers of antigen-specific IgG2c, while the titers of antigen-specific IgG1 were only modestly reduced. In this context, it is interesting to note that IFN-γ, the signature cytokine of Th1 cells, is important for class-switch recombination (CSR) to IgG2c. The role of Tfh cells in the initiation of CSR has not been fully understood. Under conditions of Th2 immunity, Tfh cells have been identified as the major source of the IL-4 and IFN-γ required for the induction of CSR to IgG1 and IgG2c, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>). In analogy, defective IFN-γ secretion by Tfh cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice may cause the impairment of the IgG2c response in these mice. Indeed, we found substantial amounts of Tfh cells in the T cell assays with which we measured IFN-γ secretion, which would be consistent with this view (data not shown). Alternatively, it is possible that under the conditions used in our study, CSR is already initiated outside of the GCs and the absence of a functional Th1 response negatively influences CSR to IgG2c. Regardless of these possibilities, however, our data collectively demonstrate that IL-6, while dispensable for the generation of Tfh cells, plays a nonredundant role in the function of these cells. Interestingly, depletion of Tregs recovered the antigen-specific IgG2c titers in IL-6α<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, suggesting that the activity of Tfh cells is negatively regulated by Tregs and this negative control is opposed by T cell-intrinsic IL-6 signaling.</p><p>Tregs have been demonstrated to suppress T cell responses by a variety of mechanisms including the sequestration of IL-2 by Tregs or the production of inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-β, IL-10, and IL-35. In search of the mechanism by which IL-6 counteracts the suppressive activity of Tregs, we found that both Tregs and TGF-β inhibited expression of CD25 on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and this inhibition could be partially prevented by IL-6 and completely prevented by the combined effect of IL-6 and IL-1. Studies have shown that IL-1 is important for Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Volpe et al., 2008</xref>). IL-1 has been demonstrated to augment Th17 differentiation induced by IL-6 in combination with TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veldhoen et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that IL-6 induces the upregulation of the IL-1R and that this effect is a pre-requisite for the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this view, our own gene expression studies on antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from immunized IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> and MyD88<sup>T-KO</sup> mice also revealed a downregulation of the IL-1R in antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the absence of IL-6 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>). While further studies are required to determine whether this particular mechanism also applies to other T cell lineages, it appears that IL-6 and IL-1 cooperate not only in the induction of Th17 differentiation but also in the generation of a Th1 response. In the context of the latter response, our work demonstrates that IL-6 and IL-1 are both important to overcome Treg-mediated suppression, perhaps in part by cooperating in the maintenance of the sensitivity of CD4<sup>+</sup> responder T cells to IL-2 and other relevant instructive cytokines such as IL-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>). It is likely that other cytokines or cytokine combinations may play a similar role in other types of T cell responses, depending on the pathogen and PRRs involved. It should be noted in this regard that several cytokines, including IL-15, have been shown to render CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells resistant to the suppressive activity of Tregs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben Ahmed et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, we found that similar to IL-6 and IL-1, IL-15 is also able to counter Treg-mediated downregulation of CD25 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This raises the possibility that control of CD25 expression on naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells may be a common mechanism utilized by different cytokines induced by different pathways of innate immune recognition. It was previously demonstrated that IL-15 overcomes Treg-mediated suppression by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI-3 kinases), which are key regulators of cell growth, survival, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben Ahmed et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, both IL-6 and IL-1 have also been implicated in the initiation of PI-3 kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hideshima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madge and Pober, 2000</xref>). This raises the possibility that the similarity in the ability of these cytokines to maintain the sensitivity of responder T cells to IL-2 signals in the presence of Tregs may be due to their shared function in inducing this important signaling pathway. Further studies are needed to determine whether inhibiting the PI-3 kinase pathway downstream of IL-6 and IL-1 signaling results in a failure to rescue the down-regulation of CD25 expression and susceptibility to Treg-mediated suppression. It should also be noted that while control of CD25 expression may be applicable to naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and the Th1 differentiation pathway, other stages of T cell responses (e.g., memory response) and other differentiation pathways (e.g., Th17 and Tfh) are likely to be counter-regulated by IL-6 and Tregs through a different control point. The counter-regulation by IL-6 and Tregs in these cases may still rely on the same principle, that is, regulated expression of a receptor for an autocrine cytokine that controls cell expansion and maintenance. Possible candidates include IL-21 and the IL-21R (for Tfh and Th17 cells), and IL-4 and the IL-4 receptor for Th2 cells. Indeed, our in vitro studies indicate that IL-6 and Tregs may also counter-regulate the IL-4Rα, IL-21R, and the common γ-chain (data not shown). Future studies will need to address this possibility in vivo.</p><p>We investigated the changes in the cellular pathways in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by GSEA of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells on day 7 after immunization. The late time point allowed us to obtain enough cells for the analysis but likely missed important changes in the gene expression at early stages of the immune response. Thus, the observed changes in the cellular pathways in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T might be biased by the presence of IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that have escaped the Treg-mediated control mechanisms. This caveat of the analysis aside, we did observe a repression of STAT3-induced genes, thereby confirming the general approach of the analysis. IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells up-regulated cell cycle genes during the late stage of the immune response. At this point, the cell may attempt to proliferate, particularly in light of the lower absolute numbers of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, but are unable to do so because of a failure to induce ribosome production. The latter observation, namely a defect in the up-regulation of ribosome-associated genes in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, appeared to be one of the most significant changes in these cells. Interestingly, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells heterozygous for the ribosomal protein S6, which is also down-regulated in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, increase their size after TCR stimulation but fail to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sulic et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, increased ribosome production accompanies increased cytokine production following TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Asmal et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, decreased ribosome generation may be a consequence of Treg-mediated suppression in the absence of IL-6 signal. Further studies will be required to elucidate this aspect.</p><p>After microbial infection, a population of memory precursor cells are generated that progressively differentiate into functionally mature, long-lived memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui and Kaech, 2010</xref>). It is currently unknown whether particular cytokines produced during infection are required for the differentiation and maintenance of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Previously, using MyD88-deficient mice, we showed that a TLR-induced signal was necessary for the formation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2004</xref>). However, the nature of the signal was unclear at the time. In the present study, we found that although depleting Tregs rescued the primary Th1 response in the absence of IL-6 signaling in T cells, the memory response was still defective. Furthermore, we found that antigen-specific memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were still generated, even though the IFN-γ response was impaired in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. This result suggests that IL-6 signaling is required for the generation of functionally competent memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Importantly, in a parallel study, we found that the functionally competent memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also depend on T cell-specific IL-1 signaling, suggesting that IL-6 and IL-1 cooperate in this aspect of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schenten et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, it is interesting to note that STAT3-dependent cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, and IL-21, as well as MyD88-dependent IL-1 have been suggested to play a role in memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation and functional maturation following immunization and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foulds et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinrichs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castellino and Germain, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yi et al., 2010</xref>). The fact that both IL-6Rα- and MyD88-deficient memory cells persist for several months following the primary immunization suggests that other signals control the maintenance of these cells.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that T cell-intrinsic IL-6 signaling plays a critical role in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, differentiation, and memory formation. Moreover, we have shown that IL-6 in cooperation with IL-1β counteract the suppressive activity of Tregs by maintaining CD25 expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, cytokines induced upon innate immune recognition, including IL-6 and IL-1, can control activation of adaptive immune responses by rendering antigen-specific T cells refractory to suppression by Treg cells. Disregulation of this mechanism may also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The generation of the conditional <italic>Il6ra</italic> allele has been published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wunderlich et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor and two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>While we find your work of potential interest, the reviewers have raised substantial concerns, as you find below, that in our view need to be addressed before we can consider publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Should further experimental data allow you to address these criticisms, we would be happy to look at a revised manuscript.</p><p>We have extracted the main points to address here:</p><p>1) In many of the in vivo studies it is not clear whether the actions of IL-6 signaling in T cells are cell intrinsic functions. It would be fairly straightforward to make bone marrow chimeras with WT and IL-6RKO bone marrow and track the fate of IL-6RKo T cells in terms of primary and secondary responses and sensitivity to Treg mediated suppression. Some information on proliferation versus cell survival pathways in the various T cell functions analysed would increase mechanistic insight.</p><p>2) The authors nicely complement their previous studies showing that IL-6 overcomes the suppressive function of Treg cells. They present evidence in vitro for impaired cytokine receptor expression. However it is widely appreciated that an vitro suppression assay bears little resemblance to T-reg mediated suppression in vivo. Some further validation of the in vitro results in vivo would increase impact of the findings.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>. The authors conclude that impaired colitis following transfer of IL-6Rako T cells is due to diminished Th17 differentiation. Nuerath and colleagues showed in 2000 (Nat Med) that lack of IL-6 in this model leads to T cell apoptosis. This may explain the results presented here and the authors should measure T cell accumulation following transfer as well as cytokine production to support their conclusions.</p><p>4) In most of the studies, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and cytokine production were examined in mixed populations (in the presence of CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg cells). So, just wondering whether the intrinsic proliferation and cytokine production of specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations were impaired once IL-6 signaling is abrogated? Especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, for the proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells after in vitro restimulation assays, were the irradiated splenocytes derived from wild type mice? It may be better to use wild type antigen-presenting cells (e.g., DC) to replace splenocytes since these cells derived from WT or IL-6Rα KO mice may be different.</p><p>5) Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, FACS analysis of IFNγ and IL-17 may be required for understanding the effects of IL-6 signaling on the specific T cell populations.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors used Treg depletion to illustrate IL-6 effects. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>, Treg cells were also affected by IL-6Rα deficiency. Whether IL-6Rα deficiency affects the suppressive functions of Treg cells/per cell should be clarified in addition to the analysis of Treg numbers.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, IL-15 could also overcome inhibitory effects of Treg cells. Since IL-15 and IL-6 signals via different signaling pathway, the authors may need to discuss the potential molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon.</p><p>8) IL-6Rα-deficient mice were used in this study. However, one possibility that needs to be excluded is the off-targets effects of KO. Did the authors examine the rescue effects of IL-6Rα or gp130 signaling on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and differentiation? The authors should discuss this issue.</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p-STAT3 is examined after IL-6 treatments. It may be needed to examine the integrity of gp130 signaling axis, e.g., in response to IL-6-like cytokines.</p><p>10) Although reference was cited for IL-6Rα deficient mice, it may be better to describe the KO effects on IL-6Rα (complete deletion of ORF or truncated IL-6Rα) since this information is very important for evaluation of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01949.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In many of the in vivo studies it is not clear whether the actions of IL-6 signaling in T cells are cell intrinsic functions.

All actions of IL-6 must be therefore T cell-intrinsic. We have added more information in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 6</xref> on the ability of antigen-specific T cells to proliferate or survive.</p><p><italic>2) The authors nicely complement their previous studies showing that IL-6 overcomes the suppressive function of Treg cells.

However it is widely appreciated that an vitro suppression assay bears little resemblance to T-reg mediated suppression in vivo. Some further validation of the in vitro results in vivo would increase impact of the findings</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be desirable to provide more insights into the molecular mechanisms that allow CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to escape Treg-mediated suppression in vivo. However, several technical hurdles make this effort challenging. First, CD25 expression after the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is known to be very transient and we are unable to detect enough antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with an activated phenotype (CD44<sup>+</sup>) at early time points (&lt;3 days) of the immune response. Second, the analysis of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells at later stages of the response (day 4-7) is hampered by the fact that one presumably only interrogates cells in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice that have escaped Treg-mediated suppression. Thus, the analysis might be biased by the presence of these escapees during the late stages of the response. This caveat aside, we have performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on the gene expression profiles of antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and wild-type controls in order to gain more mechanistic insights. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>, we present the interesting finding from this analysis that IL6Ra-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are severely impaired in their ribosomal metabolism. The implications of this finding are evaluated in the expanded Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>.

This may explain the results presented here and the authors should measure T cell accumulation following transfer as well as cytokine production to support their conclusions</italic>.</p><p>The referees raise an interesting and important mechanistic point about the role of IL-6 in Th17 differentiation during colitis. We would like to emphasize that we used the T cell transfer model of colitis in our study mainly to demonstrate that our experimental system, namely the use of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice, behaves as expected with respect to the differentiation of Th17 cells. The role of IL-6 in Th17 differentiation is not the focus of our study and the suggested experiments might distract from the core message of our manuscript. That being said, we show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1–figure supplement 6</xref> that at least in the context of immunizations, IL-6Rα-deficient antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are not more prone to undergo apoptosis.</p><p><italic>4) In most of the studies, CD4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>T cell proliferation and cytokine production were examined in mixed populations (in the presence of CD4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>Treg cells).

It may be better to use wild type antigen-presenting cells (e.g., DC) to replace splenocytes since these cells derived from WT or IL-6Rα KO mice may be different</italic>.</p><p>The main concern of the referees, namely that the composition or function of the irradiated splenocytes used in the in vitro re-stimulation assays may differ between IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and wild-type controls and thus affects the outcome of these assays, had already been addressed. In all of these assays, we isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the draining lymph nodes of immunized IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice and wild-type controls and co-cultured them with irradiated splenocytes from naïve wild-type mice. Thus, differences in the outcome of these assays must reflect the differences in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which also are the only cells capable of proliferation. Defective IL-6 signaling in Tregs cannot account for these differences as Tregs are not present in concentrations that would typically result in the suppression of responder T cells in vitro. Moreover, we have shown that IL-6Rα-deficient Tregs suppress as efficiently as wild-type Tregs in vitro (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). The effects on proliferation and cytokine production of specifc responder T cells (Th1, Th17) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) Similarly, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>, FACS analysis of IFNγ and IL-17 may be required for understanding the effects of IL-6 signaling on the specific T cell populations</italic>.</p><p>The purpose of this figure is to show that the initial phenotype of an impaired Th1 and Th17 response in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice is not confined to the use of LPS as an adjuvant but also applies to other TLR ligands. For the remainder of the study, we have focused on the response to LPS and show the effects of IL-6 signaling on specific T cell populations via intracellular FACS analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, the authors used Treg depletion to illustrate IL-6 effects. However, as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>, Treg cells were also affected by IL-6Rα deficiency. Whether IL-6Rα deficiency affects the suppressive functions of Treg cells/per cell should be clarified in addition to the analysis of Treg numbers</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> does indeed show that the absolute number of Tregs is reduced in IL6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. However, this reduction can be mainly attributed to the diminished CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response in these mice, which is accompanied by a reduced overall size of the draining lymph nodes. The frequency of the Tregs relative the overall CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population does not change in IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice. Moreover, we showed in the original manuscript that a Treg-specific ablation of the IL6Ra has no effect on the immune response. Together, these aspects of the phenotype of IL-6Rα<sup>T-KO</sup> mice make it unlikely that the suppressive functions of Tregs are impaired in the absence of IL-6. Nonetheless, in order to clarify this aspect, we show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref> that IL-6Rα-deficient Tregs are as capable to suppress as wild-type cells.</p><p><italic>7)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1"><italic>Figure 6–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, IL-15 could also overcome inhibitory effects of Treg cells. Since IL-15 and IL-6 signals via different signaling pathway, the authors may need to discuss the potential molecular mechanisms involved in this phenomenon</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion of the referees and we have modified our manuscript to discuss this aspect.</p><p><italic>8) IL-6Rα-deficient mice were used in this study. However, one possibility that needs to be excluded is the off-targets effects of KO. Did the authors examine the rescue effects of IL-6Rα or gp130 signaling on CD4</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>T cell activation and differentiation? The authors should discuss this issue</italic>.</p><p>The IL-6Rα is specific for IL-6. As no other ligands are known for the IL-6Rα, it is unlikely that off-targets effects are responsible for the observed phenotype of IL-6RαT-KO mice. Nonetheless, in order to address the concerns of the referees, we have examined the ability of IL-6Rα-deficient CD4 T cells to phosphorylate STAT3 upon addition of the soluble form of the IL-6Rα plus IL-6. Naive IL-6Rα-deficient CD4 T cells phosphorylated STAT3 as efficiently as wild-type cells upon addition of soluble IL-6Rα + IL-6, suggesting that the gp130 signaling axis remains intact in IL-6Rα-deficient CD4 T cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>, p-STAT3 is examined after IL-6 treatments. It may be needed to examine the integrity of gp130 signaling axis, e.g., in response to IL-6-like cytokines</italic>.</p><p>We have also stimulated naïve IL-6Rα-deficient CD4 T cells with the gp130-dependent cytokines IL-11, OSM, and CNTF. However, none of these additional cytokines were able to phosphorylate STAT3 efficiently (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, other gp130-dependent cytokines presumably do not play a major role during the activation phase of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response. It remains possible that these cytokines are important to the physiology of T cells at later stages of the effector phase. However, these events were not the focus of our study.</p><p><italic>10) Although reference was cited for IL-6Rα deficient mice, it may be better to describe the KO effects on IL-6Rα (complete deletion of ORF or truncated IL-6Rα) since this information is very important for evaluation of this study</italic>.</p><p>For the deletion of the IL-6Rα, exon 2 and 3 were flanked by loxP sites. Deletion of exon 2 and 3 upon Cre-mediated recombination leads to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon in exon 4. As a result, only exon 1 and an additional non-sense 20 aa are encoded by the deleted allele. The binding site to IL-6 is encoded by the deleted exon 2 and 3, thus the deleted allele produces a non-functional protein. We have added this information in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
