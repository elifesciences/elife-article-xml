Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists directly hyperpolarize a population of neurons in the dorsolateral pons, particularly the Kölliker-Fuse (KF) nucleus, that are key mediators of opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, the projection target and synaptic connections of MOR-expressing KF neurons are unknown. Here, we used retrograde labeling and brain slice electrophysiology to determine that MOR-expressing KF neurons project to respiratory nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla, including the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) and rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG). These medullary-projecting, MOR-expressing dorsolateral pontine neurons express FoxP2 and are distinct from calcitonin gene-related peptide-expressing lateral parabrachial neurons. Furthermore, dorsolateral pontine neurons release glutamate onto excitatory preBötC and rVRG neurons via monosynaptic projections, which is inhibited by presynaptic opioid receptors. Surprisingly, the majority of excitatory preBötC and rVRG neurons receiving MOR-sensitive glutamatergic synaptic input from the dorsolateral pons are themselves hyperpolarized by opioids, suggesting a selective opioid-sensitive circuit from the KF to the ventrolateral medulla. Opioids inhibit this excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit by three distinct mechanisms—somatodendritic MORs on dorsolateral pontine and ventrolateral medullary neurons and presynaptic MORs on dorsolateral pontine neuron terminals in the ventrolateral medulla—all of which could contribute to opioid-induced respiratory depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>opioid</kwd><kwd>respiratory depression</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>mu opioid receptor</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA047978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levitt</surname><given-names>Erica S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DA053798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bateman</surname><given-names>Jordan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Opioids have distributed effects on the brainstem circuitry that controls breathing, including presynaptic and postsynaptic receptor-mediated inhibition of an excitatory circuit from the dorsolateral pons to the ventrolateral medulla.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the prevalence of opioid overdose on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mattson et al., 2021</xref>), understanding the network mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression is of particular importance. Opioids, due to activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dahan et al., 2001</xref>), depress breathing by inhibiting interconnected respiratory nuclei in the pons and medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bateman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>). Despite significant progress, detailed mechanisms by which this occurs remain elusive, especially for the dorsolateral pons. We sought to identify mechanistic insight concerning how opioids inhibit pontomedullary respiratory neurocircuitry that gives rise to opioid-induced respiratory depression.</p><p>Respiration is generated and controlled by an interconnected pontomedullary network in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Del Negro et al., 2018</xref>). The Kölliker-Fuse (KF) nucleus and adjacent lateral parabrachial area (LPB) of the dorsolateral pons are critical to the neural control of breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lumsden, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fung and St John, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutschmann and Herbert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). The KF/LPB is composed of a heterogeneous population of respiratory neurons that impact respiratory rate and pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamberlin and Saper, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Navarrete-Opazo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saunders and Levitt, 2020</xref>) via excitatory projections to respiratory nuclei in the ventrolateral medulla, including, but not limited to the Bötzinger complex (BötC), preBötzinger complex (preBötC), and rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yokota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geerling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). The preBötC generates inspiratory rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 1991</xref>), which is relayed to inspiratory premotor neurons in the rVRG. The BötC contains mostly inhibitory neurons that fire during expiration and is a major source of inhibition within the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreihofer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ezure et al., 2003</xref>). The dynamic interplay between the KF/LPB and the BötC, preBötC, and rVRG is essential for optimized respiratory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dutschmann and Dick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, all of these respiratory nuclei express MORs, leading to inhibition of the control of breathing network via multiple potential sites and mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lonergan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montandon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cinelli et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Two respiratory nuclei considered critical for opioid-induced respiratory depression are the KF/LPB of the dorsolateral pons and the preBötC of the ventrolateral medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varga et al., 2020</xref>). The dorsolateral pontine KF/LPB is considered a key contributor of opioid-induced respiratory depression because (1) deletion of MORs from the KF/LPB attenuates morphine-induced respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), (2) opioids injected into the KF/LPB reduce respiratory rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prkic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), (3) blockade of KF/LPB opioid receptors rescues fentanyl-induced apnea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saunders and Levitt, 2020</xref>), and (4) chemogenetic inhibition of MOR-expressing LPB neurons induces respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, mechanisms by which the opioid inhibition of dorsolateral pontine neurons alter neurotransmission in the respiratory circuitry and causes suppression of breathing are unknown.</p><p>MORs inhibit neurotransmission by hyperpolarizing neurons through activation of somatodendritic GIRK channels and/or inhibiting presynaptic neurotransmitter release through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang and North, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chahl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zamponi and Snutch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Hasani and Bruchas, 2011</xref>). In the preBötC, presynaptic MORs inhibit synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballanyi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wei and Ramirez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2021</xref>) and are expressed more abundantly than somatodendritic MORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lonergan et al., 2003</xref>). These presynaptic MORs in the preBötC are poised to play a major role in the mechanism of opioid suppression of breathing within the inspiratory rhythm-generating area, but the specific origins of MOR-expressing synaptic projections remain unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that they are coming from the dorsolateral pons.</p><p>Opioids hyperpolarize a subset of KF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>), whose neurochemical identity and possible projection targets are unknown.

Therefore, we hypothesized that MOR-expressing KF neurons project to and form excitatory synapses onto respiratory controlling neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (i.e. the preBötC and rVRG), and that this excitatory synapse is inhibited by presynaptic MORs on KF terminals. The results show that this excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit is robustly inhibited by opioids by three different mechanisms, involving presynaptic and postsynaptic opioid receptors in the dorsolateral pons and the ventrolateral medulla, revealing convergent mechanisms by which opioids can depress breathing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Oprm1 expression in dorsolateral pontine neurons</title><p>To visualize MOR-expressing dorsolateral pontine neurons, <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>Cre/Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) were crossed with tdTomato Cre-reporter mice to generate <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>LSL-tdT/+</sup>::<italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> mice (hereby referred to as Oprm1-tdT mice) that express tdTomato in neurons that also express MORs at any point during development.

We targeted the excitatory vglut2-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral medulla because they contain the populations of inspiratory rhythm-generating preBötC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2016</xref>) and inspiratory premotor rVRG neurons, and MOR deletion from vglut2 neurons prevents opioid-induced respiratory depression in medullary slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>). Opioid inhibition of excitatory drive from KF onto these respiratory neuron populations is important for rhythm generation (preBötC) and respiratory pattern formation (rVRG). Thus, there are convergent mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory suppression, including both presynaptic and postsynaptic opioid receptors in the dorsolateral pons and the ventrolateral medulla, resulting in distributed effects of opioids on the pontomedullary respiratory network.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary schematic of mu opioid receptor (MOR) regulation of excitatory pontomedullary circuitry.</title><p>Kölliker-Fuse (KF): Somatodendritic MORs hyperpolarize KF neurons that project to the ventrolateral medulla.

Genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of different subsets of pre- and postsynaptic MORs in these areas mostly resulted in partial attenuation of opioid-induced respiratory rate suppression, presumably due to redundancy from the subset(s) of MORs in this pontomedullary circuit that were not deleted or blocked. Furthermore, additional MORs outside of the dorsolateral pontine and preBötC circuit likely contribute to respiratory suppression since deletion of MORs from both dorsolateral pons and preBötC did not eliminate morphine-induced respiratory suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Often overlooked in the context of opioids, the rVRG contains abundant opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lonergan et al., 2003</xref>) and application of an opioid agonist into the rVRG suppresses rate and amplitude of phrenic nerve bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lonergan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cinelli et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we showed that MOR-expressing KF neurons densely project to the rVRG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and form glutamatergic synapses onto excitatory rVRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Presynaptic opioid receptors inhibit glutamate release from KF terminals synapsing onto rVRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and the excitatory rVRG neurons that receive glutamatergic input from the dorsolateral pons are hyperpolarized by postsynaptic opioid receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The impact of this highly opioid-sensitive projection on respiration warrants further investigation. Other respiratory-related areas in the medulla, such as the retrotrapezoid nucleus and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), that receive <italic>Oprm1</italic>+ pontine input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) could also be involved, but functional connectivity and impact remains to be determined. Another potential contributor to OIRD are the caudal medullary raphe nuclei since antagonism of opioid receptors in the dorsolateral pons, ventrolateral medulla, and caudal medullary raphe was able to eliminate remifentanil-induced respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palkovic et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Opioids inhibit excitatory pontomedullary circuitry</title><p>Unexpectedly, KF neurons were more likely inhibited by presynaptic vs. somatodendritic MORs. The vast majority of KF terminals expressed presynaptic MORs since opioids inhibited glutamate release onto 91% of preBötC and rVRG neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, postsynaptic (somatodendritic) MOR-mediated outward currents were only observed in about two-thirds of medullary-projecting KF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which matches prior studies without projection identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varga et al., 2020</xref>). There are multiple possible reasons for this apparent heterogeneity. First, KF neurons may express MORs more abundantly on terminals than in the somatodendritic region. Second, KF neurons that did not have outward currents and were deemed not sensitive to opioids may express MORs, but lack GIRK channels, the functional readout we used to assess opioid sensitivity. MORs on these neurons could instead couple to other effectors, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramirez et al., 2021</xref>). However, this seems unlikely since the percentage of retrograde-labeled neurons that were <italic>Oprm1</italic>+ (56% in rostral and 47% in mid-rostral slices; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) nearly matched the percentages of functionally identified opioid-sensitive KF neurons (59% of preBötC-projecting and 67% of rVRG-projecting neurons; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The last and most interesting possibility is that opioid-sensitive glutamatergic KF neurons preferentially synapse onto excitatory medullary neurons, while non-opioidergic KF neurons might preferentially synapse onto non-excitatory (i.e. inhibitory) medullary neurons. This hypothesis is consistent with anatomical-tracing studies showing that KF neurons project to excitatory and, to a lesser extent, inhibitory preBötC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), and could be tested by recording from labeled inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral medulla. Inhibitory transmission in the medullary rhythm generator influences respiratory rate in the case of phasic inhibition or causes sustained apnea in the case of prolonged inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baertsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cregg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sherman et al., 2015</xref>). We have recently found that inspiratory dorsolateral pontine neurons are silenced by fentanyl, whereas expiratory neurons are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saunders et al., 2022</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that opioid-insensitive pontine neurons, which have continued activity during opioid exposure, send prolonged input to inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral medulla to promote apnea, perhaps using pathways overlapping those involved in apneas evoked by excitation of certain parts of the KF area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saunders and Levitt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dutschmann and Dick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutschmann and Herbert, 2006</xref>). This could include opioid-insensitive KF neurons that project to inhibitory neurons in the BötC since a higher proportion of opioid-insensitive pontine neurons projected to the BötC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Inhibitory input could also come from the NTS, which contains abundant MOR-expressing afferents and non-MOR-expressing neurons that are activated by disinhibition during opioid exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glatzer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maletz et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dorsolateral pontine subpopulations</title><p>The dorsolateral pons includes the lateral parabrachial area and the KF, both of which have been implicated in opioid-induced respiratory depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prkic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Varga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).

In addition, the anatomical distinction between KF and lateral parabrachial area is not clear cut, though recent descriptions of transcription factor and neuropeptide/receptor expression in the dorsolateral pons provide opportunity to improve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karthik et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pauli et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The most well-defined area in the dorsolateral pons is the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus, which expresses Lmx1b and CGRP, but not FoxP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karthik et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).

We also did not observe a ‘shell’ pattern of retrograde-labeled <italic>Oprm1</italic>+ neurons surrounding the external lateral parabrachial area, in contrast with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2022</xref>, which could be due to slight differences in injection location, the fluorescent probe, and/or sensitivity of the experimental design. Rather, electrophysiologically or histologically identified opioid-sensitive/<italic>Oprm1</italic>+ neurons that project to the ventrolateral medulla were found rostrally and ventrally in the area overlapping FoxP2 expression in the KF. Thus, at least two distinct subpopulations of <italic>Oprm1</italic>+ dorsolateral pontine neurons exist that can be distinguished based on CGRP expression and projection pattern: forebrain-projecting CGRP-expressing neurons and medullary-projecting neurons that do not express CGRP. Both populations are involved in pain and breathing due, at least in part, to reciprocal excitatory synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2022</xref>).

Although other MOR-expressing glutamatergic inputs are also likely contributors, including collaterals within the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rekling et al., 2000</xref>), the role of these specific pontine inputs on opioid inhibition of respiratory rhythm generation is worthy of further investigation.</p><p>Only a subpopulation of preBötC neurons contain MORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kallurkar et al., 2022</xref>). The population of MOR-expressing preBötC neurons is heterogeneous, including nearly equal numbers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmutsky et al., 2020</xref>), type 1 and type 2 Dbx1-expressing inspiratory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kallurkar et al., 2022</xref>), and pre-inspiratory, inspiratory, expiratory, and tonic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baertsch et al., 2021</xref>).

For instance, postsynaptic, but not presynaptic, opioid receptors couple to GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lüscher et al., 1997</xref>) through binding of up to four Gβγ subunits directly to the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). In contrast, presynaptic opioid receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release through inhibition of VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinke et al., 2011</xref>) or direct inhibition of vesicle release machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackmer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerachshenko et al., 2005</xref>). Coupling to these presynaptic effectors may be more sensitive since VGCCs can be inhibited by a single Gβγ subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zamponi and Snutch, 1998</xref>) and vesicular release is steeply calcium dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katz and Miledi, 1967</xref>). Consistent with this, presynaptic opioid receptor responses have higher sensitivity than postsynaptic responses when directly compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pennock and Hentges, 2011</xref>). Prolonged exposure to high doses of opioids can exacerbate differences in sensitivity since postsynaptic receptors desensitize more readily than presynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanchet and Lüscher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fyfe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lowe and Bailey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pennock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhim et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, the responses of presynaptic receptors may predominate, especially after prolonged opioid exposure, for reasons related to receptor reserve, coupling to effectors and/or receptor regulation. The relative sensitivity of presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors in the pontomedullary circuit identified here will be important to determine, especially since postsynaptic opioid receptors on KF neurons are resistant to desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levitt and Williams, 2018</xref>), suggesting unique receptor regulation in these neurons.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that opioids inhibit an excitatory pontomedullary respiratory circuit by three distinct mechanisms—somatodendritic MORs on dorsolateral pontine and ventrolateral medullary neurons and presynaptic MORs on glutamatergic dorsolateral pontine axon terminals in the ventrolateral medulla—all of which could influence distributed network function and contribute to the profound effects of opioids on breathing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Florida (protocol #09515) and were in agreement with the National Institutes of Health ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.’ Homozygous <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup>Cre/Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) (Jackson Labs Stock #035574, obtained from Dr. Richard Palmiter, University of Washington) were crossed with homozygous Ai9-tdTomato Cre-reporter mice (<italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>LSL-tdT/LSL-tdT</sup>) (Jackson Labs Stock #007909) to generate Oprm1-tdT mice.

Cells containing FluoSpheres (580/605) or tdTomato were identified using LED epifluorescence illumination and a Texas Red filter cube (ex 559 nm/ em 630 nm). Whole-cell recordings were made using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in voltage-clamp mode (Vhold = −60 mV).

Data were low-pass filtered at 10 kHz and collected at 20 kHz with pCLAMP 10.7 (Molecular Devices), or collected at 400 Hz with PowerLab (LabChart version 5.4.2; AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). Series resistance was monitored without compensation and remained &lt;15 MΩ for inclusion. For optogenetic experiments, ChR2-expressing KF terminals were stimulated using 470 nm LED illumination (5 ms duration) through a ×40 objective to optogenetically evoke excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSC) in preBötC and rVRG neurons. A pair of optical stimuli (5 ms pulse, 50 ms interval) was delivered every 20 s. Blockers of glycine (strychnine, 1 µM) and GABA-A (picrotoxin, 100 µM) receptors were added to the aCSF to isolate excitatory neurotransmission. Peak amplitudes were determined in Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices), and paired-pulse ratios (peak 2/peak 1), were determined in Microsoft Excel. All drugs were applied by bath perfusion.

Although opioid overdose deaths are highly prevalent, our knowledge of the neural circuits underlying respiratory depression in the brainstem is far from complete. The present study used a variety of sophisticated experimental techniques to convincingly reveal the identity of brainstem components that are part of the neural circuits involved in the mediation of opioid respiratory effects, together with defining potential synaptic underlying mechanisms. They focused on two regions of the brainstem, namely the Kolliker-Fuse and the preBötzinger Complex, and proposed a combination of three complementary processes at pre- and post-synaptic sites in both KF and preBötC regions to explain respiratory depression linked to opioid exposure. This study provides very important findings on the circuitry involved in opioid-induced respiratory depression, and the present results are of broad interest to the respiratory control research community, as well as medically relevant.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81119.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Thoby-Brisson</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/057qpr032</institution-id><institution>CNRS Université de Bordeaux</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Montandon</surname><given-names>Gaspard</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Unity Health Toronto</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.24.497461">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.497461v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gaspard Montandon (Reviewer #2). We strongly apologize for the abnormally long reviewing process. This was due in part to the difficulty to find reviewers available during the summertime and also due to personal problems that one reviewer got in the middle of the process, resulting in the need for us to give him some extra time allowing this reviewer to be able to provide his/her full review.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study explores the mechanisms underlying inhibition by opioid drugs of two regions, the preBötzinger Complex, and the Kolliker-Fuse, well-known to mediate opioid-induced respiratory depression and respiratory rhythmogenesis. Based on sophisticated experiments three mechanisms are proposed to occur: postsynaptic inhibition of excitatory KF projection neurons, reduced glutamate release of KF projection neurons via MOR mediated pre-synaptic inhibition, and postsynaptic inhibition of medullary preBötC and VRG neurons. Despite the fact that conclusions are well supported by the data several important concerns must be addressed by the author:</p><p>1. Justify the dose (provide a dose-response curve) and the relevance (why not DAMGO) for having chosen ME at 3µM.</p><p>2. A detailed description of the recorded neuronal firing patterns should be provided in order to testify their belonging to the respiratory network.</p><p>3. Providing a summary diagram or a cartoon of the neural circuits between KF, preBötC, rVRG, and types of projections revealed here would greatly help following the demonstration and summarizing the present findings.</p><p>4. Orientate the discussion more towards broader network implications and not mainly focus on preBötC.</p><p>5. The possibility that other mechanisms may underlie inhibition by opioids that are not involving potassium current, such as inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels should be considered.</p><p>6. The specificity and potential roles of the different sub-population of KF/LPB group should be more detailed.</p><p>7. The presentation (zoom) of the images of cells of interest should be improved.</p><p>8. Please provide a better description of the relationship between CGRP and FoxP2 and recorded neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The 3 proposed mechanisms: postsynaptic inhibition of excitatory KF projection neurons, reduced glutamate release of KF projection neurons via MOR mediated pre-synaptic inhibition, and postsynaptic inhibition of medullary preBotC and VRG neurons are well supported by the data. However, most of the data presented were predictable and the postsynaptic mechanisms of MOR activation of KF and pre-BotC neurons were described before. That KF projection neurons are predominantly glutamatergic was also predictable from previous studies. Thus, it would have been of major interest to study whether the identified MOR-dependent pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms underlying opioid respiratory depression have different sensitivity to exogenous opioids.</p><p>The patch clamp recordings of either pontine or medullary neurons identify MOR effects via valid experimental protocols. However, only a single dose of 3uM ME was used. I think ME dose-response curves for all the patch clamp experiments would allow for a comparative analysis of the opioid sensitivity of post and pre-synaptic inhibition.</p><p>The ME dose response curves would increase the value of your study significantly and would help to straighten the discussion – at its present stage, the discussion is largely around in vitro mechanisms and specific subsets of pre-BotC neurons which is not much advancing the understanding of the network mechanisms of opioid respiratory depression. The discussion is hard to understand in the context of the designated roles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in terms of concepts of rhythm generation and pattern formation. The essential roles of ponto-medullary synaptic interactions and distributed network mechanisms are largely avoided. Your work is clearly supporting that opioid respiratory depression is affecting distributed network functions and thus the extensive discussion concerned with the pre-BotC could be significantly shortened and the discussion then could be more broadly focused on the broader network implications.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Please check scale bars for C and E (-5.02). Also, the labelling pattern between C and E does not match – does Oprm1 Cre/tdT vs Oprm1 Cre/+ change the expression level? Please comment.</p><p>Figure 6</p><p>Foxp2 expression appears to be very high – the photographs indicate very high numbers of Foxp2 expression neurons in the KF that do not match previously published data. Did you validate the anti-body?</p><p>I suggest deleting the figure – at the end, it adds very little to the story.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study explores the mechanisms underlying inhibition by opioid drugs of two regions, the preBötzinger Complex, and the Kolliker-Fuse, well-known to mediate opioid-induced respiratory depression. It shows pre-synaptic inhibition of Kolliker-Fuse glutamatergic neurons which projects to the preBötzinger Complex and rostral VRG. It also suggests that inhibition occurs at the preBötzinger Complex levels.</p><p>There are a few comments that the authors should address:</p><p>1) Pre-synaptic versus postsynaptic opioid effects. Presynaptic inhibition by ME is clearly demonstrated in this study. Postsynaptic inhibition is identified with outward currents. It is possible that other mechanisms may underlie inhibition by opioids that are not involving potassium current, such as the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. The authors should acknowledge other potential mechanisms that may be involved.</p><p>2) Are the mechanisms described and identified here also mediating opioid-induced respiratory depression in-vitro (brainstem preparation) or in-vivo (anesthetized or freely-behaving animals)?</p><p>3) Activation of opioid receptors by MET5-enkephalin. Why did the authors use MET-enkephalin which is mostly acting on δ-opioid receptors with lower effects on mu-opioid receptors?</p><p>Why not use DAMGO to activate mu-opioid receptors or morphine to mimic opioid drug effects? How was the concentration chosen?</p><p>Do we know the affinity of ME on mu and δ receptors at this concentration?</p><p>4) FoxP2 and CGRP identify different types of KF/parabrachial neurons.

Based on sophisticated experiments three mechanisms are proposed to occur: postsynaptic inhibition of excitatory KF projection neurons, reduced glutamate release of KF projection neurons via MOR mediated pre-synaptic inhibition, and postsynaptic inhibition of medullary preBötC and VRG neurons. Despite the fact that conclusions are well supported by the data several important concerns must be addressed by the author:</p><p>1. Justify the dose (provide a dose-response curve) and the relevance (why not DAMGO) for having chosen ME at 3µM.</p></disp-quote><p>Relevance: ME is the endogenous opioid peptide agonist for mu and delta opioid receptors. ME and DAMGO are both full agonists for mu opioid receptors. When we have compared ME and DAMGO using dose-response curves in KF neurons they were equally effective with EC50 values in the expected range, similar to neurons in the LC, periaqueductal gray and ventral tegmental area (Levitt et al., J Physiol, 2015). The main difference between DAMGO and ME is selectivity. DAMGO is selective for mu opioid receptors, while ME has equal potency for mu and delta opioid receptors. Delta opioid receptors are not expressed on KF neurons or preBötC neurons, since when MORs were genetically deleted from these neurons the effects of ME at these concentrations were eliminated (Varga et al., J Physiol, 2020). Delta opioid receptor activation does not cause respiratory depression, since respiratory depression caused by morphine, which activates both mu and delta opioid receptors, is eliminated in MOR knockout mice in our hands and as previously reported (Dahan et al., 2001). Thus, the selectivity of DAMGO is not needed for the experiments in this study making ME and DAMGO functionally identical. We prefer to use ME for brain slice experiments for several reasons. (1) ME is an endogenous opioid ligand and activation of opioid receptors by the endogenous ligand sheds light on opioid receptor functions independent of the exogenous opioid use context. (2) From a technical standpoint ME is superior to morphine, DAMGO or fentanyl because it rapidly washes from the slice allowing multiple applications and analysis of the “wash” period in comparison to the baseline period to determine if technical artifacts have occurred during the course of the recording.</p><p>Concentration: The concentration of ME (3 µM) is approximately the EC80, based on our previous concentration-response experiments in KF neurons (Levitt et al., 2015). We chose this concentration because we knew from previous work that it would give a reliable response in both KF and preBötC neurons (Varga et al., 2020) and avoid causing acute desensitization which can occur with concentrations at and above 10 µM (Levitt and Williams, 2018). In pilot experiments we used lower concentrations of ME (0.3 – 1 µM) followed by 3 µM. The response to these lower concentrations was not as consistent. Since our goal for these experiments was to determine opioid-sensitive versus non-sensitive responses, we wanted to use a high enough concentration to ensure robust and reliable responses, but not too high to avoid receptor desensitization. Clarifying text was added to the Drugs section of the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A detailed description of the recorded neuronal firing patterns should be provided in order to testify their belonging to the respiratory network.</p></disp-quote><p>These recordings were performed in non-rhythmic slices, so the firing pattern of the recorded neurons does not provide the respiratory-related information required to determine the respiratory phenotype of each neuron. The viral injections used to achieve regional specificity necessitate using adult mice, which precluded the use of rhythmic slices. To our knowledge, medullary rhythmic slices for preBötC neuron recording are still only possible from early postnatal mice. Rhythmic slices for the pons are not possible, and en bloc preparations are technically not feasible to combine with the recording and optical stimulation techniques used here. It is precisely for this reason that we recorded from vglut2-expressing preBötC and rVRG neurons, as a surrogate method of cell-type identification. This is an important caveat and we have added additional clarification of this limitation to the Results describing these experiments (Page 5, line 30-31).</p><p>“Because we could not determine the respiratory-related firing pattern of the neurons we recorded from in this study, we chose to target vglut2-expressing neurons since (1) this contains the population of inspiratory rhythm-generating preBötC neurons (Wallén-Mackenzie et al., 2006; Gray et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2016) and inspiratory premotor rVRG neurons, (2) KF neurons project to excitatory, more so than inhibitory, preBötC neurons (Yang et al., 2020), and (3) deletion of MORs from vglut2 neurons eliminates opioid-induced depression of respiratory output in medullary slices (Sun et al., 2019; Bachmutsky et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Providing a summary diagram or a cartoon of the neural circuits between KF, preBötC, rVRG, and types of projections revealed here would greatly help following the demonstration and summarizing the present findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We made a summary schematic highlighting the major findings (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Orientate the discussion more towards broader network implications and not mainly focus on preBötC.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the Discussion to lead with expanded sections on implications of pontomedullary circuitry and dorsolateral pontine subpopulations. The section on preBötC mechanisms has been shortened and moved to the end of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The possibility that other mechanisms may underlie inhibition by opioids that are not involving potassium current, such as inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels is almost certainly involved in the presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release by opioids. It is possible that opioid inhibition of dendritic VGCCs could affect other processes, such as synaptic integration or back-propagation of action potentials, but these have not been described for KF neurons. The possible involvement of VGCCs has been added to the Introduction and the Discussion.</p><p>Intro: “MORs inhibit neurotransmission by hyperpolarizing neurons through activation of somatodendritic GIRK channels and/or inhibiting presynaptic neurotransmitter release through inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (Jiang and North, 1992; Chahl, 1996; Zamponi and Snutch, 1998; Al-Hasani and Bruchas, 2011).”</p><p>Discussion: “Second, KF neurons that did not have outward currents and were deemed not sensitive to opioids may express MORs, but lack GIRK channels, the functional readout we used to assess opioid sensitivity. MORs on these neurons could instead couple to other effectors, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (Ramirez JM <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The specificity and potential roles of the different sub-population of KF/LPB group should be more detailed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section on “Dorsolateral pontine subpopulations” to the Discussion. New Text is copied below:</p><p>“The most well-defined area in the dorsolateral pons is the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus, which expresses Lmx1b and CGRP, but not FoxP2 (Karthik et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021). CGRP-expressing external lateral parabrachial neurons project primarily to the forebrain (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021), and are involved in pain processing, feeding, and CO2-induced arousal (Campos et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Kaur et al., 2017). Although MORs are highly co-expressed with CGRP in these neurons (Huang et al., 2021), we did not observe opioid-sensitive or Oprm1+ retrograde labeled neurons in the external lateral parabrachial area. Rather, electrophysiologically or histologically identified opioid-sensitive/Oprm1+ neurons that project to the ventrolateral medulla were found rostrally and ventrally in the area overlapping FoxP2 expression in the KF. Thus, two distinct subpopulations of Oprm1+ dorsolateral pontine neurons exist that can be distinguished based on CGRP expression and projection pattern: forebrain-projecting CGRP-expressing neurons and medullary-projecting neurons that do not express CGRP. Both populations are involved in pain and breathing due, at least in part, to reciprocal excitatory synaptic connections (Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). Although medullary projecting Oprm1+ pontine neurons do not express CGRP (Figure 7), they can still be involved in pain processing, just not to the same extent as forebrain projecting Oprm1/CGRP+ pontine neurons (Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022).</p><p>Both populations of Oprm1+ dorsolateral pontine neurons are also likely involved in opioid-induced respiratory depression. MORs in glutamatergic, medullary-projecting, rostral KF neurons could reduce respiratory rate by decreasing excitatory input to the preBötC and rVRG (Figure 3) leading to a distributed blunting effect on inspiration generating processes within the ventrolateral medulla. In contrast, MORs in forebrain-projecting pontine neurons could reduce respiratory rate through intra-pontine excitatory connections with medullary-projecting MOR+ pontine neurons (Liu et al., 2022), or through reduced excitatory input to forebrain areas involved in arousal (Kaur et al., 2017), which may be especially important in sleep-dependent effects of opioids on breathing (Montandon and Horner, 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

We did not fill and identify recorded neurons post-hoc, so cannot say with certainty that they expressed CGRP or FoxP2.</p><p>We have added these sentences to the Discussion (page 10, lines 18-23):</p><p>“Although MORs are highly co-expressed with CGRP in these neurons (Huang et al., 2021), we did not observe opioid-sensitive or MOR+ retrograde labeled neurons in the external lateral parabrachial area.

However, most of the data presented were predictable and the postsynaptic mechanisms of MOR activation of KF and pre-BotC neurons were described before. That KF projection neurons are predominantly glutamatergic was also predictable from previous studies. Thus, it would have been of major interest to study whether the identified MOR-dependent pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms underlying opioid respiratory depression have different sensitivity to exogenous opioids.</p><p>The patch clamp recordings of either pontine or medullary neurons identify MOR effects via valid experimental protocols. However, only a single dose of 3uM ME was used. I think ME dose-response curves for all the patch clamp experiments would allow for a comparative analysis of the opioid sensitivity of post and pre-synaptic inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above (Essential revision #1), ME (3 µM) is approximately the EC80, based on our previous dose-response experiments in KF neurons. We chose this concentration because it would provide robust and reliable responses and avoid causing acute desensitization which can occur with concentrations at and above 10 µM. We agree that it would be beneficial to examine the difference in sensitivity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic responses. However, we think it would be most valuable to examine this difference in sensitivity in the context of acute versus chronic opioid exposure, which is out of scope of the current study and is best examined in a future study dedicated to this goal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ME dose response curves would increase the value of your study significantly and would help to straighten the discussion – at its present stage, the discussion is largely around in vitro mechanisms and specific subsets of pre-BotC neurons which is not much advancing the understanding of the network mechanisms of opioid respiratory depression. The discussion is hard to understand in the context of the designated roles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in terms of concepts of rhythm generation and pattern formation. The essential roles of ponto-medullary synaptic interactions and distributed network mechanisms are largely avoided. Your work is clearly supporting that opioid respiratory depression is affecting distributed network functions and thus the extensive discussion concerned with the pre-BotC could be significantly shortened and the discussion then could be more broadly focused on the broader network implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly revised and reoriented the Discussion towards distributed pontomedullary mechanisms and circuitry. We have added a discussion of excitatory/inhibitory balance and expanded discussion of potential sources of opioid influence, including BötC, NTS, rVRG and raphe. We added a section on dorsolateral pontine subpopulations, including roles in breathing and pain, to address other reviewer comments. We shortened the section on preBötC mechanisms and moved it to the end of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1</p><p>Please check scale bars for C and E (-5.02).

In new figures E-H, an AAV encoding Cre-dependent expression of GFP was injected into the KF/parabrachial area in adult Oprm1-Cre/+ mice, leading to GFP expression only in the neurons in the injection area (KF/PB), and not in axon terminals projecting to the KF/PB from elsewhere in the brain. The cell bodies are more visible in E-H because they are not obscured by the dense innervation from Oprm1-expressing axons into the area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6</p><p>Foxp2 expression appears to be very high – the photographs indicate very high numbers of Foxp2 expression neurons in the KF that do not match previously published data.

FoxP2 expression in rostral PB/KF (bregma -4.9) is quite abundant, similar to Figure 6. In contrast, FoxP2 is excluded from the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus, which contains cells that project to the forebrain and express CGRP and Lmx1b and is located more caudally (bregma -5.2). We also observe this exclusion of FoxP2 from the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus, even though FoxF2 is detected in the surrounding PB. We have added representative images in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1. These images also show FoxP2 expression in caudal KF, consistent with Karthik et al., 2022 and overlapping with a small population of medullary projecting Oprm1+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suggest deleting the figure – at the end, it adds very little to the story.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the additional figure supplement and text in the Results and discussion related to dorsolateral pontine subpopulations adds enough to the story to justify keeping these data in the manuscript.</p><p>Additional text in Results:</p><p>“Oprm1+, medullary-projecting KF neurons expressed FoxP2 (n=3; Figure 6), consistent with the population of glutamatergic FoxP2 and Lmx1b neurons in the rostral KF (Karthik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022). These are a separate population from FoxP2 expressing neurons located more dorsally and caudally in the inner portion of the external lateral parabrachial area and those activated by sodium deprivation (Geerling et al., 2011; Karthik et al., 2022). FoxP2 expression also overlapped with a smaller population of Oprm1+ medullary projecting neurons in the caudal KF containing GABAergic neurons (Figure 6 – Figures supplement 1) (Geerling et al., 2017; Karthik et al., 2022).

In addition, morphine is also a delta opioid receptor agonist, with similar affinity for mu and delta receptors, so it would have similar selectivity considerations as ME. Morphine is also a partial agonist (Levitt and Williams, Mol Pharmacol, 2012), which makes it difficult to see small effects. GIRK currents in mouse KF neurons can be relatively small and we did not know what size of effect would occur pre-synaptically. Since the goal of these experiments was to identify MOR+ projections, we were looking for robust results that would differentiate opioid-sensitive vs. non-opioid-sensitive responses, so we chose to use a full agonist (ME) at an ~EC80 concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) FoxP2 and CGRP identify different types of KF/parabrachial neurons.

The new paragraphs are below:</p><p>“The most well-defined area in the dorsolateral pons is the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus, which expresses Lmx1b and CGRP, but not FoxP2 (Karthik et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021). CGRP-expressing external lateral parabrachial neurons project primarily to the forebrain (Huang et al., 2021), and are involved in pain processing, feeding, and CO2-induced arousal (Campos, 2018; Chen, 2018; Kaur et al., 2017).

Specifically, this point in the Discussion was revised as follows: “Second, KF neurons that did not have outward currents and were deemed not sensitive to opioids may express MORs, but lack GIRK channels, the functional readout we used to assess opioid sensitivity. MORs on these neurons could instead couple to other effectors, such as voltage-gated calcium channels (Ramirez JM <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall the manuscript appears to be somewhat improved.</p><p>General comment:</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors did not address my main suggestions to test whether the different neuronal populations in pons and medulla or the different mechanisms linked to somatic or pre-synaptic MOR may have different sensitivities.

In addition, our ability to do these experiments in a timely manner is constrained by a lack of mice and personnel since we just moved institutions and are still getting the lab back to normal operations. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (below) to address the potential for differences in sensitivity based on presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors at other synapses. We ask for understanding and lenience from the reviewer regarding the necessity of these experiments and look forward to exploring this further in the future.</p><p>“Sensitivity and regulation of presynaptic and postsynaptic opioid receptors</p><p>Presynaptic and postsynaptic mu opioid receptors couple to distinct effectors and are regulated differently, which can lead to differences in sensitivity that change with prolonged opioid exposure (Coutens and Ingram, 2023). For instance, postsynaptic, but not presynaptic, opioid receptors couple to GIRK channels (Luscher et al., 1997) through binding of up to four Gβγ subunits directly to the channel (Whorton et al., 2013). In contrast, presynaptic opioid receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release through inhibition of VGCCs (Heinke et al., 2011) or direct inhibition of vesicle release machinery (Blackmer et al., 2005; Gerachshenko et al., 2005). Coupling to these presynaptic effectors may be more sensitive, since VGCCs can be inhibited by a single Gβγ subunit (Zamponi and Snutch, 1998) and vesicular release is steeply calcium dependent (Dodge and Rahamimoff, 1967). Consistent with this, presynaptic opioid receptor responses have higher sensitivity than postsynaptic responses when directly compared (Pennock and Hentges, 2011). Prolonged exposure to high doses of opioids can exacerbate differences in sensitivity, since postsynaptic receptors desensitize more readily than presynaptic receptors (Blanchet and Luscher, 2002; Fyfe et al., 2010; Lowe and Bailey, 2015; Pennock et al., 2012; Rhim et al., 1993). Thus, the responses of presynaptic receptors may predominate, especially after prolonged opioid exposure, for reasons related to receptor reserve, coupling to effectors and/or receptor regulation. The relative sensitivity of presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors in the pontomedullary circuit identified here will be important to determine, especially since postsynaptic opioid receptors on KF neurons are resistant to desensitization (Levitt and Williams, 2018), suggesting unique receptor regulation in these neurons.”</p><p>We were also prompted by the reviewer’s comment to carefully check the language about sensitivity throughout the manuscript and changed “sensitivity” to “proportion” in some instances and added quantification of these proportions. For instance: (Results, page 6, line 9) “presynaptic opioid receptors inhibit glutamate release from KF terminals onto a majority of excitatory preBötC and rVRG neurons (91 % 20 of 22 neurons).” And (Discussion page 8, lines 17-18): “These mechanisms converge on a projection-specific opioid-sensitive circuit, whereby MOR-expressing KF neurons synapse onto MOR-expressing excitatory preBötC and rVRG neurons at a proportion that is higher than predicted based on MOR expression in either of these populations alone (Bachmutsky <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Kallurkar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2022; Levitt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015).” We would like to thank the reviewer for emphasizing this comment and think the additional text has helped further “straighten the Discussion”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>&quot;With the prevalence of opioid overdose on the rise (Wilson et al., 2020; Mattson et al., 2021), understanding the mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression is of particular importance to aid in development of countermeasures and/or analgesics that do not affect breathing&quot;.</p><p>How does your study aid the development of countermeasures when systemic opioids act on all 3 mechanisms at the same time?</p></disp-quote><p>As Reviewer 1 noted in the original round of reviews “The study advances our knowledge of network mechanisms that mediate opioid respiratory depression and may provide interesting frameworks for the development of therapies to counteract or prevent opioid respiratory depression.” However, we understand the point that we did not explore countermeasures (or analgesia), so we have revised this sentence as follows: <italic>&quot;With the prevalence of opioid overdose on the rise (Wilson et al., 2020; Mattson et al.,2021), understanding the network mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression is of particular importance&quot;.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>Please provide the age and weight of the mice used for slice preparation and tracing experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Mice used for brain slice recordings and tracing experiments were 2-4 months old.

NK1R labeling was not the only marker we used for the NA (we also used cytoarchitecture), but the NK1R labeling was obvious in the slices that were immunostained for NK1R, which are in Figure 2B and Figure 3.

Our reading of the prior literature reports that FoxP2 expression is lesser in caudal PB areas, but the density increases in the dorsolateral pons in more rostral slices (see Karthik et al., 2022). The density of FoxP2 labeled cells we observe in the rostral KF area matches the Allen Brain Atlas and Karthik et al., JCN, 2022 at the rostral-caudal level we are investigating (bregma -4.84). To help facilitate the review process, we added low resolution widefield images (admittedly low quality) showing that FoxP2 staining is focally restricted, in a manner similar to the Allen Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>FoxP2 immunolabeling in the rostral dorsolateral pons (~bregma -4.84).</title><p>See also, ISH for <italic>Foxp2</italic> from the Allen Brain Atlas.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81119-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Also see pertinent Figure panels from Karthik et al., JCN, 2022 that show high density of FoxP2 expressing cells in the rostral KF (&gt; 500 neurons at bregma -4.9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>Paragraph Opioids inhibit excitatory pontomedullary circuitry</p><p>&quot;The last and most interesting possibility is that opioid-sensitive glutamatergic KF neurons preferentially synapse onto excitatory medullary neurons, while opioid-non-sensitive KF neurons are GABAergic and/or synapse onto non-excitatory (i.e. inhibitory) medullary neurons&quot;.</p><p>As I understand you patched MOR-positive cells in the rostral mid-rostral KF while the literature suggests that GABAergic KF neurons are located in the caudal KF so what is the basis of your speculation/hypothesis?

We have removed the possibility that non-opioidergic KF neurons are GABAergic, and revised the text as follows.</p><p>New text: “The last and most interesting possibility is that opioid-sensitive glutamatergic KF neurons preferentially synapse onto excitatory medullary neurons, while non-opioidergic KF neurons might preferentially synapse onto non-excitatory (i.e. inhibitory) medullary neurons. This hypothesis is consistent with anatomical tracing studies showing that KF neurons project to excitatory and, to a lesser extent, inhibitory preBötC neurons (Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020), and could be tested by recording from labeled inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral medulla.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;An intriguing possibility is that opioid insensitive pontine neurons, which have continued activity during opioid exposure, send prolonged inhibitory input to the ventrolateral medulla to promote apnea&quot;.</p><p>Any evidence in the literature to support this speculation? What are the mechanisms for apnea mediated via descending inhibitory projections? Since there are only small fractions of inhibitory neurons in the caudal KF I would be cautious to suggest that these can mediate apnea via shifting excitatory-inhibitory balance in the pre-BotC microcircuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that direct inhibitory descending projections that promote apnea are unlikely. More likely, descending excitatory projections onto inhibitory medullary neurons could promote apnea, possibly through mechanisms overlapping those involved in post-inspiratory apneas observed by excitation of the KF. We have rephrased to indicate this possibility:</p><p>“An intriguing possibility is that opioid insensitive pontine neurons, which have continued activity during opioid exposure, send prolonged excitatory input to inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral medulla to promote apnea, perhaps using pathways overlapping those involved in apneas evoked by excitation of certain parts of the KF area (Saunders and Levitt, 2020; Dutschmann and Dick, 2012; Dutschmann and Herbert, 2006). This could include opioid insensitive KF neurons that project to inhibitory neurons in the BötC, since a higher proportion of opioid insensitive pontine neurons projected to the BötC (Figure 2 and 4 supplements).”</p><p>We also removed the sentence regarding a shift in the excitatory-inhibitory balance. I think it may be possible that opioids could shift the excitatory-inhibitory balance if opioid-insensitive neurons are synapsing onto inhibitory neurons in the medulla (BotC or preBotC), but this is highly speculative and has been removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Para Dorsolateral pons: You should be firm with a statement that you have no evidence to support the findings of Lui et al., 2021.</p></disp-quote><p>I think the assertion that we have no evidence to support the findings of Lui <italic>et al.</italic> is a little extreme, since we were focusing on slightly different areas and many of the functional effects on breathing align with what we would have predicted from manipulating opioidergic neurons in the dorsolateral pons. The main difference between our study and theirs is that we don’t see labeling of the PBN “shell” with retrograde injections into the preBotC area. This could be due to differences in the injection location and/or the experimental design. Liu et al. injected rgAAV-EF1a-DIO-FLPo into the preBotC and AAV9-EF1a-fDIO-ChR2-eYFP into the PB. Because only a few copies of recombinase are needed to drive expression of flp, which will be amplified by fDIO-ChR2-YFP, this approach has higher sensitivity but with the potential for false positives (ie. if the retrograde AAV spreads outside of the intended injection area). In contrast, our approach (rgAAV-DIO-GFP) will have less sensitivity but with less potential for false positives and more potential for false negatives. It remains to be determined which is the case. In addition, the cellular distribution of YFP tagged ChR is different from soluble GFP, leading to differences in the fluorescence appearance in labeled neurons and dendrites. We have added a shortened version of these points to the Discussion: “We also did not observe a “shell” pattern of retrograde labeled Oprm1+ neurons surrounding the external lateral parabrachial area, in contrast with (Liu et al., 2022), which could be due to slight differences in injection location, the fluorescent probe and/or sensitivity of the experimental design.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
