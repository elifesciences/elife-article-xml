behaviorally induced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in such mice. Here, we employ an event-based algorithm to assess astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the neocortex of awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe mice and non-transgenic wildtype littermates while monitoring pupil responses and behavior. We demonstrate an attenuated astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to locomotion and an uncoupling of pupil responses and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in 15-month-old plaque-bearing mice. Using the genetically encoded fluorescent norepinephrine sensor GRAB<sub>NE</sub>, we demonstrate a reduced norepinephrine signaling during spontaneous running and startle responses in the transgenic mice, providing a possible mechanistic underpinning of the observed reduced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Our data points to a dysfunction in the norepinephrine–astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity axis, which may account for some of the cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer’s disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s disease are characterized by neurons dying and being damaged. Yet neurons are only one type of brain actors; astrocytes, for example, are star-shaped ‘companion’ cells that have recently emerged as being able to fine-tune neuronal communication. In particular, they can respond to norepinephrine, a signaling molecule that acts to prepare the brain and body for action. This activation results, for instance, in astrocytes releasing chemicals that can act on neurons.</p><p>Certain cognitive symptoms associated with Alzheimer’s disease could be due to a lack of norepinephrine. In parallel, studies in anaesthetized mice have shown perturbed astrocyte signaling in a model of the condition. Disrupted norepinephrine-triggered astrocyte signaling could therefore be implicated in the symptoms of the disease. Experiments in awake mice are needed to investigate this link, especially as anesthesia is known to disrupt the activity of astrocytes.</p><p>To explore this question, Åbjørsbråten, Skaaraas et al. conducted experiments in naturally behaving mice expressing mutations found in patients with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. These mice develop hallmarks of the disorder. Compared to their healthy counterparts, these animals had reduced astrocyte signaling when running or being startled. Similarly, a fluorescent molecular marker for norepinephrine demonstrated less signaling in the modified mice compared to healthy ones.</p><p>Over 55 million individuals currently live with Alzheimer’s disease. The results by Åbjørsbråten, Skaaraas et al. suggest that astrocyte–norepinephrine communication may be implicated in the condition, an avenue of research that could potentially lead to developing new treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>norepinephrine</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 249988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enger</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 302326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enger</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Letten Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enger</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Olav Thon Stiftelsen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Olav Thon Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagelhus</surname><given-names>Erlend A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006095</institution-id><institution>Helse Sør-Øst RHF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 2016070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enger</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Student Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>Kristin M Gullestad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006095</institution-id><institution>Helse Sør-Øst RHF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enger</surname><given-names>Rune</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 271555/F20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>Kristin M Gullestad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Noradrenaline-mediated astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in behavior is reduced in awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were first discovered in the early 1990s, they have been the object of numerous studies exploring their roles in brain physiology and pathophysiology. Importantly, such signals have been shown to occur in response to a wide array of neurotransmitters and trigger the release of substances that affect neuronal signaling and the vasculature. A growing body of evidence suggests that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals play important roles in higher brain functions such as memory formation and cortical processing, mediated in part through the neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adamsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poskanzer and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse model was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuchibhotla et al., 2009</xref>, who found pathological Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves originating at amyloid plaques, and a general increase in astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Later, it was demonstrated that plaque-associated astrocytic hyperactivity was mediated through activation of metabotropic purine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delekate et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reichenbach et al., 2018</xref>). These studies were performed under anesthesia, which severely attenuates physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thrane et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The field of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is undergoing a revolution as developments in optical imaging and genetically encoded fluorescent sensors now allow us to monitor these signals in awake-behaving mice, without the confounding effects of anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bojarskaite et al., 2020</xref>). Such studies have revealed exceedingly rich and complex astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling ranging from large activations of nearly all astrocytes in a field of view (FOV) under locomotion and startle responses due to noradrenergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>), to small, localized signals occurring spontaneously or as a response to local neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bindocci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stobart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). New analytical tools now also enable us to accurately quantify and describe these signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjørnstad et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The brain noradrenergic system is crucial for mediating responses to external environmental stimuli, optimizing central nervous system performance and thus for arousal and cognition. Interestingly, norepinephrine is one of the main drivers of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling activating astrocytic α1-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thrane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paukert et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, noradrenergic signaling in relation to locomotion and startle responses causes global increases of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). The main downstream effects of this astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity are not yet well understood, but thought to support neurons metabolically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Donnell et al., 2012</xref>), or through dynamic changes of the size and composition of the extracellular fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, astrocytes are believed to be key actuators of the noradrenergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Donnell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wahis and Holt, 2021</xref>). Importantly, NA signaling is assumed to play a pivotal role in AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weinshenker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peterson and Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holland et al., 2021</xref>). Profound loss of noradrenergic neurons is a hallmark of AD that occurs early in the development of the disorder, likely accounting for some of the symptoms of AD, including loss of cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matchett et al., 2021</xref>). However, the mechanisms and signaling pathways connecting perturbed NA and cognition are only rudimentarily understood.</p><p>As astrocytes are tightly associated with NA signaling and AD is characterized by perturbed NA system, we set out to investigate whether the norepinephrine–astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling axis was perturbed in ~15-month-old unanesthetized awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe mice compared to wildtype (WT) littermates. The tg-ArcSwe mice carry two mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene, the Arctic (E693G) and Swedish (KM670/6701NL) mutations, and exhibit amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits, a hallmark of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lord et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lillehaug et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Philipson et al., 2009</xref>). The mice have a robust phenotype with emergence of Aβ plaques at 6–7 months of age both in the parenchyma and in the walls of blood vessels, which are biochemically similar to human Aβ plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Philipson et al., 2009</xref>). The prominent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in close proximity to astrocytic endfeet makes the model suitable for studying astrocytic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate an attenuated behaviorally induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in cortical astrocytes during locomotion. As noradrenergic signaling is known to trigger astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in startle responses and locomotion, and pupil responses are regarded a faithful, although indirect, readout of noradrenergic signaling in the brain during physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zuend et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa and Rudebeck, 2016</xref>), we compared the pupil responses to the astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during running and startle and found a positive correlation in WT mice. No such correlation was present in the AD mice. Using the fluorescent extracellular norepinephrine sensor GRAB<sub>NE</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), we found attenuated norepinephrine signaling in relation to locomotion and startle responses in the AD mice, likely explaining the observed reduced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

However, the signals are weaker than in controls and do not display the correlation with pupil responses typically seen in WT animals. The behaviorally induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals bear no clear spatial correlation to Aβ plaques. We conclude that elimination of anesthesia unveils a new dimension of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, superimposed on the locally induced signals described in previous studies.

This discrepancy could possibly be explained by either the lack of sensitivity of the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor in the current experimental paradigm to pick up small increases in cortical norepinephrine or potentially by a compensatory upregulation of adrenergic receptors or other receptors in reactive astrocytes in the tg-ArcSwe mice. In line with this, Reichenbach et al. demonstrated an age/disease stage-related upregulation of P2R1-receptors in an AD mouse model that correlated with the level of reactive astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reichenbach et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, potentially the expression of α1-adrenergic receptors in astrocytes is changed in AD, similar to reports of how α2 and β2 receptors are upregulated in microvessels and neurons in AD patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalaria et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalaria and Harik, 1989</xref>).

Widespread reactive astrogliosis is nonetheless highly likely to perturb the physiological signaling of astrocytes as prominent changes in the expression of key receptors and molecules of intracellular pathways are known to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Habib et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escartin et al., 2021</xref>).

It is possible that the attenuated astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses we observe is a feature of advanced disease, and not earlier stages of the disease development. Similarly, the sparsity of pathological ‘hyperactive’ astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events in our data compared to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delekate et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuchibhotla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reichenbach et al., 2018</xref>) could stem from the other studies being performed at ages that represents earlier stages in the disease progression. Further studies across AD models and stages of disease progression mice are warranted to conclude.</p><p>Previous studies have shown mixed results regarding an effect of plaque–astrocyte distance, with reports of both hyperactivity close to plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delekate et al., 2014</xref>) and no such correlation except for plaques serving as initiation sites for pathological intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuchibhotla et al., 2009</xref>). In our awake-behaving mice, we found no clear correlation between overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and 3D distance reconstruction of plaque positions relative to the imaging plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The apparent discrepancies in the literature and this study may be due to different AD mouse models, different age groups investigated, different Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators employed, or lastly, the effects of removing anesthesia allowing for a much richer repertoire of behaviorally induced astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to emerge, effectively masking a potential weak correlation.</p><p>Astrocytes have a highly complex and specialized morphology, and this morphology is known to change in reactive astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escartin et al., 2021</xref>). The majority of astrocytic processes are much smaller than what can be clearly delineated by non-super-resolution optical microscopy, but to what extent these small processes are altered in reactive astrogliosis is unknown, although the astrocytic territories are known to be preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilhelmsson et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, GFAP, which was used as the promoter for the GCaMP6f expression, was highly upregulated in tg-ArcSwe mice. This difference in GFAP expression did not translate into obvious differences in sensor expression levels as judged by GFP labeling of brain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We cannot rule out that gliosis-induced morphological changes in combination with potential subtle differences in GCaMP6f expression and potentially an elevated baseline intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuchibhotla et al., 2009</xref>) may influence our results. However, the ability for the whole FOV to be activated during spontaneous running and startle responses and the lack of correlation (if anything a negative correlation) between distance to the nearest Aβ plaque and gross level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling suggest that our findings are not due to degree or pattern of sensor expression.</p><p>This study underscores the importance of studying astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in unanesthetized mice and to carefully consider animal behavior when interpreting astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. By lifting the confounding effects of anesthesia, we found that the astrocytic hyperactivity previously reported in AD mouse models was only a part of the total picture. At first glance, the physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were remarkably well preserved and not characterized by a general increase in astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. However, behavior like quiet wakefulness and locomotion are not static entities, and the degree of activation of all relevant parameters needs to be taken into account with statistical modeling to be able to conclude if there are relevant differences between the genotypes. We were able to demonstrate attenuated Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and norepinephrine signaling in the tg-ArcSwe mice, and given the growing spectrum of roles ascribed to the norepinephrine–astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in higher brain functions, the present findings may highlight one potential cause for the cognitive decline of AD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Tg-ArcSwe mice carry a human <italic>APP</italic> cDNA with the Arctic (p.

We used our recently published imaging analysis toolbox ‘Begonia’ to remove motion artifacts, mark ROIs, and perform event-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal detection (ROA method). Astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were detected using the ROA method, and the ROA density (i.e., fraction [in %] of the compartment analyzed being active) and ROA frequency in the whole FOV or in anatomical subcompartments were calculated. Methods and algorithms related to this processing pipeline are described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjørnstad et al., 2021</xref>. In brief, movement-corrected image time-series data of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity were preprocessed by variance stabilization (square root transform) and smoothing in the temporal and spatial domain to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 9. All image time series were for this reason smoothed with 14 frames in the temporal domain (~0.45 s) and two pixels in the <italic>x–y</italic> domain. Four times the median standard deviation of the variance stabilized data plus the baseline value for a pixel was then used to calculate a threshold for signal detection for each pixel.

Here, the area may be the entire FOV or we may limit ourselves to the area identified as belonging to cellular subcompartments; the astrocytic processes, somata, or endfeet. In each trial, we had time series of ROA density lasting around 300 s (approximately 9000 frames). Within each trial, the startle period was defined as starting from the air puff at 150 s and lasting 600 frames (~20 s). In addition, one or more time periods within the trial could be identified as spontaneous runs or as periods of quiet wakefulness. A first important question concerns the choice of summary statistics adequately describing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in such periods of interest (runs and startle), which are dynamic behavioral states that entail both acceleration, steady locomotion and deceleration. We have studied the mean and max ROA density and the ROA density rise rate, which is defined as the <italic>maximal increase in ROA density over a maximum of 50 frames</italic>. Initial explorations indicated that the main results are fairly robust to the choice of window length, and 50 frames appeared to be a sensible choice compared to the kinetics of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. The ROA density rise rate is meant to capture some of the dynamics in astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and can be understood as the maximum acceleration inside the time period of interest. The rise rate has a high correlation with the maximum, and if the length of the window is increased sufficiently these two statistics tend to become almost identical (since most traces are close to zero at some point in the trial). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>, which displays both the max ROA density and the rise rate in an example.</p><p>Pupil size measurements had a coarser time resolution than for the astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals; see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>, showing the pupil sizes around a startle response. The pattern in the figure – a sharp increase in pupil size after air puff, before a gradual decline – was quite typical. Therefore, we chose to only consider the measurements in a time window of 6.67 s on each side of the air puff (or start of running). We defined the <italic>pupil dilation</italic> as the relative increase in the ratio of pupil diameter to eye diameter inside this window. In other words, we calculate the average ratio before the air puff (or start of running) and after the air puff, compute the difference, and divide by the average before the air puff.</p><p>For GRAB<sub>NE</sub> analyses, time series were segmented similar to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging trials. Due to the slower response, change in GRAB<sub>NE</sub> fluorescence was calculated slightly different than the increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling as the difference between the median GRAB<sub>NE</sub> ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> in the baseline period (10 s immediately prior to locomotion/startle) and during locomotion/starle. Pupil responses and locomotor responses were defined within the same time intervals for these trials.</p><sec id="s4-15-1"><title>Interpreting hierarchical plots</title><p>We have chosen to present some of our data in the form of <italic>hierarchical plots</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, and figure supplements). These plots allow the reader to assess the degree of separation between the genotypes and at the same time get an impression of the <italic>variation at different levels of the analysis</italic> – in our case, the variation between different mice of the same genotype and the variation between repeated measurements on the same mouse. At the lowest level – the trial level – we have points representing the observations themselves. For the spontaneous runs, there are sometimes more than one run per trial and in that case the points are the median ROA density rise rate in these runs. The maximal number of spontaneous runs in a single trial was 5 (average: 1.6 runs per trial). At the middle level, we have the median ROA density rise rate for each mouse, and at the top level the median ROA density rise rate for each genotype. The lines between the levels indicate which observations belong to each mouse and to each genotype respectively. We have made similar plots for the max ROA density also. The hierarchical plots are a useful tool for exploratory analysis. They are also meant to promote transparency in scientific reporting and highlight the importance of intra-group variation. Still, it is important to realize that the impression conveyed by the plots might not be identical to the results from statistical modeling. In the plots, we do not include the influence of various technical and biological covariates that one typically would include in a statistical model. Some of the variation between observations belonging to the same mouse and between different mice of the same genotype may be explained by such covariates, as we will see in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Modeling</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.1.1). The ROA density rise rate was modeled by linear mixed effect regression models, which were fitted using the glmmTMB package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>). We conducted two sets of analyses: (1) to investigate potential differences in ROA density rise rate between the two genotypes and (2) to investigate the relationship between ROA density rise rate and the pupil dilation, including potential differences between the two genotypes with respect to this relationship. For (1), the coefficient of primary interest is the one belonging to the genotype variable, while for (2) we are interested in the effect of pupil dilation on the ROA density rise rate, as well as the interaction between this pupil effect and the genotype. In both of these sets of analyses, we adjusted for the following fixed effect covariates: the level of magnification (μm per pixel) (two levels), the depth of the measurements (in μm), and the maximal speed in the relevant time window. We included random intercepts for each mouse (five WT and six tg-ArcSwe). We analyzed the ROA density max and mean values with similar models as the ones described here for the rise rate. For (1), the number of observations ranged between 77 and 117 trials with startle data (depending on the subcompartment) and between 72 and 109 episodes of spontaneous running, while for (2) the number of observations ranged between 60 and 86 for the startle data and between 35 and 44 for the spontaneous runs. There were less observations for the (2) analyses because some episodes/trials had missing or incomplete pupil measurements. Similar modeling was performed for GRAB<sub>NE</sub> analyses.</p><p>The sensitivity of our result to these modeling choices was assessed by various robustness checks (see next section). The adequacy of model assumptions was investigated by residual plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartig, 2022</xref>). In the cases where the residual plots indicated deviations from the assumption of constant residual variance, we extended the model by allowing the residual variance to vary as a function of genotype. The reported p-values are based on the t-distribution, with degrees of freedom as provided from the glmmTMB package. No corrections for multiple comparisons were applied.</p><p>When analyzing the relationship between distance from the nearest plaque and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we considered the mean ROA density in each ROI (n = 10,988) in the quiet wakefulness episodes. If present, any effect of plaque proximity on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling should be discernible among ROIs observed in the same episode. The dashed lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> show the effect of distance on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within each episode, and they form an uncertain picture: in some episodes, there is a weak positive relationship, with seemingly higher mean ROA density further away from plaques, while in many episodes there is a negative relationship, with somewhat higher mean ROA density close to plaques. The overall line is found by fitting a linear mixed effect model with mean ROA density as the response, with a fixed effect of distance and with each episode having its own random intercept and slope for the distance effect.</p><p>For the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, unless otherwise stated, the data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used to analyze the number of processes, total length of processes in µm, process thickness in µm<sup>3</sup>, and area fraction of positive GFAP staining. Two-way ANOVA followed by Sidak post-hoc comparison was used to analyze the number of intersections. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 for Windows (GraphPad Software). For qPCR analysis, mean copy number per ng of total RNA was compared between genotypes by Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test in SPSS Statistics 26 (SPSS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-3"><title>Robustness checks</title><p>In order to check the robustness of the various statistical analyses, the stability of estimates and p-values was examined with respect to the length of window, for the rise rate response variable, and also sensitivity to individual mice and trials.</p><p>The type of sensitivity analysis performed is illustrated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) for the analysis of the uncoupling between pupil dilation and astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> for details about the data). Again, for the purpose of illustration, we focus on the interaction between pupil dilation and genotype for the ROA density rise rate response variable; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for details. Similar analyses were performed for the main statistical models; none of these sensitivity analyses provided clear or strong evidence for any change in the main conclusions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Data and source code availability</title><p>A complete dataset of raw and processed data including two-photon microscopy traces, behavioral monitoring, and pupil tracking data is provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.11582/2021.00100">https://doi.org/10.11582/2021.00100</ext-link>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Impaired astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in awake Alzheimer's disease transgenic mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mark T Nelson as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jillian L Stobart (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The heavy reliance on pupil response, which is only partially linked to NE, takes the manuscript into a tautological reasoning. Authors should consider using another read-out of NA activity. For instance they have the expertise and technical capability necessary to employ GRAB-NE sensors. In the final analysis, too much of the weight of this study rests on pupillary dilation measurements that are just not reproducible enough to bear the burden; this is especially true for pupil responses induced by spontaneous locomotion.</p><p>2) The authors should conduct some experiments in anesthetized Tg-ArcSwe mice to hone in on the idea that anesthesia is the causal factor in discrepancies observed in the field, and to strengthen the take-home message of the study, experiments could be done in a paired fashion (i.e. comparison of un-anesthetized and under isoflurane anesthesia, in the same mice), rather than as a separate cohort of mice. These experiments could be provided later. Regardless, the authors should greatly soften their conclusions about anesthesia without firm evidence.</p><p>3) Why were tg-ArcSwe mice chosen over other AD models?</p><p>4) Figure 2A: In the leftmost panel, does the sudden increase in ROA signal density at ~60 s correspond to initiation of a spontaneous running event? (Not specified in the text or legend.) What does the relatively higher density of signals centered around ~25 s reflect-background activity? How do differences in these x-y-t plots between WT and Tg-ArcSwe mice relate to phenotypic differences described? Are these data used in calculation of ROA density rise rate? If so, how? Description of methods on this point (imaging processing and analysis) is not sufficient to even get the gist of how this is done (over-relies on a previous publication).</p><p>5) Figure 2B: Rate (top panels) and density (bottom panels) are presumably normalized relative values. If so, this should be indicated, and the normalization procedure used should be described. Is this presentation style a standard in the field or a home-grown method? It's certainly not intuitively relatable and only becomes comprehensible after prolonged staring.

Hardly compelling.</p><p>7) Figure 3C: Again, what are the statistics on these analyses? Although trends in pupillary responses are more evident with the startle paradigm, the data are too messy to form the basis of a firm conclusion.</p><p>8) The authors make the reasonable argument that a means for measuring astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the absence of anesthesia is necessary, but the &quot;compared-to-what&quot; aspect needed to support their argument is missing. The case for quantitative and/or qualitative differences in astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the absence of anesthesia would be considerably strengthened by including a comparison of startle response-astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> relationships (or other locomotion-independent relationships) between anesthetized and unanesthetized animals.</p><p>9) The reactive gliosis assessment has a tacked-on quality; seems more like something that would be included in a basic characterization of the tg-ArcSwe model. Its inclusion might make sense if the authors had in mind teasing out a relationship between reactive gliosis and astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>10) Clearly lay out the goals of the study, providing sufficient description of all the various aspects-role of NA signaling in AD, NA induction of astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, behavior-induced (NA-dependent) ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, novel technique for real-time monitoring of astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, etc-for the reader to follow along.</p><p>11) Include a cartoon showing how all the many moving parts of the study are related.</p><p>12) Provide a better description of the imaging processing and analysis procedures (including event-based detection aspect) in Methods so that the reader doesn't have to go to a previous publication to understand the basic workflow.</p><p>13) Include better (or at least some) description of what panels illustrate in figure legends (see comments in Public Review).</p><p>14) Provide statistics on regression analyses; a supplemental figure might be helpful in this regard.</p><p>15) The authors did not provide a justification for why they chose this mouse model and to use 15-month-old animals. Further information about the symptoms and the known disease progression of this strain would be beneficial. Previous studies used AD models that contained mutations in PSEN1 (e.g. APPPS1 mice). Also, these studies used 5-9-month-old animals. This alone could account for differences in results, particularly if the stage of disease is not comparable.</p><p>16) Authors study was performed in 15-months old mice when the plaque load is significant. I am wondering if they have done or would consider doing some recordings in younger animals from the same line, in which the plaque burden is still absent (or significantly less) and age-matched controls. This could help determine whether the decoupling they observed is due to the plaque load itself or whether it preexists to the plaques. Considering that sleep is among the first alterations observed in AD and considering the growing body of evidence implicating astrocytes (and NE) in sleep, this could yield some very interesting and important results.</p><p>17) It is unclear to me why authors picked this specific mouse model of AD. I don't feel very strongly about any AD model in particular but I wonder if authors could provide a rational/justification for using this particular model.</p><p>18) It is unclear to me whether Methoxy-X04 was injected in AD mice in all experiments and, more importantly, whether it was injected in control animals as well? If it was only injected in AD mice, I do think authors should conduct some control experiments where they confirm the absence of effect of this probe alone on astrocytes ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and morphology, especially in the case of AD astrocytes since they engulf/phagocytose plaques and might thus accumulate large amounts of Methoxy-X04. This might have already been performed by others but I am not aware of it.</p><p>19) For the conclusion of Figure 2 to be fully valid, authors would need to show quantitative data indicating that the full dynamic range of functional pupil dilation in AD mice is statistically identical to controls (which seems to be the case from Figure 3 panel C). Otherwise, an alternative interpretation would simply be an overall attenuation of the input-output curve of the pupil dilation neurological reflex.</p><p>20) The only major concern I have with this study, and I am genuinely surprised authors do not discuss it, is that GFAP is used to drive GCaMP expression and, as authors elegantly show, the GFAP promoter is strongly overactive in AD astrocytes by nearly 10-folds. This presumably drives a 10-fold stronger expression of GCaMP in AD mouse astrocytes. Since GCaMP acts as a strong ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator/buffer, this alone could disrupt ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, baseline ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms in astrocytes, and/or fail to report ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in a way that is comparable to controls, in such a way that this could partially explain the impaired ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling observed in AD mice. Would it be possible for authors to quantify GCaMP protein expression accurately (i.e. not by proxy of baseline fluorescence) and rule this out? Alternatively, would it be possible to provide control data indicating that the expression level of GCaMP in AD mouse astrocytes is not deleterious? I think this is a crucially important control experiment.</p><p>21) Lines 209-212, authors present data that is not statistically significant as a de facto difference between control and AD mouse ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, on the basis that the p-value is close to 0.05. Whether it is biologically relevant or not, the &quot;0.05 p-value&quot; is an international statistical standard and authors should stick to it. I agree that there is a &quot;trend towards&quot; (line 209-210): is it possible that the sample size for the study was underpowered? If not, then the biological difference is not statistically significant and authors should remove statements of &quot;trend&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75055.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The heavy reliance on pupil response, which is only partially linked to NE, takes the manuscript into a tautological reasoning. Authors should consider using another read-out of NA activity. For instance they have the expertise and technical capability necessary to employ GRAB-NE sensors. In the final analysis, too much of the weight of this study rests on pupillary dilation measurements that are just not reproducible enough to bear the burden; this is especially true for pupil responses induced by spontaneous locomotion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that using the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor in our current experimental setup could provide valuable mechanistic insight. We have therefore run an additional round of imaging experiments where we subject tg-ArcSwe mice and littermate controls expressing GRAB<sub>NE</sub> to the same experimental protocol as for the ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. In both spontaneous running and startle responses we find attenuated GRAB<sub>NE</sub> fluorescence increases in tg-ArcSwe mice compared to WT littermates, potentially – at least partially – explaining the differences in astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in AD mice. More specifically, the effect of pupil dilation on GRAB<sub>NE</sub> fluorescence is lower in tg-ArcSwe mice, suggesting that pupil responses are not so tightly coupled to cortical norepinephrine release in the transgenic mice.</p><p>One new figure (Figure 5) presenting the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> data with a corresponding Results section (“Attenuated noradrenergic signaling in tg-ArcSwe mice”) and 2 tables (tables 5 and 6) have been added. We have further expanded our discussion about the new results as well as limitations of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should conduct some experiments in anesthetized Tg-ArcSwe mice to hone in on the idea that anesthesia is the causal factor in discrepancies observed in the field, and to strengthen the take-home message of the study, experiments could be done in a paired fashion (i.e. comparison of un-anesthetized and under isoflurane anesthesia, in the same mice), rather than as a separate cohort of mice. These experiments could be provided later. Regardless, the authors should greatly soften their conclusions about anesthesia without firm evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of the current study was to analyze signaling in awake, behaving animals, and we see the literature as so compelling when it comes to the detrimental effect of anesthesia on astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling that we found it of little relevance to recapitulate studies made under anesthesia. Anesthesia clearly removes behaviorally and neuromodulatory driven astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (by at least 90%) (Thrane et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2013). This also fits well with our own experimental studies both from anesthetized and un-anesthetized mice (Enger et al., 2017; Enger et al., 2015; Heuser et al., 2018; Bojarskaite et al., 2020). Accordingly, our ca<sup>2+</sup> event frequency is orders of magnitude more frequent than what was presented in Delekate et al., 2014 (even though a direct comparison is not entirely fair as we have used a different method for quantification of ca<sup>2+</sup> signals). Our experimental model also differs quite considerably with previous studies, both in terms of age of inclusion, AD model, ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors used and experimental setup for a fair comparison to be made.</p><p>Thus we did not aim to confirm or disprove the well-documented astrocytic hyperactivity evident in previous studies in anesthetized mice. Importantly, we do find clearly pathological signaling, although rare compared to the behaviorally driven ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the tg-ArcSwe mice, that we believe represents what has been previously reported. That being said, we agree that a direct comparison of anesthetized or awake tg-ArcSwe mice and WT littermates could provide some relevant information about pathological ca<sup>2+</sup> hyperactivity in AD. Even though anesthesia prominently dampens physiological astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, this may not be the case with the pathological “hyperactive” ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in AD. It is important to note that we consider the relatively straightforward experimental design suggested by the reviewer for determining the effects of anesthesia to be a bit simplistic. Notably, a “cross-over design” is not compatible with artificial ventilation and control of blood gasses, which we deem necessary for maintaining physiological parameters in anesthetized mice, as self-breathing mice would typically (to some degree) be hypoxic and hypercapnic if breathing room air, or hyperoxic and hypercapnic if oxygen is supplied. Moreover, isoflurane is probably an agent that would be particularly effective in quenching astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Thrane et al., 2012). With the relatively extensive effort it would take for a proper investigation of this topic, we rather focussed our resources on developing sophisticated behavioral paradigms and analytical methods than revisiting the effects of anesthesia on astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</p><p>Finally, at the current time we do not have enough mice at the appropriate age group to both perform GRAB<sub>NE</sub> experiments and experiments in anesthesia, and prioritized the experiments we believed had the biggest potential to add to the story. To meet the critique by the reviewers, we have now softened our conclusions about the effects of anesthesia except in cases where we consider the statement clearly justified by studies in WT mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Why were tg-ArcSwe mice chosen over other AD models?</p></disp-quote><p>The tg-ArcSwe model is an AD model that expresses amyloid plaques in the parenchyma throughout most of the brain, including cortex, but also expresses strong vascular amyloid deposits (as also is the case in AD patients) (Lillehaug et al., 2014, Neurobiology of Aging). The model expresses plaques that are biochemically close to the composition of plaques in human AD (Philipson et al., 2009). Moreover, we have extensive experience with the mouse model from previous studies (Syverstad Skaaraas et al., 2021; Lillehaug et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2017), and the plaque load and distribution, and behavioral phenotype is well characterized (Codita et al., 2010; Lillehaug et al., 2014). Most importantly, however, we deem the tg-ArcSwe AD model particularly relevant for studying astrocytic physiology, due to the prominent vascular deposits and the close anatomical relationship between astrocytic endfeet and blood vessels and distinct consequences to astrocytic endfoot expression of key proteins like aquaporin-4. Two sentences have been added to the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2A: In the leftmost panel, does the sudden increase in ROA signal density at ~60 s correspond to initiation of a spontaneous running event? (Not specified in the text or legend.) What does the relatively higher density of signals centered around ~25 s reflect-background activity? How do differences in these x-y-t plots between WT and Tg-ArcSwe mice relate to phenotypic differences described? Are these data used in calculation of ROA density rise rate? If so, how? Description of methods on this point (imaging processing and analysis) is not sufficient to even get the gist of how this is done (over-relies on a previous publication).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed both these increases in ROAs represent ca<sup>2+</sup> activity coupled to locomotor activity, but the locomotor activity at ~25 s was not large enough to be defined as a run. We added labeling in the figure and a few sentences to Figure 2A legend to explain these activation patterns.</p><p>The <italic>x-y-t</italic> plots shown in figure 2 are representative examples of the data used for the ROA analyses. The data used for all analyses are essentially the data used to generate these <italic>x-y-t</italic> plots of ROAs (binary masks of signal (ROA) vs background). A trace of mean ROA activity per frame (i.e. fraction of area of signal per frame) has been used to calculate the maximum ROA density and ROA density rise rate (and mean values as presented in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). The ROA method has now been better explained in Results in a new paragraph pertaining to statistical modeling, as well as in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2B: Rate (top panels) and density (bottom panels) are presumably normalized relative values. If so, this should be indicated, and the normalization procedure used should be described. Is this presentation style a standard in the field or a home-grown method? It's certainly not intuitively relatable and only becomes comprehensible after prolonged staring. The authors should be a little less stingy with text that might help readers orient.</p></disp-quote><p>These hierarchical plots are not a standard in the field, and therefore we had added a section in Materials and methods about interpretation of hierarchical plots. Also, to make this information more easily available, the figure legends have been expanded with more explanations. We believe these plots are particularly well suited for displaying hierarchical data, as it displays variability in several levels of the hierarchy, as opposed to box-and-whisker plots, violin plots or similar.</p><p>Values as indicated in the x-axis of these graphs represents ROA density rise rate and max ROA density without any further normalization, as ROA density is expressed as a fraction of the analyzed area (FOV, astrocyte soma, process, endfoot). We have now changed the fractional number to percent as this may be more intuitive for the reader. We have also added labeling for the x-axes in the hierarchical plots, and more text in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2C: What are the statistics on these regression analyses?

We agree that there is a relatively large spread of data points in these scatter plots. However, the slopes and p-values are clearly different between the two genotypes, and the effects are robust to various statistical controls (see Figure 2 —figure supplement 2). The statistics to analyze these relationships have been provided in the section “Two-photon imaging of awake-behaving tg-ArcSwe mice“ in the Results section. It is important to note that the statistical model includes more covariates than what is shown in the scatter plot (the dots merely represent median activation per trial). Moreover, 6 tables are added with results from the statistical models used to generate all p-values for comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors make the reasonable argument that a means for measuring astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the absence of anesthesia is necessary, but the &quot;compared-to-what&quot; aspect needed to support their argument is missing.

Again, the rationale of the study was for the first time to investigate a different mode of astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling than what had been reported previously, namely signaling associated with behavior. We consider comparing startle responses in anesthetized vs. awake mice would be highly influenced by the particular anesthesia employed (depth, type of anesthetic agent) and maybe of lesser value.</p><p>We agree that a comparison between anesthetized and awake mice could provide important information, but do not have mice of the appropriate age to perform these experiments at the current time, and the work needed for a proper analysis of these questions is extensive as it would require several different types of anesthesia, anesthesia depths and probably also a new way of inducing “startle” that would work in anesthesia (foot shock or electrical stimulation of of the whisker pad, which are methods that we do not have established in our laboratory).</p><p>As detailed in point 2, we have softened our conclusion where we believe appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The reactive gliosis assessment has a tacked-on quality; seems more like something that would be included in a basic characterization of the tg-ArcSwe model.

However, the GFAP levels came out as non-significant in the statistical modeling, and there was no clear relationship between GFAP level and ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the AD mice. We believe the data still are of interest to include in the story as gliosis is not well described in this particular mouse model before in the neocortex, and also may provide one possible explanation why pupil responses are not so clearly correlated to astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling anymore, as reactive astrocytes may express a different repertoire of receptors and signaling pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Clearly lay out the goals of the study, providing sufficient description of all the various aspects-role of NA signaling in AD, NA induction of astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, behavior-induced (NA-dependent) ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, novel technique for real-time monitoring of astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, etc-for the reader to follow along.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the background of NE in relation to both AD and astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals should be presented more comprehensively.

We intended here to study astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in a disease state where the mice would express a clear phenotype, both in terms of cognitive function, and pathomorphological changes, such as a clear plaque load, hoping to probe whether relevant differences of astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were present in AD that potentially could contribute to perturbed cognition. We have added more information about the symptoms and disease progression of this mouse strain in the Introduction and in the Materials and methods. We agree that experiments in younger mice are worth pursuing for future experiments, focussing on the earlier states in the disease progression and this is now commented upon in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) It is unclear to me why authors picked this specific mouse model of AD.

This presumably drives a 10-fold stronger expression of GCaMP in AD mouse astrocytes. Since GCaMP acts as a strong ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator/buffer, this alone could disrupt ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, baseline ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms in astrocytes, and/or fail to report ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in a way that is comparable to controls, in such a way that this could partially explain the impaired ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling observed in AD mice.

I think this is a crucially important control experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We did assess GFP expression by confocal microscopy of sections from the FOVs used for 2P imaging and found comparable levels between the groups (median fluorescence: 28 ± 10.3 a.u. in AD vs. 25 ± 10.9 a.u. in WT, p = 0.88, area fraction of GFP labeling: 66.1 ± 4.44 in AD vs. 70.5 ± 5.42 in WT). Even if quantification of fluorescence from brain slices is an imprecise measurement, it would clearly detect large differences in sensor expression as suggested by the reviewer. Why we do not see a significantly increased GCaMP expression in the AD mice with much more GFAP expression is not entirely clear, but could be due to rAAV infectious rates in normal vs. reactive astrocytes for instance. Clearly these data are important to report, and are now to be found in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3. Moreover, we find a similar level of ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in quiet wakefulness in tg-ArcSwe compared to WT mice, suggesting a comparable level of sensor expression between the two groups, as basal astrocytic ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are known to determine also ca<sup>2+</sup> signal frequency (see “Local Resting ca<sup>2+</sup> Controls the Scale of Astroglial ca<sup>2+</sup> Signals”, King et al., Cell Reports 2020).
