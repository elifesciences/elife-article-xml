motility. They assemble into non-polar filaments independently of nucleotides and typically associate with the cytoplasmic membrane. Their membrane interaction is thought to involve a short N-terminal peptide, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we clarify the complete membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of the <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> bactofilin BacA and identify residues critical for its function. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that its affinity for membranes arises from hydrophobic residue-driven water exclusion and electrostatic interactions with negatively charged phospholipid headgroups. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that this mode of membrane binding is conserved across diverse bacterial phyla. Importantly, we observe that BacA polymerization and membrane binding stimulate each other, and both of these processes are necessary for recruiting the membrane-bound client protein PbpC, a cell wall synthase that interacts with BacA via its N-terminal cytoplasmic region. PbpC can functionally replace the MTS of BacA when overproduced, demonstrating that client proteins contribute to the bactofilin-membrane association. Thus, bactofilin assembly and localization are determined by a complex interplay of different factors, thereby enabling the adaptation of these processes to the needs of the systems they control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytoskeletal protein</kwd><kwd>bactofilin</kwd><kwd>membrane-targeting sequence</kwd><kwd>protein-membrane interaction</kwd><kwd>membrane binding</kwd><kwd>amphiphilic peptide</kwd><kwd>CcmA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01rdrb571</institution-id><institution>University of Marburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Core funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bange</surname><given-names>Gert</given-names></name><name><surname>Thanbichler</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01hhn8329</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Max Planck Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bange</surname><given-names>Gert</given-names></name><name><surname>Thanbichler</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>450420164 - TH 885/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thanbichler</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2033 - 390677874 - RESOLV</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schäfer</surname><given-names>Lars V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>324652314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bange</surname><given-names>Gert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>260989694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bange</surname><given-names>Gert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/801459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Saumyak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01hhn8329</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral research grant from the Microcosm Earth Center</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez-Tamayo</surname><given-names>Rogelio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Many important components of the bacterial cytoskeleton have eukaryotic homologs. The conserved cell division protein FtsZ, for instance, is a member of the tubulin superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Löwe and Amos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mukherjee et al., 1993</xref>), forming dynamic polymers at the cell division site that control the assembly and function of the cell division apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McQuillen and Xiao, 2020</xref>). By contrast, the morphogenetic protein MreB, which governs cell growth and morphology in most rod-shaped bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>), is homologous to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rohs and Bernhardt, 2021</xref>). Some bacteria also possess intermediate-filament-like proteins, such as the coiled-coil-rich protein crescentin, which promotes cell curvature in the crescent-shaped alphaproteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ausmees et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Apart from these universally conserved cytoskeletal protein families, bacterial cells can contain various polymer-forming proteins that are typically absent from eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagstaff and Löwe, 2018</xref>). A prominent member of this group of proteins is bactofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Bactofilin homologs are widespread among bacteria and involved in diverse cellular functions.

Bactofilins are relatively small proteins characterized by a central Bactofilin A/B domain (InterPro ID: IPR007607) that is typically flanked by unstructured terminal regions of varying lengths. The central domain is ~110 amino acids long and folds into a compact right-handed β-helix with a triangular geometry, measuring roughly 3 nm along its longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kassem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>). This basic unit polymerizes into extended non-polar filaments through alternating head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions between individual subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). The resulting protofilaments can further assemble into higher-order structures such as bundles, lattices, and 2D crystalline sheets in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holtrup et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zuckerman et al., 2015</xref>) and, potentially, also in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that bactofilins are typically associated with the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hay et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). However, only a small subset of them, including certain gammaproteobacterial representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hay et al., 1999</xref>), contain predicted transmembrane helices, suggesting that canonical bactofilins use an unconventional membrane-targeting mechanism that may have specifically evolved in this cytoskeletal protein family. Consistent with this notion, the membrane-binding activity of bactofilin homologs from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2023</xref>) has recently been shown to depend on a short peptide in the N-terminal unstructured region of the proteins. However, the conservation of these peptides, the precise mechanism underlying their affinity for the lipid bilayer, and the interplay between membrane attachment and bactofilin polymerization still remain to be investigated.</p><p>In this study, we comprehensively analyze the membrane-binding behavior of bactofilins, using BacA from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> as a model protein. Previous work has shown that BacA forms membrane-associated polymeric sheets at the old pole of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell, which recruit the cell wall synthase PbpC to stimulate stalk formation at this subcellular location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). By systematically exchanging residues in the N-terminal region of BacA, we identify a short N-terminal peptide (MFSKQAKS) that acts as the membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of BacA and pinpoint residues critical for its membrane-binding activity in vivo and in vitro. We then clarify the molecular mechanism underlying the membrane affinity of this sequence using molecular dynamics simulations. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis suggests that the mode of action identified for the MTS of BacA may be broadly conserved among bactofilins from various different phyla. Importantly, our findings indicate that membrane association and polymerization are cooperative processes that are both required for robust BacA assembly, with polymerization in turn promoting the interaction of BacA with its client protein PbpC, and vice versa. Together, these findings reveal the mechanistic basis of membrane binding by bactofilin homologs and highlight its implications for bactofilin function, thereby shedding light on a thus-far poorly understood aspect in the biology of this widespread cytoskeletal protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The membrane-binding activity of BacA depends on an N-terminal amphipathic peptide</title><p>Previous work has proposed a small N-terminal peptide as the membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) of canonical bactofilin homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA, the suggested region comprises the sequence MFSKQAKS at the N-terminal end of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To verify the importance of this peptide for BacA function, we compared the localization pattern of wild-type BacA with that of a mutant derivative lacking the predicted MTS. For this purpose, the two proteins were fused to the monomeric yellow fluorescent protein mVenus and produced in a strain carrying an in-frame deletion in the endogenous <italic>bacA</italic> and <italic>bacB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, the wild-type protein was fully functional and formed distinct fluorescent foci at the stalked pole of the cells, which have been previously shown to reflect the formation of small patches of membrane-associated BacA polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). The mutant protein (Δ2–8), by contrast, was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm, supporting the idea that the N-terminal region of BacA is involved in membrane binding. The diffuse localization also suggests a defect in polymerization, which, however, may be a secondary effect resulting from the loss of membrane association, since previous work has shown that the unstructured terminal regions are not essential for bactofilin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vasa et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this finding, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed that the Δ2–8 variant formed polymers similar to those of wild-type BacA when overproduced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, although not essential, membrane binding may facilitate BacA polymerization at native expression levels by promoting its enrichment at the membrane surface and thereby stimulating inter-subunit interactions. To further evaluate the role of polymerization in BacA localization, we generated a mutant variant of BacA impaired in self-assembly by replacing a conserved phenylalanine residue in the C-terminal polymerization interface of its Bactofilin A/B domain (F130 in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA) with a charged arginine residue.

Among the single exchanges, substitution of the hydrophobic phenylalanine residue at position 2 (F2Y and F2E) led to a disperse or, occasionally, patchy distribution of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Other single substitutions, by contrast, had relatively mild effects, including the formation of multiple and/or mispositioned bactofilin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Notably, however, a double exchange replacing the two positively charged lysine residues in the MTS with polar serine residues (K4S-K7S) strongly increased the fraction of delocalized protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), although distinct fluorescent foci or patches were still detectable, suggesting residual membrane-binding activity. An even stronger effect, as reflected by a complete dispersion of the fluorescence signal, was observed when negatively charged glutamate residues were introduced at these positions (K4E-K7E).

To this end, cells producing different BacA-mVenus variants were lysed and membranes were separated from soluble components by ultracentrifugation. Western blot analysis revealed that a large part of the wild-type protein was detected in the membrane fraction, whereas the variant lacking the MTS (Δ2–8) was completely soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A severe reduction in membrane-binding activity was also observed for all fusion proteins lacking residues F2 and K4/K7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming the importance of these residues in the function of the MTS.</p><p>After having identified a role of the MTS in the association of BacA with membranes in vivo, we aimed to verify the membrane-targeting activity of this peptide in a defined system in vitro. For this purpose, we purified wild-type BacA and various mutant derivatives, using a cleavable N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO affinity tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marblestone et al., 2006</xref>), which allowed us to obtain proteins without any non-native extensions that could potentially interfere with the analysis. This approach also made it possible to obtain two additional BacA variants, one lacking the N-terminal methionine of BacA (ΔM) and another one lacking the N-terminal methionine and containing a glutamate instead of the phenylalanine normally located at the second position of the MTS (xE). We then incubated the different proteins with small unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) made of phosphatidylglycerol, which has been identified as the most abundant membrane lipid in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Contreras et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stankeviciute et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequently, the liposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation and analyzed for the amount of bound protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with the in vivo data, a large proportion (~80%) of the wild-type protein was associated with the liposome pellet, whereas only a small fraction sedimented in control reactions lacking liposomes, likely reflecting large, poorly soluble polymer bundles. Variants lacking the entire MTS (Δ2–8) or carrying the F2E or K4E-K7E exchanges, by contrast, showed severe defects in membrane binding, with sedimentation efficiencies similar to those obtained in the liposome-free control reactions. Residual binding was still observed for the F2Y and K4S-K7S variants, consistent with the milder defects observed for these proteins in the localization and single-particle tracking studies (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Notably, while the behavior of the xE variant closely resembled that of the F2E variant, the absence of residue M1 (ΔM) alone only partially abolished the membrane association of BacA, indicating that the N-terminal methionine plays an important but not decisive role in the function of the MTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Together, these findings verify the existence of an N-terminal MTS in BacA. Moreover, they identify the hydrophobic residues M1 and F2 and the two positively charged lysine residues K4 and K7 as key determinants of its membrane-binding affinity.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Co-sedimentation analysis of the association of various BacA variants with liposomes.</title><p>The indicated proteins (20 µM) were incubated without (-) or with (+) liposomes (0.4 mg/mL) prior to ultracentrifugation.

Notably, in control simulations in which the peptides were initially modeled as α-helices, the peptides unfolded rapidly, either in the aqueous phase or after binding to the membrane/water interface, eventually yielding the same results (within the statistical uncertainties) as the simulations starting from an extended conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamics simulation of the interaction between the BacA membrane-targeting sequence (MTS) and a model membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshot of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation system showing the 10-mer peptide MFSKQAKSNN (BacA<sub>1-10</sub>; red) after binding to the lipid bilayer.

The results show that the N-terminal residues 1 and 2 insert deeply into the lipid bilayer, assuming positions below the phosphate headgroup region, while the positions of the remaining residues (3–10) are gradually shifted towards the aqueous phase. The peptides thus bind to the membrane in a tilted orientation, with their N-terminal region protruding more deeply into the hydrophobic parts of the lipid headgroup region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, in case of the F2Y variant, the presence of tyrosine at position 2 pulls residue M1 and Y2 further towards the headgroup/water interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result can be explained by the preferential hydration of tyrosine compared to phenylalanine, as is also reflected in the difference of the solvation free energies (ΔG<sub>solv</sub>) of the corresponding side-chain analogs <italic>p</italic>-cresol (–25.6 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>) and toluene (–3.2 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolfenden et al., 1981</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the interactions between the peptides and the membrane in more detail, the contacts between the individual peptide residues and the different lipid species in the bilayers were counted. The results confirm the above finding that residues 1 and 2 show the strongest association with lipids and that lipid interactions gradually decrease for residues further down the peptide chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Notably, among these interactions, contacts with anionic PG lipids dominate, even though the percentage of PG lipids (33%) in the simulated bilayer is smaller than that of GLY lipids (50%) (see above and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which can largely be attributed to the lysine residues at positions 4 and 7. In line with this result, the K4S-K7S variant shows a strong reduction in the number of PG contacts at these positions, which is partially compensated by a higher prevalence of GLY contacts, particularly for residues 1–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The F2Y variant, by contrast, did not show a marked decrease in the number of total lipid contacts for position 2, with fewer PG contacts (of residues 1 and 2) again compensated by more GLY lipid contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Taken together, the lipid contact analysis shows that the N-terminal residues M1 and F2 establish the closest contacts with the lipid bilayer, and that the lysine residues K4 and K7 strongly interact with PG lipids.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Contact numbers and interaction energies for different peptide-lipid bilayer interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The graph shows the total number of contacts between individual residues in the wild-type, K4S-K7S, and F2Y peptides and the lipid bilayer, as well as the number of contacts with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) lipids and monoglucosyldiglyceride (GLY) lipids. A contact between a peptide residue and a lipid was defined to exist if any two non-hydrogen atoms of the residue and a lipid molecule were within a distance of 0.5 nm to each other. Contacts were counted for each frame of the MD trajectories and averaged. Multiple contacts between a peptide and a lipid molecule were treated as a single contact, so that the number of contacts counted was either 1 or 0.

To additionally determine the strength of the interactions, we analyzed the MD simulations in terms of the interaction energies between the different peptide residues and the lipid molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For both the wild-type peptide and its F2Y variant, the strongest (most favorable) peptide-lipid interaction energy is seen for residues 1, 4, and 7, which can be attributed to strong electrostatic attraction between the PG lipids and the charged NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group at the N-terminus (residue M1) as well as the side chains of residues K4 and K7, respectively. Notably, out of all residues, M1 interacts most strongly with the membrane. Nevertheless, its removal (ΔM) had only a moderate effect on the membrane-binding activity of BacA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), corroborating the notion that the largest part of the interaction energy is provided by the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of M1 rather than its hydrophobic side chain. However, taken together, the two lysines K4 and K7 make an even larger contribution to the interaction, consistent with the significant reduction in membrane association observed for the K4S-K7S variants of BacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is interesting to note that in terms of the interaction energy, residue F2 does not seem to play a prominent role in the peptide-membrane association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), although the F2Y exchange strongly reduces the membrane-binding affinity of BacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The deleterious effect of this exchange may be explained by the preferential hydration of tyrosine compared to phenylalanine, which is not reflected in the peptide-membrane interaction energy but in the difference in hydration free-energy (see above). Furthermore, residues M1 and Y2 in the F2Y peptide are located in closer proximity to the aqueous phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which leads to a substantial decrease in the favorable interaction energy of the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>-group with PG lipids that is only incompletely compensated by slightly more favorable interactions with GLY lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Together, these results provide a rational basis for the experimental finding that the F2Y and K4S-K7S variants of BacA have a considerably lower membrane-binding affinity than the wild-type protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The N-terminal membrane-targeting sequence is conserved among bactofilin homologs</title><p>The results of the MD simulations confirmed that the short peptide (MFSKQAKS) at the N-terminus of BacA acts as an MTS. To assess whether this mode of interaction was more widespread among bactofilins, we established a bioinformatic pipeline to analyze the conservation of the N-terminal region of bactofilin homologs from a broad range of bacterial lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To this end, all proteins containing an annotated bactofilin domain were retrieved from the UniProt database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). After the exclusion of entries from non-bacterial origin, we eliminated all bactofilin homologs containing predicted N-terminal transmembrane helices as a membrane anchor. These proteins were relatively rare (~3.2%) but widely distributed across the bacterial phylogeny, with the majority found in the gammaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To avoid biases arising from the over-representation of certain bacterial species in UniProt, we next grouped highly similar (&gt;90% identity) bactofilin sequences, which typically represent orthologs from different sequenced strains, and only kept one sequence per group. For each of the remaining proteins, we then determined the N-terminal region preceding the bactofilin domain. Based on the length of the MTS identified for BacA, we eliminated proteins whose predicted N-terminal tails were shorter than eight amino acids, potentially due to misannotation of the translational start sites. The remaining proteins (14,337 sequences) were then used to search for conserved N-terminal amino acid motifs.</p><p>A global analysis of the entire protein set yielded a conserved motif with the consensus sequence MFSKKKK, which resembled the MTS identified for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA and contained both the two hydrophobic N-terminal residues that insert into the core of the lipid bilayer as well as the two lysine residues that make electrostatic interactions with the headgroups of PG lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result suggests that the presence of an N-terminal MTS is a common feature of bacterial bactofilin homologs. However, this global approach might obscure lineage-specific adaptations of the MTS to evolutionary differences in membrane lipid composition. To address this issue, we conducted an additional analysis in which we sorted the proteins according to their phylogenetic origin before performing a motif search. In doing so, we focused on the phyla Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, Bacillota, Spirochaetota, and Thermodesulfobacteriota, which contribute the majority of the bactofilin homologs in the UniProt database. This refined analysis confirmed the presence of conserved N-terminal motifs in each of the five phyla, although there is variability in the consensus sequences of these motifs both within and between phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). A comparison of the most prevalent motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) revealed that bactofilin homologs from Pseudomonadota and Bacillota share highly similar N-terminal sequences, which largely correspond to the global motif described above. A similar N-terminal motif is also found in most bactofilin homologs from Bacteroidota, although these proteins often display a negatively rather than a positively charged residue at position 4. The most prevalent motif identified in Spirochaetota and Thermodesulfobacteriota, by contrast, is fundamentally different from the global consensus motif and may thus have a function unrelated to membrane binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, there is also a subset of sequences from these phyla that do share MTS-like sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the ability of bactofilins to interact with membranes is still widespread in these bacterial lineages. Together, these results strongly suggest that the majority of bactofilin homologs known to date feature an N-terminal MTS whose composition and mode of action are similar to that of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Conservation of the N-terminal regions of bactofilin homologs in different bacterial phyla.</title><p>The pie chart in the middle shows the relative distribution of the 14,337 unique bactofilin homologs analyzed among the indicated bacterial phyla.

Next, we aimed to pinpoint the regions in the cytoplasmic tail of PbpC that mediate its recruitment to BacA. For this purpose, we retrieved the amino acid sequences of PbpC homologs and aligned their predicted cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This analysis identified four distinct segments, including (i) a highly conserved peptide at the N-terminal end of PbpC (region C1), (ii) a proline-rich medial region, (iii) a second highly conserved peptide (Region C2), and (iv) a region rich in positively charged amino acids immediately adjacent to the transmembrane helix. To assess the importance of these segments, we generated mVenus-PbpC derivatives whose cytoplasmic tail either lacked region C1 (Δ2–13) or only comprised region C1, with the remaining parts being replaced by an unstructured region taken from the periplasmic protein DipM of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Izquierdo-Martinez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).

When biosensors carrying the immobilized peptide were titrated with increasing concentrations of BacA, we observed specific binding with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of 4.9 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>). A similar assay with the polymerization-deficient F130R variant, by contrast, only yielded residual binding with very fast dissociation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These results confirm the direct interaction of BacA with region C1 of PbpC. Moreover, they indicate that BacA polymerization is a prerequisite for efficient and stable PbpC binding, likely because the high local accumulation of BacA within polymers leads to an increase in the avidity for its interaction partner.</p><p>Having identified a direct association of BacA with the N-terminal peptide of PbpC, we set out to map the PbpC-binding site of BacA using hydrogen-deuterium-exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry, a method that allows the detection of local shifts in the accessibility of backbone amide hydrogens induced by conformational changes and/or ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Konermann et al., 2011</xref>). When analyzed alone, the HDX profile of BacA showed very fast HDX in the N- and C-terminal regions flanking the bactofilin domain, which indicates a high degree of disorder and thus corroborates the predicted domain structure of BacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>). Upon incubation with the PbpC peptide, several peptides in the C-terminal half of the central bactofilin domain exhibited a small, yet significant decrease in the HDX rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), with the most prominent changes observed in a region close to the C-terminal polymerization interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Although additional studies are required to precisely define the interface, this finding suggests that inter-subunit interactions in the bactofilin polymer could potentially induce slight conformational changes in BacA that promote PbpC binding.</p><p>To clarify whether the interaction with PbpC contributes to BacA assembly, we compared the localization patterns of BacA-Venus in wild-type and Δ<italic>pbpC</italic> cells. The behavior of the fusion protein was unchanged in the mutant background, suggesting that PbpC does not have a major role in BacA polymerization or membrane binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, it was conceivable that PbpC binding could contribute, at least to some extent, to the association of BacA polymers with the cytoplasmic membrane, thereby complementing the activity of the MTS. To test this hypothesis, we set out to investigate the effect of PbpC on the assembly of an MTS-free BacA-mVenus variant (Δ2–8). Our initial studies showed that the mutant protein had a diffuse localization when analyzed in cells producing PbpC at native levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, it was possible that, in this setting, the affinity between the two proteins or the number of PbpC molecules available for the interaction are not be high enough to compensate for the loss of the endogenous membrane-targeting sequence. We, therefore, performed localization studies in cells that overproduced a C-terminally truncated variant of PbpC in which the periplasmic region was replaced by the fluorescent protein mCherry (PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>), thereby accumulating elevated levels of the PbpC membrane anchor. Control experiments showed that the truncated protein colocalized with wild-type BacA-mVenus and stabilized the polar bactofilin cluster under conditions of BacA-mVenus overproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, the increased availability of the PbpC membrane anchor also fully restored polar localization for the MTS-free fusion protein (Δ2–8), whereas it could not reverse the localization defect of the polymerization-deficient F130R variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These results support the notion that membrane binding and polymerization are cooperative processes that are both required for efficient bactofilin assembly. Moreover, they suggest that membrane-bound client proteins can contribute to the recruitment of bactofilins to the cytoplasmic membrane, although the importance of this effect may vary between systems.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Contribution of PbpC to BacA membrane association.</title><p><italic>C. crescentus</italic> Δ<italic>bacAB</italic> Δ<italic>pbpC</italic> cells producing the indicated BacA-mVenus variants (WT, Δ2–8, F130R) under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter and PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mCherry under the control of a vanillate-inducible promoter (strains MAB575, MAB576, and MAB577) were grown in the presence of xylose (left) or both xylose and vanillate (right) prior to microscopic analysis.

Although the polymers they form are typically associated with the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane, the vast majority of bactofilin homologs lack transmembrane helices, suggesting the existence of an alternative membrane-targeting mechanism. Consistent with this notion, the membrane-binding activity of the bactofilin <italic>Th</italic>Bac from <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> has recently been localized to the unstructured N-terminal tail of the protein, and a sequence alignment based on several well-characterized bactofilin homologs suggested the existence of a conserved N-terminal motif in this protein region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). Our work considerably extends these initial findings by determining the precise composition of the N-terminal MTS, unraveling its mode of action and clarifying its conservation among bacteria. Moreover, we reveal a mutual dependence of membrane-binding and bactofilin polymerization and provide first insights into mode of interaction between the bactofilin scaffold and membrane-associated client proteins.</p><p>Mutational analysis of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA identified residues F2 and K4/K7 as key components of the BacA MTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This finding is explained by the results of our MD analysis, which show that the insertion of F2 into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is critical to ensure the proper positioning of the MTS in the membrane, thereby promoting electrostatic interactions of the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group with the negatively charged lipid headgroups of phosphatidylglycerol. The positively charged ε-amino groups of K4 and K7, by contrast, directly interact with these lipid headgroups, making the largest contribution to the overall interaction energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, the N-terminal methionine residue of proteins is usually removed after translation when followed by an amino acid with a short side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirel et al., 1989</xref>). In the case of BacA, however, the bulky phenylalanine residue at position 2 presumably inhibits this process, so that residue M1 may be a genuine, conserved part of the MTS. Although M1 interacts most extensively with the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), its absence has only a moderate effect on the membrane-binding activity of BacA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This observation supports the idea that most of its interaction energy is contributed by the N-terminal NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group, whereas the insertion of the M1 side chain into the hydrophobic core of the membrane only serves to tune the positioning of the N-terminus at the lipid-water interface. Consistent with the results of the MD simulations, the loss of either F2 or K4/K7 drastically impairs the membrane-binding activity of BacA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Moreover, it prevents the assembly of BacA into distinct higher-order complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting a link between BacA membrane association and polymerization. Indeed, a soluble BacA variant lacking the native MTS (Δ2–8) regains the ability to form polymeric complexes when fused to a heterologous MTS from <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that membrane binding is a prerequisite for efficient BacA polymerization. Conversely, polymerization appears to promote membrane binding, because the disruption of the BacA polymerization interface (F130R) strongly increases the fraction of soluble protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Comparable results were obtained when a suitable membrane anchor was provided in trans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Together, these findings point to a cooperative binding mechanism, whereby (i) membrane association leads to an increase in the local concentration of BacA that facilitates its self-assembly into polymers, and (ii) polymerization closely juxtaposes multiple MTS-containing N-terminal tails, thereby increasing the avidity of BacA for the membrane and shifting the equilibrium to the membrane-bound state. This process may be particularly relevant at the low bactofilin levels (~200 BacA molecules per cell) found in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, substitutions in the MTS that did not completely abolish BacA assembly often led to the formation of multiple and/or mislocalized complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The mechanism determining the polar localization of BacA is still unclear. However, it is conceivable that bactofilin polymers are intrinsically curved and thus preferentially associate with membrane regions of positive or negative Gaussian curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>). Alternatively, the MTS may preferentially bind certain lipid species that are enriched in the polar regions of the cell, with its modification leading to a change in the lipid specificity that interferes with this recruitment pathway. Exchanges at less critical positions of the MTS may affect these recruitment mechanisms by reducing the membrane-binding affinity and thus, indirectly, also the dimensions of BacA polymers, or by altering their lipid specificity.</p><p>To assess whether the mode of membrane association established for BacA is more widely conserved, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of the N-terminal regions of all bactofilin homologs known to date. This analysis revealed that amino acid sequences similar to the MTS of BacA are highly prevalent in a large number of bactofilins from the phyla Pseudomonadota, Bacteroidota, and Bacillota, strongly suggesting that MTS-mediated membrane binding is a common theme among this group of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Notably, however, most prevalent N-terminal motifs identified for the bactofilin homologs of Spirochaetota and Thermodesulfobacteriota are fundamentally different from those of the other phyla investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that they exhibit in a different mode of membrane binding or interacts with factors other than the cytoplasmic membrane.</p><p>Notably, a small subset of bacterial bactofilin homologs contains an N-terminal transmembrane domain, which mediates their stable insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane. While found in a diversity of bacterial phyla, these proteins are particularly abundant in the Pseudomonadota, especially in their gammaproteobacterial and alphaproteobacterial lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). One of them, the bactofilin CcmA of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, has been previously investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hay et al., 1999</xref>). It was shown to undergo proteolytic processing and exist in two forms, a full-length form that is an integral membrane protein and a shorter form that lacks the N-terminal transmembrane segments. Intriguingly, the shorter form has an N-terminal sequence (MFSRKTE) that corresponds to the predicted consensus sequence of the MTS in Pseudomonadota and, indeed, behaves like a typical peripheral membrane protein. The specific functional properties conferred by these two distinct modes of membrane association are still unclear. However, it is tempting to speculate that the assembly of MTS-containing bactofilins may be dynamically regulated by cell cycle-dependent changes in membrane curvature or composition, whereas homologs with transmembrane domains may form more static polymeric assemblies. Consistent with this idea, <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA only assembles at the old cell pole once its cell envelope bulges outward to initiate stalk formation, thereby establishing a region of positive Gaussian curvature, although its cytoplasmic levels remain constant throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kühn et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, the BacA homolog of the stalked budding bacterium <italic>H. neptunium</italic> consistently assembles in regions of positive Gaussian curvature, first localizing to the stalked pole and then, once the terminal segment of the stalk starts to expand into a bud, to the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pöhl et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Instead of using an MTS or a transmembrane domain, some bactofilins may also interact with the membrane indirectly by binding to other membrane-associated proteins, as recently suggested for the bactofilin homolog CcmA from <italic>H. pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>). Our results show that the interaction with PbpC contributes, at least to some extent, to the membrane association of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> BacA. We did not observe any obvious localization defects in a Δ<italic>pbpC</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that PbpC binding is not critical for proper BacA assembly and positioning at native accumulation levels. However, when produced in excess, the PbpC membrane anchor was able to fully compensate for the absence of the N-terminal MTS, providing sufficient links with the cytoplasmic membrane to enable the assembly of polar BacA clusters. Thus, client protein binding is an important factor to consider when analyzing the assembly and localization dynamics of bactofilins in vivo.</p><p>The determinants mediating the interaction of membrane-associated bactofilin scaffolds with their client proteins are still poorly understood. For <italic>M. xanthus</italic> BacP, the binding site for its soluble interactor PadC was shown to be located in the exceptionally long unstructured C-terminal tail, which contains a conserved KKKVVVKK motif potentially involved in the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). However, most bactofilin homologs have much shorter C-terminal tails, which are typically poorly conserved in sequence and, at least in certain cases, dispensable for function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sichel et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting a direct interaction of client proteins with the bactofilin core domain. Our results indeed indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of PbpC associates with the C-terminal region of the bactofilin domain, close to the polymerization interface. Importantly, BacA assembly appears to be critical for efficient PbpC binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), suggesting that inter-subunit contacts could potentially change the conformation of BacA, such as to increase its affinity for its client protein. In addition, BacA polymers may have a higher avidity for PbpC than monomers. Polymerization thus acts as a trigger for both membrane association and the recruitment of client proteins, ensuring the tight regulation of bactofilin function.</p><p>Collectively, our findings provide important new insights into the function of bactofilins and the nucleotide-independent dynamics of their assembly. It will be interesting to analyze how cell cycle- or stress-induced changes in membrane composition affect the membrane-binding and polymerization behavior of MTS-containing bactofilin homologs. Moreover, it will be informative to shed light on the mode of membrane binding for bactofilins with conserved N-terminal sequences that are clearly distinct from the global consensus motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Proteins were digested online on an Enzymate BEH Pepsin column (300 Å, 5 μm, 2.1 mm × 30 mm; Waters, USA) at 12°C with a constant flow (100 μl min<sup>–1</sup>) of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, and the resulting peptic peptides were collected on a trap column (2 mm ×2 cm) that was filled with POROS 20 R2 material (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and kept at 0.5°C. After 3 min, the trap column was placed in line with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm 1.0×100 mm column (Waters, USA), and the peptides were eluted at 0.5°C using a gradient of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min generated as follows: 0–7 min/95–65 % A, 7–8 min/65–15 % A, 8–10 min/15 % A, 10–11 min/5 % A, 11–16 min/95 % A. Peptides were ionized with an electrospray ionization source operated at 250°C capillary temperature and a spray voltage of 3.0 kV. Mass spectra were acquired over a range of 50–2000 m/z on a G2-Si HDMS mass spectrometer with ion mobility separation (Waters, USA) in Enhanced High Definition MS (HDMS<sup>E</sup>) or High Definition MS (HDMS) mode for undeuterated and deuterated samples, respectively. A [Glu1]-Fibrinopeptide B standard (Waters, USA) was employed for lock mass correction. After each run, the pepsin column was washed three times with 80 μl of 4% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.5 M guanidine hydrochloride, and blanks were performed between each sample. All measurements were carried out in triplicate.</p><p>Peptides from the non-deuterated samples (acquired with HDMS<sup>E</sup>) were identified with the ProteinLynx Global SERVER (PLGS, Waters, USA), employing low energy, elevated energy, and intensity thresholds of 300, 100, and 1000 counts, respectively. Peptides were matched using a database containing the amino acid sequences of the proteins of interest, pepsin and their reversed sequences. The search parameters were as follows: peptide tolerance = automatic; fragment tolerance = automatic; min fragment ion matches per peptide = 1; min fragment ion matches per protein = 7; min peptide matches per protein = 3; maximum hits to return = 20; maximum protein mass = 250,000; primary digest reagent = non-specific; missed cleavages = 0; false discovery rate = 100. Deuterium incorporation was quantified with DynamX 3.0 (Waters, USA), using peptides that fulfilled the following criteria: minimum intensity = 5000 counts; maximum length = 40 amino acids; minimum number of products = 2; maximum mass error = 25 ppm; retention time tolerance = 0.5 min. After automated data processing with DynamX, all spectra were manually inspected and, if necessary, peptides were omitted (e.g. in case of a low signal-to-noise ratio or the presence of overlapping peptides).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bioinformatic analysis</title><p>Nucleotide and protein sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>) databases, respectively. Sequences were compared and analyzed using the blastn, blastp, or PSI-blast algorithm as implemented on the NCBI website. The presence of putative amphipathic helices was assessed using AMPHIPASEEK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sapay et al., 2006</xref>). Multiple sequence alignments were generated with MUSCLE v3.8.31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edgar, 2004</xref>) and viewed and edited with Jalview v2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waterhouse et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To identify conserved motifs in the N-terminal regions of bactofilins, all known bactofilin homologs were retrieved from the UniProt database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). Subsequently, a Python-based pre-processing procedure was used to exclude non-bacterial entries, remove sequences with predicted transmembrane helices, and eliminate sequences from species with unclear phylogeny. In addition, highly similar sequences (with over 90% similarity) from the same species were filtered out to correct biases due to over-sequencing. The N-terminal region of each protein was determined using hmmscan (HMMER 3.3.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eddy, 2011</xref>) with the hidden Markov profile constructed from the seed alignment of the bactofilin domain downloaded from the Pfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paysan-Lafosse et al., 2023</xref>). Subsequently, sequences with N-terminal regions shorter than 8 amino acids were eliminated. The resulting set of sequences was categorized by phylum, and MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</xref>) was used to detect the 10 most probable motifs. The analysis employed the following settings: classical objective function, with zero or one occurrence per sequence, motif width ranging from 5 to 50 amino acids, and a 0<sup>th</sup>-order background Markov model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out with Gromacs (version 2021.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>).

The lipid composition of the simulated bilayer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) was chosen such that it mimics as closely as possible the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow and Schmidt, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Siervo and Homola, 1980</xref>). Symmetric bilayers with 128 lipids in each monolayer were constructed, that is, the same number and type of lipids was present in the two leaflets. At the beginning of the simulations, a single bactofilin 10-mer peptide (either the wild-type sequence MFSKQAKSNN, or the K4S/K7S or F2Y variants) were modeled as extended conformations and placed in the bulk water phase, located at least 3 nm away from the lipid headgroups. The net charge of the simulation box was neutralized with 150 mM KCl. After energy minimization (with steepest descent), MD simulations were carried out with periodic boundary conditions in the NpT ensemble at a constant temperature of 310 K, maintained via the Bussi velocity-rescaling thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>), and constant 1 bar pressure, maintained by semi-isotropic pressure coupling of the lateral (x,y) and normal (z) dimensions of the simulation box to a weak coupling barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>). Short-range Coulomb and Lennard-Jones 6,12 interactions were described with a buffered pair list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Páll and Hess, 2013</xref>) with potentials smoothly shifted to zero at a 1.2 nm distance, with forces switched to zero between 1.0 and 1.2 nm. The long-range electrostatic interactions were described with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method with 0.12 nm grid spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darden et al., 1993</xref>). The LINCS and SETTLE algorithms were used to constrain all protein bonds involving H-atoms and to keep the water molecules rigid, respectively, allowing to integrate the equations of motion with 2 fs time steps using the leap-frog integrator. The final production MD simulations were 500 ns long.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed in Excel 2019 (Microsoft) or Python 3.10.12 and mainly visualized using the Python Matplotlib v3.6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunter, 2007</xref>) and Seaborn v0.12.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waskom, 2021</xref>) libraries.

BacA was the progenitor of a family of cytoskeletal proteins that have been identified as ubiquitous structural components in bacteria, performing a range of cell biological functions. Association with the cell membrane is a frequent property of the bactofilins studied and is thought to be important for functionality. However, almost all bactofilins lack a transmembrane domain. While membrane association has been attributed to the unstructured N-terminus, experimental evidence had yet to be provided. As a result, the mode of membrane association and the underlying molecular mechanics remained elusive.</p><p>Liu at al. analyze the membrane binding properties of BacA in detail and scrutinize molecular interactions using in-vivo, in-vitro and in-silico techniques. They show that few N-terminal amino acids are important for membrane association or proper localization and suggest that membrane association promotes polymerization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed conserved lineage-specific N-terminal motifs indicating a conserved role in protein localization. Using HDX analysis they also identify a potential interaction site with PbpC, a morphogenic cell wall synthase implicated in Caulobacter stalk synthesis. Complementary, they pinpoint the bactofilin-interacting region within the PbpC C-terminus, known to interact with bactofilin. They further show that BacA localization is independent of PbpC.</p><p>Although the phenotypic effects of an abolished BacA-PbpC interaction are mild, these data significantly advance our understanding of bactofilin membrane binding, polymerization, and function at the molecular level. The major strength of the comprehensive study is the combination of complementary in vivo, in vitro and bioinformatic/simulation approaches, the results of which are consistent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The investigators undertook detailed characterization of a previously proposed membrane targeting sequence (MTS), a short N-terminal peptide, of the bactofilin BacA in Caulobacter crescentus. Using light microscopy, single molecule tracking, liposome binding assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, they provide data to suggest that this sequence indeed does function in membrane targeting and further conclude that membrane targeting is required for polymerization. While the membrane association data are reasonably convincing, there are no direct assays to assess polymerization and some assays used lack proper controls as detailed below. Since the MTS isn't required for bactofilin polymerization in other bacterial homologues, showing that membrane binding facilitates polymerization would be a significant advance for the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional experiments were required to consolidate our results and conclusions. Please see below for a description of the new data included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns</p><p>(1) This work claims that the N-termina MTS domain of BacA is required for polymerization, but they do not provide sufficient evidence that the ∆2-8 mutant or any of the other MTS variants actually do not polymerize (or form higher order structures). Bactofilins are known to form filaments, bundles of filaments, and lattice sheets in vitro and bundles of filaments have been observed in cells. Whether puncta or diffuse labeling represents different polymerized states or filaments vs. monomers has not been established. Microscopy shows mis-localization away from the stalk, but resolution is limited. Further experiments using higher resolution microscopy and TEM of purified protein would prove that the MTS is required for polymerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not propose that the MTS is directly involved in the polymerization process and state this more clearly now in the Results and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript. To address this point, we performed transmission electron microscopy studies comparing the polymerization behavior of wild-type and mutant BacA variants. The results clearly show that the MTS-free BacA variant (∆2-8) forms polymers that are indistinguishable from those formed by the wild-type protein, when purified from an <italic>E. coli</italic> overproduction strain (new Figure 1–figure supplement 1). This finding is consistent with structural work showing that bactofilin polymerization is exclusively mediated by the conserved bactofilin domain (Deng et al, Nat Microbiol, 2019). However, at native expression levels, BacA only accumulates to ~200 molecules per cell (Kühn et al, EMBO J, 2010). Under these conditions, the MTS-mediated increase in the local concentration of BacA at the membrane surface and, potentially, steric constraints imposed by membrane curvature, may facilitate the polymerization process. This hypothesis has now been stated more clearly in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>For polymer-forming proteins, defined localized signals are typically interpreted as slow-moving or stationary polymeric complexes. A diffuse localization, by contrast, suggests that a protein exists in a monomeric or, at most, (small) oligomeric state in which it diffuses rapidly within the cell and is thus no longer detected as distinct foci by widefield microscopy. Our single-molecule data show that BacA variants that are no longer able to interact with the membrane (as verified by cell fractionation studies and in vitro liposome binding assays) have a high diffusion rate, similar to that measured for the non-polymerizing and non-membrane-bound F130R variant. These results demonstrate that a defect in membrane binding strongly reduces the ability of BacA to form polymeric assemblies. To support this hypothesis, we have now repeated all single-particle tracking experiments and included mVenus as a freely diffusible reference protein. Our data confirm that the mobilities of the ∆2-8 and F130R variants are similar and approach those of free mVenus, supporting the idea that the deficiency to interact with the membrane prevents the formation of extended polymeric structures (which should show much lower mobilities). To underscore the relevance of membrane binding for BacA assembly, we have now included a new experiment, in which we used the PbpC membrane anchor (PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mCherry) to restore the recruitment of the ∆2-8 variant to the membrane (new Figure 9 and Figure 9–figure supplement 1). The results obtained show that the ∆2-8 variant transitions from a diffuse localization to polar foci upon overproduction of PbpC<sub>1-132</sub>-mCherry. The polymerization-impaired F130R variant, by contrast, remains evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm under all conditions. These findings further support the idea that polymerization and membrane-association are mutually interdependent processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Liposome binding data would be strengthened with TEM images to show BacA binding to liposomes. From this experiment, gross polymerization structures of MTS variants could also be characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have the possibility to perform cryo-electron microscopy studies of liposomes bound to BacA. However, the results of the cell fractionation and liposome sedimentation assays clearly support a critical role of the MTS in membrane binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The use of the BacA F130R mutant throughout the study to probe the effect of polymerization on membrane binding is concerning as there is no evidence showing that this variant cannot polymerize. Looking through the papers the authors referenced, there was no evidence of an identical mutation in BacA that was shown to be depolymerized or any discussion in this study of how the F130R mutation might to analogous to polymerization-deficient variants in other bactofilins mentioned in these references.</p></disp-quote><p>Residue F130 in the C-terminal polymerization interface of BacA is conserved among bactofilin homologs, although its absolute position in the protein sequence may vary, depending on the length of the N-terminal unstructured tail. The papers cited in our manuscript show that an exchange of this conserved phenylalanine residue abolishes polymer formation. Nevertheless, we agree that it is important to verify the polymerization defect of the F130R variant in the system under study. We have now included size-exclusion chromatography data showing that BacA-F130R forms a low-molecular-weight complex, whereas the wild-type protein largely elutes in the exclusion volume, indicating the formation of large, polymeric species (new Figure 1–figure supplement 2). In addition, we performed transmission electron microscopy analyses of BacA-F130R, which verified the absence of larger oligomers (new Figure 1–figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Microscopy shows that a BacA variant lacking the native MTS regains the ability to form puncta, albeit mis-localized, in the cell when fused to a heterologous MTS from MreB. While this swap suggests a link between puncta formation and membrane binding the relationship between puncta and polymerization has not been established (see comment 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We show that a BacA variant lacking the MTS (∆2-8) regains the ability to form membrane-associated foci when fused to the MTS of MreB. By contrast, a similar variant that additionally carries the F130R exchange (preventing its polymerization) shows a diffuse cytoplasmic localization. In addition, we show that the F130R exchange leads to a loss of membrane binding and to a considerable increase in the mobility of the variants carrying the MTS of <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB. As described above, we now provide additional data demonstrating that elevated levels of the PbpC membrane anchor can reinstate polar localization for the ∆2-8 variant, whereas it fails to do so for the polymerization-deficient F130R variant (new Figure 9 and Figure 9–figure supplement 1). Together, these results support the hypothesis that membrane association and polymerization act synergistically to establish localized bactofilin assemblies at the stalked cell pole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors provide no primary data for single molecule tracking. There is no tracking mapped onto microscopy images to show membrane localization or lack of localization in MTS deletion/ variants. A known soluble protein (e.g. unfused mVenus) and a known membrane bound protein would serve as valuable controls to interpret the data presented. It also is unclear why the authors chose to report molecular dynamics as mean squared displacement rather than mean squared displacement per unit time, and the number of localizations is not indicated. Extrapolating from the graph in figure 4 D for example, it looks like WT BacA-mVenus would have a mobility of 0.5 (0.02/0.04) micrometers squared per second which is approaching diffusive behavior. Further justification/details of their analysis method is needed. It's also not clear how one should interpret the finding that several of the double point mutants show higher displacement than deleting the entire MTS. These experiments as they stand don't account for any other cause of molecular behavior change and assume that a decrease in movement is synonymous with membrane binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide additional information on the single-particle analysis. A new supplemental figure shows a mapping of single-particle tracks onto the cells in which they were recorded for all proteins analyzed (Figure 2–figure supplement 1). Due to the small size of <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, it is difficult to clearly differentiate between membrane-associated and cytoplasmic protein species. However, overall, slow-diffusing particles tend to be localized to the cell periphery, supporting the idea that membrane-associated particles form larger assemblies (apart from diffusing more slowly due to their membrane association). In addition, we have included a movie that shows the single-particle diffusion dynamics of all proteins in representative cells (Figure 2-video 1). Finally, we have included a table that gives an overview of the number of cells and tracks analyzed for all proteins investigated (Supplementary file 1). Figures 2A and 4D show the mean squared displacement as a function of time, which makes it possible to assess whether the particles observed move by normal, Brownian diffusion (which is the case here). We repeated the entire single-particle tracking analysis to verify the data obtained previously and obtained very similar results. Among the different mutant proteins, only the K4E-K7E variant consistently shows a higher mobility than the MTS-free ∆2-8 variant, with MSD values similar to that of free mVenus. The underlying reason remains unclear. However, we believe that an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon is beyond the scope of this paper. We re-confirmed the integrity of the construct encoding the K4E-K7E variant by DNA sequencing and once again verified the size and stability of the fusion protein by Western blot analysis, excluding artifacts due to errors during cloning and strain construction.</p><p>We agree that the single-molecule tracking data alone are certainly not sufficient to draw firm conclusions on the relationship between membrane binding and protein mobility. However, they are consistent with the results of our other in vivo and in vitro analyses, which together indicate a clear correlation between the mobility of BacA and its ability to interact with the membrane and polymerize (processes that promote each other synergistically).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The experiments that map the interaction surface between the N-terminal unstructured region of PbpC and a specific part of the BacA bactofilin domain seem distinct from the main focus of the paper and the data somewhat preliminary. While the PbpC side has been probed by orthogonal approaches (mutation with localization in cells and affinity in vitro), the BacA region side has only been suggested by the deuterium exchange experiment and needs some kind of validation.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the HDX analysis <italic>per se</italic> are not preliminary and clearly show a change in the solvent accessibility of backbone amides in the C-terminal region in the bactofilin domain in the presence of the PbpC<sub>1-13</sub> peptide. However, we agree that additional experiments are required to precisely map and verify the PbpC binding site. However, as this is not the main focus of the paper, we would like to proceed without conducting further experiments in this area.</p><p>We now provide additional data showing that elevated levels of the PbpC membrane anchor are able to recruit the MTS-free BacA variant (∆2-8) to the cytoplasmic membrane and stimulate its assembly at the stalked pole (Figure 9). These results now integrate Figure 8 more effectively into the overall theme of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors of this study investigated the membrane-binding properties of bactofilin A from Caulobacter crescentus, a classic model organism for bacterial cell biology. BacA was the progenitor of a family of cytoskeletal proteins that have been identified as ubiquitous structural components in bacteria, performing a range of cell biological functions. Association with the cell membrane is a common property of the bactofilins studied and is thought to be important for functionality. However, almost all bactofilins lack a transmembrane domain. While membrane association has been attributed to the unstructured N-terminus, experimental evidence had yet to be provided. As a result, the mode of membrane association and the underlying molecular mechanics remained elusive.</p><p>Liu at al. analyze the membrane binding properties of BacA in detail and scrutinize molecular interactions using in-vivo, in-vitro and in-silico techniques. They show that few N-terminal amino acids are important for membrane association or proper localization and suggest that membrane association promotes polymerization. Bioinformatic analyses revealed conserved lineage-specific N-terminal motifs indicating a conserved role in protein localization. Using HDX analysis they also identify a potential interaction site with PbpC, a morphogenic cell wall synthase implicated in Caulobacter stalk synthesis. Complementary, they pinpoint the bactofilin-interacting region within the PbpC C-terminus, known to interact with bactofilin. They further show that BacA localization is independent of PbpC.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>These data significantly advance the understanding of the membrane binding determinants of bactofilins and thus their function at the molecular level. The major strength of the comprehensive study is the combination of complementary in vivo, in vitro and bioinformatic/simulation approaches, the results of which are consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The results are limited to protein localization and interaction, as there is no data on phenotypic effects. Therefore, the cell biological significance remains somewhat underrepresented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is interesting to investigate the phenotypic effects caused by the reduced membrane binding activity of BacA variants with defects in the MTS. We have now included phenotypic analyses that shed light on the role of region C1 in the localization of PbpC and its function in stalk elongation under phosphate-limiting conditions (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>To address the missing estimation of biological relevance, some additional experiments may be carried out.</p><p>For example, given that BacA localizes PbpC by direct interaction, one might expect an effect on stalk formation if BacA is unable to bind the membrane or to polymerize. The same applies to PbpC variants lacking the C1 region. As the mutant strains are available, these data are not difficult to obtain but would help to compare the effect of the deletions with previous data (e.g. Kühn et al.) even if the differences are small.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analyzed the effect of the removal of region C1 on the ability of mVenus-PbpC to promote stalk elongation in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> under phosphate starvation. Interestingly, our results show that the lack of the BacA-interaction motif impairs the recruitment of the fusion protein to the stalked pole, but it does not interfere with its stimulatory effect on stalk biogenesis. Thus, the polar localization of PbpC does not appear to be critical for its function in localized peptidoglycan synthesis at the stalk base. These results are now shown in Figure 8–Figure supplement 4. The results obtained may be explained by residual transient interactions of mVenus-PbpC with proteins other than BacA at the stalked pole. Notably, PbpC has also been implicated in the attachment of the stalk-specific protein StpX to components of the outer membrane at the stalk base. The polar localization of PbpC may therefore be primarily required to ensure proper StpX localization, consistent with previous work by Hughes et al. (Mol Microbiol, 2013) showing that StpX is partially mislocalized in a strain producing an N-terminally truncated PbpC variant that no longer localizes to the stalk base.</p><p>We have also attempted to investigate the ability of the Δ2-8 and F130R variants of BacA-mVenus to promote stalk elongation under phosphate starvation. However, the levels of the WT, Δ2-8 and F130R proteins and their stabilities were dramatically different after prolonged incubation of the cells in phosphate-limited medium, so that it was not possible to draw any firm conclusions from the results obtained (not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the M23-like endopeptidase LdpA is proposed to be a client protein of BacA (in C. crescentus, Billini et al. 2018, and H. neptunium or R. rubrum, Pöhl et al. 2024). In H. neptunium, it is suggested that the interaction is mediated by a cytoplasmic peptide of LmdC reminiscent of PbpC. This should at least be commented on. It would be interesting to see, if LpdA in C. crescentus is also delocalized and if so, this could identify another client protein of BacA.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to study the role of BacA in LdpA function. However, we have not yet succeeded in generating a stable fluorescent protein fusion to LdpA, which currently makes it impossible to study the interplay between these two proteins in vivo. The focus of the present paper is on the mode of interaction between bactofilins and the cytoplasmic membrane and on the mutual interdependence of membrane binding and bactofilin polymerization. Given that PbpC is so far the only verified interaction partner of BacA in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, we would like to limit our analysis to this client protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further comments:</p><p>L105: analyze --&gt; analyzed</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L169: Is there any reason why the MTS of <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB was doubled?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work has shown that two tandem copies of the N-terminal amphiphilic helix of <italic>E. coli</italic> MreB were required to partially target a heterologous fusion partner protein (GFP) to the cytoplasmic membrane of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (Salje et al, Mol Cell, 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. S3:</p><p>a) Please decide which tag was used (mNG or mVenus) and adapt the figure or legend accordingly.</p><p>b) In the legend for panel (C), please describe how the relative amounts were calculated, as the fractions arithmetically cannot add to &gt; 100%.

It would be even more useful when some more details about the applied criteria for filtering would be provided (e.g. concerning what is meant with &quot;detailed taxonomic information&quot; or &quot;filter out closely related sequences&quot;). Does the latter mean that only one bactofilin sequence per species was used? (As quite many bacteria have more than one but similar bactofilins.)</p></disp-quote><p>We removed sequences from species with unclear phylogeny (e.g. candidate species whose precise taxonomic position has not yet been determined). For many pathogenic species, numerous strains have been sequenced. To account for this bias, only one sequence from clusters of highly similar bactofilin sequences (&gt;90% identity) was retained per species. This information has now been included in the diagram. It is true that many bacteria have more than one bactofilin homolog. However, the sequences of these proteins are typically quite different. For instance, the BacA and BacB from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> only share 52% identity. Therefore, our analysis does not systematically eliminate bactofilin paralogs that coexist in the same species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L281: Although likely, I am not sure if membrane binding has ever been shown for a bactofilin from these phyla.

Unfortu­nately, the sequences of the three co-polymerizing bactofilin paralogs of <italic>R. vannielii</italic> DSM 166 studied by Richter et al (2023) have not been reported and the genome sequence of this strain is not publicly available. However, in related species with three bactofilin paralogs, only one paralog shows an MTS-like N-terminal peptide and another paralog typically contains an unusual cadherin-like domain of unknown function, as also reported for <italic>R. vannielii</italic> DSM 166. Therefore, the mechanism controlling the localization dynamics of bactofilins may be complex in the <italic>Rhodomicrobium</italic> lineage. Nevertheless, at native expression levels, the major bactofilin (BacA) of <italic>R. vannielii</italic> DSM 166 was shown to localize predominantly to the hyphal tips and the (incipient) bud necks, suggesting that regions of distinct membrane curvature could also play a role in its recruitment. We do not claim that all bactofilins recognize positive membrane curvature, which is clearly not the case.
