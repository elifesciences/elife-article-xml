Here, we utilize mouse islets to determine how microtubules (MTs) affect secretion toward the vascular extracellular matrix at single cell and subcellular levels. Our data indicate that MT stability in the β-cell population is heterogenous, and that GSIS is suppressed in cells with highly stable MTs. Consistently, MT hyper-stabilization prevents, and MT depolymerization promotes the capacity of single β-cell for GSIS. Analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of secretion events shows that MT depolymerization activates otherwise dormant β-cells via initiation of secretion clusters (hot spots). MT depolymerization also enhances secretion from individual cells, introducing both additional clusters and scattered events. Interestingly, without MTs, the timing of clustered secretion is dysregulated, extending the first phase of GSIS and causing oversecretion. In contrast, glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was not affected by MT depolymerization yet required for secretion under these conditions, indicating that MT-dependent regulation of secretion hot spots acts in parallel with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Our findings uncover a novel MT function in tuning insulin secretion hot spots, which leads to accurately measured and timed response to glucose stimuli and promotes functional β-cell heterogeneity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule stability</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>biphasic secretion</kwd><kwd>stimulus-secretion coupling</kwd><kwd>computational cluster analysis</kwd><kwd>microtubule dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 DK07061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trogden</surname><given-names>Kathryn P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32DK117529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trogden</surname><given-names>Kathryn P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM127098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaverina</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK65949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMS1562078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>William R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DK106228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Guoqiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>William R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaverina</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM119552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanic</surname><given-names>Marija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 DK122650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bracey</surname><given-names>Kai M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of insulin secretion patterns in pancreatic islets shows that microtubules control β-cell heterogeneity by regulating initiation and timing of secretion hot spot activity in parallel with Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells is tightly regulated and highly heterogeneous. The major stimulator for secretion is glucose, with other nutritional and neuronal signals modulating the response. The prevailing view is that glucose influx results in increased glucose metabolism, higher levels of the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio, and increased levels of metabolite intermediates. The increased ATP/ADP ratio results in the closure of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, β-cell depolarization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that triggers vesicular-cell membrane fusion. Metabolite intermediates promote secretion via known (e.g., microtubule [MT]-dependent vesicular biogenesis, movement, and docking) and unknown mechanisms. Intriguingly, β-cells secrete on the order of tens of granules per cell in response to each round of high-glucose stimulus, which last for hours, despite having thousands of available granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dean, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olofsson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rorsman and Renström, 2003</xref>). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) has characteristic bi-phasic kinetics with a rapid, high peak within minutes after the stimulation (first phase) followed by a sharp decrease and a slow, lower secreting second phase. The mechanisms underlying this timing are believed to be associated with the availability of secretion-ready insulin vesicles, the pool size of which does not depend on changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaisano, 2017</xref>).</p><p>An intriguing property of β-cells is their heterogeneity in morphology, biochemical features, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miranda et al., 2021</xref> and references therein). Accordingly, β-cells have been found to display different metabolic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van De Winkel and Pipeleers, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kiekens et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Schravendijk et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giordano et al., 1993</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bader et al., 2016</xref>), stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lei et al., 2018</xref>), expression of some key function- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jetton and Magnuson, 1992</xref>) or marker-genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorrell et al., 2016</xref>), and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giordano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Schravendijk et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wojtusciszyn et al., 2008</xref>). Such heterogeneous properties are considered important, because different β-cell subsets could contribute to different physiological needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoang Do and Thorn, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain β-cell heterogeneity. For example, it has been proposed that β-cell heterogeneity can result from differences in age, disease state, and location within the islet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dean and Matthews, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stefan et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballian and Brunicardi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguayo-Mazzucato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pipeleers et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, β-cell age/disease states can affect gene expression, vesicle maturity, and glucose metabolic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguayo-Mazzucato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zeng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Specific locations in islets can result in differential cross talk with other islet cell subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efendić and Luft, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pipeleers et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wojtusciszyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Meulen et al., 2015</xref>) and with vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballian and Brunicardi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Low et al., 2014</xref>). However, heterogeneous GSIS is maintained in dissociated single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wojtusciszyn et al., 2008</xref>) and in adults when most β-cells are mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoang Do and Thorn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>). In this regard, approximately 25% of adult β-cells remain unresponsive regardless of the glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoang Do and Thorn, 2015</xref>). More importantly, islet β-cells show the near-uniform glucose- or depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, despite of the lack of uniform insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dwulet et al., 2021</xref>). These findings indicate that the currently proposed mechanisms cannot fully explain β-cell heterogeneity and are consistent with a possibility that different β-cells may have different numbers of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive insulin granules, contributing to their unique GSIS responses.</p><p>In addition to secretory heterogeneity in the β-cell population, uneven distribution of secretion has been also observed at subcellular levels. Designation of insulin secretion to specialized loci at the cell membrane has been shown to be essential for the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2019</xref>). The sites of preferential insulin secretion depend on the cellular location of L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in combination with molecular tethers and other exocytotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokvist et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019a</xref>). This molecular machinery resembles the composition of ‘active zones’ or areas of high exocytosis in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garner et al., 2000</xref>) and is thought to underlie the hot spots of secretion at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Landis et al., 1988</xref>). Interestingly, some major components of the hot spot machinery (e.g., ELKS) are assembled at the membrane in response to integrin activation by vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hotta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nishimune, 2012</xref>), and in islets they are preferentially found at sites of β-cell contact with the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Low et al., 2014</xref>). However, as most β-cells in an in-situ islet have discrete points of contact with the capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Low et al., 2014</xref>), it is clear that positioning and ECM-dependent activation of secretion hot spots is insufficient for the differences in secretion activity of individual cells. Thus, despite a significant progress toward the understanding of β-cell heterogeneity, some key cellular mechanisms underling their functional differences in islets are still unknown.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that the secretion capacity of β-cells is regulated by the MT cytoskeleton, which is uniquely structured to help tune β-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike in many other cell types, MTs in β-cells do not radiate from a central point in the cell, and instead form a dense mesh-like network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>). This network configuration is, to a large extent, due to the fact that most MTs in β-cells originate at the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). The large surface area of the Golgi acts as an MT organizing center (MTOC), leading to an unusual non-radial MT network appearance. Intriguingly, optimal β-cell function depends on a finely tuned balance of MT assembly and disassembly, which can both promote and restrict secretion capacity of a cell. On the one hand, Golgi-derived MTs function aids the budding of new insulin granules from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). High glucose stimuli lead to an increase in Golgi-derived MT nucleation, which is necessary to replenish insulin granule content after a secretion pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). Long-term loss of this MT subpopulation causes degranulation of the β-cell as vesicle budding is less efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, glucose-dependent MT nucleation is a critical factor supporting the capacity of β-cells to secrete. On the other hand, MTs act to prevent over-secretion in functional β-cells, which contain excessive amounts of insulin granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). This function relies on the configuration of MT networks in β-cells, where the non-radial mesh in the cell interior prevents directional granule movement, and the extremely stable MT bundles extending along the plasma membrane serve as tracks for granule withdrawal from docking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>). Upon glucose stimulation, these pre-existing MTs are destabilized and partially depolymerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 2020</xref>), allowing for release of a subset of granules. This regulated dynamicity of the MT network is vital for the dosage of GSIS at each stimulus: loss of all MTs acutely leads to over-secretion, while hyper-stabilization of MTs greatly suppresses it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lacy et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Howell et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hill and Rhoten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). These effects are only seen after GSIS stimulation but not at basal glucose conditions, indicating the leading role for other mechanisms in secretion triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>). In functional β-cells, which are able to secrete in response to a glucose stimulus, the effects of MT destabilization are finely tuned because simultaneous increase in MT nucleation promptly replaces depolymerizing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). The intriguing combination of positive (long-term) and negative (short-term) MT regulation of secretion may be responsible for the early controversy on the role of MTs in insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lacy et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lacy et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Malaisse et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Howell et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hill and Rhoten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mourad et al., 2011</xref>). It also makes the MT cytoskeleton a candidate for differential control of secretory activity, which acts in concert with other regulatory mechanisms to underlie functional β-cell heterogeneity.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the role of the MT cytoskeleton in β-cells as a factor in the differential secretory response of β-cells to glucose stimulation. Our computational analysis of insulin secretion toward the vascular ECM at the single-cell level in whole islets shows that this regulation occurs via secretion hot spot activity. Our findings indicate that the presence of stable MTs attenuates initiation of secretion hot spots in both otherwise dormant and already active β-cells, thus contributing to functional heterogeneity of insulin secretion. We also show that MTs regulate the timing of insulin secretion by restricting hot spot activity to the first phase of GSIS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microtubule stability in pancreatic islet β-cells is heterogenous</title><p>We have previously found that MTs serve as a critical regulator of both phases of β-cell glucose response and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>).

There was no detectable difference in overall polymerized tubulin content upon glucose stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), likely due to glucose-stimulated nucleation of new MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>), which replace destabilized MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Trogden et al., 2019</xref>).

While not changed by glucose stimulation, the overall tubulin polymer content was variable in the β-cell population as indicated by the intensity distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>) and coefficients of variation (58.72% in low glucose and 60.42% in high glucose). MT stability was also highly variable, as evident from the Glu-tubulin staining, which ranged from barely detectable levels to highlighting essentially the whole MT cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>, compare cells with red arrows). While the amount of Glu-tubulin decreased after glucose stimulation, shifting the histogram of Glu-tubulin intensities per cell to the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), the degree of variation amongst the β-cells was retained as indicated by the distributions of Glu-tubulin intensity normalized to the mean for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and by high coefficients of variation (48.56% in low glucose and 63.46% in high glucose). The proportion of stable MTs within the MT network (Glu-tubulin to tubulin) also remained variable in high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>; coefficient of variation: 78.15% in low glucose and 64.39% in high glucose).</p><p>As a second measure of MT stability in β-cells, we subjected the cells to ice treatment for 30 min. Since MTs are temperature-sensitive and only stable MTs will remain after ice treatment, this well-established assay is used to directly assess MT stability. After extraction of free tubulin, fixation, and immunostaining, the tubulin content per cell was measured to evaluate the amount of cold-resistant MTs remaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–P</xref>). In basal glucose conditions, many cells contained MTs stable enough to be retained after ice treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M and N</xref>). Following high glucose stimulation, the amount of cold-stable MTs significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O,P,Q,R</xref>), consistent with our previous findings and data described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Most of the remaining MTs were positive for Glu-tubulin, as expected for long-lived stable MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-K</xref>).

This prevents tubulin polymerization so that dynamic MTs are lost through depolymerization without being replaced, leaving only stable MTs in a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Khawaja et al., 1988</xref>). Immunofluorescent detection of MTs after this treatment resulted in a similar variation in MTs patterns retained in cells and Glu-tubulin staining as the cold treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L-N</xref>).</p><p>These three assays indicated that, similar to insulin secretion, MT stability is heterogeneous between different β-cells.

As we have previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), nocodazole increased insulin secretion specifically in high glucose-stimulated islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). Strikingly, we also observed that a larger sub-population of β-cells (on average, 66% of cells) was activated, compared to only 42% in control islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Addition of taxol also affected insulin secretion as we have previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), blunting it in high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>). The percent of secreting cells in taxol was only 27%, similar to the percentage observed in low glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), where MTs are intrinsically stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>These results indicate that the modulation of MT stability can change the insulin secretion activity of β-cells within the population. Since in control islets, cells have variable MT stability levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we explored a potential connection between MT stability in individual cells and their ability to secrete. This connection was assessed by a correlative microscopy approach using whole-mount attached islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) as well as slightly disseminated islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-F</xref>). FluoZin-3-detected secretion pattern was correlated with post-assay Glu-tubulin immunostaining. As expected, secretion levels were extremely low in cells with a high content of Glu-tubulin (Glu-tubulin intensity above islet average), indicating that cells with overly stable MTs are not capable of secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Interestingly, in cells with Glu-tubulin content below the islet average, secretion levels were highly variable, indicating that in those cells other, non-MT-dependent mechanisms significantly modulate GSIS levels.</p><p>We next tested whether MT presence introduces differences between actively secreting β-cells by assessing how modulation of MTs influences the number of secretion events per cell, a criterion critical for GSIS efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Low et al., 2013</xref>). We found that high glucose caused an increase in the number of events per cell in both control and nocodazole-treated islets, but not taxol-treated islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-J'</xref>). Importantly, the number of events per cell and the fraction of highly-secreting cells in high glucose were significantly increased by nocodazole as compared to control, suggesting that MT presence attenuates glucose-stimulated secretion in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I-J'</xref>). Consistent with this result, under all conditions of high MT stability (low glucose in all conditions and high glucose in taxol) secretion activity is distributed similarly throughout the cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I’ and J’</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that insulin secretion capacity on both the cellular and population levels is decreased by MT presence, and even more so, by MT stability. Furthermore, in terms of β-cell activation, MTs provide a mechanism that supports β-cell heterogeneity. While normally the glucose-stimulated β-cell population is highly heterogeneous, changing MT stability in either direction leads to a more homogenous population with either most cells secreting (nocodazole, no MTs) or most cells not secreting (taxol, hyper-stabilized MTs). It is also evident that modulation of MT dynamics decreases but does not completely eliminate variability in β-cell activity, which is in agreement with the existence of other, MT-independent, mechanisms of heterogeneity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pipeleers et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MT stability regulates β-cell GSIS by suppressing insulin secretion “hot spots”</title><p>To better understand MT-dependent regulation of secretion in individual cells versus a cell population, we analyzed their spatial and temporal secretion patterns.

This is particularly obvious under conditions of high glucose stimulation in control and nocodazole, where a high number of clustered events allows for constructing a smooth distribution. Specifically, there is an enrichment of short wait times between events that cannot be captured by the exponential. However, this analysis considers time-between-events within all clusters combined into a single distribution. In this case, the observed deviation may be caused by the presence of clusters with different secretion dynamics within analyzed cluster populations.</p><p>To test whether individual clusters exhibit distinct secretion dynamics, we next analyzed event dynamics separately in different cluster sizes. In control and nocodazole treated islets in high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the average time between events was lower for larger clusters. Individual analyses of the waiting time distributions for clusters of each size in each of the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) indicate that those distributions are well fit by exponential distributions. Thus, for each condition, we constructed a generalized linear model (GLiM) with an exponential linking function (since the data are exponentially distributed) where the rate of secretion depends on cluster size according to (rate<italic>=</italic>α<italic>+</italic>β<italic>*</italic>Size). This model was fit to the data for each of the six conditions separately using a Bayesian parameter estimation approach.</p><p>Our goal is to determine (1) whether (β&gt;0) since this would indicate that there is a size dependence of cluster secretion rates and (2) whether the model parameters differ across conditions.</p><p>Results of these model fits are presented using 95% Bayesian credible intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kruschke and Liddell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In brief, a 95% credible interval depicts the range that the parameter values will fall into with 95% certainty (note this is technically different than confidence intervals that are often reported in frequentist statistics). Results show that the credible interval for β is strictly greater than 0 in control and nocodazole treated islets in high glucose. Thus we can say that larger clusters do indeed secrete insulin at higher rates with 95% certainty (this is the definition of a credible interval, see Materials and methods for further technical discussion). This is confirmed by model comparison where this size-dependent model is compared to a ‘null’ model where the secretion rate is fixed across all sizes (model comparison results are reported using the Watanabe–Akaike information criterion – WAIC, which is a Bayesian companion of the common frequentist AIC). Results are inconclusive in the other four conditions due to the relative scarcity of clustering data leading to more widely distributed credible intervals that overlap with β=0. Comparing model results across conditions shows the credible intervals for both parameters (α not shown) overlap across all six conditions. Thus, there is no discernable difference in the rate of within-cluster secretion, consistent with our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, both clustered and non-clustered events appear to occur independently of each other: one secretion event does not influence the timing of the next. Neither cluster size nor secretion dynamics within clusters differ significantly between any of the examined experimental conditions. However, larger clusters are secreting insulin at faster rates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MT stability affects timing of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion</title><p>As insulin secretion is known to be tightly regulated in time, we tested if MT stability had any effect on the timing of secretion events. Since the data outlined above show that MT destabilization leads to the initiation of extra secretion hot spots, we also analyzed the kinetics of secretion for clustered and non-clustered events separately.</p><p>Events in low glucose occurred at random through time with no distinguishable pattern, indicating that basal secretion was random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Control high glucose data showed a more noticeable pattern with the first peak at 2–4 min and the second peak at 9–10 min after high glucose addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Such kinetics correspond well with the known timing of the two waves of the bi-phasic insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curry et al., 1975</xref>). Interestingly, we found that clustered secretion at hot spots had a stronger impact on the first phase of secretion, while non-clustered events contributed stronger to the second phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In nocodazole-treated islets, high glucose induced a much broader peak of secretion with the maximum at 4–5 min, which extended into the timing of the second phase without a defined minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of non-clustered events maintained a slightly bi-phasic appearance, while clustered secretion appeared as a single wide peak in the time frame of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that the timing of clustered secretion was dysregulated.</p><p>To test whether the noted distribution is a manifestation of a change in the timing of triggering and/or silencing of secretion hot spots, we analyzed the distribution of the first and last events within each cluster over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This analysis showed that in control, clusters were initiated mostly in the first 5 minutes after stimulation (first phase), while in the absence of MTs clusters were initiated throughout most of the imaging sequence, suggesting that MTs serve to restrict cluster initiation to the first phase of GSIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, in control glucose-stimulated islets, over 50% of clustered secretion ceased close to the end of the first phase, while the rest persisted through the second half of the movie. In the absence of MTs, in contrast, a noticeable proportion of clustered secretion lasted through to the end of the recorded sequence, and/or was still active during the last frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This indicates that while no difference in the cluster size between control and nocodazole (in any other conditions) was detected, timely cluster inactivation was disturbed in the absence of MTs, and secretion might continue at the same location for a longer period (not recorded due to the fluorescent dye background buildup).</p><p>These data are consistent with the model where MTs regulate the timely response of secretion hot spots to the stimulus, including both their initiation and silencing. Lack of such regulation led to ‘smearing’ of the bi-phasic GSIS response, so that the decrease in secretion after the first phase was not evident.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Microtubules control insulin secretion in addition to, rather than via, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling</title><p>Since MTs regulate secretion hot spots, which have been previously shown to be defined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel location at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokvist et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Satin, 2000</xref>), we have tested whether overall GSIS under conditions of MT disruption is still dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

To address this, we have tested whether pretreatment of islets with nocodazole influences glucose-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in individual β-cells. We have utilized a fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter Calbryte 520 to follow single-cell response to glucose stimulation in attached islets in real time by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, cyan, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1 fig7video2">Figure 7—videos 1; 2</xref>). As above, β-cell identity was determined by the presence of nuclear mApple reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, red). No increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx levels between control and nocodazole-treated cells was detected, arguing against the hypothesis of MT-dependent regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). While the response was expectedly variable between individual islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations in nocodazole treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) show no detectable defect in timing and/or synchronization as compared to control, suggesting that both hub cell firing and cell connectivity was not affected by MT disrupture to a detectable extent. Interestingly, while no difference in summarized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx over time has been detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), our data indicate a slight decrease in the fluctuation amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that the absence of MTs might influence the functionality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx machinery in some minor way. Nevertheless, if such a defect exists, it must have a suppressing effect on insulin secetion, rather than underlie the observed GSIS enhancement.</p><p>Furthermore, we have explored whether single-cell secretion efficiency and heterogeneity is modulated by MTs under conditions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx enforced by 25 mM KCl (membrane depolarization). We have performed FluoZin-3 assays during KCl-induced insulin secretion. Because KCl causes immediate membrane depolarization, in these assays, we had to apply stimulation during TIRF-imaging recording in order to register early secretion events. In the time frame of the assay, disruption of MTs by nocodazole pretreatment facilitated GSIS but did not affect secretion triggered by KCl alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, synergistic secretion triggered by a combination of glucose and KCl was further enhanced under conditions of MT disruption. This effect was likely due to the increased number of secretion hot spots (clusters, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while the cluster size (number of events per cluster) remained constant throughout all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, in the presence of KCl, secretion events within clusters occurred more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and secretion concentrated within the first minutes after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that KCl-induced acute Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx acted predominantly in a short time frame. To analyze the role of MTs in secretion caused by KCl-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we have analyzed FluoZin-3 assay outcomes exclusively within the active period of 2.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Strikingly, none of the components of secretion caused by KCl alone was facilitated by MT disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>). However, secretion activity was significantly increased by nocodazole when glucose was used as a trigger in combination with KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1 fig8video2 fig8video3">Figure 8—videos 1–3</xref>). The number of cells with clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>) as well as the number of clusters per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and J</xref>) significantly increased upon nocodazole pretreatment, indicating an increased number of secretion hot spots. Accordingly, while the cluster size (number of events per cluster) remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), the number of clustered events per cell was boosted by nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K and L</xref>). The number of non-clustered events per cell was only slightly affected by nocodazole pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K’ and L’</xref>), in agreement with our above conclusion that MTs predominantly regulate hop spot associated secretion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>MTs regulate glucose-stimulated secretion in addition to calcium-dependent mechanisms.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) KCl− (<bold>A, B</bold>) and KCl+ Glucose-stimulated (<bold>C, D</bold>) secretion as detected by FluoZin-3 assay in DMSO- (<bold>A, C</bold>) and nocodazole (<bold>B, D</bold>) pre-treated islets.

The functional β-cell heterogeneity, established via hemolytic plaque assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salomon and Meda, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosco et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katsuta et al., 2012</xref>) or real-time secretion assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoang Do and Thorn, 2015</xref>) is particularly intriguing because it was proposed to be important for an adaptable, efficient response to various changes in physiological conditions and is one of the parameters that dramatically changes in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguayo-Mazzucato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>).

Yet, these studies do not fully explain why similar levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx cannot induce similar insulin secretion from different β-cells.</p><p>In this study, we have evaluated the role of the MT cytoskeleton in influencing the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of insulin secretion events both at the level of pancreatic β-cell populations and sub-plasma membrane regions. Our data indicate that MT stability in the β-cell population is heterogeneous and that this heterogeneity is a contributing factor to the previously established heterogeneity of insulin response. We also show that the loss of MTs causes initiation of additional insulin secretion: (1) activation of hot spots in a higher fraction of cells, (2) increase in the number of hot spots in active cells, and (3) broadens the timing of secretion from the hot spots in the first phase of GSIS. Stabilizing MTs prevents GSIS so that all parameters are indistinguishable from basal secretion levels. Importantly, MT-dependent regulation of hot spots acts in parallel to glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, rather than in the same pathway.</p><p>There are a number of advantages to the approach utilized in this paper. It is important to measure the spatiotemporal distribution of secretion from individual β-cells in its natural environment in the whole islet with intact cell-to-cell contacts and a proper basement membrane. High-resolution detection of secretion event distribution over the surface of the plasma membrane is a challenging task. While secretion detection in whole islets has been successfully achieved by two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Low et al., 2014</xref>), this method does not allow for high time resolution and for registration of secretion hot spots over the plasma membrane due to its complex topography. Furthermore, it is very labor-intensive and the number of examined samples is very limited. In contrast, TIRF microscopy with β-cells secreting toward the glass coverslip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagamatsu and Ohara-Imaizumi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loder et al., 2013</xref>) allows for rapid imaging in the plasma membrane focal plane. The major challenge is the rapidly compromised responsiveness to glucose characteristic for whole-mount islets plated on glass. To our advantage, it has become clear that ECM signaling through integrin-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity is critical for the preservation of correctly patterned secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019b</xref>). Our approach of culturing whole-mount islets on vascular ECM preserves the functionality of β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Patterson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), supporting the idea that the signals downstream of integrins are vital to preserving β-cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). TIRF microscopy in this system allows us to register single secretion events associated with their physiological organizer—the vascular ECM. Thus, this experimental model allows for the evaluation of the secretion patterning arranged by vascular cues, and at the same time, analysis of individual β-cell responses as they maintain their connections with each other and other islet cell types. An additional advantage of our approach is that utilization of FluoZin-3 dye provides direct information of precise insulin secretion time and location without the need for genetically encoded markers of insulin.</p><p>One important conclusion from our study is that MT stability varies in the β-cell population. The mechanistic basis of the differences in MT stability between β-cells is yet unclear. For example, since MTs are sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hepler, 2016</xref>), MT stability might be modified by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx wave, which is thought to contribute to spatial and temporal differences in β-cell response to stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benninger et al., 2014</xref>). However, we have recently shown that blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by verapamil does not prevent glucose-induced changes in MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). Keeping also in mind the evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is insufficient to provide for secretion heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2011</xref>), we suggest that MT differences are likely triggered by another mechanism. MT heterogeneity might be promoted by such factors involved in β-cell variability as cell maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguayo-Mazzucato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pipeleers et al., 2017</xref>), islet microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trimble and Renold, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Trimble et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brereton et al., 2015</xref>), and/or paracrine signaling from other islet cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efendić and Luft, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pipeleers et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wojtusciszyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van der Meulen et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we have shown that glucokinase, an enzyme, which expression/activity is involved in promoting β-cell variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jetton and Magnuson, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heimberg et al., 1993</xref>), is important for MT network remodeling downstream of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, glucokinase variability could lead to heterogeneous MT stability in β-cells.</p><p>One possible important molecular player in this pathway could be the MT stabilizer tau, which we have recently found to be a critical component of glucose- and glucokinase-dependent MT remodeling, leading to efficient insulin release from β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ho et al., 2020</xref>). Other MT-stabilizing proteins found in β-cells, such as MAP2 and doublecortin, may also be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krueger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). It is clear from our data that regardless of the source of MT heterogeneity, it is functioning to enhance the variability of β-cell secretion activity: pushing MTs toward uniform stability or uniform depolymerization makes β-cell secretion response more uniform in opposite directions. This role of MT heterogeneity in the regulation of variable β-cell response to stimulation is not entirely unexpected. The effect of heterogeneity of MT stability in cell populations has been described in other cell types and is implicated in the variability of cell function. For example, motile cells that have directionally stable MT arrays have an increased ability for migration in wound healing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sugioka and Sawa, 2012</xref>). Heterogeneity of MT dynamics in neurons has been found to underlie the distinction between the axon and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conde and Cáceres, 2009</xref>), neurite capacity for cargo movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franker and Hoogenraad, 2013</xref>), and modulation of local signaling and rearrangements in neuronal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogenraad and Bradke, 2009</xref>). Now, our data add β-cells to the list of cell types where the differential MT stability plays an important role in cell physiology.</p><p>How do differential MT dynamics promote differential secretion? The first possibility is the direct MT regulation of insulin secretion, when differently organized MT networks differentially transport insulin granules within individual cells. This aligns well with the model supported by our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>), where stable MTs act as tracks for the withdrawal of insulin granules from the plasma membrane, restricting secretion. Lack of this regulated withdrawal should allow for the increased secretion at random locations. Indeed, this is what we observed: the increase of glucose-stimulated non-clustered events when MTs are absent (nocodazole treatment). However, we found that MTs most prominently regulate heterogeneity of β-cells responsiveness to glucose specifically via activation of secretion clusters, or hot spots. Such specific restriction of clustered secretion would be achieved by MT-dependent withdrawal if secretion-competent granules are specifically accumulated near the hot spots prior to the secretion stimulus by an additional mechanism. Alternatively, specific MT withdrawal from the secretion hot spots could result from local molecular motor activation and/or local organization of MT tracks at these cellular locations. In this regard, it is interesting that ELKS, a tether molecule involved in MT anchoring at the cell cortex in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lansbergen et al., 2006</xref>), is specifically concentrated at secretion hot spots. While ELKS is likely involved in the regulation of insulin exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2019b</xref>), it might also be a regulator of local MT anchoring at those sites.</p><p>It is important to integrate our understanding of MT function with prior accumulated knowledge on secretion hot spots regulation. Existing evidence indicates that loci of repeated clustered secretion involve membrane accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2019</xref>), VDCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bokvist et al., 1995</xref>), as well as tethering and membrane fusion machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ohara-Imaizumi et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, it is thought that the functioning of a hot spot includes insulin granule docking in preparation for secretion, ion channels to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent membrane fusion. Our data indicate that MT depolymerization does not affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and that acute Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx stimulates secretion of readily releasable granules at hot spots regardless of MT presence, consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mourad et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent steps of secretion are not MT-dependent. In contrast, our previous findings show that insulin granule docking at the plasma membrane is regulated by MTs, because MT-dependent transport withdraws granules from the docking sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracey et al., 2020</xref>). We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) where glucose signaling stimulates both insulin granule docking and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which are thought to be triggered via independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gaisano, 2017</xref>). MT-dependent transport negatively regulates the process of docking, restricting the number of readily-releasable granules. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, in turn, promotes secretion of docked granules, in an MT-independent manner. In the experimental setup, when secretion is stimulated by KCl, only pre-docked granules are released, and MT disruption does not have a significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>MT regulation of insulin secretion at a hot spot.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Glucose signaling stimulates both insulin granule docking and calcium influx; calcium influx, in turn, promotes secretion of docked graules. MT-dependent transport negatively regulates the process of docking, restricting the number of readily releasable granules and secretion outcome. (<bold>B</bold>) KCl treatment causes extreme acute calcium influx, which in turn facilitates secretion of pre-docked granules. No additional docking occurs in the absence of glucose stimulation, and MT regulation does not influence the number of pre-docked granules and secretion levels. MT, microtubule.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59912-fig9-v3.tif"/></fig><p>An additional potential scenario is that dynamic MTs facilitate secretion at hot spots by coupling insulin exocytosis with compensatory endocytic events, as was shown for ELKS/LL5β patches in cultured Ins-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yuan et al., 2015a</xref>). Another possibility is that MTs act indirectly by modulating one of the prominent mechanisms involved in β-cell heterogeneity regulation. Interestingly, such master regulators of heterogeneous β-cell response as gap junctions and ion channels have been shown to be modulated by MTs in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joseph et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, the important conclusion from our data is that it is the activation of hot spots in additional cells that makes the β-cell population response more uniform in the absence of MTs. Since Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential but likely insufficient for β-cell heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benninger and Hodson, 2018</xref>), it is possible that suppression of hot spot activity by stable MTs provides a required layer of control restricting secretion in a subpopulation of cells in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, our finding that larger clusters secrete insulin at higher rates suggests a potential enhancement of secretion via a chemical (e.g., insulin signaling or ATP signals) or mechanical (e.g., in terms of membrane tension) feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rodríguez-Iturbe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saltiel and Pessin, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Another important take-home message from our analyses is that MTs regulate the timing of the first phase of GSIS via control of clustered secretion. We show that initiation of secretion hot spots that is normally rapidly triggered by the metabolic signal is dysregulated when MTs are lost, possibly due to the presence of excessive, unregulated readily-releasable granules. In the absence of MT regulation, new secretion sites continue to appear even at the time points when the first phase of secretion should normally be fading. This suggests a potential role for MTs in the decay of the first phase of GSIS, which could be a significant part of prevention of over secretion under physiological conditions. At the same time, MT-dependent regulation of random secretion applies to both stages of the bi-phasic GSIS. An extended first phase of secretion and enhanced secretion levels in both phases are consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, we do not find a significant role of MTs in the secretion dynamics within individual clusters. Our data clearly indicate that MTs do not affect the frequency of secretion events within clusters, which is at odds with a previous finding in KCl-stimulated Ins-1 cells plated on glass, where a decreased frequency of events within a cluster was observed in the absence of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yuan et al., 2015b</xref>). It is unclear at this point whether this discrepancy is due to the dramatic differences in the experimental models used in the two studies, but it is not surprising that the fine regulation detected here was not observed in the absence of islet cell interactions and vascular ECM signals.</p><p>To conclude, this study highlights a novel role of MT network in promoting β-cell heterogeneity in islets by restricting secretion hot spot activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ins-Apl mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stancill et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Histone 2B-mApple knocked into the <italic>Ins2</italic> locus</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RPE1-hTert</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC, Cat# CRL-4000,</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_4388">CVCL_4388</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-α-tubulin (DM1A clone) Mouse monoclonal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: T9026</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:500) dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-detyrosinated tubulin, rabbit polyclonal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore, Cat#: AB3201</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:500) dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FluoZin-3, Tetrapotassium Salt, cell impermeant</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#: F24194</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Final concentration (20 µM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human ECM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Corning, Cat#: 354237</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Placenta-derived vascular ECM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse utilization</title><p>Ins-Apl mice with Histone 2B-mApple knocked into the <italic>Ins2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stancill et al., 2019</xref>) were used for all experiments.

A natural hypothesis to test is that secretion events occur independently of each other. If events are indeed independent, then the time between successive events within a cell or cluster should be exponentially distributed. To test this, we fit each data set using an exponential distribution using python’s SciPy package. For non-cluster data, all events occurring within a cell were grouped in ascending order of occurrence time to produce a time-between-event distribution that was fit to an exponential distribution. For analysis of all cluster data within each condition (e.g., high glucose Taxol treated), events occurring within each cluster were grouped to compute the time between successive events within the same cluster. These wait times for all clusters were then grouped together to form a time-between-event distribution that was fit. This analysis however grouped clusters of different sizes together. We thus separately analyzed clusters of different sizes (measured as secretion events per cluster). For this, we collected the within cluster time between events for clusters of each size separately. We then grouped all computed waiting times for clusters of a given size (e.g., 4 secretion events) and fit the resulting distribution for each size separately to an exponential.</p><p>To assess whether clusters of different sizes secrete insulin at different rates, we constructed a GLiM where the secretion rate is linearly dependent on cluster size. Since the secretion time data for each cluster size is well approximated by an exponential distribution (as verified by the previously described analysis), we use an exponential linking function. Note that due to the non-normal nature of this data and the relatively small sample sizes, this GLiM approach is more appropriate than a more common ANOVA or similar approach. This GLiM was fit to the data for each condition separately using Bayesian parameter estimation with the python PyMC package. Both the parameters (α, β) were assigned half-normal priors with a standard deviation of 0.1, which are weakly informative priors. Four MCMC chains were used with 4000 samples each using the built in NUTS sampler.</p><p>We briefly discuss the interpretation of the Bayesian ‘credible interval’ approach we used for hypothesis testing on the parameter β. A typical frequentist approach to this would be to determine a ‘point estimate’ for the value of an unobserved parameter and construct a ‘confidence interval.’ Bayesian estimation instead produces a ‘posterior density’ (in contrast to a point estimate) describing the probability of every possible value of that unobserved parameter conditioned on the data. From this posterior, a ‘credible interval’ (Bayesian analog to a confidence interval) can be constructed. We specifically construct a 95% Highest Density Posterior Interval (HDPI), which is an interval within which 95% of the posterior density resides. This HDPI has a simple interpretation: given the observed data, there is a 95% probability that the parameter value falls within this interval. So if the 95% HDPI for β does no overlap 0, we can be 95% certain that it is different from 0. Note that there are subtitle but important differences between credible intervals (Bayesian) and confidence intervals (frequentist) that are beyond the scope of this article.

At least 20 images per experiment were obtained, random fields containing β-cells (identified by red nuclei) were imaged. All images where cell borders could be identified from the bottom of the stack where intensities were measured were analyzed.</p><p>Due to the large expected variation in insulin secretion from each β-cell (0 to &gt;100 vesicles) reported by others, we aim to detect a 20% difference in means with a power of 0.95. This needs &gt;327 samples (cells). FluoZin-3 assay experiments were repeated on at least 7 different days, using islets from independent isolations/mice. For all data sets, islets from the same animal/isolation were compared between two or more conditions. If at least one secretion event was identified, the movie was analyzed. Any movies without a secretion event were excluded as the technical difficulty of the assay caused an inability to identify a reason for lack of secretion. Analysis of secretion events was performed blind.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image processing</title><p>In order to make small structures visible, adjustments were made to brightness, contrast, and gamma settings of all fluorescent images presented here.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>For data sets where the distribution was appropriate (normal distribution as determined by the D’Agostino &amp; Pearson omnibus normality test), statistics were calculated by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. When the data distribution was non-normal, a Kruskal-Wallis test nonparametric and multiple comparison was used (&gt;2 data sets). For two data set comparisons, Mann-Whitney nonparametric comparison test was used. GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analyses and graphical representations.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David J Hodson (Reviewer #1); Jonathan S Bogan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The central finding is that microtubule stability is heterogenous in rodent β cells. Using Zn2+ reporter assays, the authors show that glu-tubulin/tubulin levels are associated with insulin secretion, and that modifying microtubule stability with nocodazole or taxol leads to changes in the proportion of active β cells, as well as insulin secretion dynamics at the single cell level. While microtubules are known to contribute to the regulation of insulin secretion, less is known about the role of microtubule stability in β cell heterogeneity. Thus, the authors' findings are highly novel. Furthermore, the analysis is well performed and the data will be of wide interest. Nocodazole and taxol are blunt tools, but the data are nonetheless informative and fit well with the authors' current work on effects of glucose-stimulated tau phosphorylation and destabilization of microtubules (Ho et al., Diabetes 2020). The Ho article slightly diminishes the novelty of this work, but a more important consideration is that it adds physiologic significance to this article. There are however a number of issues that need addressing, before an effect of microtubules on β cell heterogeneity can be firmly concluded. Specifically, the authors to give special attention to (a) studies on secretion in response to depolarization with KCl/diazoxide, (b) quantification of secretory granules and their dynamics, and (c) determining microtubule stability heterogeneity under a relevant condition mimicking T2D.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Experiments in models with perturbed islet dynamics would help to strengthen the main conclusion that differences in microtubule stability contribute to heterogeneity in insulin release. For example, the authors could compare distributions of glu-tubulin/tubulin/Fluozin3 in islets from HFD-fed mice.</p><p>2. The analysis of temporal and spatial aspects of exocytosis is nicely done, but it would be helpful to include data for the magnitude of each exocytic event in the analysis. Can the authors integrate the Fluozin-3 signal over time and space to estimate the relative size (or amount of Zn2+ that is secreted) in each event? This may be done using existing datasets. Is the size of a secretion event related to the likelihood that it is part of a cluster of exocytic events? One can imagine that compound exocytosis (which may increase the secretion at a single event) may be mechanistically similar to clustered exocytoses.</p><p>3. The data showing that nocodazole increased secretion only in the presence of high glucose, and not in low glucose, are interesting and imply that other factors are required for secretion. Possibly, ca<sup>2+</sup> is one of these. Does KCl cause secretion in this setting, and does verapamil block secretion? Is glucose metabolism required? This is a critical experiment.</p><p>4. As acknowledged by the authors in the Discussion, changes to the microtubule network might conceivably affect glucose metabolism, calcium influx or mobilizsation and the study would be greatly strengthened by exploring at least one of these possibilities. To what extent, are calcium dynamics affected at the single cell level by nocodozole or taxol treatment in this preparation (experiments analogous to Figure 2)? Do those cells with greatest depolymerisation also experience the largest or most sustained calcium transients in response to glucose? On the same lines, it would be important to determine whether secretion (FluoZin3) responses to depolarization (e.g. KCl+diazoxide) were, like the response to high glucose, also heterogeneous, according to the extent of MT polymerisation? If there is also a correlation between the degree of depolymerization and KCl<sup>-</sup>stimulated secretion (at the single cell level) then this would provide good evidence that limitations in secretory granule dynamics (rather than in glucose metabolism or intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup>) directly influence exocytosis in a given cell and hence generate intercellular heterogeneity.</p><p>5. The use of permeablization to release free tubulin is the most direct measurement of microtubule stability, but this is shown only for high glucose treated cells. Was there a difference compared to low glucose? Can this be quantified?</p><p>6. The definition of insulin release clusters is not clear. At the resolutions used here (assuming ~100 nm in an ideal setup), it is unlikely that single release events can be reliably separated in a voxel &lt; 300 nm. Thus, cluster events may in fact represent rapid sequential release of insulin granules in the same space. The authors should comment on this and what it means for a number of the measures presented herein.</p><p>7. How do insulin secretory hot spots correlate with glu-tubulin levels in the same cell? How can the increase in hot spots under conditions of microtubule re-arrangement (e.g. with nocodazole and taxol) be separated from changes in insulin tone and ergo paracrine feedback? A caveat might be needed here.</p><p>8. Data are obtained from multiple cells from multiple islets. However, are these islets from multiple islet isolations/animals? It is well known that individual islet isolation/animal is a bigger source of variability than individual islets.</p><p>9. Effects of nocodazole and taxol on glu-tubulin/tubulin fluorescence intensity distribution should be quantified (to show how reproducible these experiments are).</p><p>10. The flattened islet preparation is some way from an intact islet with native morphology, and further still from a fully vascularised and innervated islet in vivo. This limitation of the present study should be emphasised and the authors' claim that this preparation had to be used since TIRF microscopy is effectively the only way to measure secretion at the single cell level isn't convincing. Reports from Kasai (Takashi, N et al., Science, 2002) as well as that from Thorn (Low et al., Diabetologia, 2014) using alternative approaches (multiphoton microscopy of endocytosed probes such as sulphorhodamine) to measure exocytosis at the single cell level within the intact islet should be more clearly acknowledged. Rapid spinning disc confocal microscopy can also be used using recombinant targeted probes (Rutter et al., Biochem Soc Trans, 2006). These studies are not required, but the caveat needs discussion.</p><p>11. Figure 5. The complex data in this figure, obtained using Bayesian credible intervals, is difficult to understand, although the conclusion – that clusters do not influence each other – was clearly stated. This part of the manuscript needs clearer description and greater deconstruction of the mathematical underpinnings for the “typical” cell biologist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59912.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, such extension falls outside of the scope of this study. The goal of this paper is to establish the basic mechanisms as they exist in healthy β cells. We believe that our data justify the conclusion that differences in microtubule stability contribute to heterogeneity in insulin release in normal functioning islets. Thus, given the limited capacity of the lab during pandemics, and considering the significant expansion of the paper scope by other reviewers’ requests, we chose to leave this to our future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Unfortunately, integrated intensity of FluoZin signal quantified from those assays would not accurately represent the amount of secreted Zn2+ (which would correlate with insulin). In the TIRF assay, the brightness of the signal depends on how close it is to the interface between the glass coverslip and aqueous media (cells) within the TIRF illumination field (~200nm). Even a few nm difference in z-position of a secretion even would strongly influence the brightness of a flash. In an islet attached to a layered ECM, the distance between a β cell membrane and the coverslip is uneven, and it is impossible to interpret whether the flash intensity is due to the fluctuation of this distance or to the amount of secreted Zn2+. For this reason, we confidently interpret these data to determine only the XY positioning of the secretion events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The data showing that nocodazole increased secretion only in the presence of high glucose, and not in low glucose, are interesting and imply that other factors are required for secretion. Possibly, ca<sup>2+</sup> is one of these. Does KCl cause secretion in this setting, and does verapamil block secretion? Is glucose metabolism required? This is a critical experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point, and we thank the reviewer for bringing it up. We have previously shown that nocodazole does not cause secretion in the absence of glucose stimulus (Zhu et al., 2015), indicating that glucose metabolism is necessary for GSIS regardless of MT presence. Moreover, glucose-dependent MT remodeling triggered downstream of glucokinase (Ho et al., 2020). Now, we show that (1) Ca influx by KCl still induces secretion regardless of MT presence (new Figure 8); (2) blocking ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by diazoxide inhibits GSIS both in the presence and absence of nocodazole (new Figure 7A); (3) glucose stimulation, in addition to calcium, is necessary for MT-dependent regulation of secretion (new Figure 8). This finding is in agreement with our hypothesis that MTs provide an additional layer of insulin secretion regulation under conditions of glucose stimulation. In other words, MTs are capable to suppress secretion at a subset of hotspots even when all Ca channels are open, while engagement of ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent machinery is still a necessary requirement. We propose that glucose-activated MT transport removes insulin granules from some sites that otherwise – in MT absence – would actively dock and secrete upon stimulus (Figure 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As acknowledged by the authors in the Discussion, changes to the microtubule network might conceivably affect glucose metabolism, calcium influx or mobilizsation and the study would be greatly strengthened by exploring at least one of these possibilities. To what extent, are calcium dynamics affected at the single cell level by nocodozole or taxol treatment in this preparation (experiments analogous to Figure 2)?</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this comment, we have now detected Ca influx triggered by glucose using cell-permeable Ca sensor dye (Calbryte 520, new Figure 7B-D). No increase in Ca influx levels between control and nocodazole-treated cells was detected (new Figure 7C-D). Interestingly, Ca influx in both control and nocodazole-treated islet populations was similarly heterogeneous (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We conclude that MTs influence secretion and β cell heterogeneity independently of Ca, likely through a parallel mechanism(s). In addition, we observed a very slight decrease in Ca influx amplitude (new Figure 7C), suggesting that the absence of MTs might decrease functionality of Ca influx machinery in a minor way. Interpretation of this last observation is outside the scope of this study but we will follow it up in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do those cells with greatest depolymerisation also experience the largest or most sustained calcium transients in response to glucose?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this refreshing question. We have not directly correlated the level of depolymerization to ca<sup>2+</sup> activity at single β-cell levels. Such studies will be interesting but will be technically very challenging, because we will likely need to titrate the time course MT-destabilization and then record ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics simultaneously. But given that we detected no significant changes in glucose-induced ca<sup>2+</sup> influx peak by complete MT depolymerization, this would be highly unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the same lines, it would be important to determine whether secretion (FluoZin3) responses to depolarization (e.g. KCl+diazoxide) were, like the response to high glucose, also heterogeneous, according to the extent of MT polymerisation?

Destabilizing MT under the conditions of KCl only stimulation did not decrease heterogeneity, indicating that glucose-dependent but calcium independent processes are needed for MTs to be able to (de)activate hotspots. We can speculate that acute calcium influx induces secretion at already “assembled” hotspots, e.g. with a significant amount of already docked granules or “mature” pre-assembled docking machinery. When glucose signaling is also activated, hotspot “assembly” (docking, assembly of membrane molecular complexes) is facilitated in additional cells, decreasing heterogeneity, but is still partially suppressed by a MT-dependent mechanism (e.g. granule availability for docking). In this model, MT depolymerization would further decrease heterogeneity only under conditions of KCl+glucose stimulation, but not KCl by itself.</p><p>Interestingly, non-clustered secretion events were only marginally affected by nocodazole under the conditions of Ca influx+glucose, further emphasizing that, specifically, secretion at hotspots was a MT-regulated process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The use of permeablization to release free tubulin is the most direct measurement of microtubule stability, but this is shown only for high glucose treated cells. Was there a difference compared to low glucose? Can this be quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that permeabilization to release free tubulin followed by MT staining/quantification is a good measure of microtubule dynamicity. Yet this is a damaging intervention and cannot exclude complications caused by the dilution of the cytoplasm. Thus, we include it only as an illustration. As an alternative, we have directly monitored MT depolymerization with live-time imaging of photolabeled preexisting MTs (published in Ho et al., 2020). We found that high glucose could substantially reduce MT stability in β cells of whole islets. Please refer to the original data (including detailed quantitative analysis) in this Ho et al., paper, which directly answer this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

At the resolutions used here (assuming ~100 nm in an ideal setup), it is unlikely that single release events can be reliably separated in a voxel &lt; 300 nm. Thus, cluster events may in fact represent rapid sequential release of insulin granules in the same space. The authors should comment on this and what it means for a number of the measures presented herein.</p></disp-quote><p>Please keep in mind that we detect clusters in 2D TIRF space. A single event is assigned to each resolved round spread of fluorescence. It is indeed possible that we do no resolve subsequent events that occur within 60 milliseconds (or 100 ms, Figures 7,8) and are separated by less than 200 nm. However, it is difficult to imagine that two 300nm granules move and perfectly align their centers in the same 200um area within 60 (100) msec. Moreover, our time resolution oftentimes allows us to follow the development of one event within two or three frames (see Figure 2A). Thus, while it is not impossible that we do not resolve some events, it deems highly improbable. For clarity, we now add a clarification of this point in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How do insulin secretory hot spots correlate with glu-tubulin levels in the same cell?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have now performed correlative microscopy experiments, when islets were fixed on the stage immediately after the FluoZin assay, stained for Glu-tubulin and re-imaged. We find a strong correlation between high Glu-tubulin content and inhibition of secretion (See new Figure 2 F-H, Figure 3G-J, and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). On the other hand, our data indicate that in cells with low levels of stable MTs, secretion heterogeneity is very high, suggesting a significant contribution of non-MT-dependent mechanisms. We would like to strike that we by no means intend to claim that cell heterogeneity is regulated by MTs only, and we are looking forward to future insights combining MT regulation with such things as paracrine signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How can the increase in hot spots under conditions of microtubule re-arrangement (e.g. with nocodazole and taxol) be separated from changes in insulin tone and ergo paracrine feedback? A caveat might be needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this stimulating question. We agree that the secreted insulin and/or other co-secreted molecules or even the vesicle-plasma membrane fusion per se could provide chemical (e.g., insulin signaling or ATP signals) or mechanical (e.g., in terms of membrane tension) feedbacks, further modulating microtubule-dependent regulation of hot spots. It is consistent with our finding that “larger clusters do indeed secrete insulin at higher rates”. This perspective is now added in the discussion and will be extensively explored in the future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Data are obtained from multiple cells from multiple islets. However, are these islets from multiple islet isolations/animals? It is well known that individual islet isolation/animal is a bigger source of variability than individual islets.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, absolutely. Each experiment was repeated on several days using islets from separate isolations. Islets from the same animal/isolation were compared between two or more conditions. We now emphasize this information in the Methods section (“Experimental Design”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Effects of nocodazole and taxol on glu-tubulin/tubulin fluorescence intensity distribution should be quantified (to show how reproducible these experiments are).</p></disp-quote><p>In nocodazole, there are no polymerized MTs, thus there would be no Glu-tubulin present to be quantified. This effect as well as effects of taxol causing increased Glu-tubulin levels have been are established for many decades, (Gundersen, Khawaja et al., 1987, Wehland and Weber 1987, Lin, Gundersen et al., 2002, Townley, Zheng et al., 2015, Baas, Rao et al., 2016, Gobrecht, Andreadaki et al., 2016) We have now included references to some of this literature to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The flattened islet preparation is some way from an intact islet with native morphology, and further still from a fully vascularised and innervated islet in vivo. This limitation of the present study should be emphasised</p></disp-quote><p>It was previously shown by David Piston’s lab and us that islets attached to placenta-derived ECM preserve their normal responsiveness to glucose for up to 14 days. The advantage of our method is that it is a model of secretion distribution within 2 dimensions of plasma membrane contacting vascular ECM (a model of cell area contacting capillaries). Thus, while these islets are ex-vivo, and our approach is more of a model, we don’t see it as a caveat, because it serves a different purpose of high time- and space-resolution detection of secretion loci on the cell surface toward the “modelled vasculature”.</p><p>It is also important to keep in mind that so-called “flattened” islets are not flat; rather, they are 3-dimentional intact islets, which have developed a flat area of vascular ECM attachment, the region that we are examining. We have now reworded the description of the method to make these point clear, and removed a misleading word “flattened”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And the authors’ claim that this preparation had to be used since TIRF microscopy is effectively the only way to measure secretion at the single cell level isn’t convincing.

Rapid spinning disc confocal microscopy can also be used using recombinant targeted probes (Rutter et al., Biochem Soc Trans, 2006). These studies are not required, but the caveat needs discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for discussing these variable techniques. Each of the studies referred to here are quite insightful, and the usage of techniques is suitable for questions asked in those studies. However, unlike TIRF microscopy, these approaches are not usable to address the questions that we are exploring in our manuscript.</p><p>Spinning disk confocal microscopy, which was used for follow NPY secretion from Min6 cells in (Rutter et al., 2006), is not suitable for the studies in 3D tissues or explants, such as islets, because confocality is lost due to out-of-focus light detected through extra pinholes. Furthermore, the usage of genetically encoded probes has its own set of pitfalls and is very challenging to prove that such markers highlight every insulin granule (in most cases they don’t).</p><p>By detecting non-specific dye penetration into exocytosed granules during their fusion with the membrane, Takahashi et al., and Low et al., were able to detect positions of single secretion events in isolated islets using two-photon microscopy. This approach is quite advanced and allows for examining secretion events inside the islet: the authors are able to compare the areas on capillary contact versus non-vessel-contacting cell surface. But while this technique has led to exciting findings, it is impossible to analyze secretion at high time resolution in three dimensions. The analysis in those seminal studies is done at single focal planes with secretion events distributed along the cell border in one optical section (in 1 dimension), or visualized in 3D at low time resolution. Thus, it does not allow for registration of secretion hot spots over the extended surface of a cell. Furthermore, it is very labor-intensive and the number of examined samples is very limited.</p><p>Thus, we believe that our chosen technique is particularly suited to our study, while those other techniques were advantageous is studies where they were used.</p><p>We have now added considerations of the advantages of our method to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

The main idea is that a 95% credible interval is an interval in which you are 95% certain the relevant parameter value will fall. If the 95% credible interval for b is exclusively greater than 0, then we can be 95% certain that b &gt; 0. To (slightly) more technically describe a Bayesian credible interval and its interpretation, we have added an additional paragraph to the modeling methods. Further discussion would require more in-depth discussion of Bayesian statistics, which is beyond the scope of these methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
