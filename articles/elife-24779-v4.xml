A growing body of evidence suggests that oscillation of the circadian clock is generated by the transcriptional-translational feedback loop composed of the circadian clock genes and their products, including the transcriptional activators CLOCK and brain/muscle ARNT-like protein 1 (BMAL1), and their negative regulators PERIODs (PER1/2/3) and CHRYPTOCHROMEs (CRY1/2)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takahashi, 2015</xref>). These factors and their modulators contribute to determination and fine-tuning of the circadian period and the phase. For example, <italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic> knockout (KO) mice, respectively, demonstrate shortened and lengthened periods of the locomotor activity rhythms in constant dark condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Tau</italic> mutant hamster or mice harboring a missense mutation in casein kinase I epsilon (<italic>Csnk1e, CKIÉ</italic>) exhibit shortened circadian periods, and the phase was advanced in behavioral and physiological rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ralph and Menaker, 1988</xref>). These lines of evidence suggest that the transcriptional-translational feedback loop mediated by the clock genes, and the post-translational modification of their products, are indispensable to the circadian clock machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the determination or stabilization of the circadian period and phase remain to be investigated in mammals.</p><p>Previous reports have suggested that protein kinases play important roles in the regulation of circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reischl and Kramer, 2011</xref>). For example, CSNK1d/e (CKIÎ´/É) phosphorylates PER1 and PER2 proteins and promotes their proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eide et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Meng et al., 2008</xref>). CRY1 are also phosphorylated by 5â² AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamia et al., 2009</xref>). CRY2 is specifically phosphorylated by dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3Ã), leading to degradation via a ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kurabayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lamia et al., 2009</xref>). We previously reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) contributes to robust circadian oscillation within individual SCN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akashi et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the significance of protein kinases in human circadian rhythms has also been studied. Toh <italic>et al.</italic> reported that a point mutation in the clock gene <italic>Per2</italic> results in familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) in a human kindred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Toh et al., 2001</xref>). A patient with FASPS exhibits an inherited abnormal sleep pattern in which the circadian clock is phase-advanced by approximately 4 hr. The FASPS mutation causes hypo-phosphorylation of PER2 protein by CSNK1e. CSNK1e requires a priming kinase for phosphorylation, which is yet to be identified. Overall, these data suggest that post-translational modifications of clock proteins by a series of protein kinases play critical roles in regulation of the circadian clock. In the current study, we focused on salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) because we found an abnormal circadian rhythmicity in metabolism while we were studying <italic>Sik3</italic> knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). SIK1-3 are Ser/Thr kinase members of the AMPK family, which is known as an energy sensor, and regulates various aspects of metabolism in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Previous studies suggest critical roles for mammalian SIK3 in the metabolism of glucose, cholesterol, and bile acid, and in retinoid metabolism and skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit severe metabolic symptoms, such as hypolipidemia and hypoglycemia, and very frequently die on the first day after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, they exhibit severe defects in chondrocyte hypertrophy, expanded growth plate or cartilage, accumulation of chondrocytes, and impaired skull bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we found that <italic>Sik3</italic> KO mice also demonstrate abnormal circadian phenotypes, which are similar in part, but distinct from those of <italic>Csnk1</italic> mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit abnormal circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior</title><p>While studying metabolic phenotypes in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we observed that the average oxygen consumption rhythm, representing the circadian rhythmicity of metabolism, was significantly phase-delayed by approximately 6 hr compared with wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

We performed in situ hybridization on mouse brain sections and found that <italic>Sik3</italic> mRNA is expressed in the SCN, the central circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a</xref>, arrowhead), although <italic>Sik3</italic> mRNA levels are not regulated in a circadian manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). We then performed behavioral analysis of the <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and WT (<italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) littermates. In 12 hr light-dark (LD) cycle conditions (LD 12:12), <italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited nocturnal activity profiles in which they were entrained to the LD cycle, with activity onset at light-off (ZT12, zeitgeber time representing light-on as ZT0 and light-off as ZT12 in LD 12:12 conditions) and the activity offset at light-on (ZT0). In stark contrast, <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to become completely entrained to the LD cycle (i.e. re-entrainment from DD to LD causes âsplittingâ phenotype, in which a part of the locomotor activity is entrained to the LD cycle but the other part appears to be free running), although they did still retain nocturnality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, upper panels). Their activity onset and offset in the LD cycle did not correspond exactly with the light-off and light-on times, respectively, and they fluctuated significantly with regard to light-on/light-off. These data suggest that <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have a defect in a light-input pathway. In constant dark (DD) conditions, the free-running period of the wheel-running activity rhythms of the <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (24.17Â Â±Â 0.09 hr [<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 13]) was significantly longer than that of <italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (23.80Â Â±Â 0.05 hr [<italic>n</italic>Â =Â 15]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>). The ability of <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice to entrain to a new LD cycle was examined by photic re-entrainment experiments, in which mice housed in DD conditions were transferred to an LD cycle, the phase of which was shifted substantially from the free-running activity rhythm. The free-running locomotor rhythms of <italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice rapidly re-entrained to the new LD cycle, in contrast, <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited slower re-entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, lower panels). Even after 2 weeks in the new LD cycle, a component of the free-running rhythm formed under the DD condition (red dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, lower right panel) was still observed, although the majority of the locomotor rhythm components were entrained to the LD condition. The acrophase of the activities of individual <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice were then compared in LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Acrophase means did not differ significantly between the two genotypes, but the individual variation (standard deviation) in the acrophase distribution in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice was significantly greater than that of <italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (p&lt;0.001, F-test). These data indicated that SIK3 plays a crucial role in controlling and sustaining robust circadian behavioral rhythmicity in addition to contributing to the photic entrainment. Notably, <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were relatively less active at night than <italic>Sik3<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice and more active during the day, which resulted in lower amplitude in the locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,g</xref>). It should also be noted that significant differences in locomotor activity rhythms of individual <italic>Sik3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which include circadian period, acrophase, and activity patterns at light-re-entrainment, were observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular rhythms are desynchronized and circadian periods and phases are varied in ex vivo SCN</title><p>To explore how SIK3 deficiency affects the circadian clocks in the SCN and periphery, <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were crossed with <italic>Per2::Luciferase</italic> knockin (KI) mice (<italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic>) expressing PER2-luciferase fusion protein in place of PER2, which monitors the circadian oscillation of PER2-luciferase fusion protein both in SCN explants and in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>).

In contrast, the circadian periods and phases of the individual cells in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> SCN slices were varied and their bioluminescence rhythms became gradually desynchronized with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>). To further evaluate the difference in the SCN rhythms between the two genotypes, we performed quantitative analyses on the periods and phases of the imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâh</xref>).

By contrast, unique circadian phenotypes observed in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice include the following: (i) fluctuating circadian periods and phases both in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aâf</xref>) and in vitro SCN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i and j</xref>), (ii) impaired light-entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), (iii) reduced amplitude in locomotor activity rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and (iv) desynchrony of rhythmicity among SCN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d,h</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2âvideo 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>), none of which have been reported in <italic>Csnk1</italic> mutants, except that reduced amplitude in <italic>Per2<sup>Luc</sup></italic> rhythms was observed in <italic>Csnk1d</italic> KO liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Etchegaray et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, data from the current study suggest that while CSNK1 is involved in determination of precise circadian period length and phase, SIK3 is more important for stabilization of circadian periods and phase via intercellular coupling, as well as for photic entrainment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). In other words, while the two kinases may have an overlapping role(s) with regard to phosphorylating and destabilizing PER2, SIK3 and CSNK1 contribute differentially to circadian clock regulation.</p><p>It is also interesting to note that the above-described phenotypic differences between <italic>Tau</italic> mutants and <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice may, at least partly, be explained by differential roles of the two protein kinases outside of the SCN. For example, SIK3 is expressed in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lizcano et al., 2004</xref>) as well as in the SCN and, hence, disruption of this gene may affect the circadian light-input pathway involving the retina, which is critical for photic-entrainment. This hypothesis, however, needs to be validated by further experiments such as a study investigating conditional KO mice to assess whether SIK3 in the eye plays a role in the entrainment. In addition, involvement of CSNK1 in the photic-entrainment cannot be excluded because of potential expression of <italic>Csnk1</italic> in the eye.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and g</xref>, in some cases, the actograms of <italic>Sik3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice suggest weakened rhythms. These data suggest the possibility that loss of SIK3-mediated signaling affects rhythm intensity, that is, less active at night and more active during the day. However, we found a wide variety of phenotypic differences in the individual <italic>Sik3<sup>-/ -</sup></italic> mice. Because SIK3 is involved in the regulation of metabolism(s), as previously shown, and also because average blood glucose level in <italic>Sik3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is significantly lower than that of controls, it may be a requirement for at least some of the KO mice to âkeep seeking foodâ even during a resting period, which may result in a change in rhythm strength. We believe that further studies, such as those investigating <italic>Sik3</italic> conditional KO mice or transgenic rescue mice, would enable us to distinguish the dual effects on behavioral rhythms (i.e. effects from the circadian clock and metabolism).</p><p>It is also noteworthy that light re-entrainment experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, some of the <italic>Sik3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited quite intriguing behaviors as mentioned above. It appears that, after transition from DD to LD, a part of the locomotor activities free-run even in the light phase (red dotted lines), but the rest of the activities were gradually entrained to LD cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, right), which is not observed in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, left). There are a couple of possible interpretations: (i) ârelative coordination,â in which free-running rhythms are affected by a Zeitgeber (entrainment agent) or other rhythms; and (ii) incomplete re-entrainment and/or insufficient negative masking by light due to defect(s) in the light-input pathway.</p><p>It has previously been shown that constitutive expression of <italic>Per2</italic> causes arrhythmia in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yamamoto et al., 2005</xref>). This may partly explain the aberrant rhythmicity in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice due to accumulation of PER2 protein. Desynchrony among SCN cells, which has been observed in circadian rhythm mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maywood et al., 2006</xref>), may lead to insufficient light-entrainment or inconstant behavioral rhythms. Finally, the <italic>Sik3</italic> gene is highly conserved in evolution, from nematodes to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Okamoto et al., 2004</xref>), and <italic>Sik3</italic> deficiency results in severe phenotypes such as high lethality after birth, and metabolic and skeletal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sasagawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Uebi et al., 2012</xref>). These previous studies suggest that SIK3 plays an essential role in various tissues and organs. Considering that animal behavior is influenced by physiological states, we cannot exclude the possibility that behavioral and physiological abnormalities in circadian rhythms in <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, such as those observed in the current study, are due to defects not only in the SCN, but in other parts of the brain or in other organs or tissues. Conditional <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse may be a suitable tool for addressing these questions in the future. In addition, the present study demonstrated that SIK3-mediated phosphorylation regulates protein stability of PER2; however, this does not exclude the possibility that other clock/clock-related protein(s) is also a target of SIK3.</p><p>It has been reported that SIK1, another isoform of the SIK subfamily, is involved in photic entrainment of the master circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>), although its involvement in the central circadian clock remains uncertain. Notably, while the present study demonstrated that SIK3 regulates photic-entrainment, light responses in behavior observed in <italic>Sik1</italic>-KD mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Sik3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are contrary to one another: rapid <italic>vs.</italic> delayed re-entrainment, respectively. In addition, CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1) was proposed as a target of SIK1, which contributes to light-induced phase reset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jagannath et al., 2013</xref>). Although further studies are necessary to elucidate the involvement of the two SIK isoforms in light-resetting mechanisms, the current study suggests that SIK3 contributes to the light-input pathway in addition to the circadian clock machinery in a manner that differs from SIK1, by regulating different substrates and signaling pathways.</p><p>Strikingly, Funato <italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that, by large-scale forward-genetics screen in mice to seek dominant sleep abnormalities, a splicing mutation of <italic>Sik3</italic> (referred to as a <italic>Sleepy</italic> mutant) resulted in significant decrease in wake time caused by extended non-REM (NREM) sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Funato et al., 2016</xref>). In the <italic>Sleepy</italic> mutants in which a point mutation resulting in a lack of a protein kinase A (PKA) recognition site of the SIK3 protein, the authors also described that locomotor activity rhythms in the mutants were normal. Although the results were in contrast to our present data, the discrepancy could be explained by a difference in introduced mutations, that is, a partial deletion in the <italic>Sleepy</italic> mutants versus null mutation in our <italic>Sik3</italic> KO mice.</p><p>More recently, a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggested effects of SIK3 homolog on coupling of different oscillator cells and with alternative period-lengthening and shortening in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujii et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the present study in mice also observed abnormality in extracellular coupling among clock cells in <italic>Sik3</italic>-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Fujii <italic>et al</italic>. described clearly that the amplitude of dPER protein rhythms in clock neurons (DN1p) was damped in <italic>Sik3</italic>-knockdown flies under constant darkness, while they did not propose a role for SIK3 in the phosphorylation and degradation of dPER. Instead, they proposed HDAC4 as a target of SIK3 since HDAC4 is one of well-established targets of SIK3 in fly. Thus, it is possible that SIK3 regulates the mammalian circadian clock by modulating activity of HDAC4 besides PER2 or that the effect of SIK3 on PER2 degradation is mediated by some kinases or degradation proteins, which are transcriptionally regulated by HDAC4.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animals were cared for in accordance with Law No. 105 and Notification No. 6 of the Japanese Government, and experimental protocols involving the mice were approved by the relevant Ethics Committees at Kindai University and Nagoya University.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and have raised some significant concerns that we feel must be addressed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Hayasaka et al. reports a role for the salt-inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) in the circadian clock of mice. SIK3 KO mice display slightly longer periods in locomotor activity rhythms and less efficient entrainment to light dark cycles. The circadian periods of SCN neurons within a cultured slice, however, are not significantly different from wild-type, yet the phase coherence of individual neurons seems to be affected. In contrast to behavior, circadian periods of NIH3T3 fibroblasts with RNAi-mediated knockdown of SIK3 are shorter than in control cells. The authors then test the effect of SIK3 levels on the abundance and stability of PER2 and find that overexpressing SIK3 (but not a kinase-dead version) decreases ectopically expressed PER2 levels by destabilization, and knockdown of SIK3 increases ectopically expressed PER2 levels. In addition, the authors show that SIK3 overexpression leads to an increase in overexpressed PER2 phosphorylation, and the resulting destabilization is independent from CK1 phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study is potentially interesting, but all three of the reviewers were concerned about the central hypothesis that PER2 is the relevant substrate for the circadian effects of this kinase. The effects of RNAi knock-down or overexpression on PER2 levels in tissue culture are very strong, and yet the period lengthening in the SIK3 knock-out mouse are very small (and go in the opposite direction from those seen with RNAi in NIH 3T3 cells) and therefore inconsistent with the strong effects seen in tissue culture manipulations.</p><p>1) Why did the authors investigate PER2 as a target for Sik3? Did they investigate any other circadian targets and fail to find effects on those? Could the direct target be something besides PER2 that produces a downstream effect on PER2?</p><p>2) There was a consensus that some additional findings are needed to strengthen the conclusion that PER2 is a relevant target, and that these findings should employ the SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> cells rather than overexpression or RNAi studies. These studies could include immunoblot analysis of PER2 levels in the SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> knock-out mice or in primary fibroblasts from SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> mice to show that these levels are significantly higher than in wild type mice, with blunted oscillations and effects on the PER2 phosphorylation profile. The plots of overall per2-luciferase levels (rather than normalized levels) could also be informative about differential effects on PER2. Primary fibroblasts derived from the SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> per2-luciferase mice (and SIK3<sup>+/+</sup> per2 luciferase control fibroblast) could be assessed for short or long period oscillations, rather than the NIH 3T3 cells with RNAi kd, and an interaction of PER2 with SIK3 in normal circadian cells would also be indicative of PER2 relevance (although an absence of such an interaction would not be informative, as many kinases do not interact stably with their substrates). Identification of a SIK3 phosphorylation site in PER2 and demonstration of a destabilizing effect of phosphorylation at these sites would be a seminal finding, although we do not insist that this finding be produced for this manuscript.</p><p>3) In any event, additional findings in circadian cells that do not involve overexpression or RNAi are needed, and if the additional findings do not show strong effects on PER2 the authors must discuss PER2 as a target of Sik3 in a speculative manner.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Salt-inducible kinase 3 regulates the mammalian circadian clock by destabilizing PER2 protein&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Hayasaka et al. have made a thorough effort to revise the manuscript according to the suggestions of the previous reviewers, and the paper is much improved. However, there are still a few points that need to be addressed. Most importantly, a paper describing the role of the SIK3 kinase in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock has been published (Fujii et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. (2017) 114(32):E6669-E6677) since the initial submission of this manuscript. This manuscript is not cited or discussed in the revised version of this manuscript under review, but it needs to be, particularly since some of the findings (e.g., effects of the kinase on coupling of different oscillator cells and with alternative period-lengthening and shortening in different cell types) are also found in this revised manuscript.</p><p>In contrast with this revised manuscript, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> manuscript does not propose a role for SIK3 in the phosphorylation and degradation of PER. Instead, HDAC4 is proposed as a target. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> paper did not investigate thoroughly an effect on PER levels and phosphorylation, so it may have missed them (feel free to suggest this), or alternatively the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock may work differently from the mammalian clock with regard to this kinase. Nevertheless, I think the authors of this revised submitted manuscript need to be cautious about claiming direct regulation of PER2 phosphorylation and stability by SIK3 kinase activity. Clearly, PER2 is less stable and more phosphorylated with catalytically active SIK3 overexpression and more stable and less phosphorylated with SIK3 knock-down or expression of the inactive kinase, but their attempts to identify a SIK3 target site in PER2 or a protein degradation mechanism that mediates this effect were not successful. The &quot;in vitro&quot; phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated PER2 by SIK3 kinase in Figure 5A by their own admission involves other factors besides PER2 and SIK3 (e.g., proteolysis components), so it might also involve an intermediate kinase that responds to SIK3 addition to phosphorylate PER2. I think it is fair to say that the kinase activity of SIK3 leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of PER2, but not necessarily directly. It could be mediated by other kinases or other clock components, which do not appear to have been assessed extensively as targets for Sik3 (just PER1). If HDAC4 is a target for SIK3, its activity could modulate the expression of many other kinases and degradation proteins that contribute to the effect on PER2. I recommend modifying the last sentence of the Abstract to &quot;Collectively, the results indicate that SIK3 plays key roles in circadian rhythms by facilitating phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of PER2, either directly or indirectly.&quot; Also, offer the alternative of an indirect regulation of PER2 phosphorylation and degradation status by SIK3 in the Results presentation of the Figure 5 data and in the Discussion, which now suggests only that PER2 is directly phosphorylated by SIK3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24779.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study is potentially interesting, but all three of the reviewers were concerned about the central hypothesis that PER2 is the relevant substrate for the circadian effects of this kinase.

We investigated other proteins, including some clock proteins, and initially found that PER2 protein levels were largely affected by SIK3. Therefore, we commenced the PER2 study and found that, in in vitro kinase assays, incubation of PER2 purified from cells and recombinant SIK3 enhanced PER2 phosphorylation, indicating that PER2 is a direct substrate of SIK3-catalyzed phosphorylation. However, we do not exclude the possibility that other clock/clock-related protein(s) is/are also a target of SIK3. In the revised manuscript, we add the following statement to the Discussion:</p><p>âIn addition, the present study showed that PER2 protein is a substrate of SIK3-mediated phosphorylation; however, this does not exclude the possibility that other clock/clock-related protein(s) is also a target of SIK3.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was a consensus that some additional findings are needed to strengthen the conclusion that PER2 is a relevant target, and that these findings should employ the SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> cells rather than overexpression or RNAi studies. These studies could include immunoblot analysis of PER2 levels in the SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> knock-out mice or in primary fibroblasts from SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> mice to show that these levels are significantly higher than in wild type mice, with blunted oscillations and effects on the PER2 phosphorylation profile.

Identification of a SIK3 phosphorylation site in PER2 and demonstration of a destabilizing effect of phosphorylation at these sites would be a seminal finding, although we do not insist that this finding be produced for this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments and constructive suggestions. As mentioned in the previous response, we established mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines from SIK3<sup>-/-</sup>; PER2::LUC<sup>+/-</sup> and SIK3<sup>+/+</sup>; PER2::LUC<sup>+/-</sup> embryos. In western blot analysis, we found that endogenous PER2 protein levels were markedly elevated in SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs at all of the time-points studied. This result strengthened our conclusion that SIK3 promotes the degradation of PER2 protein. This finding is included in revised manuscript as the new Figure 4A.</p><p>In addition, we attempted to detect/determine PER2 protein levels in SIK3-KO mouse liver. As mentioned, many SIK3-KO mice died on the day of birth, and only one SIK3<sup>-/-</sup>; PER2::LUC<sup>+/-</sup> mouse was available for this experiment. Unfortunately, no SIK3<sup>+/+</sup>; PER2::LUC<sup>+/-</sup> littermates were produced; therefore, we used a Sik3<sup>+/-</sup>; PER2::LUC<sup>+/-</sup> littermate as a control in this experiment. Of note, we observed a dramatic increase in PER2 protein level in SIK3-KO mouse liver compared with control SIK3-heterozygous mice (Figure 4B in the revised manuscript, compare lane 5 and 6).</p><p>In response to the latter comment, we tried to identify PER2 phosphorylation site(s) responsible for control of its degradation rate. For this purpose, we prepared four single amino-acid (SA) mutants of the PER2 protein, in which each of four potential phosphorylation sites (all Serine) by SIK3 was mutated to Alanine (i.e., S624A, S659A, S971A, and S981A). These phosphorylation sites were identified by MS analysis in cell culture (Vanselow et al., 2007). Among all sites, S624 was identified by omics studies most frequently (PhosphoSitePlus, https://www.phosphosite.org/homeAction.action) and S659 is a well-known site regulating PER2 protein stability (Toh et al., 2001). We also considered the kinase consensus sequence of SIK3 (LXR[T/S]XpSXXX), especially regarding S971 and S981. Because the responsible kinases for all four sites are undetermined, we focused on these sites as candidates for SIK3-mediated phosphorylation.</p><p>We compared the steady state protein levels of the mutants with wild-type (WT)-PER2 in the presence of co-expressed SIK3 in HEK293T17 cells. However, no significant stabilization of PER2 protein was detected in any of the single SA mutations of PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Combination of these SA mutations and other sites should be examined in the future (because MS analysis of SIK3-mediated PER2 phosphorylation sites appear to be difficult due to their unstable nature).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>No significant effects of SA mutations at phosphorylation sites of PER2 on its degradation induced by SIK3.</title><p>HEK293T17 cells were transfected with SIK3 (or empty vector [â]) and mutant PER2 expression vectors with green-fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector.

As mentioned above, we observed markedly elevated expression levels of PER2 in SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> cells (new Figure 4A in revised manuscript) and SIK3<sup>-/-</sup> liver (new Figure 4B in revised manuscript), which strongly suggest that PER2 is the most promising SIK3 substrate candidate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] I recommend modifying the last sentence of the Abstract to &quot;Collectively, the results indicate that SIK3 plays key roles in circadian rhythms by facilitating phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of PER2, either directly or indirectly.&quot; Also, offer the alternative of an indirect regulation of PER2 phosphorylation and degradation status by SIK3 in the Results presentation of the Figure 5 data and in the Discussion, which now suggests only that PER2 is directly phosphorylated by SIK3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these insightful comments. While we have tried to indicate the direct effect of SIK3 on PER2, we agree that our data is not strong enough to conclude that. According to your suggestion, we have modified our statements in the Abstract for the role of SIK3 as follow according to the reviewersâ suggestion:</p><p>âCollectively, SIK3 plays key roles in circadian rhythms by facilitating phosphorylation-dependent destabilization of PER2, either directly or indirectly.â</p><p>In addition, we cited the paper that reviewers had suggested (Fujii et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (2017) 114(32): E6669-E6677) and added the following statement to the Discussion:</p><p>âMore recently, a study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggested effects of SIK3 homolog on coupling of different oscillator cells and with alternative period-lengthening and shortening in different cell types (Fujii et al., 2017). [â¦] Thus, it is possible that SIK3 regulates the mammalian circadian clock by modulating activity of HDAC4 besides PER2 or that the effect of SIK3 on PER2 degradation is mediated by some kinases or degradation proteins, which are transcriptionally regulated by HDAC4.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
