DNA methylation profiles from 4483 participants from seven independent cohorts identifying differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with psychosis, schizophrenia, and treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Psychosis cases were characterized by significant differences in measures of blood cell proportions and elevated smoking exposure derived from the DNA methylation data, with the largest differences seen in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. We implemented a stringent pipeline to meta-analyze epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results across datasets, identifying 95 DMPs associated with psychosis and 1048 DMPs associated with schizophrenia, with evidence of colocalization to regions nominated by genetic association studies of disease. Many schizophrenia-associated DNA methylation differences were only present in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, potentially reflecting exposure to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Our results highlight how DNA methylation data can be leveraged to identify physiological (e.g., differential cell counts) and environmental (e.g., smoking) factors associated with psychosis and molecular biomarkers of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>DNA

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psychosis is a complex and heterogeneous neuropsychiatric condition characterized by a loss of contact with reality, whose symptoms can include delusions and hallucinations. Episodic psychosis and altered cognitive function are major features of schizophrenia, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that contributes significantly to the global burden of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Whiteford et al., 2013</xref>). Schizophrenia is highly heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hilker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sullivan et al., 2003</xref>) and recent genetic studies have indicated a complex polygenic architecture involving hundreds of genetic variants that individually confer a minimal increase on the overall risk of developing the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Purcell et al., 2009</xref>). Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 160 regions of the genome harboring common variants robustly associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, with evidence for a substantial polygenic component in signals that individually fall below genome-wide levels of significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pardi√±as et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ripke et al., 2014</xref>). As the majority of schizophrenia-associated variants do not directly index coding changes affecting protein structure, there remains uncertainty about the causal genes involved in disease pathogenesis and how their function is dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A major hypothesis is that GWAS variants predominantly act to influence the regulation of gene expression. This hypothesis is supported by an enrichment of schizophrenia-associated variants in core regulatory domains (e.g., active promotors and enhancers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hannon et al., 2019a</xref>). As a consequence, there has been growing interest in the role of epigenetic variation in the molecular etiology of schizophrenia. DNA methylation is the best-characterized epigenetic modification, acting to influence gene expression via disruption of transcription factor binding and recruitment of methyl-binding proteins that initiate chromatin compaction and gene silencing. Despite being traditionally regarded as a mechanism of transcriptional repression, DNA methylation is actually associated with both increased and decreased gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wagner et al., 2014</xref>) and other genomic functions including alternative splicing and promoter usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maunakea et al., 2010</xref>). We previously demonstrated how DNA methylation is under local genetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannon et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannon et al., 2016b</xref>), identifying an enrichment of DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) among genomic regions associated with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannon et al., 2016b</xref>). Furthermore, we have used mQTL associations to identify discrete sites of regulatory variation associated with schizophrenia risk variants implicating specific genes within these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannon et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannon et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, epigenetic variation induced by environmental exposures has been hypothesized as another mechanism by which non-genetic factors can affect risk for neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dempster et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The development of standardized assays for quantifying DNA methylation at specific sites across the genome has enabled the systematic analysis of associations between methylomic variation and environmental exposures or diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murphy and Mill, 2014</xref>). Because DNA methylation is a dynamic process, these epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are more complex to design and interpret than GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mill and Heijmans, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rakyan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Relton and Davey Smith, 2010</xref>). As for observational epidemiological studies of exposures and outcomes, a number of potentially important confounding factors (e.g., tissue or cell¬†type, age, sex, lifestyle exposures, medication, and disorder-associated exposures) that can directly influence DNA methylation need to be considered along with the possibility of reverse causation. Despite these difficulties, recent studies have identified schizophrenia-associated DNA methylation differences in analyses of post-mortem brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaffe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pidsley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wockner et al., 2014</xref>), and also detected disease-associated variation in peripheral blood samples from both schizophrenia-discordant monozygotic twin pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dempster et al., 2011</xref>) and clinically¬†ascertained case-control cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kinoshita et al., 2014</xref>). We previously reported an EWAS of variable DNA methylation associated with schizophrenia in¬†&gt;1700 individuals, meta-analyzing data from three independent cohorts and identifying methylomic biomarkers of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2016a</xref>).¬†Together these data support a role for differential DNA methylation in the molecular etiology of schizophrenia, although it is not clear whether disease-associated methylation differences are themselves secondary to the disorder itself or a result of other schizophrenia-associated factors.</p><p>In this study we extend our previous analysis, quantifying DNA methylation across the genome in a total of 4483 participants from seven independent case-control cohorts including patients with schizophrenia or first-episode psychosis (FEP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This represents the largest EWAS of schizophrenia and psychosis, and one of the largest case-control studies of DNA methylation for any disease phenotype. In each cohort, genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood, and DNA methylation was quantified across the genome using either the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray (‚Äò450K array‚Äô) or the HumanMethylationEPIC microarray (‚ÄòEPIC array‚Äô) (see 'Materials and methods'). We implemented a stringent pipeline to meta-analyze EWAS results across datasets to identify associations between psychosis cases and variation in DNA methylation. We show how DNA methylation data can be leveraged to identify biological (e.g., differential cell counts) and environmental (e.g., smoking) factors associated with psychosis, and present evidence for molecular variation associated with clozapine exposure in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia¬†(TRS).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the sample cohorts and analytical approaches used in this study of altered DNA methylation in psychosis and schizophrenia.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58430-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Forest plot showing the difference in mean age between psychosis cases and controls across each cohort.</title><p>TE: treatment effect (i.e., the mean difference between cases and controls); seTE: standard error of the treatment effect.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58430-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Scatterplot of the relationship between the first two genetic principal components merged with HapMap phase 3 data for individual cohorts.</title><p>With the exception of the IoPPN and EUGEI cohorts, there is little ethnic heterogeneity in each of the cohorts with samples being predominantly of Caucasian origin.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58430-fig1-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Scatterplots of DNAmAge derived from the DNA methylation data against actual chronological age for each of the cohorts.</title><p>DNAmAge was calculated using the algorithm described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horvath, 2013</xref>.

These cohorts represent a range of study designs and recruitment strategies and were initially designed to explore different clinical and etiological aspects of schizophrenia (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>); they include studies of FEP (EU-GEI and IoPPN), established schizophrenia and/or clozapine usage (UCL, Aberdeen, Dublin, IoPPN), mortality in schizophrenia (Sweden), and a study of twins from monozygotic pairs discordant for schizophrenia (Twins). All cohorts were characterized by a higher proportion of male participants (range¬†=¬†52.1‚Äì71.1% male, pooled mean¬†=¬†62.6% male, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) than females. Although there was an overall significantly higher proportion of males among cases compared to controls (œá<sup>2</sup> = 37.5, p=9.35√ó10<sup>‚àí10</sup>), consistent with reported incidence rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aleman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van der Werf et al., 2014</xref>), there was significant heterogeneity in the sex by diagnosis proportions across different cohorts (œá<sup>2</sup> = 348, p=4.86√ó10<sup>‚àí63</sup>) with the overall excess of male patients driven by two cohorts (UCL [œá<sup>2</sup> = 52.7, p=3.81√ó10<sup>‚àí13</sup>] and EU-GEI [œá<sup>2</sup> = 25.9, p=3.68√ó10<sup>‚àí7</sup>]). Most cohorts were enriched for young and middle-aged adults, although there was considerable heterogeneity across the studies reflecting the differing sampling strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For example, the IoPPN cohort has the lowest average age, reflecting the inclusion of a large number of FEP patients (mean¬†=¬†34.9 years; SD¬†=¬†12.42 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Forti et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, individuals in the Sweden cohort were older (mean¬†=¬†60.0 years; SD¬†=¬†8.9 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kowalec et al., 2019</xref>).

Schizophrenia-associated DMPs had a mean difference of 0.789% (SD¬†=¬†0.204%) and, like the psychosis-associated differences, were significantly enriched for sites that were hypermethylated in cases compared to controls (n¬†=¬†897 [87.4%]; p=1.27√ó10<sup>‚àí129</sup>). A number of the top-ranked DMPs are annotated to genes that have direct relevance to the etiology of schizophrenia and gene ontology (GO) analysis highlighted multiple pathways previously implicated in schizophrenia including several related to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berretta, 2012</xref>) and cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Dushlaine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Given the large range of ages across the samples included in this study, we tested whether there was evidence for a relationship between age and differential DNA methylation at the 1048 schizophrenia DMPs by refitting our analysis model using an additional interaction term between age and schizophrenia status individually for each cohort prior to the interaction effects being meta-analyzed (see 'Materials and methods'). Overall, we found limited evidence for a relationship between age and DNA methylation at schizophrenia-associated DMPs; controlling for multiple testing (p&lt;0.00004771), only two (0.002%) DMPs were identified as showing a significant interaction with age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We used the same approach to explore for an interaction between sex and DNA methylation, finding no evidence for sex differences at these sites or evidence for a significant interaction between sex and DNA methylation (p&lt;0.00004771) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Finally, although most of the cohorts included in this study were predominantly Caucasian, there was some ethnic heterogeneity in the IoPPN and EU-GEI cohorts. To explore the extent to which this diversity might be influencing our results, we merged SNP array data from each donor with HapMap phase 3 data and calculated genetic PCs using GCTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). We re-analyzed data from individual cohorts including increasing numbers of genetic PCs to the model, finding that even in the most ethnically diverse cohort (IoPPN) the inclusion of up to five genetic PCs had negligible effects, with a very strong correlation in test statistics between models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Schizophrenia-associated DNA methylation differences show overlap with previous analyses of schizophrenia and other traits</title><p>Two of our experiment-wide significant schizophrenia-associated DMPs (cg00390724 and cg09868768) overlapped with those reported in a previous smaller whole blood schizophrenia EWAS performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montano et al., 2016</xref> with the same direction of effect; of note, 119 (71.3%) of the 167 replicated DMPs reported by this study were characterized by a consistent direction of effect in our meta-analysis, representing a significantly higher rate than expected by chance (p=3.83√ó10<sup>‚àí8</sup>). Unfortunately, we could not check the extent to which our schizophrenia-associated DMPs were replicated in the Montano et al. dataset because the full results from their analysis are not publicly available.¬†We next compared our results with those from a prefrontal cortex EWAS meta-analysis of schizophrenia also performed by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Viana et al., 2017</xref>), finding that 627 (60.2%) of the 1042 DMPs tested in both analyses had the same direction of effect, a significantly higher rate than expected by chance (p=5.43√ó10<sup>‚àí11</sup>).

Where effect sizes for individual DMPs were available in the EWAS catalog, we tested for an enrichment of consistent (or discordant) associations to those identified with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia DMPs also associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and gestational age, for example, were significantly enriched for a consistent direction of effect (CRP: 10 overlapping DMPs, 10 consistent direction of effect, p=0.001953; gestational age: 105 overlapping DMPs, 72 consistent direction of effect, p=0.000178).

Using results from a quantitative genetic analysis of DNA methylation in monozygotic and dizygotic twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hannon et al., 2018c</xref>), we found that DNA methylation at schizophrenia-associated DMPs is more strongly influenced by additive genetic factors compared to non-associated sites matched for comparable means and standard deviations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) (mean additive genetic component across DMPs¬†=¬†23.0%; SD¬†=¬†16.8%; p=1.61√ó10<sup>‚àí87</sup>). Using a database of blood DNA mQTL previously generated by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannon et al., 2018a</xref>), we identified common genetic variants associated with 256 (24.4%) of the schizophrenia-associated DMPs. Across these 256 schizophrenia-associated DMPs, there were a total of 455 independent genetic associations with 448 genetic variants, indicating that some of these DMPs are under polygenic control with multiple genetic variants associated. Of note, 31 of these genetic variants are located within 12 schizophrenia-associated GWAS regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with 19 genetic variants associated with schizophrenia DMPs located in the MHC region on chromosome 6.

Although we identified no significant DMPs at our stringent experiment-wide significance threshold, this is not surprising given the greatly attenuated sample size and the high phenotypic heterogeneity among individuals with FEP compared to diagnosed schizophrenia; both factors negatively influence power to detect effects. We next repeated our EWAS of diagnosed schizophrenia, excluding the IoPPN cohort to ensure that there were no overlapping samples between the schizophrenia vs. control analysis and the FEP vs. control analysis, identifying 125 significant DMPs of which 101 were also tested in the FEP EWAS. To see if there was any evidence for differential DNAm at these sites prior to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, we compared the estimated differences between schizophrenia cases and controls and FEP cases and controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Strikingly, 96 (95.0%) of the tested DMPs had a consistent direction of effect in the FEP EWAS, a significantly higher rate than expected by chance (p=6.58√ó10<sup>-23</sup>).

Using data from four cohorts for which medication records were available (UCL, Aberdeen, IoPPN, and Sweden), we performed a within-schizophrenia analysis comparing schizophrenia patients prescribed clozapine (described as TRS cases) and those prescribed standard antipsychotic medications (total n¬†=¬†399 TRS and 636 non-TRS). Across each of the four cohorts, the proportion of males prescribed clozapine was slightly higher than the proportion of males on other medications (œá<sup>2</sup> = 7.04; p=7.96√ó10<sup>‚àí3</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) consistent with findings from epidemiological studies that report increased rates of clozapine prescription in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 2017</xref>), although there was statistically significant heterogeneity in the sex distribution between groups across cohorts (œá<sup>2</sup> = 20.5; p=0.0150).

Interestingly, cellular composition variables derived from the DNA methylation data suggest that TRS cases are characterized by a significantly higher proportion of granulocytes (meta-analysis mean difference¬†=¬†0.00283; p=8.10√ó10<sup>‚àí6</sup>) and lower proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (mean difference¬†=¬†‚àí0.0115; p=4.37√ó10<sup>‚àí5</sup>;¬†<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>) compared to non-TRS cases. Given the finding of higher derived granulocyte and lower CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell levels in the combined psychosis patient group compared to controls described above, a finding driven primarily by patients with schizophrenia, we performed a multiple regression analysis of granulocyte proportion to partition the effects associated with schizophrenia status from effects associated with TRS status. After including a covariate for TRS, schizophrenia status was not significantly associated with granulocyte proportion using a random effects model (p=0.210) but there was significant heterogeneity of effects across the four cohorts (I<sup>2</sup>¬†=¬†91%, p=4.93√ó10<sup>‚àí7</sup>). Within the group of patients with schizophrenia, however, there were notable differences between TRS and non-TRS groups (mean difference¬†=¬†0.0275; p=3.22√ó10<sup>‚àí6</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>).

One hundred and fifty-two (14.5%) of the schizophrenia-associated DMPs were associated with a significant effect between schizophrenia cases and controls and a significant effect within schizophrenia patients between TRS and non-TRS patients, with the majority (128 [84.2%]) characterized by the same direction of effect in both groups and indicative of an additive effect of both schizophrenia diagnosis and TRS status (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Using a stringent pipeline to meta-analyze EWAS results across datasets, we identify novel DMPs associated with both psychosis and a more refined diagnosis of schizophrenia. Of note, we show evidence for the colocalization of genetic associations for schizophrenia and differential DNA methylation. Finally, we present evidence for differential methylation associated with TRS, potentially reflecting differences in DNA methylation associated with exposure to the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine.</p><p>We identify robust psychosis-associated differences in cellular composition estimates derived from DNA methylation data, with cases having increased proportions of monocytes and granulocytes and decreased proportions of natural killer cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, compared to non-psychiatric controls. This analysis extends previous work based on a subset of these data, which reported a decrease in the proportion of natural killer cells and increase in the proportion of granulocytes in schizophrenia patients, with the large number of samples enabling us to identify additional associations with other cell types. We also confirm findings from an independent study of schizophrenia which reported significantly increased proportions of granulocytes and monocytes, and decreased proportions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells using estimates derived from DNA methylation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montano et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, because we can only derive proportion of cell types from whole blood DNA methylation data, and not actual counts, an increase in one or more cell types must be balanced by a decrease in one or more other cell types and an apparent change in the proportion of one specific cell type does not mean that the actual abundance of that cell type is altered. Despite this, the results from DNA methylation-derived cell proportions are consistent with previous studies based on empirical cell abundance measures which have reported increased monocyte counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beumer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moody and Miller, 2018</xref>), increased neutrophil counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Rizo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">N√∫√±ez et al., 2019</xref>), increased monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steiner et al., 2019</xref>), and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karageorgiou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazza et al., 2020</xref>) in both schizophrenia and FEP patients compared to controls. Previous studies have also shown that higher neutrophil counts in schizophrenia patients correlate with a greater burden of positive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">N√∫√±ez et al., 2019</xref>) suggesting that variations in the number of neutrophils is a potential marker of disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steiner et al., 2019</xref>). Our sub-analysis of TRS, which is associated with a higher number of positive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 2017</xref>), found that the increase in granulocytes was primarily driven by those with the more severe phenotype, supporting this hypothesis. Importantly, the differences we observe may actually reflect the effects of various antipsychotic medications that have been previously shown to influence cell proportions in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steiner et al., 2019</xref>) or a recruitment bias whereby patients with low levels of granulocytes are not prescribed clozapine given the risk of agranulocytosis.</p><p>We also identified a highly¬†significant increase in a DNA methylation-derived smoking score in patients with schizophrenia, replicating our previous finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2016a</xref>). The smoking score captures multiple aspects of tobacco smoking behavior including both current smoking status and the quantity of cigarettes smoked; our results therefore reflect existing epidemiological evidence demonstrating that schizophrenia patients not only smoke more, but also smoke more heavily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Leon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Leon and Diaz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McClave et al., 2010</xref>). We also report an increased smoking score in patients with FEP, although not to the same extent as seen in schizophrenia, consistent with a meta-analysis reporting high levels of smoking in FEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Myles et al., 2012</xref>). In the subset of treatment-resistant patients, we found that there was an additional increase in smoking score relative to schizophrenia cases prescribed alternative medications, supporting evidence for higher rates of smoking in TRS groups relative to treatment-responsive schizophrenia patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>). These results not only highlight physiological (i.e., cell proportions) and environmental (i.e., smoking) differences associated with psychosis and schizophrenia and the utility of DNA methylation data for deriving these variables in epidemiological studies, but also highlight the importance of controlling for these differences as potential confounders in analyses of disease-associated DNA methylation differences.</p><p>Our EWAS, building on our previous analysis on a subset of the sample cohorts profiled here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2016a</xref>), identified 95 DMPs associated with psychosis that are robust to differences in measured smoking exposure and heterogeneity in blood cellular composition derived from DNA methylation data. Of note, we identified a dramatic increase in sites characterized by an increase in DNA methylation in patients. A key strength of our study is the inclusion of the full spectrum of schizophrenia diagnoses, from FEP through to treatment-resistant cases prescribed clozapine. While this may introduce heterogeneity into our primary analyses, we used a random effects meta-analysis to identify consistent effects across all cohorts and diagnostic subtypes. We also performed an additional analysis focused specifically on cases with a more refined diagnosis of schizophrenia excluding those with FEP, which identified over 1000 DMPs. A number of the top-ranked DMPs are annotated to genes that have a¬†direct relevance to the etiology of schizophrenia, and GO analysis highlighted multiple pathways previously implicated in schizophrenia, including several related to the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berretta, 2012</xref>) and cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">O'Dushlaine et al., 2011</xref>). Given the known genetic component to the etiology of schizophrenia, it is interesting that schizophrenia-associated DMPs were found to colocalize to several regions nominated by genetic association studies. Our results suggest that this analysis of a more specific phenotype in a smaller number of samples is potentially more powerful and that schizophrenia cases have a more discrete molecular phenotype that might reflect both etiological factors but also factors associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (e.g., medications, stress, etc.). The mean difference in DNA methylation between cases and controls for both psychosis and schizophrenia was small, consistent with other blood-based EWAS of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montano et al., 2016</xref>) and complex traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hannon et al., 2018c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hannon et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marioni et al., 2018</xref>) in general. While individually they may be too small to have a strong predictive power as a biomarker, together they may have utility as a molecular classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To explore whether schizophrenia-associated differences in DNA methylation are present before a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia, we also performed an EWAS of individuals with FEP. Strikingly, the majority of our schizophrenia-associated DMPs were found to have a consistent direction of effect in the EWAS of individuals with FEP. While this result is consistent with schizophrenia-associated differences being present prior to a formal diagnosis of schizophrenia, it is not sufficient to state that they are causal; they may still reflect some underlying environmental risk factors or be a consequence of having FEP (e.g., medication exposure or other psychiatric condition). Further work is needed to explore the extent to which the DMPs associated with psychosis and schizophrenia in this meta-analysis might have a causal role in disease.</p><p>Finally, we also report the first systematic analysis of individuals with TRS, identifying seven DMPs at which differential DNA methylation was significantly different in the subset of schizophrenia cases prescribed clozapine. These data are informative for the interpretation of our schizophrenia-associated differences, because a number of these DMPs are driven by the subset of patients on clozapine. Furthermore, a number of sites show opposite effects in our analyses of TRS vs. our analysis of schizophrenia, suggesting they might represent important differences between diagnostic groups. Because the prescription of clozapine is generally only undertaken in patients with TRS, we are unable to separate the effects of clozapine exposure from differences associated with a more severe sub-type of schizophrenia such as the influence of polypharmaceutical treatment.</p><p>Our results should be considered in light of a number of important limitations. First, our analyses were constrained by the technical limitations of the Illumina 450K and EPIC arrays, which assay only ~ 3% of CpG sites in the genome. Second, this is a cross-sectional study and it¬†was not possible to distinguish cause from effect. It is possible, and indeed likely, for example, that the differences associated with both schizophrenia and TRS reflect the effects of medication exposure or other consequences of having schizophrenia, for¬†example, living more stressful lives, poorer diet, and health. The importance of such confounding variables is demonstrated by our findings of differential smoking score and blood cell proportions derived directly from the DNA methylation data, although these examples also highlight the potential utility of such effects for molecular epidemiology. Third, although our aim was not to make inferences about mechanistic changes in the brain associated with psychosis, it is important to note that our study analyzed DNA methylation profiled in peripheral blood and therefore can provide only limited information about variation in the primary tissue associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hannon et al., 2015</xref>). Although this limits mechanistic conclusions about the role of DNA methylation in schizophrenia, biomarkers, by definition, need to be measured in an easily accessible tissue and do¬†not¬†need to reflect the underlying pathogenic process. Furthermore, because most classifiers used to quantify variables such as smoking exposure and age have been trained in blood, this represents the optimal tissue in which to derive these measures. Of course, blood may also be an appropriate choice for investigating medication effects, particularly given the known effects on white blood cell counts associated with taking clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvir et al., 1993</xref>). Fourth, while we have explored the potential effects of clozapine on DNA methylation by assessing a sub-group of individuals with TRS, this is just one of a range of antipsychotics schizophrenia and psychosis patients are prescribed. The fact that the TRS group show more extreme differences for many of the schizophrenia-associated DMPs suggests that the polypharmaceutical treatment regimens often prescribed to schizophrenia patients may produce specific DNA methylation signatures in patients, akin to the effect seen for smoking. Fifth, although we found no evidence for a significant interaction between sex and DNA methylation at DMPs associated with schizophrenia, it is possible that there are other DNA methylation differences associated with disease only in males or females. Finally, although we found some evidence that schizophrenia-associated DMPs colocalize to regions nominated by GWAS, the integration of our DNA methylation data with genetic data was beyond the scope of this analysis. Of note, we have previously used mQTL associations to identify discrete sites of regulatory variation associated with schizophrenia risk variants to prioritize specific genes within broad GWAS regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hannon et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hannon et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannon et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hannon et al., 2017</xref>), and future work will aim to further explore interactions between genetic and epigenetic risk factors.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis of 4483 participants represents the largest study of blood-based DNA¬†methylation in schizophrenia and psychosis yet performed, and one of the largest EWAS studies for <italic>any</italic> disease phenotype. Our study also includes the first within-case analysis of TRS yet performed, providing important molecular insights into genomic differences associated with poor outcome to standard therapeutic approaches. Our results highlight differences in measures of blood cellular composition and smoking behavior derived from methylomic data between not just cases and controls, but also between TRS patients prescribed clozapine and those prescribed alternative medications. We report widespread differences in DNA methylation in psychosis and schizophrenia, a subset of which are driven by the more severe treatment-resistant subset of patients. On a practical level, our study not¬†only¬†demonstrates the utility of DNA methylation data for deriving measures of specific physiological phenotypes (e.g., blood cell-type proportions) and environmental exposures (e.g., exposure to tobacco smoke) that can be used to identify epidemiological associations with health and disease, but also highlights the importance of properly controlling for these potential confounders in EWAS analyses. Our results are important because they suggest there are also clear molecular signatures of schizophrenia and psychosis that can be identified in whole blood DNA. Although it is unlikely these differences are mechanistically related to neuropathological changes in the brain, they may have utility as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in individuals with FEP and may potentially be used to differentiate individuals with TRS at an early stage of disease. Future work should aim to prospectively profile DNA methylation in individuals at risk for FEP and schizophrenia to explore how methylomic variation at baseline can predict outcome and the extent to which longitudinal changes at psychosis-associated DMPs map on to clinical trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cohort descriptions</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>University College London samples</title><p>Four hundred and forty-seven schizophrenia cases and 456 controls from the University College London schizophrenia sample cohort were selected for DNA methylation profiling.

To define physically distinct loci, those within 250 kb of each other were subsequently merged to obtain the final set of GWAS regions. The outermost SNPs of each associated region defined the start and stop parameters of the region. Using the set of 158 schizophrenia-associated genomic loci, we used Brown‚Äôs method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1975</xref>) to calculate a combined p-value across all probes located within each region (based on hg19) using the probe-level p-values and correlation coefficients between all pairs of probes calculated from the DNA methylation values. Briefly, correlation statistics were calculated and (along with the p-values) were inputted into Brown‚Äôs formula.

Where probes were not annotated to any gene (i.e., in the case of intergenic locations), they were omitted from this analysis, and where probes were annotated to multiple genes, all were included. A logistic regression approach was used to test if genes in this list predicted pathway membership, while controlling for the number of probes that passed quality control (i.e., were tested) annotated to each gene. Pathways were downloaded from the GO website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://geneontology.org/">http://geneontology.org/</ext-link>) and mapped to genes including all parent ontology terms. All genes with at least one 450K probe annotated and mapped to at least one GO pathway were considered. Pathways were filtered to those containing between 10 and 2000 genes. After applying this method to all pathways, the list of significant pathways (p&lt;0.05) was refined by grouping to control for the effect of overlapping genes. This was achieved by taking the most significant pathway and retesting all remaining significant pathways while controlling additionally for the best term. If the test genes no longer predicted the pathway, the term was said to be explained by the more significant pathway, and hence these pathways were grouped together. This algorithm was repeated, taking the next most significant term, until all pathways were considered as the most significant or found to be explained by a more significant term.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was primarily supported by grants from the UK Medical Research Council (MRC; MR/K013807/1 and MR/R005176/1) to JM.

marks in blood samples from over 4,000 individuals suffering from psychosis, schizophrenia and treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Evidence was presented suggesting this approach has future potential as a diagnostic tool to identify physiological and environmental exposure variables contributing to mental illness.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DNA methylation meta-analysis reveals cellular alterations in psychosis and markers of treatment-resistant schizophrenia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor. Together we have concluded that while the analysis seems to be carefully done and this is the largest report of its kind, the work is nonetheless lacking in impact due to the absence of any firm biological or clinical conclusions. The Editors are willing to consider your response to this criticism and request that the conclusions move beyond these associative findings, as well as the changes suggested by reviewers below. Please understand this is not an assurance that your manuscript will be considered acceptable upon revision. We ask you to consider carefully whether your report might be more suitable for a different journal</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is the largest study of DNA methylation differences in the blood of controls and patients with psychosis, performed in a sample of 4,483 participants. This is an important piece of work conducted to the highest standards of methodological rigour. By drawing together most case-control DNAm studies of schizophrenia in a single meta-analysis, this work will provide the most up-to-date information for some time, and is likely to generate a lot of interest.</p><p>As predictable, the authors found significant differences in measures of blood cell proportions and smoking exposure in patients with psychosis compared with controls, and in patients with schizophrenia with clozapine treatment compared with other patients. They also detected differentially methylated positions in such comparisons. The authors have employed an appropriate methodology to search for schizophrenia- and psychosis- associated methylation changes, and the manuscript is interesting and well-written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A more extensive analysis may increase our insight about DNA methylation differences in schizophrenia, and is therefore necessary.</p><p>1) An important question is whether the methylation differences are pre-existing the disorder or a consequence, an epiphenomenon of the disorder. The fact that the authors detect a higher number of DMPs when they exclude individuals with first episode psychosis from their analysis could suggest that the methylation differences are not present before the onset of the disorder. However, the authors have the resources and the ability to better answer this question. For example:</p><p>a) I think they should report in a separate section the results in the two samples of FEP individuals compared with age-matched controls. Can they identify any FEP-specific DMP?</p><p>b) Also, I think they could try to integrate their data with other blood methylation datasets, to see whether the DMPs associated with psychosis/schizophrenia have been associated with environmental risk factors associated with schizophrenia. For example, the authors could check the overlap of the DMPs with blood methylation changes associated with gestational age (PMID: 32114984; this work contains references to other studies that may be useful too). Data on methylation and cannabis or other environmental factors, if available, may be useful too.</p><p>c) The authors could also explore, in patients and controls, the relationship between age and methylation of the DMPs. An increase of the differences between patients and controls in older ages would suggest that the methylation differences are related to factors that are secondary to the disorders, while the presence of methylation differences at younger age could suggest the opposite. Analyzing the interaction between methylation and age on case-control status could be an alternative way to answer this question.</p><p>2) Sex is an important biological variable that the authors could analyze more extensively, considering that being male is a risk factor for schizophrenia, and is associated with a different epigenetic regulation. The authors have already the statistics to analyze whether the psychosis/schizophrenia-associated DMPs are also associated with sex. Moreover, they could analyze the interaction between methylation and sex on case-control status and/or perform analyses stratified by sex.</p><p>3) The authors did not find association of schizophrenia with age acceleration. However, a recent study has performed a comprehensive analysis of 14 epigenetic clocks categorized according to what they were trained to predict: chronological age, mortality, mitotic divisions, or telomere length. I think it is relevant that the authors try to validate and perhaps extend the findings of Higgis-Chen and coll. (&quot;Schizophrenia and Epigenetic Aging Biomarkers: Increased Mortality, Reduced Cancer Risk, and Unique Clozapine Effects&quot;, PMID: 32199607).</p><p>4) Adjustment: I have not found any clear information about ethnicity/race. I assume the samples were mainly composed by white Caucasians. Did the authors perform any adjustment for ethnicity/race or population stratification? Also, were principal component of negative control probes included as covariates?</p><p>5) Replication: was there any replication at the level of DMP in the data from Montano et al.? Also, if many DMPs are under genetic control, we should expect an overlap between DMPs in blood and brain of patients with schizophrenia. Have the authors analyzed such overlap?</p><p>6) I think the authors should be more cautious in interpreting the clozapine data. They write: &quot;Studies have also shown that higher neutrophil counts in schizophrenia patients correlate with a greater burden of positive symptoms (N√∫√±ez et al., 2019) suggesting that variations in the number of neutrophils is a potential marker of disease severity(Steiner et al., 2019). Our sub-analysis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which is associated with a higher number of positive symptoms (Bachmann et al., 2017), found that the increase in granulocytes was primary driven by those with the more severe phenotype, supporting this hypothesis.&quot; Actually, the fact that TRS cases are characterized by a significantly higher proportion of granulocytes could be related a &quot;recruitment bias&quot;: because clozapine administration is associated with a risk of agranulocytosis, clozapine is usually not prescribed to patients with low number of granulocytes. I think this possibility needs to be mentioned, unless the authors can exclude it.</p><p>7) The Abstract details the (unsurprising) smoking results but lacks other findings, such as the GO analysis and the localisation of findings to previously associated GWAS loci.</p><p>8) The authors could consider providing a DNAm-based predictor of SCZ/SCZ-resistance based on their dataset ‚Äì to be tested in a series of leave-one-out analyses. In my opinion, this would provide further interest in the results, provide evidence of replication somewhat lacking from the current version, and could be used by others to test for SCZ/TRS prediction in their cohorts or for the purpose of PheWAS.</p><p>9) There are a large number of findings reported with only a p-value given, and no effect size. In many cases, I think there's no reason that additional info couldn't be added.</p><p>10) It's not sufficiently clear in the text how the effects of SCZ were disambiguated from TRS ‚Äì when the latter group is nested within the first.</p><p>11) Whether DNAm is a cause or consequence of liability to SCZ could be further examined in the paper ‚Äì and I'm not sure why the authors have stopped short of further MR-based tests of this question.</p><p>12) The correction for smoking is somewhat heterogeneous across studies (‚Äúsmoking status‚Äù). If they were current non-smokers, was this recent? Further examination of whether reporting findings attenuate after inclusion of AHRR CpGs would provide greater confidence that some are not due to residual confounding. Alcohol and BMI are also likely to give rise to similar issues.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;DNA methylation meta-analysis reveals cellular alterations in psychosis and markers of treatment-resistant schizophrenia&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Huda Zoghbi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The original submission was recognized as the largest study of DNA methylation differences in the blood of controls and patients with psychosis and was considered an important piece of work but the impact was lessened by many of the observed changes being predictable and due to secondary factors such as smoking or medication. A further weakness was the lack of a clear biological or clinical association with the methylation changes observed.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors are asked to highlight in the Discussion what they believe is the main take-home message of the manuscript. For example, what does this meta-analysis tell us about schizophrenia that we did not know before? or about the potential use of DNA methylation in clinical study? If there are no big answers, what should be the next step forward in studying the epigenetic of schizophrenia? Because this paper is the largest meta-analysis on blood DNA methylation in schizophrenia, these sort of conclusions are expected.</p><p>2) Some additional limitations should be mentioned. For example, the interaction of DNA methylation with age and sex was analyzed only for the schizophrenia-associated DMPs (which does not exclude that there could be other methylation differences associated with schizophrenia only in males or females among the remaining positions). Ignoring the possibility that genotype may interact with methylation could be another limitation of current EWASs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58430.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A more extensive analysis may increase our insight about DNA methylation differences in schizophrenia, and is therefore necessary.</p><p>1) An important question is whether the methylation differences are pre-existing the disorder or a consequence, an epiphenomenon of the disorder.

To address this, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis of DNAm differences associated with first episode psychosis (FEP) in the IoPPN and EU-GEI cohorts (total n: 698 FEP cases and 724 controls), meta-analysing the results across 384,217 common DNAm sites. We identified no significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) after stringently correcting for multiple testing, although this is not surprising given the greatly attenuated sample size (compared to the full schizophrenia meta-analysis), and the fact that the FEP group is likely to be more heterogeneous compared to the diagnosed SZ case group; both these factors negatively influence power to detect effects.</p><p>Despite the lack of experiment-wide significant differences amongst these results, they still have potential value for interpreting our SZ-associated DMPs. To facilitate this analysis, we repeated our EWAS of diagnosed SZ, excluding the IoPPN cohort to ensure that there were no overlapping samples between the SZ vs control analysis and the FEP vs control analysis. This analysis identified 125 significant DMPs, of which 101 were also tested in the FEP EWAS. To see if there was any evidence for differential DNAm at these sites prior to a diagnosis of SZ, we compared the estimated differences between SZ cases and controls and FEP cases and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Strikingly, 96 (95.0%) of the tested DMPs had a consistent direction of effect in the FEP EWAS, a significantly higher rate than expected by chance (P = 6.58 x10<sup>-23</sup>). While this observation is consistent with SZ-associated differences being present prior to diagnosis, it is not sufficient to state that they are causal; they may still reflect some underlying environmental risk factor or be a consequence of FEP (e.g. medication exposure). We believe these results are interesting and have added them to the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of effect sizes from an EWAS of diagnosed SZ (x-axis) and FEP (y-axis) for SZ-associated DMPs.</title><p>Shown is the mean difference (% DNAm) between cases and controls.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58430-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Also, I think they could try to integrate their data with other blood methylation datasets, to see whether the DMPs associated with psychosis/schizophrenia have been associated with environmental risk factors associated with schizophrenia.

Across studies undertaken using blood DNA (isolated from whole blood or cord blood) there were 101,091 significant DMPs (at P &lt; 10<sup>-7</sup>) associated with 87 traits. Of the 1,048 specific DMPs associated with SZ in our meta-analysis, 219 (20.9%) were present in the database and significantly associated with 18 different traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>). Where effect sizes were available, we counted the number of DMPs for which the direction of effect was consistent and used a binomial test to see if there was a significant bias. Interestingly, we found that age associated DMPs overlapping with SZ associated DMPs were enriched for sites with a discordant direction of effect, as were those associated with HDL (Figure 6). In contrast, SZ DMPs also associated with CRP and gestational age had a higher rate of concordance than expected. If SZ-associated differences at these sites reflect exposure to these factors then we might anticipate a dose dependent relationship and a notable correlation in the magnitude of effect. For CRP and HDL we do indeed see a strong correlation between the magnitudes of effect, with weaker correlations for gestational age and age (Figure 6). Likewise, of the 95 DMPs associated with psychosis in our meta-analysis, 39 (41.1%) were present in the database and significantly associated with 11 traits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable2">Author response table 2</xref>). Unlike for SZ, however, none of these DMPs shared with these traits were significantly enriched for a concordant/discordant direction of effect. These results for the schizophrenia overlaps have been added to the revised manuscript.</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary

As requested by the reviewers we have investigated whether there is any evidence of age specific SZ-associated differences in DNA methylation. To do this we took the 1,048 SZ-associated DMPs and refitted our analysis model using an additional interaction term between age and schizophrenia status. This analysis was done individually for each cohort prior to the interaction effects being meta-analysed using a random effects model as described in our original manuscript. Overall, we found limited evidence for a relationship between age and DNAm at SZ-associated DMPs; controlling for multiple testing (P &lt; 0.00004771), only two (0.002%) DNAm sites were identified as showing a significant interaction with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). However, given the differences in ages between cases and controls in some cohorts, it is plausible that our dataset is not optimal for addressing this question. Although we think that the lack of significant effect here should not be interpreted as an absence of an effect, these results have now been added to the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Limited evidence for a relationship between age and DNAm at SZ-associated DMPs.</title><p>Shown is a histogram of ‚Äìlog10(p-values) for the interaction term between age and schizophrenia status across all 1,048 SZ-associated DMPs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58430-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Sex is an important biological variable that the authors could analyze more extensively, considering that being male is a risk factor for schizophrenia, and is associated with a different epigenetic regulation.

Moreover, they could analyze the interaction between methylation and sex on case-control status and/or perform analyses stratified by sex.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another interesting suggestion. As requested by the reviewers we have investigated whether there is any influence of sex on DNAm across the set of SZ-associated DMPs. To do this we took the 1,048 sites associated with SZ and refitted our analysis model with an additional interaction term between sex and schizophrenia status. This analysis was done within each cohort prior to the interaction effects being meta-analysed using a random effects model as described in our original manuscript. We found no evidence that there was any influence of sex on DNAm at these sites, and none of the sites were associated with a significant interaction (P &lt; 0.00004771) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Limited evidence for a relationship between sex and DNAm at SZ-associated DMPs.</title><p>Shown is a histogram of ‚Äìlog10(p-values) for the interaction term between sex and schizophrenia status across all 1,048 SZ-associated DMPs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58430-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors did not find association of schizophrenia with age acceleration. However, a recent study has performed a comprehensive analysis of 14 epigenetic clocks categorized according to what they were trained to predict: chronological age, mortality, mitotic divisions, or telomere length. I think it is relevant that the authors try to validate and perhaps extend the findings of Higgis-Chen and coll. (&quot;Schizophrenia and Epigenetic Aging Biomarkers: Increased Mortality, Reduced Cancer Risk, and Unique Clozapine Effects&quot;, PMID: 32199607).</p></disp-quote><p>Several of the datasets included in our meta-analysis have already been studied in detail with regard to elevated epigenetic aging (e.g. Kowalec et al., Translational Psychiatry, PMID: 31164630; Wu wt al, Schizophrenia Bulletin, PMID: 33269797) and a meta-analysis of epigenetic aging using a range of clocks in &gt;1,100 cases and 1,200 controls from this study is currently in review and available as a preprint on bioRxiv (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/727859v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/727859v1</ext-link>). Given that the current manuscript already includes a detailed analysis of DNAmAge and PhenoAge across all cohorts ‚Äì the largest single analysis of accelerated aging in schizophrenia to date ‚Äì and finds no evidence for any accelerated epigenetic aging, we believe that an analysis across 14 additional epigenetic clocks would be beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Our data is freely-available for anyone who is interested in testing the large (and expanding) number of additional clock algorithms available in the literature. It is worth noting that there are some important limitations to the use of epigenetic clocks to assess accelerated biological aging, especially in older samples (for example, see El Khoury et al., Genome Biology, PMID: 31847916).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Adjustment: I have not found any clear information about ethnicity/race. I assume the samples were mainly composed by white Caucasians. Did the authors perform any adjustment for ethnicity/race or population stratification? Also, were principal component of negative control probes included as covariates?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if we did not provide enough detail about the ethnicity/race of samples included in the study. With the exception of the IoPPN and EU-GEI cohorts, which had some ethnic heterogeneity, the reviewer is correct that the samples profiled in this study were predominantly Caucasian. To illustrate this, we have now used the genetic data available for each sample to explore ethnicity using genetic principal components (PCs) incorporating data from the HapMap project (Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2). To explore whether ethnicity influences our results, we reanalyzed data from individual cohorts including increasing numbers of genetic PCs to our model. Even in the most ethnically diverse cohort (IoPPN) the inclusion of genetic PCs made very limited difference to the results and there was a very strong correlation between models (Figure 4‚Äîfigure supplement 1). These details have been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Replication: was there any replication at the level of DMP in the data from Montano et al.? Also, if many DMPs are under genetic control, we should expect an overlap between DMPs in blood and brain of patients with schizophrenia. Have the authors analyzed such overlap?</p></disp-quote><p>It was a great suggestion to explore overlap between our findings and those from Montano et al., and we have undertaken additional analyses to explore this. Of note, the raw data and full results tables were not available for this study, so we were somewhat limited in the scope of what was possible. First, our results for cell composition differences are consistent with those reported in Montano et al. (i.e. higher proportions of monocytes and granulocytes and lower proportions of CD8 T-cells) although we also report additional differences in CD4 T-cells and natural killer cells. Second, two of our SZ-associated DMPs (cg00390724 and cg09868768) overlapped with the 172 replicated DMPs reported by Montano et al., with the same direction of effect. As the results for the full dataset were not available, we could not check for overall consistency of direction of effect of our SZ-associated DMPs, although we were able to explore whether our results replicated theirs. Comparing the estimated mean difference between cases and controls for the 172 replicated DMPs reported by Montano et al., we were able to test 167 of these in our data; of note, 119 of these showed the sample direction of effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>), which is a significantly higher rate than expected by chance (P = 3,83x10-8).</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of results from our EWAS meta-analysis with those for 167 replicated SZ-associated DMPs identified by Montano et al.</title><p>Overall there is a significant enrichment of consistent results between the analyses for these DMPs.

While it is true that genetic effects mediate inter-individual correlations between blood and brain, it does not follow that all genetic effects are conserved between tissues. However, to explore the reviewer‚Äôs comment about overlap between blood and brain DMPs, we first leveraged data from our previous study quantifying covariation in DNAm between blood and different brain regions using matched tissue samples (Hannon et al., Epigenetics, PMID: 26457534) to investigate whether our DMPs are likely to be mirrored in brain. Using matched blood and prefrontal cortex (PFC) data we found that of the 1,048 SZ-associated DMPs, no DMPs were characterized by a correlation in DNAm between blood and cortex of &gt; 0.8, only 5 were characterized by a correlation &gt; 0.5, and 100 were characterized by a correlation &gt; 0.2. Second, we performed a direct comparison of our blood based EWAS results with those from a meta-analysis of PFC EWAS datasets (Viana et al., Human Molecular Genetics, PMID: 28011714). Our PFC study is much smaller than our blood meta-analysis and relatively underpowered to detect a large number of true positives; therefore, we explored whether there was any evidence of consistency in our results by comparing the estimated mean differences between schizophrenia cases and controls across both tissues. This analysis showed that 627 of the 1,042 DMPs tested in both analyses had the same direction of effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>), a significantly higher rate than expected by chance (P = 5.43x10-11).</p><fig id="sa2fig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Comparison of results from our EWAS meta-analysis (x-axis) with those identified in an analysis of human PFC (y-axis).</title><p>Overall there is a significant enrichment of consistent results between the analyses for SZ-associated DMPs.

They write: &quot;Studies have also shown that higher neutrophil counts in schizophrenia patients correlate with a greater burden of positive symptoms (N√∫√±ez et al., 2019) suggesting that variations in the number of neutrophils is a potential marker of disease severity(Steiner et al., 2019). Our sub-analysis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which is associated with a higher number of positive symptoms (Bachmann et al., 2017), found that the increase in granulocytes was primary driven by those with the more severe phenotype, supporting this hypothesis.&quot; Actually, the fact that TRS cases are characterized by a significantly higher proportion of granulocytes could be related a &quot;recruitment bias&quot;: because clozapine administration is associated with a risk of agranulocytosis, clozapine is usually not prescribed to patients with low number of granulocytes. I think this possibility needs to be mentioned, unless the authors can exclude it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our analyses of schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine need to be interpreted carefully and highlight strongly in the discussion that we can‚Äôt separate the effects of clozapine exposure from environmental effects or confounders related to the subset of patients that are treatment resistant. However, the reviewer highlights an important bias that we had not considered and we have now added this caveat to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Abstract details the (unsurprising) smoking results but lacks other findings, such as the GO analysis and the localisation of findings to previously associated GWAS loci.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some additional details to the Abstract as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors could consider providing a DNAm-based predictor of SCZ/SCZ-resistance based on their dataset ‚Äì to be tested in a series of leave-one-out analyses. In my opinion, this would provide further interest in the results, provide evidence of replication somewhat lacking from the current version, and could be used by others to test for SCZ/TRS prediction in their cohorts or for the purpose of PheWAS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the development of an epigenetic ‚Äúpredictor‚Äù for SZ based on our results is interesting ‚Äì as stated in our Discussion ‚Äì but believe it to be beyond the scope of the current analysis, especially given the large number of analyses and results already presented in the manuscript. Furthermore, a number of papers on this subject using overlapping data from the current study have been published (e.g., Chen et al., 2020), and a large analysis across multiple datasets has been submitted for publication by our collaborators. Finally, we are wary that there are some important caveats to such an analysis; given the very different characteristics of the cohorts included in our meta-analysis it is not obvious how to train such a predictor and what the results of the model would mean in any given individual cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) There are a large number of findings reported with only a p-value given, and no effect size. In many cases, I think there's no reason that additional info couldn't be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and have now included these in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It's not sufficiently clear in the text how the effects of SCZ were disambiguated from TRS ‚Äì when the latter group is nested within the first.</p></disp-quote><p>To separate out effects associated with SZ from effects associated with TRS, we fitted a multiple regression model with two binary indicator variables: one that identified the SZ patients and a second that identified the TRS patients. Within each cohort, DNA methylation values for each probe were regressed against these two binary variables, with covariates for age, sex, cell composition, smoking status, and batch as described for the other EWAS. This analysis was only possible for the four cohorts that were included in the TRS EWAS (UCL, Aberdeen, IoPPN and Sweden), and the results from these cohorts were then meta-analysed together, separately for the results for the two binary indicator terms. The inclusion of these two dummy variables allowed us to separately estimate differences associated with all schizophrenia cases and differences only associated with TRS cases. We realise now that we had omitted a description of this analysis from the Materials and methods section of the manuscript; we apologize for this oversight and this has now been rectified in the resubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Whether DNAm is a cause or consequence of liability to SCZ could be further examined in the paper ‚Äì and I'm not sure why the authors have stopped short of further MR-based tests of this question.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the dynamic nature of the epigenome, it is clear that the differences we report could be either causal or a consequences of having SZ. The analyses of FEP discussed above are one approach to explore this. While MR has been proposed as a method for testing causal pathways between DNAm and an outcome, it is only possible for sites that are robustly associated with genetic variation. As reported in the manuscript only 256 (24.4%) of the SZ-associated DMPs have an associated mQTL, meaning if we were to apply an MR analysis this would only be possible for a small proportion of our results. Furthermore, the genetic effects at these sites are small, so the power to perform this MR is likely insufficient to draw any meaningful conclusions. In truth we anticipate that many of the associations we report will result from either environmental risk factors for schizophrenia/psychosis or the consequences of having disease (e.g. medication exposure). This is why one of the strengths of our study is the analysis of TRS cases, which enabled us to determine which of the reported DMPs might be driven by medication. We have expanded our discussion about causality in the Discussion section of the manuscript to further address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The correction for smoking is somewhat heterogeneous across studies (‚Äúsmoking status‚Äù). If they were current non-smokers, was this recent? Further examination of whether reporting findings attenuate after inclusion of AHRR CpGs would provide greater confidence that some are not due to residual confounding. Alcohol and BMI are also likely to give rise to similar issues.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, the correction for smoking status was consistent across all samples. As described, we used a quantitative smoking score derived from the DNAm data as a covariate in each of the EWAS analyses presented. For samples where self-reported smoking data was also available, there was a highly significant difference in the DNAm-derived smoking score between smokers and non-smokers. The smoking score itself includes sites annotated to AHRR and other genes strongly associated with exposure to tobacco smoke, and so these would have been controlled for in the analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors are asked to highlight in the Discussion what they believe is the main take-home message of the manuscript. For example, what does this meta-analysis tell us about schizophrenia that we did not know before? or about the potential use of DNA methylation in clinical study? If there are no big answers, what should be the next step forward in studying the epigenetic of schizophrenia? Because this paper is the largest meta-analysis on blood DNA methylation in schizophrenia, these sort of conclusions are expected.</p><p>2) Some additional limitations should be mentioned. For example, the interaction of DNA methylation with age and sex was analyzed only for the schizophrenia-associated DMPs (which does not exclude that there could be other methylation differences associated with schizophrenia only in males or females among the remaining positions). Ignoring the possibility that genotype may interact with methylation could be another limitation of current EWASs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are delighted by the overall positive feedback on our revised manuscript, which was ‚Äú‚Ä¶recognized as the largest study of DNA methylation differences in the blood of controls and patients with psychosis and considered an important piece of work‚Ä¶‚Äù.</p><p>We were asked to add two sections to the Discussion section before the paper could be accepted for publication. As requested, we have added a final paragraph describing more succinctly the key take-home message of the paper.
