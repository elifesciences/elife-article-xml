Making such a choice requires assigning options with subjective values that can be updated through learned experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hare et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glimcher and Fehr, 2013</xref>). In such a framework, storing and updating values for every potential option separately would be computationally taxing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seger and Miller, 2010</xref>). Instead, it is beneficial for the brain to maintain overlapping sensory representations, which would allow options to be grouped downstream into categories based on sensory similarity and assigned with common values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Seger, 2008</xref>). Such a coding-scheme would allow animals to distinguish between options in different categories and perform appropriate behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kudryavitskaya et al., 2021</xref>). For example, the most adaptive response when faced with a choice is to pick the highest value stimulus, taking into account the values of available alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glimcher and Fehr, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayden, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017</xref>). However, this scheme would not readily allow for distinguishing between two options from the same category. It is therefore essential in such a coding-scheme that category boundaries be flexible. One prominent hypothesis suggests that animals directly compare the values of the available stimuli and make use of this relative value signal to guide flexible categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Itti and Koch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carello and Krauzlis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mysore and Knudsen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mysore et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we ask how this flexibility arises and identify neural correlates of stimulus comparison in the relatively simple learning and memory circuitry of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body.</p><p>This flexibility can be studied by examining how animals use an associative memory in two different tasks: discrimination and generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackintosh, 1974</xref>). In a discrimination task, the animal has to choose between a cue associated with reward and a second cue that could either be similar to (hard discrimination) or distinct (easy discrimination) from the original cue. In the generalization task, the flies have to choose between a cue that is perceptually similar to the trained cue and a cue that is very different. The correct choice in this task depends on the animal generalizing its learned response to the similar cue. So the response to the perceptually similar cue differs between the two tasks – the animal chooses it when generalizing and chooses against it when discriminating. Despite the need to switch choices, performance can be extremely high on both these types of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen and Gerber, 2014</xref>), suggesting that comparisons between available alternatives have a strong impact on animals’ behavioral responses.</p><p>We employed these paradigms using aversive olfactory conditioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as its well-studied memory circuit provides a strong framework to understand the neural basis of flexible categorization. Olfactory learning takes place in the mushroom body (MB), where odors are represented by sparse activity patterns of the 2000 intrinsic neurons termed Kenyon cells (KCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>). Although different odor response patterns are largely uncorrelated, chemically similar odors can elicit partly overlapping patterns of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). These sensory representations are converted into value-representing memory traces that guide behavioral outputs downstream of the KCs, at the synapses that they form with MB output neurons (MBONs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Villar et al., 2022</xref>). These ~30 distinct MBONs form compartments that integrate input from different subsets of KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Strausfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, these synapses are plastic and primarily undergo depression as flies learn an olfactory association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Séjourné et al., 2011</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Plaçais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2022</xref>). This plasticity is mediated by dopaminergic neurons (DANs) that convey information about reward or punishment and arborize in corresponding compartments as the MBONs forming a series of DAN-MBON modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>The degree to which KC response patterns overlap has been shown to drive the specificity of learning and resulting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). During learning, synapses from odor-activated KCs to specific MBONs are depressed. A similar odor with an overlapping KC response pattern thus also exhibits a reduced synaptic drive onto the same MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2018</xref>). The greater the overlap, the more extensive the depression of this other odor’s activation of the MBONs, and the greater the generalization. In contrast, when overlap is low, downstream MBON activity is minimally affected and the animal discriminates between the two cues. Although this model has a lot of explanatory power, it does not include a means for explicitly comparing between available options. A comparison would allow for the estimation of a relative value between the available options and explain the high performance of flies in both generalization and discrimination tasks. The explanatory framework must therefore move beyond the idea of overlap in sensory representations.</p><p>In this study, we combined neural activity measurements with behavioral experiments, to expand our understanding of flexible categorization. We observed that flies could achieve high levels of performance for both discrimination and generalization tasks and identified a single MB compartment capable of supporting both. Surprisingly, MBON responses in this compartment showed no measurable stimulus-specificity to simple pulses of the two similar odors we used, despite being able to distinguish them behaviorally. However, when we presented odors in sequence, one transitioning immediately into the other, similar to what flies experience in the behavioral task, we found that MBON responses to these odors were clearly distinct. These findings show that MBON activity is modulated by a temporal comparison of the alternatives presented to the fly, allowing for switches in the categorization of odor stimuli. Importantly, KC representations did not show categorization switching to either simple stimuli or transitions suggesting the involvement of downstream mechanisms. Moreover, behavioral experiments showed that these comparisons are made when stimuli are experienced close together in time. Both imaging and behavior provide complementary evidence that comparing available alternatives ‘side-by-side’ in time is important for flexible categorization.These results show that the MB circuit implements a comparison, augmenting small differences between overlapping sensory representations to guide flexible stimulus categorization and choice behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Precision of memory recall depends on MB compartment</title><p>Previous work has shown that flies are capable of high levels of performance on both hard discrimination and generalization tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>). This study identified a trio of odors to use for experiments on the specificity of memory, based on the degree of overlap of KC response patterns: pentyl acetate (PA) butyl acetate (BA) and ethyl lactate (EL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). PA and BA are chemically similar and elicit highly overlapping response patterns in the KC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>). EL is distinct, both chemically and in terms of KC response patterns. Choices between different combinations of these cues can be used to test flies’ ability to flexibly classify odors and measure memory specificity. Take, for example, an experiment where flies are trained to form an association with PA. We can present flies with a difficult discrimination task by giving them a choice between the similar odors (PA and BA), or an easy discrimination with a choice between the paired odor (PA) and the dissimilar odor (EL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). We can also test whether the association with PA generalizes to the similar odor BA, by giving flies a choice between BA and EL. Since we use these odors in many different combinations for different task structures, with and without reciprocal design, here we will use A to refer to the paired odor (PA or BA) and A’ to refer to the other similar odor, which is unpaired, while B always refers to the dissimilar odor, EL. With this nomenclature, hard discrimination involves an A versus A’ choice, easy discrimination is A versus B and generalization is A’ versus B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A single set of changed synapses can result in generalization or discrimination.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Chemical structures of the three odors used in the study, the similar odors butyl acetate (BA) and pentyl acetate (PA) and the dissimilar odor ethyl lactate (EL).

Consequently the synaptic changes responsible were likely distributed across many areas of the mushroom body, and possibly elsewhere. To confine plasticity to a more restricted region of the brain, we used optogenetic reinforcement, pairing the activation of specific DANs with odor presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Claridge-Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>). We used drivers to express CSChrimson in specific DANs from the PPL1 cluster that target different compartments involved in aversion learning: α3 (MB630B) and γ2α’1 (MB296B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>). Since compartments have different time courses for memory acquisition and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>), the number of repetitions of odor-reinforcement pairing and the time between training and testing differed depending on the compartment tested (see Methods).</p><p>We found that these two compartments exhibited contrasting properties in the easy and hard discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Flies that received reinforcement from DAN PPL1-α3 were poor at the hard discrimination, although they performed significantly better on the easy task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, p=0.007, n=12). On the other hand, flies that received optogenetic reinforcement via DAN PPL1-γ2α’1 performed the hard discrimination as effectively as the easy discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, p=0.08, n=12). Empty driver controls performed no better than chance at either easy or hard discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, p=0.052, p=0.38, n=12). These results show that these two compartments have different capacities for discrimination, with α3 weakly discriminating and γ2α’1 stronger.</p><p>The difference in ability to support fine discrimination between these two compartments raises the question of whether and how they differ in a generalization task. In a simple model where performance reflects overlap between the test stimulus and the trained odor, the harder the discrimination, the easier the generalization. Does the weakly discriminating α3 compartment support strong performance on generalization, while the strongly discriminating γ2α’1 compartment does not? Or does the γ2α’1 compartment somehow have the flexibility to support strong performance on both tasks?</p><p>We tested this by examining relative performance on generalization and easy discrimination tasks in these two compartments. We kept a parallel structure between the two types of tasks by quantifying performance against control experiments where optogenetic stimulation was delivered unpaired to odor delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; see Methods; note that since these experiments did not have reciprocal controls the performance scores in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref> are computed differently than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). As expected, training flies using DAN PPL1-α3 yielded similarly high performance on both generalization and easy discrimination tasks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, p=0.84, n=12), while empty driver controls performed no better than chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, p=0.052, p=0.91, n=12).

These results show that the way the animal experiences the odors has a significant effect on how differentially the downstream MBON-γ2α’1 responds to them.</p><p>To further evaluate whether this effect contributes to hard discrimination, we next examined the effects of plasticity on odor transition responses in MBON-α3. Reinforcement in this compartment does not support fine discrimination, so if the transition effect is important for discrimination, it should be absent here.</p><p>α3 is a slow-learning compartment; when an odor is paired with reinforcement via DAN PPL1-α3, behavioral performance gradually rises until it peaks 24 hr after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>). To examine MBON responses when behavioral performance is at this peak, we could not use on-rig optogenetic reinforcement. Instead, we trained flies in a behavior chamber, by pairing an odor with a shock reinforcement. We retrieved flies from the arena and imaged MBON-α3 responses 20–28 hr after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, detailed protocol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This experimental approach did not permit us to measure pre- and post-training responses in the same fly. So in these experiments, we compared responses observed in trained flies with those in a mock-trained cohort, where shock was delivered at a different time than odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We note that optogenetic reinforcement was not possible for experiments targeting the α3 compartment; despite extensive efforts we were unable to identify LexA driver lines either with sufficient strength to image MBON-α3 activity, or to get effective reinforcement selectively via DAN PPL1-α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>We found that in response to odor transitions, there was no modulation in MBON-α3 responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Responses to the second odor in the transition were depressed for both transition orders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; A’-A, p&lt;0.001, A-A’, p&lt;0.001, pooled n=14 PA-paired and n=12 BA-paired flies). As expected, responses to the dissimilar odor (B) showed no significant depression (p=0.48). We also evaluated odor boundary detection post-training by computing a contrast score as we did for MBON-γ2α’1. With MBON-α3, we saw very little contrast at the transition point, and contrast was similarly low for either order of the transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <italic>P</italic>=0.86).</p><p>Mimicking the fly’s experience in the behavioral arena by presenting odor transitions revealed a strong concordance between neural activity and behavior. In MBON-γ2α’1, when odors are presented in isolation, responses to A and A’ were not measurably different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This would allow flies to generalize learning between these odors in most circumstances. But when the two similar odors are juxtaposed in time, matching what they experience when making a choice, MBON-γ2α’1 responses were clearly distinct and could support fine discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The ability of MBON-γ2α’1 to respond differently in these two conditions likely reflects the flexible categorization that enables flies to perform both generalization and discrimination. In agreement with this hypothesis, the effect of odor transitions is absent in the α3 compartment, which does not support fine discrimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Odor transition effects on MBONs are not present in the KCs</title><p>We have shown that MBON-γ2α’1 responses show a stimulus-history dependent modulation at odor transitions, but MBON-α3 does not.

We attempted to use the KC activity patterns we measured to reproduce our observations of MBON activity. Specifically, we used logistic regression models, adjusting the weights of KC inputs so that model outputs were low for A and A’ and high for B. To match the training procedure the flies experienced, we first trained the models using isolated odor pulses, and tested predictions for odor transition stimuli. To ensure we did not penalize cells that responded uniquely to transitions, weights were initialized at 1 and we trained models without any weight regularization. Trained weights were negatively correlated with responses to A, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top, Pearson correlation coefficient for γ KCs = - 0.39, α’/β’ = - 0.28 and α/β = - 0.22).

Further, since MBON-γ2α’1 signals positive valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>), our activity measurements predict that flies might be attracted to A’ if they encounter an A to A’ transition. To test these predictions, we examined behavioral responses to temporal sequences of odor, converting the spatial odor border flies encountered in our earlier behavioral experiments, into an odor transition in time. Flies were trained in the circular arena, and then tested by flooding the entire arena with a sequence of odor pulses. We then compared their behavioral response to direct odor transitions to their response when we interrupted the transition with 25 s of clean air. We determined the timing of odor pulse transitions using photo-ionization detector measurements at the exhaust outlet of the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and analyzed fly behavior around these timepoints.</p><p>Attraction to an odor was quantified by how much the flies move upwind; in the arena odors flow inwards from the periphery so we measured displacement away from the center of the arena.

Learning-related synaptic plasticity resulted in depressed neuronal responses to both similar odors when presented in isolation, consistent with strong behavioral generalization. However, when the odors were presented sequentially, as at an odor boundary, neuronal responses to A and A’ were distinct. Moreover, behavioral experiments with carefully timed odor delivery showed that flies’ response to A’ was distinct from A only if they were delivered in a transition. These results demonstrate how presenting cues as a choice can influence behavioral responses.

This could serve as the basis for differences in discrimination we observe between compartments, with optogenetic training in γ2α’1 but not α3 capable of supporting hard discrimination. However, we found that all three major subtypes of KCs exhibit similar levels of overlap across our odor test set. Furthermore, we found that odor representations in all three KC subtypes contain enough information for A-A’ discrimination. Despite this, when we examined KC responses to odor transitions, we found that they could not account for the odor-transition responses we observed in MBON-γ2α’1.</p><p>Another factor that could potentially contribute to the different specificity in these compartments are the numbers of KC inputs.

In particular we observe that flies make a temporal comparison of inputs and identify the underlying neural implementation of comparison in the MB. Prior work has shown history-dependent effects at multiple layers of the olfactory circuit. For example, in the rodent olfactory bulb, responses to odor sequences are linear combinations of the responses to individual pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, in locusts, presenting odors singly or in transitions altered odor representations non-linearly in KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Broome et al., 2006</xref>). The extent of response alteration correlated with the accuracy of behavioral recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saha et al., 2013</xref>).

In another locust study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nizampatnam et al., 2018</xref>), presenting an odor in a transition altered its representation to enhance contrast in the locust antennal lobe glomeruli. These observations suggest that changes in response to transitioning stimuli are mediated by a mechanism that takes place early on in the olfactory circuit. However, our observations of KC activity indicate that, although KCs response patterns to an odor presented as a single pulse versus in a transition are distinct, they are not sufficiently so to generate the sequence-specific transition effect we observe here.</p><p>We suggest instead that flexible categorization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> involves a mechanism at or downstream of the KC-MBON synapses modified during learning.

Ongoing motor activity can also affect dopaminergic inputs along the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>).

One mechanism that could satisfy these criteria, would involve an explicit comparison of MBON activities in time, much like the delay-lines in the auditory pathways of owls and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schöneich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sullivan and Konishi, 1986</xref>). This could be implemented via a downstream neuron that receives a real-time and a delayed copy of MBON-γ2α’1 activity, which then provides a positive feed-back signal to the MBON to amplify small increases in activity. Both of these motifs have been observed in the EM connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2020</xref>). As the extent of depression of KC &gt;MBON synapses is inevitably slightly weaker for any odor that overlaps imperfectly with the learned odor, this mechanism would sensitize the circuit to small differences in MBON activity that arise around an odor transition. Another class of mechanisms centers on the observation that the KC population exhibits a distinct pattern of responses to odor offset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lüdke et al., 2018</xref>). Offset responses in other MBONs can be potentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vrontou et al., 2021</xref>), presumably due to the timing of reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Handler et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting a similar mechanism might operate in MBON-γ2α’1 to augment responses to the second odor in a transition. An additional candidate mechanism is plasticity of inhibitory input to KCs from the APL neuron. Activity of this inhibitory neuron is reduced by training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu and Davis, 2009</xref>), so when a non-overlapping set of KCs is activated at an odor transition, that excitation may more effectively drive the downstream MBON. Inhibition at odor offset is a particularly prominent feature of the α’/β’ KCs that are input to MBON-γ2α’1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inada et al., 2017</xref>), so this effect could act in combination with potentiation of KC offset responses to create pronounced changes in KC output at an odor transition. Future work will be needed to resolve these different possibilities.</p><p>Many animals use a stored memory to support different behaviors based on the choices available to them. We have shown that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this response flexibility relies on comparing cues side by side in time. Making fine-grained distinctions is easier when a temporal comparison is possible, but when it is not, more generalized categorizations can be an adaptive default.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were raised on standard cornmeal food at 21 °C at 60% relative humidity on standard cornmeal food on a 12–12 hr light-dark cycle.

Starved females were trained and tested at 25 °C at 50% relative humidity in a dark circular arena described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>. The arena consisted of a circular chamber surrounded by four odor delivery ports that divide the chamber into quadrants. The input flow rate through each port was 100 mL/min, which was actively vented out a central exhaust at 400 mL/min. Odors were pentyl acetate, butyl acetate and ethyl lactate (Sigma-Aldrich product numbers 109584, 287725, and W244015 respectively).

Images were acquired using a 20 x, NA 1.0, water-immersion objective lens XLUMPLFLN (Olympus, Japan) and a GaAsP PMT H11706P-40 SEL (Hamamatsu, Japan). Power after the objective ranged from 4 to 5 mW for MBON imaging and 4–7 mW for KC imaging, depending on the preparation. Microscope control and data acquisition ran on the Scanimage platform (Vidrio, USA). Frames were acquired at 30 Hz, but three frames at a time were averaged during acquisition, for a final frame rate of 10 Hz. For KC imaging, pixels were sampled at 0.22 μm/pixel and for MBON imaging, at 0.18 μm/pixel. For photostimulation, flies were fully illuminated from beneath with 617 nm light through a liquid light-guide (LLG-03-59-340-0800-2, Mightex, USA) butt-coupled to an LED light source (GCS-0617–04 A0510, Mightex, USA). Intensity at the fly was 1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. LED pulses were delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz, with a duty-cycle of 50%, for 5 s, starting 2 s after paired-odor onset.</p><p>For optogenetics imaging experiments, crosses were set on food supplemented with 0.4 mM all-trans-retinal, and maintained on the same food at 25 ° C until flies were used for experiments. Flies were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>). Three- to 8-day-old female flies were immobilized in a 0.25 mm thick stainless-steel sheet with a photo-chemically etched tear-drop shaped hole (PhotoFab, UK) and glued into place with two-component epoxy (Devcon, USA). For imaging in the KC somata and the MBON dendrites, head angle was adjusted differently to give best optical access to the target region, taking care to keep the antennae dry beneath the metal plate. For KC and MBON α3 imaging, the back of the head was submerged in Ringer’s bath solution consisting in mM: NaCl, 103; KCl, 3; CaCl2, 1.5; MgCl2, 4; NaHCO3, 26; N-tris(hydroxymethyl) methyl-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid, 5; NaH2PO4, 1; trehalose, 10; glucose, 10 (pH 7.3, 275 mOsm). For γ2α’1 MBON experiments, the flies were starved (24 hours in nutrient-free, distilled-water agarose vials). Previous studies have shown that hemolymph sugar is halved in flies starved for 24 hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dus et al., 2011</xref>). So we used bath Ringer’s where glucose and trehalose were halved to 5 mM each and the non-metabolizable sugar arabinose (10 mM) was substituted to maintain osmolarity. For KC imaging, once the brain was exposed, bath solution was momentarily aspirated away and the preparation was covered in a drop of 5% (w/v) agarose (Cambrex Nusieve, catalog #50080) in Ringer’s, cooled to 36 ° C, which was then flattened with a 5 mm diameter circular coverslip that was then removed just prior to imaging.</p><p>For KC imaging, 8 repeats of single odor pulses and each kind of odor transition were delivered with an inter trial interval of 45 s. Stimulus types were randomly interleaved. For MBON γ2α’1 imaging, we delivered two repeats of either single odor pulses or transitions before and after odor-reinforcement pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2018</xref>.

These systems use saturated odor vapor which is then serially diluted in clean air to a final dilution of 0.8% (v/v). This was delivered to the fly at a flow rate of 400 mL/min from a tube with an inner diameter of 3 mm.</p><p>We measured relative odor concentrations with a photoionization detector (200B miniPID, Aurora Scientific, Canada). Different chemical vapors at the same concentration generate different PID signal amplitudes. Thus, the PID signal is linearly related to concentration only for a given odor chemical. The PID probe was used to measure and tune odor pulse shapes and to measure and account for the time taken for an odor pulse to reach the fly. The short period of overlap between the fall of the first odor pulse and the rise of the second occurred for both kinds of transition stimuli, paired to unpaired transitions and unpaired to paired transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Hence, this overlap would not affect our measures of discriminability between the two similar odors. A hot-wire anemometer S490 (Kurz, USA) was used to measure air-velocity at a sampling rate of 10 KHz while mock-odor pulses were being delivered though empty odor-vials. This was to rule out any mechanical transients at the time of odor-transitions being an external cue to the flies. To minimize transients, we combined the steps of the second serial dilution of the second odor pulse and mixing the outputs of the two odor machines. The second pulse in all transition stimuli was introduced into the final air stream at one-tenth the flow-rate. Any pressure-transients due to valve switches during the transition to the second pulse were too small to be measured by the anemometer in the final output. We saw a small valve-switching transient at the beginning of the first pulse in any transition (8% the size of the steady-state flow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Since this transient was always at the onset of the first pulse, and not during transitions, again, it did not affect discriminability.</p><p>Final air flow rate and odor concentration were adjusted to best match the odor flux a fly would experience in the arena. Since odor flows inward from the circumference of the arena, odor flux increases with distance from the periphery. We computed the odor flux on the circle that covers half the arena area and matched the flux delivered on the rig to it.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>Videos recorded during the test phase were analyzed using custom-written MATLAB code.

This value was calculated for every frame of the movie, and the values over the final 30 s of the test period averaged to compute a single PI.

We used the non-parametric, independent sample, Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare performance indices across treatment groups. Statistical testing was performed with custom code written in Matlab (Mathworks, USA).

Odor stimulus onset time in the arena was determined from PID measurements of odor concentration at the arena exhaust port. For the MBON-activation assay, stimulus onset was set as the moment the LED turned on. Upwind displacement was computed as the increase in the distance from the center for each fly, relative to its location at stimulus onset, for each time-point over the entire stimulus window.

For MBON imaging data, ROIs were manually drawn using a custom Matlab script. For both types of experiments, average, raw fluorescence intensity for each ROI was then extracted by a separate, custom script. A background region with no labeling in each imaging field was manually defined, and background fluorescence (this consisted of the PMT offset and autofluorescence) was subtracted from all measured fluorescence values for that field.

We fitted logistic regression models to predict whether or not KC activity on a given trial was evoked by a particular odor. For example, an odorA classifier received KC population activity vectors as input and then made a prediction whether the input activity was evoked by odorA/not odorA. Separate classifiers were fitted for each fly, for each odor. We used leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV): of the 8 repeats acquired for each odor, one was left out as a test trial and the remaining trials were used to fit the model. In this way, we systematically fitted models for each combination of training and test trail sets. All plotted accuracy scores are for model predictions on test trials not used for fitting. Model weights were initialized by sampling from a distribution of weights obtained from EM connectome synapse counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clements et al., 2020</xref>). Synapse counts from a KC to an MBON were assumed to be linearly related to KC-MBON weight, and normalized to the maximum weight observed. Initial model weights were uniformly sampled from this biological distribution and then fitted without regularization.</p><p>The cost function used to estimate goodness of fit was the binary cross-entropy with a quadratic regularization, defined as<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mstyle></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of training trials, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the correct odor label for a given trial (0 or 1), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the model’s prediction (or probability that the input activity vector was in response to a given odor) for the same trial, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the regularization constant (we used  <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1, but this was not a sensitive parameter), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of neurons in a given dataset and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are the weights of the neurons.

This work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> shows that two related odors trigger near identical Kenyon cell responses when tested in isolation, but trigger different responses to the second odor if these are experienced in sequence within a small temporal window. The authors argue that this template comparison requires some activity downstream of Kenyon cells, that is recruited by MBONs. Overall, the experiments, building on a clever method to build &quot;miminal memories&quot; via optogenetically restricting the formation of memory traces in selective output compartments of the Kenyon cell (KC) axon terminals, provide very nice physiological evidence for a neural mechanism that underlies a contextual basis for the precision of memory recall.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80923.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ramaswami</surname><given-names>Mani</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02tyrky19</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Ireland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ramaswami</surname><given-names>Mani</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02tyrky19</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Ireland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.24.492551">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.24.492551v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mani Ramaswami as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There appear to be a variety of ambiguities not acknowledged in the text as well as prior work not considered in necessary depth. These are indicated or reflected in various reviewer comments. Please address all of them and provide point-by-point responses indicating how these concerns have been addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) One concern, is the claim and focus around &quot;one engram and two responses&quot; is both incompletely justified (e.g. see reviewer 2 comment that the boutons represent the engram and not the cells) and not intellectually useful in terms of communicating the findings to a broader audience. Figure 4, which contains the most impressive and impactful observations in the paper indicates that after the specific optogenetic learning protocol is deployed, two odors are perceived similarly (or as a common category or class of odors) in one condition but cab discriminated as two different odorants in another condition. First, at least one reviewer feels that the excitement of this figure is in the clear demonstration of. neural correlates of this contextual discrimination phenomenon – a point that is inadequately made here and somehow occluded by a pitch around &quot;one-engram two outcomes&quot;. Second, a more solid basis for a general discussion here may be around the concept of categories. There appears to be a contextual ability to go beyond clubbing two odorants into a common category vs splitting them into distinct objects. We appreciate that the authors can decide on how they wish to discuss their data, but do ask that these suggestions/ concerns be considered as final revisions are made.</p><p>3. Please provide genetic controls requested in Reviewer 2 point d.</p><p>4.

Perhaps it is always possible as supported by the Results section 2, showing that KC inputs in &quot;naïve&quot; flies have enough information for discrimination.

I am confused by the use of 'one engram' and 'single set of synapses' – 'single set' is entirely arbitrary, and what is one engram in this context? Single odor engram triggering different behavior is not novel. Several prior works have shown that a single odorant can trigger different actions in learned flies depending on either stimulus history or the fly's internal state.</p><p>b. Authors have imaged calcium dynamics in the KC cell bodies to compare if two engrams should be perceptually similar. However, Bilz et al. 2019 have shown that the KC boutons, not the cell bodies, are the units of olfactory memory engrams. I understand that imaging KC boutons will be challenging to combine with optogenetic stimulations, but this nonetheless creates a significant caveat in their approach and needs to be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>c. Given that odorant similarity is concentration-dependent (e.g., Hallem and Carlson 2006), I am unsure how the authors chose the odor concentrations. Behavior experiments in Campbell et al. 2013 were performed in a vastly different apparatus; authors need to check if flies indeed find it difficult to discriminate between BA and PA in the current setup under standard aversive learning protocol. It would also be reassuring to see additional odor pairs to ensure the generality of their results.</p><p>d. Authors have not included any genetic control (e.g., empty split) and stimulation control (-retinal) in the behavioral experiments (Figures 1 and 6) to show the baseline response. Discrimination data in Figure 1g looks bimodal, and I wonder if discr. vs. gen. will become significant with a larger sample size. What is the rationale for the chosen sample size for these experiments? DA rescue data in Figure 1i is also incomplete as it does not contain any easy discrimination, and generalization data for γ2α'1 and α3 rescue data is entirely missing. Figure 6 includes only γ2α'1 data but no α3 activation data; α3 is an essential control for testing their predictions.</p><p>e. In Figure 4 and supplementary Figures 3 and 4, dissimilar odorants are presented as isolated pulses, not as a transition. A fairer comparison would present them as a transition to match the behavioral experience. Why were optogenetics not used for the α3 imaging experiments in Figure 3?</p><p>f. Does the starting KC weight matrix in Figure 5 match the EM connectivity data? How does the transition data from this figure look in the PC space, and how well does the decoder from Figure 2 performs on the transition data? Similarly, how well the regression model performs if it's trained purely on single pulse data?</p><p>g. Multiple papers have shown how odor transitions affect learned behavior in flies, e.g., DasGupta et al. 2014, Groschner et al. 2018, Vrontou et al. 2021. Yet, the authors have not discussed how their results support/contradict these prior models. It's an integral part of the manuscript and could point towards significant differences in experimental approach and/or intensity vs. identity coding. For example, Groschner et al. 2018 and Vrontou et al. 2021 had shown that the main difference among the KC responses during intensity discrimination is in the spike latency, not in the KC identity-I wonder if the apparent lack of discriminability in Figure 5 comes from the slow GCamp responses in the KC cell bodies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The story is novel and convincing, but a little patchy in parts.</p><p>I am not convinced that Figure 4d-f should be done with shock and not DAN stimulation.

Because we often talk about how well trained flies perform these tasks, that sometimes lead to sentence constructions like ‘flies learn the hard discrimination well’ etc. But we did not intend to say that learning directly influences the sensory perception of those odors. Indeed our previous work (Figure 2 in Hige…Turner Neuron 2015) failed to find any changes in KC response patterns with optogenetic training targeted to the MB compartments, suggesting that ‘sensory perception’ of the odors does not change in these conditions.

Although we cite Campbell 2013 for the similarity of BA and PA, the odor concentrations were chosen based on Hige 2015 where we carried out <italic>circular arena</italic> experiments to examine generalization between these two odors (Figure 7 in that paper). These experiments provided direct evidence that PA and BA at these concentrations are perceived similarly. We then carefully tuned odor concentrations delivered on the microscope to match the mean odor flux in the behavioral arena (see Methods).</p><p>We also note that our experimental observations provide further evidence that PA-BA discrimination is difficult at these concentrations. First, after pairing in the α3 compartment, flies perform poorly on the PA-BA behavioral discrimination, compared to a PA-EL or BA-EL discrimination. Second, even after pairing in the γ2α’1 compartment, we see depressed MBON responses to single pulses of both PA and BA, again indicative of the similarity between these two odors at the level of physiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d.

Indeed some colleagues at Janelia have observed optogenetic-induced behaviors on non-retinal added food. The empty split control maintains the comparable transgenic background with only the absence of the promoter regions and we feel is a more interpretable control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discrimination data in Figure 1g looks bimodal, and I wonder if discr. vs. gen. will become significant with a larger sample size. What is the rationale for the chosen sample size for these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this comment, we re-examined the data used to generate these plots and have now re-computed the performance scores. The experiments plotted in Figure 1G,H are unconventional in their use of a US separated in time from odor rather than a reciprocal control. This was necessary since the dissimilar odor B is not suitable to generalize to A or A’. Hence, we had to compute a generalization score, measuring fly position during US delivery, prior to any odor delivery. We noticed that in some experiments, biased initial positions in the arena introduced a large positive or negative offset to the score. We have re-computed generalization scores after subtracting away this offset. We then assessed bi-modality of this updated dataset using Sarle’s bi-modality coefficient, which ranges from 0 to 1, with a uniform distribution showing a coefficient of 0.599. This analysis ruled out bi-modality (Sarle’s coefficients for α3 data in Figure 1G were 0.35 for discrimination and 0.43 for generalization; values for γ2α’1 data in Figure 1H were 0.35 for discrimination and 0.36 for generalization).</p><p>We chose sample size based on the standard in the field of n=12 (Aso Rubin <italic>eLife</italic> 2014b).

We tried to construct split-LexA lines to specifically drive expression in these neurons, but they had very low expression levels. Hence the experiment cannot be done due to the unavailability of driver lines. We have added this explanation (Lines 331-334) and example images of split-LexA lines we tried (Figure 4 Supp. 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f.

This analysis supports the original conclusion that KC responses to single pulses do not predict MBON responses to odor transitions.</p><p>We have added a Figure 5 Sup Figure 1 to address the points here. The PCA plots of transition data are now shown in Figure 5 Supp. 1A. This visualization shows that responses to the second odor in the transition are quite similar to responses to isolated pulses. Indeed decoders trained on single pulses (as in Figure 2) distinguish odors in a transition almost as accurately as the isolated pulses Figure 5 Supp. 1B,C. This is consistent with Figure 5B in the main text which shows that a decoder trained on single pulses fails to distinguish between A-A’ and A’-A transitions. Together these results support the conclusion that KC activity patterns do not reflect the odor transition responses we observe in MBON.</p><p>We have also revised the Results section to clarify the different decoder analyses, and added schematics to Figure 5B,C to more clearly indicate the different training procedures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g.

Groschner 2018 was referred to in the Discussion in the original manuscript, but we now also discuss DasGupta 2014 and Vrontou 2021. These three studies show that KCs act as leaky integrators of odor-evoked excitation, showing different spike latencies for different stimulus conditions. It is possible that very similar odors could activate the same KCs, but with different latencies, that might not be resolved by calcium imaging. We have included this point in the revised Discussion (lines 475-479), where we write that different KC subtypes could have different integrative properties that might contribute to discriminating, and cite these studies.</p><p>We do want to emphasize here that although KC response patterns are extensively overlapping for PA and BA, they do in fact contain enough information to discriminate between single pulses of these odors even with the low temporal resolution of calcium imaging. The issue is rather that the plasticity rule in this compartment is such that the extensive overlap between KC patterns results in depressed responses to both odors when we follow the downstream MBON.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The story is novel and convincing, but a little patchy in parts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively re-written the paper, focussing on odor-categorization rather than on changing recall of a single engram.

In Figure 3 our goal was to find how neural activity supports distinct learned responses for the two similar odors in the hard discrimination task. In Figure 1 we had shown that this was a property of the γ2α’1 compartment, but in Figure 3 our imaging showed that, rather than discriminating, MBON-γ2α’1 generalizes across odors A and A’. Since training targeted to α3 does not support significant performance on the hard discrimination task, we did not characterize MBON-α3 with single odor pulses. However, we note that MBON-α3 responses to odor transitions (Figure 4) clearly show similar levels of depression for both A and A’ irrespective of the order of the transition.</p><p>We note that for other points of α3/γ2α’1 asymmetry – particularly Figure 1 and Figure 6 – we have now carried out the missing experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A loss of function experiment with DAN inhibition in natural learning would be appropriate and very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered this experiment, but it is likely that interpretation will be very difficult. There are 9 compartments involved in aversive learning, so if any other compartment has the ability to support fine discrimination, the effects of loss of function experiment in γ2α’1 would be masked. Indeed there are very few loss of function experiments targeting individual compartments in the literature in general, likely because of the redundancy between some of the 15 compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The dopamine biosynthesis KO experiment of Figure 1i should really be done for both populations of DANs, and ideally for easy discrimination as well as hard discrimination.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, also raised above (Ref 2 point d). We have now done the suite of easy/hard/generalization experiments in flies with dopamine biosynthesis confined to DAN PPL1-γ2α’1 and present the results in Figure 1 Supp. 1. However, we have not been able to do these experiments with the α3 compartment due to technical limitations. Flies lacking DA throughout the rest of the nervous system locomote much less, making it hard to train and collect flies and then test recall 24 hours later in order to do these experiments targeting α3. It was possible γ2α'1 only because the behavioral test is carried out immediately after training in the arena.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More discussion of potential mechanisms would also help.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a clearer description of the possible mechanisms to the revised Discussion (Lines 514-53).</p></body></sub-article></article>
