anxiogenic environments. However, if and how such neuronal activity induces or restricts the exploration of an anxiogenic location remains unexplained. Here, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to motivate rats to explore an anxiogenic area. Male rats ran along an elevated linear maze with protective sidewalls, which were subsequently removed in parts of the track to introduce an anxiogenic location. We recorded neuronal action potentials during task performance and found that vH neurons exhibited remapping of activity, overrepresenting anxiogenic locations. Direction-dependent firing was homogenised by the anxiogenic experience. We further showed that the activity of vH neurons predicted the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic location. Our data suggest that anxiety-related firing does not solely depend on the exploration of anxiogenic environments, but also on intentions to explore them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>ventral hippocampus</kwd><kwd>single-unit</kwd><kwd>neuronal activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P 29588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klausberger</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>716761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ciocchi</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>170654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ciocchi</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel behavioural paradigm reveals how neurons in the ventral hippocampus dynamically adapt their firing activity after the introduction of an anxiogenic location.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the <italic>Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium</italic>, Seneca wrote: “There are more things, Lucilius, likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more often in imagination than in reality”. This sentence, from one of the key figures of the school of stoicism, describes inner fear within our imagination in the absence of a direct fear-provoking stimulus. Nowadays, even though anxiety and fear correspond to the same theoretical construct in some literature, anxiety differentiates from the latter based on the potential nature of the threat in the absence of an imminent harmful stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calhoon and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steimer, 2002</xref>). Anxiety disorders are becoming more commonly reported: 12-month prevalence estimates on mental disorders show that at least 14% of people in the European Union suffer from anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wittchen et al., 2011</xref>), and around 31% of people in the United States have experienced some type of anxiety disorders in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>). Different brain areas play a role in the underlying circuitry of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sandford et al., 2000</xref>). Stimulations in the brainstem, more precisely in the periaqueductal grey matter or the locus coerulus are specifically involved in the symptomatology of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graeff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Redmond and Huang, 1979</xref>). Some studies have also shown how the amygdala plays a role in humans suffering from anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birbaumer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 1999</xref>) or in animal models with generalised fear responses associated with anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). Also, by using the elevated plus maze (EPM) as an anxiety task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pellow et al., 1985</xref>), Tye and colleagues induced anxiolytic effects by targeting projections from the basolateral amygdala (BA) to the central nucleus of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tye et al., 2011</xref>). Additional structures are involved in anxiety and include the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, whose subdivisions are differentially involved in anxiety responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duvarci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which has also been directly linked to anxiety processing in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rauch et al., 1997</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shah and Treit, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Last but not least, the ventral hippocampus (vH) plays a critical role in anxiety behaviour. Lesions in the vH induce anxiolysis during the exploration of elevated open arenas (e.g. EPM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kjelstrup et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016</xref>), or generally in tasks associated with approach-avoidance conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schumacher et al., 2018</xref>). Neurons recorded in the vH showed increased firing in locations with elevated anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jimenez et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, projections neurons from and to the vH exhibit anxiety-related activity: amygdala projections to the vH are specifically shaping anxiety-related behaviour during the exploration of an EPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pi et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, the reciprocal connection (from vH to BA) is involved in the expression of context-dependent fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim and Cho, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, information related to anxiety in the vH is directly routed to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>), and synchronised activity in this monosynaptically connected long-range circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2011</xref>) is essential for the expression of anxiety behaviour. Motivated by the critical role of the dorsal hippocampus (dH) region in the encoding of spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Keefe, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Keefe and Nadel, 2011</xref>), several studies focusing on the vH have described its involvement in spatial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poucet et al., 1994</xref>). Yet, probably due to its anatomical location and the difficulties to record action potentials of single-unit activity in the vH, the individual neuronal dynamics associated with the changes between anxiogenic and non-anxiogenic states during spatial navigation remain poorly understood.</p><p>To study the neuronal dynamics associated with anxiety behaviour in the vH, we simultaneously recorded the activity of individual neurons during the exploration of the EPM, as well as during the exploration of a novel behavioural paradigm, the elevated linear maze (ELM). During the same recording session, we modified the ELM from a non-anxiogenic to an anxiogenic configuration, while recording the activity of the same individual vH neurons. This enabled the investigation of the neuronal dynamics within the vH underlying different anxiety states. We specifically examined the remapping of neuronal activity at the single neuron and population level as animals transitioned from a non-anxiogenic configuration to an anxiogenic one. Collectively, the results of this study show that the neuronal activity in the vH does not simply reflect anxiogenic locations but that it is dynamically modulated by the experience and expectation of anxiety during spatial navigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The firing activity of vH neurons is dynamically modulated during EPM exploration</title><p>Rats (n=6) freely explored an EPM consisting of two opposite arms with protective sidewalls (closed arms) and two opposite arms without sidewalls (open arms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The rats exhibited strong anxiety-related behaviour by spending most of the time in the closed arms, avoiding the more anxiogenic open arms and the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom; closed vs open, p=9.5615e-10; closed vs centre, p=9.5657e-10; one-way ANOVA, Tukey-Kramer for multiple comparisons). While rats explored the EPM, we recorded neuronal activity in the vH with tetrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and isolated individual spikes from different single neurons (n=98). We identified vH neurons with previously described activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>), exhibiting preferential firing in the open arms, closed arms, or centre of the EPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To understand the effect of the open areas on the neuronal activity, we defined six possible trajectories taken by animals during EPM exploration (from one closed arm to any other arm). After linearising the trajectories (see Materials and methods), we organised the activity of the recorded neurons based on the spatial location of their peak (i.e. maximal) firing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We observed that the peak firing activities of individual neurons spanned the entire maze even though the exploration of open arms was minimal. When plotting the peak firing density across the maze (normalised by the total number of neurons possibly firing in a spatial bin) the activity of vH neurons was concentrated around the centre of the maze when shuttling from one closed arm to the other one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top, stars indicate bins with significant higher density; bootstrapping; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In some trajectories, a similar effect is observed when animals shuttled from one closed arm to an open one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom, starts indicate bins with significant higher density; bootstrapping; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Even though the reduced number of entries to the open arms and exploration of open areas prevents a powerful statistic calculation, the observed effects imply that open areas are relevant for the neuronal activity of the vH.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The activity of ventral hippocampal neurons is dynamically modulated during elevated plus maze (EPM) exploration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, picture of the EPM.

Second, the non-anxiogenic and the anxiogenic areas of the EPM are constantly present. This means that the characterisation of the anxiety states experienced by animals is not trivial as these may feel continuously anxious not solely in open spaces but also when considering to visit an open arm, while being in the closed arms of the EPM. In order to discriminate between neuronal activity related to spatial exploration from anxiety-related exploration and to motivate the exploration of anxiogenic areas for quantitative evaluation of the associated neuronal activity, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to better control the transitions between anxiety states and the extent of exploration of anxiogenic areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Removal of protective sidewalls along an ELM induces anxiety behaviour</title><p>We developed an ELM, which consisted of an elevated linear track with removable protective sidewalls. This allowed to have sidewalls either all along the entire ELM, called closed-closed (CC) configuration, or to have the sidewalls removed from half of the track, called closed-open (CO) configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The rapid removal of the sidewalls enabled the alternation between a non-anxiogenic and an anxiogenic configuration within the same maze and in a single recording session. To control for neuronal activity-associated differences between two dissimilar areas in the linear maze exploration, while maintaining non-anxiogenic locations, we modified temporarily the visual appearance of sidewalls and floor texture in one half of the track, creating a new and enriched environment, without being anxiogenic. This configuration was termed closed-texture (CT) configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Rats (n=6) were motivated to fully explore the ELM, by shuttling from one end of the track to the other one over numerous trials, to receive food rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To assess whether the removal of sidewalls induces behavioural readouts of anxiety similar to those of the EPM, we calculated the percentage of time spent on each of the arms for each configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). No differences were observed in the time spent by rats on the different arms during non-anxiogenic explorations (CC, CT). On the contrary, a significant difference was found in the configuration with sidewalls removed (CO exploration, p=1.45e-05, Wilcoxon signed-rank). The time spent in the centre area (11.5 cm around the middle of the track) was also longer during CO exploration compared to CC or CT explorations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, p=2e-05 and p=0.034 against CC and CT, respectively, one-way ANOVA, Turkey-Kramer for multiple comparisons), suggesting of hesitations to enter this open area of the maze.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Removal of protective sidewalls along an elevated linear maze (ELM) induces anxiety behaviour.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

When the activity of individual neurons was sorted according to the spatial location of their peak firing activity, we observed that it spanned over the entire extent of the ELM for the three different configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is important to note that most of the neurons do not have a spatially restricted activity similar to a typical place cell in the dorsal CA1 hippocampus, but still they exhibit a peak of activity associated to a spatial bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). During the CO exploration, the distribution of peak firing activity was skewed towards the open area. We assessed the proportion of vH neurons with peak firing activity located on the different halves of the ELM during CC exploration. We found no differences in the proportion of peak firing activity located in each half of the CC configuration, even for the closed half that was going to be opened in the CO configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left). Then, when one half was opened, a remapping of the neuronal activity was induced towards the anxiogenic location. We observed a higher proportion of peak firing activities located on the open arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> left, p=0.0121, chi-square test). We also compared the proportions of neurons that will ‘Change to open’ in contrast to the ones that will ‘Change to closed’. ‘Change to open’ are neurons that, during CC configuration, had their peak firing located in the arm, which was to remain closed upon sidewall removal. After the removal, their peak firing activity was remapped to the open arm of the CO. ‘Change to closed’ are their counterpart neurons, meaning that during the CC configuration, their peak firing was located in the arm to be opened upon sidewall removal. After the removal, their peak firing activity was remapped to the closed arm of the CO. The difference in proportions between these two subpopulations was significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right, p=0.0066, chi-square test). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows the peak activity transition of every single recorded neuron before (CC) and after (CO) removing the sidewalls in half of the maze.

Speed-related modulation of hippocampal activity has been widely shown in the dorsal hippocampal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czurkó et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiener et al., 1989</xref>). Using generalised linear models (GLMs), we aimed to capture the influence of the animal’s instantaneous speed on the location-dependent activity for each cell (see Materials and methods). We found that the spiking activity of 49 neurons out of 133 (36.84%) was significantly modulated by the speed of the animal during the exploration of the CC configuration. Also, as expected, a higher number of neurons (72 out of 133, 54.14%) were significantly modulated by running speed during the exploration of the CO, in agreement with the speed changes related to the experience of an anxiogenic area. Next, we used the residuals of the GLM as an approximation of the neuronal spike-associated activity, corrected by the influence of the speed. Repeating the same analysis as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref> we found that a significant proportion of vH neurons changed the location of their peak firing activities from the closed area to the open area after sidewall removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), in addition to no significant differences when exploring the CT configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggest that even though there is a modulation by the speed of the animal, there is also a prominent influence of the anxiogenic location in the neuronal activity irrespective of running speed.</p><p>As the population of cortical neurons is composed of pyramidal cells and interneurons, we aimed to sort the recorded neurons according to their putative identity by examining the spike shape and the firing rate of the individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csicsvari et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>).

To investigate how CO exploration changed different spatial properties of neuronal activity, we calculated each neuron’s spatial information, sparsity and coherence for each ELM configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods). Specifically, we compared these three properties for neurons with peak firing rate located in the open arm of the CO configuration; we called these ‘peak in open’ (PiO) neurons. Reciprocally, neurons whose peak activity was located in the closed part of the CO configuration, were called ‘peak in closed’ (PiC) neurons. Interestingly, both PiO and PiC neurons showed similar properties: their spatial information diminished when going from a CC to a CO configuration (p=1.66e-05 for PiO and p=0.0074 for PiC, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), while their sparsity and coherence increased (p=6.86e-05 and p=1.88e-05 respectively for PiO; p=9.68e-04 and p=2.86e-04 for PiC, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Such effects were not observed for neurons during changes from CC2 to CT configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

However, this direction-dependent neuronal firing of the same vH neurons became homogenised, meaning that it was very similar in both directions, once the sidewalls were removed and the rats were exploring the CO configuration. To quantify this phenomenon, we use the Spearman correlation as a measurement of place field similarity (PFS) of a neuron between its activity while the animal moved in one direction vs the other direction. The PFS value obtained from the correlation will grant an accurate approximation of the similarity between the neuronal activity of both directions.

To do so, we divided spatial explorations into two groups depending on how far animals explored the open arm during a particular trial: proximal and distal exploration trials were defined using an individual threshold for each session (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then tested if the neuronal activity before entering the open arm was informative of how far animals would venture into the open arm (proximal or distal explorations). We trained a support vector machine (SVM) using the neuronal activity for each possible neuronal pair in the closed arms and each recording day (see Materials and methods). Using a wrapper-like method, we then selected the neuronal pair with the highest performance on correctly predicting the extent of exploration for single trials on a given recording day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> for raster plots). Since the distribution of distal and proximal trials was not equal (50%–50%), we then determined if the performance of the optimal pair in a given recording day was significant by shuffling the trial IDs 1000 times and re-calculating the performance on a newly trained SVM. A recording day was labelled as successfully predicted if the performance of the optimal neuronal pair was higher than the 95% percentile of the shuffled distribution. Classification performance for three sessions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, where the red coloured dots imply an incorrect classification. The summary of the performance of the classifiers for all sessions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, where the boxplots represent the performance of each of the 1000 shuffles but with the optimal performance of the session subtracted (grey line at 0 denotes the optimal performance and the boxplots the ‘differential to the optimal’ shuffled ones). We found that during individual recording sessions, the performance of the SVM was above chance levels (95th percentile) in 9 out of 12 sessions. Also, the performance of any pair was higher than the performance of the best pair’s shuffled data, with few expected exceptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Because the area before entering the open arm of the CO configuration seemed to be a behaviourally important location, it might be possible that we were capturing the speed-related neuronal activity (due to a speed difference between trials in which the rat would visit the end of the arm, or would return early). However, we observed that the animals’ speed before entering the open arm was not different between proximal or distal run endpoints, except for one session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, correct prediction of several sessions using the SVM classifier was achieved for controls in which speed or SWR-associated activity was corrected and also when restricting the pairs to be either only putative pyramidal cell pairs, or putative interneuron pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The activity of ventral hippocampal neurons predicts the extent of exploration of an anxiogenic location.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) For two behavioural sessions, the furthest spatial bin visited on each trial is plotted.

This implies that neuronal activity within the vH can predict upcoming anxiogenic situations, even when animals are still located in a safer environment without a direct exposure to an anxiety-inducing location.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To investigate the neuronal dynamics governing anxiety behaviour in the vH, we recorded the activity of individual neurons while rats explored anxiogenic locations. In addition to the classical EPM, we used a novel ELM, which allowed us to rapidly change the anxiety content of the maze to expose rats to non-anxiogenic or anxiogenic configurations. We found that the neuronal activity of the vH exhibited a uniform spatial representation in the non-anxiogenic configuration of the ELM and that vH neurons displayed direction-dependent spatial firing when shuttling from one end of the ELM to another. When the anxiogenic location was introduced by removing the protective sidewalls from half of the track, the peak firing activity remapped towards the newly introduced anxiogenic location, the spatial properties of the neuronal activity diminished, and direction-dependent firing was homogenised. Of important note, neuronal activity in the closed arm of the ELM predicted the extent of the upcoming exploration in the open arm even before rats entered into the open anxiogenic location.</p><p>Much of the anxiety research in freely moving rodents has been relying on the EPM. Using the EPM, it has been shown that: amygdala projections to the vH control the expression of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felix-Ortiz and Tye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pi et al., 2020</xref>); there is an anxiety-associated neuronal activity in the vH routed to the mPFC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; and that the vH-prefrontal pathway is critical for anxiety behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>). The first part of this manuscript focuses on the activity of neurons recorded in the vH during the exploration of an EPM. We divided the exploration of the EPM into different trajectories. We observed a localised increase in the density of peak firing activity when rats crossed the centre in all the different C-C or C-O trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This might be explained by the fact that not only the open arms of an EPM are anxiogenic, but also the centre zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mendes-Gomes et al., 2011</xref>). Unfortunately, it proved difficult to analyse these effects quantitatively, because rats explored the open arms only minimally and sporadically, consistent with the anxiogenic nature of the EPM paradigm.</p><p>To overcome this problem, we introduced a novel ELM on which rats were motivated to shuttle from one extremity to the other to receive rewards. The ELM had three different configurations: non-anxiogenic (CC configuration); anxiogenic (CO configuration); and a configuration with new texture and visual cues (CT). Configurations could be quickly switched within a session. At the behavioural level, we observed anxiety-related behaviour during ELM exploration comparable to the ones during EPM exploration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). However, the main advantage of the ELM was the possibility to record the neuronal activity of the same vH neurons while rapidly modifying ELM configurations and motivating rats to spend more time in the anxiogenic location. After animals transited from a non-anxiogenic to an anxiogenic configuration, we observed a significant increment in peak firing activities predominately located in the open area. We attributed this recruitment or remapping of the neuronal activity to the anxiogenic location. The neuronal mechanisms during spatial remapping remain largely elusive. Global remapping is a phenomenon observed in the dH when animals move from one environment to a different one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>). One could argue that the simple removal of the walls is changing the environment of the ELM and therefore animals could perceive the open arm as a completely novel environment, inducing global remapping. Nevertheless, remapping of neuronal activity in a new environment is expected to be random and independent of a previously explored environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gauthier and Tank, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schlesiger et al., 2018</xref>), even when emotional contexts are introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moita et al., 2004</xref>). However, the remapping of neuronal activity observed in vH neurons is not arbitrary as it is most prominent in the anxiogenic location, contrary to a uniformly distributed peak activity in case of a random remapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Nonetheless, the opening of walls per se, independent of the anxiogenic experience, could cause changes in vH neuronal activity. Previous work has shown that novel environments elicit the activation of vH neurons to a similar extent as an aversive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graham et al., 2021</xref>). To show that the remapping of neuronal activity relies on anxiety, we changed the ELM from a CC to CT configuration during the same recording session. In the CT configuration, the previously open location changed to a novel one with a different floor texture and visual patterns in the inner part of the walls, but with protective sidewalls kept all along the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As anticipated, these changes equally induced a remapping of neuronal activity in the vH. Yet, in this case, the remapping was distributed over the length of the maze and the novel area did not show an increased number of peak firing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Overrepresentation of behaviourally relevant locations or episodes is not novel in the hippocampal research field. It has been previously demonstrated that hippocampal place cells fire preferentially at reward locations during goal-directed tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupret et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hok et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hollup et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin and Lee, 2021</xref>) and global remapping is observed in the intermediate hippocampus due to motivational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin and Lee, 2021</xref>). Several experiments have tackled the role of dH neurons in fear conditioning and other aversive tasks, resulting in similar activity patterns to the ones found in this research. Dorsal hippocampal place cells were shown to remap or partially remap in the presence of an aversive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), or remap towards areas of aversive stimuli or threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuette et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), by increasing their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) or by synchrony with or reactivation of a subset of basal and BA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girardeau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kong et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the non-aversive stimulus, presented in the same context as the aversive ones, did not induce remapping in dorsal hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), a similar effect to our observations in vH neurons.</p><p>Furthermore, the vH is strongly associated with anxiety, and the anxiogenic location represents a highly salient environment for vH-dependent computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannerman et al., 2014</xref>). This is supported by our finding that neurons of the vH overrepresent the anxiogenic area. Interestingly, in addition to the global remapping, we also found differences in the rate remapping between the CC-CO and the CC2-CT conformation changes. Rate remapping was significantly more robust in the novel context than in the anxiogenic one, in line with the literature suggesting that novelty induces rate remapping in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaefer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rennó-Costa et al., 2010</xref>). Regarding spatial properties of the hippocampal neurons, conflicting effects have been observed with aversive stimuli in the dH. In some cases, spatial information was not significantly different between non-aversive and aversive conditions, but the variance was significantly greater <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; in other cases, spatial information was higher in non-aversive compared to aversive contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; while others report either an increase in place field size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moita et al., 2004</xref>) or a decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schuette et al., 2020</xref>). One paper reports various changes in the activity of vH neurons when mice are confronted with an aversive odour stimulus. They report a decrease in place field size, remapping of the activity and increase of the firing rate in the presence of the aversive odour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keinath et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we also observe remapping of neuronal activity in aversive conditions and, in fact, a tendency, yet no significance, of the neurons to increase their firing rate in the CO configuration compared to the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, in our study, the activity of the neurons in vH increases its coverage, while in Keinath et al., it is reduced (smaller place fields). In the Keinath et al. study, the aversive stimulus was presented on a small area while in our case the source of the anxiogenic stimulus cannot be pinpoint to a specific part of the open arm, which might have contributed to the different observations. In our experiments, the spatial properties of the neurons in the anxiogenic area of the CO configuration are reduced (lower spatial information and higher sparsity) compared to the CC configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, all these elements further strengthen the role of vH in the emotional processing of information.</p><p>Another relevant observation relates to the directional firing of vH neurons. In the non-anxiogenic configuration of the ELM, the spatial activity of single vH neurons varied depending on the direction of exploration. Similar observations have been made in both the dH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNaughton et al., 1983</xref>) and vH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royer et al., 2010</xref>) for linear mazes, suggesting of a common principle underlying spatial information along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus. With respect to the vH, Royer et al. hypothesised that the differential activity between inbound and outbound trajectories might be caused by the reward delivered at the end of the arm implying some reward-associated value coding. In contrast to Royer et al., we placed rewards at both extremities of the ELM. Although this does not invalidate the view of Royer et al., in our study, the direction-dependent firing was homogenised in the anxiogenic configuration of the ELM, with vH neurons exhibiting similar firing independently of the direction of exploration in the open arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We attribute the homogenisation of the direction-dependent firing in single vH neurons to the relevance of the anxiogenic location for vH-dependent computations. One cannot rule out that the homogenisation is also a product of the noticeable change in the maze configuration, implying that the closed and open arm are easier to discern for the animal. Therefore, in both directions, the animal receives similar visual inputs and, therefore, activity homogenises. However, our control experiments, in which we introduced a new, but non-anxiogenic environment to the ELM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), also resulted in a clear differentiation of both parts of the ELM in both directions of travel. Still, we failed to observe a homogenisation of the activities.</p><p>Furthermore, the modulation of the neuronal activity in the anxiogenic location was not exclusively observed while the rats explored the open area. The CO configuration of the ELM contained protective walls in half of the maze, while the other half was entirely open. The neuronal population activity was a good predictor of the extent of the exploration of the open location, even when rats explored the closed arm before entering to the open location. Indeed, the neuronal activity in the closed arm, of neuronal pairs, was sufficient to infer whether rats would perform proximal or distal explorations of the open arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Anxiety-related modulation of vH neuronal activity in both the closed and the open locations implies that not only a direct experience of anxiety enhances neuronal activity in the vH, but also its anticipation without a direct confrontation to an anxiety-inducing situation.</p><p>Overall, we provided evidence that the neuronal dynamics within the vH are subjected to the experience of anxiety. When an anxiogenic situation was encountered, vH neurons, first, over-represented this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, spatial properties of the neurons, with their main activity in the anxiogenic area, were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Third, vH neuronal activity was tuned to the anxiogenic environment, impairing previous direction-dependent neuronal activity manifesting in the absence of anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Fourth, the neuronal activity of vH neurons reflected and predicted the exploration of an anxiogenic location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Collectively, these results expand our view of vH function by highlighting dynamic and predictive computations during anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental subjects</title><p>In total, nine long Evans rats from Charles River Laboratories (male, 250–600  g), were kept in 12 hr light cycles during behavioural experiments (performed during the light cycle).

The difference with the CC configuration was that in half of the maze (the half which was open in the CO configuration) coloured geometrical figures were added to the sidewalls as new visual patterns and the texture of the floor were changed. The ELM sessions were composed by the presentation of the CO and CT configurations, each preceded by a CC configuration.

For the Axona headstages, output signals were amplified 1000× via a 64-channel amplifier and then digitised continuously with a sampling rate of 24  kHz at 16-bit resolution, using a 64-channel analogue-to-digital converter computer card (Axona Ltd). For the Intan headstages, signals were acquired with the RHD32 channel headstage and directly sent to the Intan 512ch/1024ch recording controller. Single-unit offline detection was performed by thresholding the digitally filtered signal (0.8–5  kHz) over five standard deviations (SD) from the root mean square in 0.2 ms sliding windows. For each single unit, 32 data points (1.33 ms) were sampled.

The stability of single units was confirmed by examining spike features over time. The position of tetrodes was reset after each recording day. The following number of neurons were recorded for each animal: SC65, 2 neurons; SC67, 17 neurons; SC68, 31 neurons; SC70, 7 neurons; HM15, 44 neurons; and HM16, 32 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Spike-shape classification of putative pyramidal cells and putative interneurons</title><p>The putative identity of the recorded hippocampal neurons has been assessed by examining the spike shape and the firing rate of the individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Csicsvari et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sirota et al., 2008</xref>).

We calculated the latency between the trough and the following peak (hyperpolarisation period) and the firing rate of each neuron (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We sorted putative pyramidal cells with a trough-to-peak latency higher than 0.3 ms and firing rate lower than 20 Hz. Putative interneurons were defined as units with a trough-to-peak latency lower than 0.3 ms and firing rate higher or equal to 10 Hz. Several neurons did not fall into any of these two categories. They were included in the main analyses, but not when differentiating putative pyramidal cells and putative interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SWR detection</title><p>SWR were detected in a semi-automatic matter from the local field potential of the tetrode with the highest ripple amplitude.

We set the threshold for ripple detection at 5 SD above the mean. The beginning and end of an SWR were marked in the 1 SD crossing (from the mean).

For each bin, the total number of spikes was divided by the rat’s occupancy (in seconds): the firing rate maps were smoothed by convolving them into two dimensions with a Gaussian low-pass filter. For the EPM, by using the geometry of the maze, the centre and the arms were defined. Trajectories were then found by demarcating the consecutive tracked positions going from the furthest point reached on the arm, to the furthest point reached on the next visited arm. To linearise this position, each two-dimensional point (x, y) was projected to the directional vector describing the arm to which that point belongs. Each projection was made by using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced open="‖" close="‖" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where P<sub>x,y</sub> is the position to be projected, D<sub>arm</sub> is the directional vector of the corresponding arm, and ||D|| denotes the norm of the vector D. Each trajectory was composed of three parts: starting arm, centre, and ending arm. For the starting and ending arm, the activity was calculated over the space by dividing the total number of spikes on each linear bin (5 cm) over the occupancy (in seconds) on that particular bin. However, due to the different possible trajectories that the animal can follow in the centre, the activity there was divided into five fixed time bins. Then, the linear firing rate maps (activity in the starting, centre, and ending arm) were smoothed by convolving them with a 1D Gaussian function. Linear firing rate maps on the ELM were calculated by dividing the space into bins (2.5 cm each) and for each bin, the corresponding spikes of each neuron were summed and divided by the occupancy (in seconds).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Spatial properties</title><p>Three different spatial properties were calculated (spatial information, sparsity, and coherence) based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alme et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muller and Kubie, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skaggs et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>.</p><p>The spatial information measured how much information about the spatial location of the animal is contained within the activity of a cell (bits/spike):<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>i=bin</p></list-item><list-item><p>p<sub>i</sub>=the probability of occupancy of the bin</p></list-item><list-item><p>λ=overall firing rate</p></list-item><list-item><p>λ<sub>i</sub> = the mean firing rate of the bin</p></list-item></list><p>The sparsity (also called coverage) measured the compactness of the place field.<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The variables of the equation are the same as for spatial information.</p><p>Coherence measures the extent to which the firing rate in a bin is predicted by the rates of the neighbouring bins.

An SVM classifier with a linear kernel was used to determine if the extent of the exploration of a given trial (proximal or distal exploration) was possible. We calculated the firing rates of the neurons prior to the entrance to the open area in the CO configuration (from the moment the animal was heading towards the open arm, until the spatial bin before reaching the centre). Using this firing rate, in a ‘one-leave out cross-validation’ fashion, the identity of each trial was predicted by training the classifier with the neuronal activity of all the other trials. Using a wrapper-like method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohavi and John, 1997</xref>), we iteratively check the performance of the SVM for all possible combinations of neuronal pairs for each session.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Inah Lee (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Necessary neural analyses are missing from the paper. For example, basic analyses of single cell properties are lacking.</p><p>2) Previous dorsal hippocampal studies related to processing anxiety and fear need to be discussed more deeply to put the new findings within the proper context.</p><p>3) Behavioral data are not described and analyzed sufficiently. As it stands, it is unclear whether neural effects are due to differences in behavior.</p><p>4) Putative principal cells and interneurons should be analyzed separately, and it should be clear how cell types were subdivided.</p><p>5) Some details about methods are missing. For example, how were spikes during sharp wave-ripples removed?</p><p>6) Histological verification should be shown.</p><p>Please see individual reviews below for details and specific recommendations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The primary finding of this study is that it was possible to predict the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic area by using the neural activities of the ventral hippocampus (vHP) before the rat enters such an area (i.e., the open arm) (Figure 5). However, the authors did not provide detailed neural and behavioral data to support their arguments. First of all, to verify the electrophysiological data, they need to report the basic firing properties of single-cell activities and the representative histological photomicrographs showing the electrode tips to verify whether the electrodes were indeed targeted the pyramidal cell layers in the vHP (e.g., the overall distribution of the spike width and mean firing rate during CC, CO, CT condition, raw spiking samples to show cell's recording stability, brain sections with thionin staining, etc.). In addition, the authors need to clarify how pyramidal neurons and interneurons were distinguished from each other (e.g., using the mean firing rate and spike width?), and how they removed sharp-wave ripple-associated spikes (e.g., using a speed filter?). Second, before providing results of principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM), they need to verify that the mean firing rate before entering the open arm was positively or negatively correlated with the exploration types (i.e., proximal and distal exploration). Such correlation analysis may make the results of PCA and SVM more substantial.</p><p>Next, the current version of the manuscript lacks detailed behavioral data (e.g., velocity and position differences between proximal and distal exploration trials before entering the open arm), which may raise the alternative hypothesis that the difference in the neural activities between proximal and distal exploration could result from behavioral differences, not the prediction signals in the vHP. For example, in the proximal exploration trials, rats could be more hesitant and stayed longer near the boundary before entering the open arm than in the distal exploration trials. In contrast, in the distal exploration trials, rats might run toward the rewards in the open arm without hesitation. In that case, it is possible that the difference in neural activities between the exploration types could mainly reflect the difference in animal speed or how long they stayed near the boundary, not necessarily reflecting the animal's intention to explore the anxiogenic area. To address these concerns, the authors need to report detailed behavioral and neural data with respect to the issue. For example, they may need to provide a peri-event time histogram of the animal's velocity and position and spikes in relation to the time of entering the open arm. Alternatively, as they used spike-associated activity controlled by speed via the general linear model (GLM) in Figure 3F-3G and 4D-4E, they may apply this model to this analysis in Figure 5 to control the speed factor, etc, to name a few.</p><p>Also, it is unclear which neural firing data were used for the PCA and SVM analyses. The authors said &quot;firing rate of each neuron prior to the open arm ~ (line 478)&quot;, but it is confusing which moment they indicated by 'prior.' They need to quantitatively define 'prior' (e.g., activities within seconds before entering the open arm or activities within 10cm from the boundary between the open and closed arm). If position or velocity was different depending on the exploration type, it could be that different place cells might be recruited during the &quot;firing rate prior to the open arm,&quot; which might result in distinct neural activities between proximal and distal exploration trials. In addition, they need to report how PCs in proximal and distal exploration were quantitatively separated between two exploration types in the entire session, not only for two sessions (Figure 5A).</p><p>In SVM analysis, the authors did not show raw data to demonstrate that the neural activities in proximal and distal exploration trials were properly distinguished through the hyperplane of SVM (Figure 5B). Thus, it is impossible to assess the validity of SVM analysis. The authors need to provide the graph whose x and y axes are associated with the neuronal activities and demonstrate that the hyperplane properly distinguished proximal and distal exploration trials. Moreover, they iteratively computed the performance of the SVM for all possible combinations of neurons and chose the combination that gave the highest performance for further analysis (Figure 5B – 5C). This may result in an overestimation of the results. For example, even if most combinations had low performance, it would be considered a high-performance session if there was only one combination of higher performance.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and Reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Please see the remaining issues noted by Reviewers #1 and 3 below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper is expected to be of interest to systems neuroscientists in the fields of emotion, hippocampal function, and anxiety-related behavior. The authors performed recordings in the ventral hippocampus and show that (1) place fields become concentrated near the open areas of a maze, (2) direction-dependent coding decreases in these open areas, and (3) ventral hippocampal population activity in the closed area can be used to predict how mice explore the open area in the immediate future. These valuable findings provide convincing support for the potential role of the ventral hippocampus in the exploration of anxiety-provoking environments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed most of my concerns. However, there are still some concerns that may need to be addressed (see below).</p><p>– (Figure 3A) The authors nicely illustrated single-cell examples in Figure 3 (and figure supplement 1A and 1B) to show broader place fields in the ventral hippocampus. However, when examining the individual cases, I am concerned that the z-transformed population rate maps in Figure 3A may give the reader the wrong impression that most cells in the ventral hippocampus have focal place fields. Furthermore, inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus also have their preferred firing locations where their firing rates are higher than others (Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2007, Hippocampus). As the current study didn't differentially analyze putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, it might be difficult to distinguish between activities in pyramidal neurons and interneurons when using the z-transformed rate maps. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to show the population activities using a z-transformed population rate map.</p><p>– (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B) The authors used the averaged speed in the arena spanning 15 cm before crossing the open area to argue that there was no behavioral difference between proximal and distal exploration. However, 15 cm is an arbitrarily determined value, and I wonder if it can serve as a representative measurement to compare animal behavior between proximal and distal trials. This is mainly because they calculated firing rates for SVM analysis from the moment heading towards the open area, not the 15cm before crossing the boundary between closed and open areas. Thus, it might be much more appropriate to compare the speed from the moment heading toward the open area to the end of the closed area.</p><p>– Additionally, the authors should include statistical testing in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B. Based on my observations, the speed of future proximal exploration seems significantly lower than that of future distal exploration in session 5. Along with the results of each session, it might be necessary to pool the data from all sessions and perform statistical testing in order to argue that there was no speed difference between proximal and distal exploration.</p><p>– (Discussion) Keinath and colleagues (Hippocampus, 2014) argued that cells in the mouse ventral hippocampus showed more spatially selective firing patterns when aversive odor (i.e., predator's urine) was introduced in the open arena. This result contradicts the current manuscript because adding an anxiety factor seemed to decrease spatial firing characteristics in the current study as opposed to the results of Keinath et al. (2014). If the authors explain the potential factors of why there was a contradiction between Keinath and colleagues and the current study, it will be helpful to understand the importance of the ventral hippocampus in emotional information processing. Additionally, if the authors explain why the firing fields became larger but not smaller in anxiogenic space in processing emotional processing, it can give readers a clue about how the ventral hippocampus is involved in processing emotional information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>After carefully evaluating the revised manuscript and the authors' response to my previous comments, I am pleased to report that I am satisfied with the changes made by the authors. The authors have addressed all the concerns and/or issues raised in my previous review and have made significant improvements to the manuscript.</p><p>The revised manuscript, with the additional supplemental materials, now presents a clear and concise argument, and the additional data analysis, especially on the single unit analyses and presentation has been significantly strengthened.</p><p>The author has also provided additional information (incl.

As it stands, it is unclear whether neural effects are due to differences in behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the very useful comment, especially regarding the results for the prediction of further exploration. We agree that speed differences could have explained the neuronal activity differences. We have added a series of analyses and clarifications:</p><p>– We have improved the description of the behavioural assays in the methods, paying particular attention to the request of the individual reviewers.</p><p>– We performed control analyses for several experiments and corrected for speed-related neuronal activity. In particular, we are now also showing the results of the SVM classifiers, predicting the proximal or distal future exploration of the subject, for the speed-corrected firing (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B).</p><p>– In addition, we show that the actual speed of the animal, prior to the entrance of the open area in the CO configuration, is not significantly different between future proximal or distal explorations (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A).</p><p>– Another behavioural difference that might affect the neuronal activity of hippocampal neurons is their association with periods of sharp-wave ripples (SWR). We have now detected SWR, removed the spikes associated with those periods and re-analysed the data showing that our conclusions still hold for the SWR-corrected activity (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3C; Figure 5 —figure supplement 1C and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Putative principal cells and interneurons should be analyzed separately, and it should be clear how cell types were subdivided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We followed the advice and separated putative pyramidal neurons from putative interneurons using their neuronal firing rate and spike width (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2B). Using this separation, we performed all of the analyses also separating put. pyramidal cells and put. interneurons. Interestingly, both group of cells show very similar activity pattern changes, with few specific differences highlighted now in the text (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3A, B); (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A, B; Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some details about methods are missing.

However, the authors did not provide detailed neural and behavioral data to support their arguments. First of all, to verify the electrophysiological data, they need to report the basic firing properties of single-cell activities and the representative histological photomicrographs showing the electrode tips to verify whether the electrodes were indeed targeted the pyramidal cell layers in the vHP (e.g., the overall distribution of the spike width and mean firing rate during CC, CO, CT condition, raw spiking samples to show cell's recording stability, brain sections with thionin staining, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We have added pictures of Nissl-stained histological brain sections with tetrode tracks in ventral hippocampus (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). In addition, we have performed an analysis to corroborate the stability of the recordings across the sessions (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2A). In the analyses, we calculated the averaged spike shape for single neurons during the first third of the recording day and correlated that spike with the average shape of the last third. 100% of the spike-shapes had a minimum correlation value of 0.98, implying that the spikes were identical at the beginning and the end of the recording. Also, we have now provided examples of the average activity for different neurons in different ELM configurations (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1), firing rates during different configurations (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C) and the raster plots of the neuronal data used for the SVM classification (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors need to clarify how pyramidal neurons and interneurons were distinguished from each other (e.g., using the mean firing rate and spike width?),</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the differentiation between putative pyramidal cells and putative interneurons and re-analysed the data separating these two populations. We have used both the firing rate and the spike width (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2B; Figure 3 —figure supplement 3A, B; Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A, B; Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B; and see methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and how they removed sharp-wave ripple-associated spikes (e.g., using a speed filter?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the SWR detection to the methods, and we have re- analysed the neuronal activity after removing spikes associated with SWR periods (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3A; Figure 5 —figure supplement 1C; Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B). This did not change our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, before providing results of principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM), they need to verify that the mean firing rate before entering the open arm was positively or negatively correlated with the exploration types (i.e., proximal and distal exploration). Such correlation analysis may make the results of PCA and SVM more substantial.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the advice of the referee. We were previously using the PCA just as a visualisation tool to imply that the population was separating the two explorations based on the neuronal firing rate prior to entering the open arm. We have changed that, and we have decided to show the prediction of the exploration based on the activity of neuronal pairs. We plot examples of the neuronal firing rates, one with the neuronal firing rate per trial for the proximal and distal explorations (Figure 6B) and another as raster plots of those neurons' activity before entering the open arm (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A). In some cases, for example, in the example of session 2 (Figure 6B), you see that Neuron 8 (N8) activity is correlated with the explorations, but neuron 3 (N3) is not so much. Also, in the neuronal activity in example session 9, none of the two neurons entirely correlate with the exploration. Nevertheless, the advantage of the classifier is that it can still separate both explorations (distal and proximal) based on the combination of both neuronal firing rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, the current version of the manuscript lacks detailed behavioral data (e.g., velocity and position differences between proximal and distal exploration trials before entering the open arm), which may raise the alternative hypothesis that the difference in the neural activities between proximal and distal exploration could result from behavioral differences, not the prediction signals in the vHP. For example, in the proximal exploration trials, rats could be more hesitant and stayed longer near the boundary before entering the open arm than in the distal exploration trials. In contrast, in the distal exploration trials, rats might run toward the rewards in the open arm without hesitation. In that case, it is possible that the difference in neural activities between the exploration types could mainly reflect the difference in animal speed or how long they stayed near the boundary, not necessarily reflecting the animal's intention to explore the anxiogenic area. To address these concerns, the authors need to report detailed behavioral and neural data with respect to the issue. For example, they may need to provide a peri-event time histogram of the animal's velocity and position and spikes in relation to the time of entering the open arm. Alternatively, as they used spike-associated activity controlled by speed via the general linear model (GLM) in Figure 3F-3G and 4D-4E, they may apply this model to this analysis in Figure 5 to control the speed factor, etc, to name a few.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the clever observation. We did not account for it previously, and therefore we have performed two different analyses in the direction of the suggestion:</p><p>– We show that the speed of the animal prior to the entrance to the open arm (15 cm) is not significantly different between proximal and distal explorations. (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>– We were also able to predict the type of exploration (Distal or Proximal) in several sessions, using the spike-associated activity corrected by speed as suggested by the referee (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is unclear which neural firing data were used for the PCA and SVM analyses. The authors said &quot;firing rate of each neuron prior to the open arm ~ (line 478)&quot;, but it is confusing which moment they indicated by 'prior.' They need to quantitatively define 'prior' (e.g., activities within seconds before entering the open arm or activities within 10cm from the boundary between the open and closed arm).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity regarding the period during which firing rates were calculated for the SVM analyses. We have now clarified in the methods section that we took the data from the moment the animal headed towards the open area until the last bin covering the closed area. This time varies depending on the decision of the animal to start approaching the open area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If position or velocity was different depending on the exploration type, it could be that different place cells might be recruited during the &quot;firing rate prior to the open arm,&quot; which might result in distinct neural activities between proximal and distal exploration trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this possibility. We are now showing the results of the SVM classifiers, predicting the proximal or distal future exploration of the animal and controlling for speed-related associated firing (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B). In addition, we show that the actual speed of the animal, prior to the entrance of the open area in the CO configuration, is not significantly different between future proximal or distal explorations (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, they need to report how PCs in proximal and distal exploration were quantitatively separated between two exploration types in the entire session, not only for two sessions (Figure 5A).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion caused by not correctly labelling figure 5 (now figure 6). We are showing two examples (session 2 and session 9) in which the activity of a pair of neurons separates proximal and distal exploration (Figure 6B. We are no longer using PCA). However, Figure 6C shows three other sessions where the separation is possible, and the performance of the SVM is high. In addition, Figure 6D shows all the sessions (12 in total) and how the SVM can, better than shuffled data, discern between proximal and distal exploration in 9 of those sessions (green dots). We have improved the explanations of the figures and corrected the y-axis of Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In SVM analysis, the authors did not show raw data to demonstrate that the neural activities in proximal and distal exploration trials were properly distinguished through the hyperplane of SVM (Figure 5B). Thus, it is impossible to assess the validity of SVM analysis. The authors need to provide the graph whose x and y axes are associated with the neuronal activities and demonstrate that the hyperplane properly distinguished proximal and distal exploration trials. Moreover, they iteratively computed the performance of the SVM for all possible combinations of neurons and chose the combination that gave the highest performance for further analysis (Figure 5B – 5C). This may result in an overestimation of the results. For example, even if most combinations had low performance, it would be considered a high-performance session if there was only one combination of higher performance. Thus, the authors need to provide the results of all combinations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the presentation according to the suggestions and added new plots to address this:</p><p>– Figure 6B shows the x and y-axis with the z-score activity of the neuron during the session for the different trials.</p><p>– Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A shows raster plots of the neuronal activity.</p><p>– Figure 6 —figure supplement 2A shows in red boxplots the performance (differential to the optimal) of the rest of the population pairs in comparison with the selected pair (green line) and the shuffle data (black boxplots).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it seems more appropriate to infer performance using the ensemble data rather than based on a combination of two cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We create models with pairs of neurons instead of the entire population because of the possible overfitting that can be created when the number of observations is less than the number of variables used (e.g. 15 trials in total but 18 neurons). The heuristics in the number of necessary observations per variable are relatively subjective. However, a used rule of thumb is approximately 10 – 20 observations per variable (Valliappa Lakshmanan, Sara Robinson, and Michael Munn. <italic>Machine learning design patterns</italic>. O’Reilly Media, 2020). In our case, that will imply that a maximum of 2 neurons is closer to the best model to avoid overfitting. Then we used a wrapper-like method to determine which neuronal pair best predicted the exploration ID (proximal, distal). To avoid overfitting regarding this approach, we do not use the entire observations for the model and then determine a performance. In one-leave-out cross-validation, we predict each trial with the model trained in the other ones. The prediction of each trial is then used to calculate the final performance score per neuronal pair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Related suggestions/comments to the Public Review Weakness points:</p><p>Related suggestion to W1.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could make a clear comparison between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus with regard to anxiety responses and highlight what aspects are unique to the vH anxiety driven cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the positive evaluation of our manuscript and we agree with the reviewer's suggestion and have added dorsal hippocampus research to the discussion, in which aversive stimuli have been used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related suggestion to W2.</p><p>It would be helpful for readers to know which subpopulation of cells in vH function as the basis for dynamical remapping of anxiety information.</p><p>Additionally, it would be helpful to have a table describing how many neurons were recorded from each animal and from what subregions.

Interestingly, only minor differences were found in the differentiation. Those are discussed in the Discussion section.

I am having trouble understanding what is plotted in Figure 5c. The legend says &quot;Box plots show median, 25th and 75th percentile&quot;. But it is the median of what? What is plotted? Is it possible to plot these data in some other way?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion generated by our lack of clarity in the description. We have improved the description in the results and figure legends. In summary, the boxplots are the performance values of sessions where we have been shuffling the trial IDs (proximal and distal exploration). These are our shuffled distributions. However, to have all the sessions included in the same plot, we have subtracted the performance of the actual observed data from the shuffled ones. Therefore, the 0 values are the observed optimal performances, and the boxplots tend to have a negative value because the shuffling performance is reduced (Shuffling perf. – Observed perf.).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed most of my concerns. However, there are still some concerns that may need to be addressed (see below).</p><p>– (Figure 3A) The authors nicely illustrated single-cell examples in Figure 3 (and figure supplement 1A and 1B) to show broader place fields in the ventral hippocampus. However, when examining the individual cases, I am concerned that the z-transformed population rate maps in Figure 3A may give the reader the wrong impression that most cells in the ventral hippocampus have focal place fields. Furthermore, inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus also have their preferred firing locations where their firing rates are higher than others (Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2007, Hippocampus). As the current study didn't differentially analyze putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, it might be difficult to distinguish between activities in pyramidal neurons and interneurons when using the z-transformed rate maps. Therefore, it seems inappropriate to show the population activities using a z-transformed population rate map.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the advice of the referee and re-plotted the same data also without the z-scoring (new Figure 3- supplement 1C). In addition, we have added cautionary sentences into the result section, as well as to the figure legend :”It is important to note that most of the neurons do not have a spatially restricted activity similar to a typical place cell in the dorsal CA1 hippocampus, but still they exhibit a peak of activity associated to a spatial bin” and “Note that firing rates of neurons remain mostly in the middle ranges (green colour), which is different from classical place cells of the dorsal hippocampus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B) The authors used the averaged speed in the arena spanning 15 cm before crossing the open area to argue that there was no behavioral difference between proximal and distal exploration. However, 15 cm is an arbitrarily determined value, and I wonder if it can serve as a representative measurement to compare animal behavior between proximal and distal trials. This is mainly because they calculated firing rates for SVM analysis from the moment heading towards the open area, not the 15cm before crossing the boundary between closed and open areas. Thus, it might be much more appropriate to compare the speed from the moment heading toward the open area to the end of the closed area.</p><p>– Additionally, the authors should include statistical testing in Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B. Based on my observations, the speed of future proximal exploration seems significantly lower than that of future distal exploration in session 5. Along with the results of each session, it might be necessary to pool the data from all sessions and perform statistical testing in order to argue that there was no speed difference between proximal and distal exploration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. We have changed the speed boxplots to the same period used to calculate the firing rate. In addition, we have added the p-values in the figure for each session (only one of them shows significantly different speeds between proximal and distal exploration). We have also pooled all trials for all the animals and added the boxplot in the figure. We labelled it as ‘All Sessions’. We also did the analyses pooled per animal but found no significant differences; therefore, we are not showing those boxplots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– (Discussion) Keinath and colleagues (Hippocampus, 2014) argued that cells in the mouse ventral hippocampus showed more spatially selective firing patterns when aversive odor (i.e., predator's urine) was introduced in the open arena. This result contradicts the current manuscript because adding an anxiety factor seemed to decrease spatial firing characteristics in the current study as opposed to the results of Keinath et al. (2014). If the authors explain the potential factors of why there was a contradiction between Keinath and colleagues and the current study, it will be helpful to understand the importance of the ventral hippocampus in emotional information processing. Additionally, if the authors explain why the firing fields became larger but not smaller in anxiogenic space in processing emotional processing, it can give readers a clue about how the ventral hippocampus is involved in processing emotional information.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing the Keinath et al. (Hippocampus, 2014). We have included the paper in the discussion. Interestingly, we observed similar results in some aspects. We also observe remapping of neuronal activity in aversive conditions and, in fact, thanks to the suggestion of the reviewer, a tendency, yet no significance, of the neurons to increase their firing rate in the CO configuration compared to the CC (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1C). However, in our study, the activity of the neurons in vH increases its coverage, while in Keinath et al., it is reduced (smaller place fields). This type of conflicting finding is also found in dorsal hippocampus studies (we mentioned in the discussion Moita et al. and Scheutte et al.), and the origin of the differences might be attributed to different causes. The most notable difference between our study and Keinath et al. is that for them, the aversive stimulus is presented in a small area (4 squared cm in comparison with the arena area, which is close to 962 squared cm) while in our case the source of the anxiogenic stimulus cannot be pinpointed to a specific part of the open arm, most likely eliciting a less spatial related activity. In Keinath et al., the effects in place field size of vH neurons in-between conditions are not statistically marked in the barplot of figure 3H but in a report in table 1. Still, no post hoc statistical validation was performed, leaving us with an overall significant interaction between the condition and the region, but not a statistical comparison between neutral and aversive odour in the place field size of ventral hippocampal neurons. Nevertheless, these types of minor discrepancies are a motivation to study in even more detail the spatial vs emotional processing in the vH.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>If the authors used only male mice this fact must be stated in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and we have now added the use of male rats in the abstract.</p></body></sub-article></article>
