produce circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the extent of circRNA conservation between closely related species remains unclear. By comparing tissue-specific transcriptomes across over 70 million years of primate evolution, we identify that within 3 million years circRNA expression profiles diverged such that they are more related to species identity than organ type. However, our analysis also revealed a subset of circRNAs with conserved neural expression across tens of millions of years of evolution. By comparing to species-specific circRNAs, we identified that the downstream intron of the conserved circRNAs display a dramatic lengthening during evolution due to the insertion of novel retrotransposons. Our work provides comparative analyses of the mechanisms promoting circRNAs to generate increased transcriptomic complexity in primates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circRNA</kwd><kwd>comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>non-coding RNAs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voineagu</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name><name><surname>Weatheritt</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001171</institution-id><institution>Cancer Institute NSW</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weatheritt</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001773</institution-id><institution>UNSW Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santos-Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Gabriela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001773</institution-id><institution>University of New South Wales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scientia Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voineagu</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014622</institution-id><institution>Nutrition Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scrimshaw Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weatheritt</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(ARC) Discovery Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weatheritt</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Voineagu</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An analysis of the genomic features that distinguish conserved from species-specific circular RNAs reveals that the expansion of the downstream intron by insertion of retrotransposons stabilizes circular RNAs' production across 30+ millions years of evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An important question in biology is how has the complexity of biological systems expanded while the number of protein-coding genes has remained mostly stable. Through decades of research, it has been shown that increased biological complexity has arisen in part by the dynamic generation of unique cell-specific transcriptomes, and as a consequence of the highly versatile programs of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>). However, studies of tissues across distant animal lineages have shown that gene expression is highly conserved between the same tissues in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardoso-Moreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, gene expression alone is unlikely to explain the heterogeneous expansion in complexity (as defined by the number of cell types) across vertebrate evolution. Instead, it is becoming increasingly evident that the plethora of post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheetham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiszbein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gueroussov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mattick, 2018</xref>) capable of greatly expanding transcriptomic diversity also underlies these advances.</p><p>Among these, an intriguing class produced by pre-mRNA processing are circular RNAs (circRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gokool et al., 2020a</xref>). These RNAs can regulate protein localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), miRNA functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piwecka et al., 2017</xref>), and a range of other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gokool et al., 2020a</xref>), enabling increased regulatory complexity, especially in the immune and nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gokool et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piwecka et al., 2017</xref>). CircRNAs form by back-splicing whereby an exon’s 3′-splice site is ligated to an upstream 5′-splice site forming a closed circRNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Starke et al., 2015</xref>). Back-splicing occurs both co- and post-transcriptionally and is facilitated by inverted repeat elements that promote complementarity between adjacent introns favoring circRNA formation over linear splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). These RNA-RNA interactions can be facilitated by RNA-binding proteins, such as Quaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conn et al., 2015</xref>), that help stabilize the hair-pin structure promoting circRNA formation.</p><p>The production of circRNAs can also arise due to the perturbed expression of trans-factors and the inhibition of the core splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aktaş et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2017</xref>). These spuriously produced circRNAs are maintained as their circular shape protects them from the activity of cellular exonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gokool et al., 2020b</xref>). In contrast, the variable usage of cis-regulatory elements in exons and flanking introns can be selected to promote circRNA expression in a cell-type, condition- or species-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Irimia and Blencowe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nilsen and Graveley, 2010</xref>). Changes in circRNA expression may therefore represent a major source of species- and lineage-specific differences or error-prone mis-splicing. To provide insight into this quandary, here we describe a genome-wide analysis of circRNAs across physiologically equivalent organs from primate species spanning 70 million years of evolution. Our analysis uncovers extensive evidence of species-specific circRNAs that display no evidence of conservation even across relatively short evolutionary time periods. However, we also identify a small subset of circRNAs that are conserved across tens of millions of years displaying increased inclusion rates across evolutionary time. Our analysis comparing conserved circRNAs to species-specific circRNAs reveals that these circRNAs are flanked by newly inserted transposons that correlate with circRNA genesis and extend intron downstream of circRNA. Overall, our results identify evidence of circRNA conservation within closely related species and identify a reoccurring mechanism that correlates with circRNA genesis facilitating the expansion of transcriptomic complexity of primate cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A core subset of circRNAs show conserved expression signatures but most are species-specific</title><p>To address the outstanding questions about the conservation and functional importance of circRNAs, we collected transcriptomic (RNA-seq) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pipes et al., 2013</xref>) from across nine tissues from eight primate species, consisting of three old-world monkeys, two hominoids, two new-world monkeys, and one prosimian (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These species were chosen on the basis of the quality of their genomes and their close evolutionary relationships enabling the evaluation of transcriptome changes between species ranging from &lt;3 million years to &gt;70 million years (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each species, we considered all primate-conserved internal exons as potential origins of back-spliced junctions (BSJs) with no restrictions on backward exon combination. Only canonical and annotated splice sites were used in analysis. RNA-seq reads were mapped to exon-exon junctions (EEJs) to determine ‘percent spliced in’ (PSI) for all circRNA with respect to the linear transcript. We also calculated PSI values for linear splicing of each internal exon and transcript per million (TPM) values to estimate gene expression. Orthology relationships between genes and exons were established to enable direct cross-species comparisons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Circular RNA (circRNA) expression signatures are conserved in some tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of analyzed species with distance from human in millions of years (MYA) (divergence time according to TimeTree <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timetree.org/">http://www.timetree.org/</ext-link>).

In agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brawand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>) from analysis across vertebrate species, a clear pattern emerged of tissue-specific conservation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This pattern suggests that most tissues possess a tissue-specific gene expression signature such that, for example, a liver-specific gene in chimp will likely also be liver-specific in lemur. In contrast to previous observations in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>), there are no clear species-specific exceptions to these patterns likely reflecting the closer evolutionary relationships studied.</p><p>To understand circRNA relationships between species, we performed an analogous pairwise clustering analysis using circRNA inclusion values. Replicates from the same tissue invariably clustered together. However, in contrast to gene expression, circRNA expression is segregated by species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This suggests that despite all the exons studied being conserved across primates the majority of circRNAs showed species-specific expression with no orthologous circRNAs in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, ~67% are species-specific, n = 11,201). To evaluate the expression patterns of circRNA orthologs, we identified circRNAs with matched BSJs (see Materials and methods) conserved across ~45 million years of evolution. In this analysis, more complex patterns of circRNA conservation emerged with tissue-dominated clustering observed across all types of brain samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in line with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venø et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">You et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, for all other tissues circRNAs showed primarily species-specific clustering.</p><p>We next assessed if these changes may be explained by gene expression changes in the host gene. A comparison of genes containing conserved and species-specific circRNAs did not show any significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B</xref>, p=0.584 Wilcoxon rank-sum test), suggesting that differences between these subgroups are not driven by gene expression differences. We next evaluated if tissue-specific changes observed in the conserved circRNAs were due to tissue-specific gene expression or alternative splicing. Interestingly, genes containing conserved circRNAs neither displayed neural-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or neural-specific alternative splicing changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that circRNA conservation and expression is independent of these regulatory layers.</p><p>We next investigated the genes containing circRNAs. Many orthologous genes consistently express circRNAs even if the precise BSJ is not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This phenomenon persisted across species with a median of 10 circRNAs detected per gene across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, this circRNA production only occurred in a limited number of expressed genes (20.4% of orthologous expressed genes). This suggests that certain genomic areas are circRNA factories that are prone to produce large numbers of lowly expressed circRNAs.</p><p>These observations suggest that a core set of circRNAs show conserved tissue-specific patterns across neural tissues. However, the great prevalence of circRNAs showing species-specific expression indicates that the cis-regulatory or trans-regulatory environments may differ between even very closely related species to promote the species-specific production of circRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Features of conserved circRNAs</title><p>Our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) reveals clear subsets of several hundred circRNAs exhibiting highly conserved circRNA expression.

A further key distinguishing feature of interest was intron length. Conserved circRNAs exhibited shorter introns downstream of the first exon and an extended intron downstream of the final exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

In contrast to orthologous lemur introns, the human introns downstream of all identified circRNAs shows an almost fourfold expansion compared to background dataset of introns within circRNA containing genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, p&lt;3.84 × 10<sup>–23</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum) and the upstream adjacent intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, p&lt;1.02 × 10<sup>–10</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum).

Further evaluation of the retrotransposons revealed that this increase in length is driven by the novel insertion of AluJ and L1 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, AluJ: p&lt;0.018; L1: p&lt;1.73 × 10<sup>–04</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum).

Together, this argues for the role of young transposons in creating longer intronic regions, which increases the time for RNA polymerase II to reach next canonical splice site and therefore increases likelihood of back-junction splicing to occur.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The evolution of circRNAs has been previously studied across extensive evolutionary time revealing poor conservation for the majority of circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Venø et al., 2015</xref>). Our approach is unique as it focuses on the conservation of circRNAs in very closely related species, enabling us to account for the rapid evolution of these RNAs. This increased resolution allowed us to compare conserved versus non-conserved circRNAs, enabling us to reveal two disparate facts about circRNA expression. Firstly, we observe extensive variation in the production of the vast majority of circRNAs between species. With circRNAs often expressed within the same orthologous genes even if BSJ is not conserved. Conversely, we identify a core set of over 700 circRNAs that are conserved across millions of years of evolution. These circRNAs have higher inclusion rates and show increased inclusion across evolutionary age. Both groups are related in the cis- and trans-regulatory features that correlate with circRNA formation such as evidence of recent transposons insertion and extended adjacent introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2017</xref>). In line with previous work, the majority of circRNAs identified arose from the same gene locus (alternative circularization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burd et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salzman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>); however, we identify that this phenomenon is largely limited to species-specific circRNAs and disappears in the conserved group. Similarly, we identify that the adjacent introns of circRNAs are significantly longer with inverted Alu repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2017</xref>); however, only in the conserved group do we observe a bias towards lengthening of the downstream adjacent intron with inverted L1 repeats dominating. Finally, in contrast to previous work, we do not identify that conserved circRNAs are more strongly expressed but instead that conserved circRNAs have greater relative expression compared to linear transcript with this ratio increasing with the evolutionary age of the circRNA. This decreased diversity of conserved circRNA production and increased relative expression is in line with data from linear splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baek and Green, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gueroussov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Irimia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>) and suggests circRNA selection is occurring. However, an important limitation of our approach is our usage of annotated splice sites, thus limiting our conclusions to exonic circRNAs from canonical splice sites.</p><p>A host of endogenous mechanisms dampen down the impact of the retrotransposons within gene bodies. For example, the formation of Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zarnack et al., 2013</xref>) and the nuclear helicase DHX9 binds to inverted repeat Alu elements to suppress circRNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aktaş et al., 2017</xref>). Over time though, in selected examples, these inclusions can promote novel functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avgan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2011</xref>), enabling the creation of tissue-specific exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Attig et al., 2018</xref>), miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spengler et al., 2014</xref>), and promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest that circRNAs are undergoing a similar selection race with the recent insertion of multiple retrotransposons promoting increased circRNA production that in some cases stabilizes over time. It is important to note though that the production of a large number of circRNAs in itself can be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). For example, in the immune system a wide diversity of circRNAs are produced to sequester-specific RNA-binding proteins. These proteins are released upon viral infection to inhibit translation of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). A major challenge for the field in the following years will arise from determining the contribution of noise versus function for each of these groups.</p><p>The investigation of mechanisms controlling circRNA production is a rapid and expanding field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2018b</xref>). Our results support a kinetic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schor et al., 2013</xref>) for circRNA function whereby trans-factors promote spliceosome recruitment to the final exon and the very long downstream introns extend the time window for back-splicing to occur. This is facilitated by inverted repeats increasing the proximity of 3′-splice site with the upstream 5′-splice site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The extension of the final intron therefore increases the likelihood of circRNA formation in time and space. Spatially by introducing new retrotransposons, which facilitates RNA-RNA duplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>) to orientate the splice sites in close proximity and temporary by increasing the intron length, it expands the time window for such an event to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Veloso et al., 2014</xref>), which acts independent of the rate of RNA polymerase II across the gene body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). This model conforms with the previous observations of enrichment of inverted repeat Alu elements and of long introns surrounding circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang and Wilusz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The conservation of circRNAs we observe could therefore just be a result of increasing the probability for such an event to occur rather than evidence of functionality. However, circRNAs represent an extreme example of a trend in post-transcriptional regulation whereby low leaky expression creates a pool of possible novel substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avgan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiszbein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mattick, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reyes et al., 2013</xref>), increasing the likelihood for unique functionality to arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gueroussov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). For circRNAs, this can be aided by single-nucleotide changes that enable trans-acting factors, such as Quaking, ADAR, or NF90/110, to facilitate circRNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our evolutionary analysis identifies that the noisy production of circRNAs is driven by the insertion of novel transposons in adjacent downstream introns that can over time stabilize to produce conserved circRNAs.

The memory used for each program is the maximum resident set size value from the time program output.

across 70 million years of primate evolution.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors analyzed circRNA expression in several tissues across 9 species representing 70 million years of primate evolution. They report that while most circRNAs are species-specific, with the exception of a subset of approx. brain-specific 700 circRNAs. Common features of these circRNAs are their high PSI values, low number of exons, unique back-splicing junction sites and, most significantly, increased lengths of their downstream introns, which is associated with the insertion of young transposons. The authors propose that increased intron length provides a longer kinetic window for back-splicing events, which favors the production of circRNAs.</p><p>These results are timely and interesting, given current controversies about the general functionality of circRNAs and our limited knowledge of their evolution and regulatory mechanisms. However in our opinion the manuscript is in need of substantial revisions in two main fronts:</p><p>a) Improved data analyses, including validation of the nature of the circRNAs detected by their pipeline (e.g. using RNaseR), filtering by gene expression, more stringent specificity controls and cross-validation by other dedicated software tools.</p><p>b) Further contextualization of the findings, including properly citing and discussing previous essential literature that reported related findings and conclusions and revising causality claims based upon correlative associations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>a) Improved data analyses,</p><p>a.1. It is essential to document some type of validation of the circRNAs detceted (e.g. by RNaseR), as many back-splicing junctions can be caused by artifacts of reverse transcription or alignment.</p><p>a.2. Filtering for gene expression. When comparing features of conserved circRNAs and species-specific circRNAs, it is important to use similarly-expressed circRNAs for comparison, as using highly-expressed conserved circRNAs to compare with relatively lowly-expressed species-specific circRNAs might lead to biased conclusions. Similarly-expressed groups of conserved circRNAs and species-specific circRNAs should be selected for analyses (Figure 3B). In the current version, the authors selected circRNAs with at least 5 reads and ≥ 5% PSI for their analysis. However, since the sequence depths of different species vary largely (supplemental table 1) from less than 20 millions of reads in some samples to more than 120 millions of reads in some other samples, this selection of circRNAs with at least 5 reads and ≥ 5% PSI is biased across species and would be problematic for cross sample comparison due to unbalanced sequencing depths.</p><p>a.3. The authors used Whippet to analyze both circRNAs and linear RNAs. However, this tool was originally developed to analyze canonical splicing events, and it is unclear how it performs on circRNA prediction. In addition, it has been suggested to combine some other tools, such as CIRCexplorer and MapSplice, together for reliable circRNA prediction (e.g. Hansen et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2016). Otherwise, the authors need to show convincingly that using Whippet alone is better than the suggested tools. In addition, the authors should carefully quantify circRNAs by considering different sequence depths across samples.</p><p>a.4. A number of publications have shown the association of long introns with circRNA expression, and more importantly, that the pairing between flanking introns of circRNAs is required for circRNA biogenesis in mouse and human. In line 42, an important reference, Zhang et al., Cell 2014, PMID: 25242744, should be cited to mention that &quot;inverted repeat elements that promote complementarity between adjacent introns favouring circRNA formation&quot;. Similar conclusions may be reached in this study. For example, in Figure 3B, L2_flank and L1_flank can be the key features that discriminate the conserved and species-specific circRNAs, while the pairing between them in flanking introns may be more important than intron lengths for circRNA formation. In this case, it might be biased to emphasize the importance of downstream intron length for evolutionary circRNA biogenesis.</p><p>a.5. To show the significance of the downstream intron lengths for conserved circRNA formation, the authors should use lengths of upstream introns of conserved circRNAs as internal controls.</p><p>a.6. It is also not clear how to solve the problem caused by multicollinearity when predicting elements for circRNA biogenesis. It is possible a collinearity between long downstream introns with their pairing between flanking (long) upstream and downstream introns.</p><p>a.7. It has been shown that expressed circRNAs are enriched with 2-3 exons in multiple early studies. In this case, the low number of exons might not be specific for conserved circRNAs, but commonly among expressed circRNAs. The authors can compare the numbers of exons of conserved circRNAs with those of expressed (except conserved circRNAs) and all expressed circRNAs.</p><p>a.8. On page 18 the authors defined relative TPM values. However, the definitions of circRNAsRead and GeneRead are not clear.</p><p>b) Further contextualization of the findings. Relevant aspects of the authors' findings have been previously reported and should be properly cited and discussed, including</p><p>b.1. The reports by Rybak et al. (Mol Cell 2015), Veno et al. (Genome Biol. 2015) and You et al. (Nature Neuro 2015, which is not even cited) described that brain circRNAs are conserved, as well as several of the features described for these circRNAs in the manuscript.</p><p>b.2. Consider the orientation of the inserted transposons (as showed in Chen LL et al., Cell 2014)</p><p>b.3. Extension of downstream introns and inefficient cleavage and polyadenylation are well described as factors modulating exon circularization (see Liang et al. Mol Cell 2017, Ashwall et al., Mol Cell 2014).</p><p>b.4. In the abstract the authors state that &quot;many primate genes produce non-coding circular RNAs&quot;. This statement is not precise as it is not clear how many of the circRNAs are coding and how many non-coding. The non-coding should be eliminated. Moreover, seems like the authors don't even know about the research showing that some circRNAS are translated.</p><p>b.5. In line 41, the authors stated that &quot;Back-splicing occurs co-transcriptionally&quot; but it has been shown that back-splicing might occur not only co-transcriptionally (Ashwall Fluss et al. Mol Cell 2014) but both co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally (Zhang et al., Cell Rep 2016, PMID: 27068474).</p><p>b.6. The most important model of this paper is that insertion of young transposon into downstream introns results in longer intronic regions, which delay the RNA polymerase II to the next splice site and increase the possibility of circRNA conservation. However, it has been reported that &quot;Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons&quot; (Jonkers et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014) and &quot;back-splicing outcomes correlate with fast RNA Polymerase II elongation rate&quot; (Zhang et al., Mol Cell 2016). In this case, longer introns might lead to fast, but not slow RNA polymerase II for circRNAs.</p><p>b.7. This manuscript mainly showed the insertion of LINE for circRNA expression and conservation. However, previous studies have suggested the importance of SINE elements, especially Alu elements of primates, in circRNA biogenesis (for example, Jeck et al., RNA 2013, PMID: 23249747; Zhang et al., Cell 2014, PMID: 25242744; Dong et al., RNA Biol 2017, PMID: 27982734). Did the authors observe that Alu is less involved in primate circRNA expression than LINE? Or, since Alu is prevalent among primates, their contribution to conserved circRNAs is less important than LINE?</p><p>b.8. In line 39, the authors cited Guo et al., Cell 2020 to show as examples of functional circular RNAs especially in the immune and nervous systems, but it has nothing to do with circular RNAs.</p><p>b.9. In line 44, Quaking was not likely to be suggested to facilitate &quot;these (assumedly inverted repeat elements) RNA-RNA interactions&quot;, instead, ADAR (Ivanov et al., Cell Rep 2015, PMID: 25558066; Rybak-Wolf et al., Mol Cell 2015, PMID: 25921068), DHX9 (Aktaş et al., Nature 2017, PMID: 28355180), NF90/110 (Li et al., Mol Cell 2017, PMID: 28625552) were suggested to be involved in inverted repeat element RNA-RNA interactions to regulate circular RNA biogenesis.</p><p>b.10. In line 67, the authors cited Pipes et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2013 to suggest their used datasets in this study. However, many samples originally in Pipes et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2013 had only mRNA-seq, without total RNA-seq Total RNA-seq datasets for many those samples were updated in Peng et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2015, which should be referenced.</p><p>c) Revising causality claims based upon associative correlations:</p><p>c.1. In line 101 the authors state &quot;Many orthologous genes consistently express circRNAs even of the precise back-spliced junction is not conserved implicating importance of trans-factors in controlling cirRNA formation&quot;. There is no logic in this statement, long introns and random insertion of repetitive elements in inverse orientation could explain this w/o invoking any trans-acting factor.</p><p>c.2. The authors claim that &quot;Anaylsis of the exonic structure of conserved circRNAs, showed that conserved circRNAs contain fewer exons, and rarely overlap with other circRNAs (Figure 2G, p = 4:08. 10*64, Fisher exact test; see Methods) displaying back-splicing at unique 5´- and 3´-splice sites. This indicates that these conserved circRNAs possess unique cis- or trans-regulatory features that enable a tight control of the number of exons within a circRNA and the back-spliced junctions used.&quot; This is not necessarily like that and the 2 aspects could be concurrent/codependent on a different factor (i.e. intron length).</p><p>c.3. After looking for predictive genomic features for circRNA biosynthesis the authors conclude that: &quot;This indicates a core set of 24 cis- and trans-regulatory features drive the conserved formation of circRNAs compared to our background set of introns&quot; This is factually and conceptually wrong, as opredictive value does not mean causality. So likely most of these factors are co-occurring, which is still interesting but should not be overstated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;Evolutionary dynamics of circular RNAs in primates&quot;, Gabriela Santos-Rodriguez et al. analyzed the circRNA expression in severl tissue samples across 9 primate species. They showed that most circRNAs are species-specifically expressed, while a subset of circRNAs were neural tissue-specifically expressed across species. These conserved circRNAs commonly had high PSI values, low number of exons and unique back-splicing junction sites. After evaluated hundreds of potential regulatory elements that might regulate circRNA biogenesis, the authors found that the insertion of young transposons, which expands the lengths of downstream introns, may up-regulate the expression of circRNAs and could be involved in conserved circRNA expression. Although obtained these interesting conclusions, there are key concerns related with their applied methods and claims. For example, the authors used Whippet to analyze both circRNAs and linear RNAs. However, this tool was originally developed to analyze canonical splicing events, and it is unclear how it performs on circRNA prediction. In addition, it has been suggested to combine some other tools, such as CIRCexplorer and MapSplice, together for reliable circRNA prediction (Hansen et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2016 and etc.).</p><p>The main and most important model of this paper is that insertion of young transposon into downstream introns results in longer intronic regions, which delay the RNA polymerase II to the next splice site and increase the possibility of circRNA conservation.

In this case, longer introns might lead to fast, but not slow RNA polymerase II for circRNAs.</p><p>Meanwhile, a number of published references have shown the association of long introns with circRNA expression, and more importantly, the pairing between flanking introns of circRNAs is required for circRNA biogenesis in mouse and human. Similar conclusion can be obtained in this study. For example, in Figure 3B, L2_flank and L1_flank can be the key features that discriminate the conserved and species-specific circRNAs, while the pairing between them in flanking introns may be more important than intron lengths for circRNA formation. In this case, it might be biased to emphasize the importance of downstream intron length for evolutionary circRNA biogenesis.</p><p>When cited references of Barbosa-Morais et al., Science 2012 and Merkin et al., Science 2012, the authors stated that &quot;gene expression is highly conserved between the same tissues in different species&quot;. However, Barbosa-Morais et al. have clearly mentioned in their abstract that &quot;Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type&quot;. In addition, Merkin et al. also stated that &quot;alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific&quot;. Together, these cited papers emphasized the species-specific alternative splicing, which can be extended to back-splicing, as back-splicing is a new type of alternative splicing. In this case, alternative splicing (should include back-splicing) can, at least partially, explain the heterogeneous expansion in complexity across evolution.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Additional analyses should be performed to address the concerns listed in public review with stringent setup for prediction and comparison. In addition, many mis-cited references should be also corrected, including those listed below.</p><p>1. The authors need to use other suggested tools that are specific for circRNA prediction for their analyses. Otherwise, the authors need to show convincing results that using Whippet alone is better than the suggested tools. In addition, the authors should carefully quantify circRNAs by considering different sequence depths across samples.</p><p>2. To show the significance of the downstream intron lengths for conserved circRNA formation, the authors may want to use lengths of upstream introns of conserved circRNAs as internal controls to draw this conclusion.</p><p>3. When comparing features of conserved circRNAs and species-specific circRNAs, it is better to used similarly-expressed circRNAs for comparison. Using highly-expressed conserved circRNAs to compare with relatively lowly-expressed species-specific circRNAs might lead to biased conclusion.</p><p>4. This manuscript mainly showed the insertion of LINE for circRNA expression and conservation. However, previous studies have suggested the importance of SINE elements, especially Alu elements of primates, in circRNA biogenesis (for example, Jeck et al., RNA 2013, PMID: 23249747; Zhang et al., Cell 2014, PMID: 25242744; Dong et al., RNA Biol 2017, PMID: 27982734). Did the authors observe that Alu is less involved in primate circRNA expression than LINE? Or, since Alu is prevalent among primates, their contribution to conserved circRNAs is less important than LINE?</p><p>5. More stringent comparisons and controls are needed throughout the study. For example, similarly-expressed groups of conserved circRNAs and species-specific circRNAs should be selected for analyses (Figure 3B). In the current version, the authors selected circRNAs with at least 5 reads and ≥ 5% PSI for their analysis. However, since the sequence depths of different species vary largely (supplemental table 1) from less than 20 millions of reads in some samples to more than 120 millions of reads in some other samples, this selection of circRNAs with at least 5 reads and ≥ 5% PSI is biased across species and would be problematic for cross sample comparison due to unbalanced sequencing depths.</p><p>6. It is also not clear how to solve the problem caused by multicollinearity when predicting elements for circRNA biogenesis. It is possible a collinearity between long downstream introns with their pairing between flanking (long) upstream and downstream introns.</p><p>7. It has been shown that expressed circRNAs are enriched with 2-3 exons in multiple early studies. In this case, the low number of exons might not be specific for conserved circRNAs, but commonly among expressed circRNAs. The authors can compare the numbers of exons of conserved circRNAs with those of expressed except conserved circRNAs and all expressed circRNAs.</p><p>8.

In line 41, the authors stated that &quot;Back-splicing occurs co-transcriptionally&quot;, but it has been shown that back-splicing might occur both co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally (Zhang et al., Cell Rep 2016, PMID: 27068474). Please correct.</p><p>10.

In line 44, Quaking was not likely to be suggested to facilitate &quot;these (assumedly inverted repeat elements) RNA-RNA interactions&quot;, instead, ADAR (Ivanov et al., Cell Rep 2015, PMID: 25558066; Rybak-Wolf et al., Mol Cell 2015, PMID: 25921068), DHX9 (Aktaş et al., Nature 2017, PMID: 28355180), NF90/110 (Li et al., Mol Cell 2017, PMID: 28625552) were suggested to be involved in inverted repeat element RNA-RNA interactions to regulate circular RNA biogenesis.</p><p>12. In line 67, the authors cited Pipes et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2013 to suggest their used datasets in this study. However, lots of samples originally in Pipes et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2013 had only mRNA-seq, without totally RNA-seq, and totally RNA-seq datasets for many those samples were updated in Peng et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2015.

This is indeed a very important and timely topic given the doubts about the functionality of circRNAs and the little we know about their evolution. Briefly, the authors compare tissue specific transcriptomes across 70 million years of primate evolution. They found that most circRNAs are not conserved with the exception of a subset of approx. 700 brain specific circRNAs. Interestingly, the authors found that those circRNAs are defined by an extended downstream intron that is lengthening during evolution due to the insertion of transposons. While the findings are interesting and the manuscript timely, it doesn't bring much new information and seems to ignore essential knowledge in the field.</p><p>– The main findings of the manuscript have been previously reported and seem to be ignored by the authors, that they didn't cite and/or discuss them. For example, the reports by Rybak et al. (Mol Cell 2015), Veno et al. (Genome Biol. 2015) and You et al. (Nature Neuro 2015, which is not even cited) described that brain circRNAs are conserved as well as several of the features described for them in the manuscript. A lot of the work described there has been described in these and other reports. So the manuscript doesn't bring novelty regarding to the conservation of brain specific circRNAs.</p><p>– Moreover, the data analysis seems a little superficial. First, the authors utilized total RNAseq, without any type of validation (e.g. RNAseR). Moreover, the authors don't even mention the fact that many backsplicing junctions are usually artifacts of reverse transcription or alignment. Moreover, the authors don't seem to apply any filter to gene expression of the circRNAs and some of the criteria utilized is not really justified. For example, very abundant circRNAs might have low PSI if the host gene is expressed at high levels.</p><p>– The authors ignore literature in the field regarding circRNA biogenesis. This is important as the authors should consider the orientation of the inserted transposons (as showed in Chen LL et al., Cell 2014) when postulating their model. Moreover, extension of downstream introns and inefficient cleavage and polyadenylation are well described as factors modulating exon circularization (see Liang et al. Mol Cell 2017, Ashwall et al., Mol Cell 2014). This is not minor, as suggest the authors don't know (or chose to ignore) major literature in the field that shows that some of the findings are not new/novel.</p><p>– There are a lot of logical/conceptual mistakes in the text in which correlations are stated as causal relationships. A few examples of them are listed below:</p><p>o In line 101 the authors say &quot;Many orthologous genes consistently express circRNAs even of the precise back-spliced junction is not conserved implicating importance of trans-factors in controlling cirRNA formation&quot;. There is no logic in this statement, long introns and random insertion of repetitive elements in inverse orientation could explain this w/o invoking any trans-acting factor.</p><p>o The authors claim that &quot;Anaylsis of the exonic structure of conserved circRNAs, showed that conserved circRNAs contain fewer exons, and rarely overlap with other circRNAs (Figure 2G, p = 4:08. 10*64, Fisher exact test; see Methods) displaying back-splicing at unique 5´- and 3´-splice sites. This indicates that these conserved circRNAs possess unique cis- or trans-regulatory features that enable a tight control of the number of exons within a circRNA and the back-spliced junctions used.&quot; This is not necessary like that and the 2 things could be concurrent/codependent on a different factor (i.e. intron length).</p><p>o After looking for predictive genomic features for circRNA biosynthesis the authors conclude that: &quot;This indicates a core set of 24 cis- and trans-regulatory features drive the conserved formation of circRNAs compared to our background set of introns&quot; This is factually and conceptually wrong, predictive value does not mean causality. So likely most of these factors are co-current. This is still interesting but the attempt of overstating is alarming.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69148.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>a) Improved data analyses,</p><p>a.1. It is essential to document some type of validation of the circRNAs detceted (e.g. by RNaseR), as many back-splicing junctions can be caused by artifacts of reverse transcription or alignment.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the dangers of false positives due to the artefacts of reverse transcription and alignment. This was the reason we required that all detected circular RNAs in our analysis were supported by at least 5 reads. We also agree that an orthogonal validation from an additional source would further increase confidence in the circRNAs we detected, as well as the subsequent analysis. We undertook this in two major ways:</p><p>Firstly, we overlapped our analysis with circRNAs previously identified in the peer-reviewed databases, circAtlas. This analysis revealed that 99.5% of conserved circRNAs and 97.03% of species-specific circRNAs in our analysis have been previously identified. Given that circAtlas used a different alignment program this increases our confidence that our results are not false positives due to alignment issues. To describe this result, we have added the following text to the Results section:</p><p>“To validate the quality of our identified circRNAs, we initially overlapped our data with circRNAs previously reported in circAtlas (Wu et al. 2020). This analysis found that 99.5% of the conserved circRNAs and 97.03% of species-specific circRNAs have been previously reported.”</p><p>Secondly, we curated a list of published human RNase R datasets (see Supplementary File 1). These datasets primarily came from cell lines, in contrast to our samples that were all from tissue data. Despite the known tissue and cell-specificity of circRNAs, we were still able to validate in RNase R data 82.7% of the conserved circRNAs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) and 62.3% of the species-specific circRNAs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). To further validate our findings that we can identify conserved circRNAs, we expanded our analysis to RNase R data from macaque data. In this analysis, we were able to validate ~85% of the conserved circRNAs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2E). All these results have been added to Results section and Methods. With the following text added to the Results section:</p><p>“Additionally, we verified our circRNAs dataset using Rnase R data (see Methods for details). […] To validate the conservation of our neuronal circRNAs, we next analyzed Rnase R samples from different brain macaque regions.

Filtering for gene expression. When comparing features of conserved circRNAs and species-specific circRNAs, it is important to use similarly-expressed circRNAs for comparison, as using highly-expressed conserved circRNAs to compare with relatively lowly-expressed species-specific circRNAs might lead to biased conclusions. Similarly-expressed groups of conserved circRNAs and species-specific circRNAs should be selected for analyses (Figure 3B). In the current version, the authors selected circRNAs with at least 5 reads and ≥ 5% PSI for their analysis. However, since the sequence depths of different species vary largely (supplemental table 1) from less than 20 millions of reads in some samples to more than 120 millions of reads in some other samples, this selection of circRNAs with at least 5 reads and ≥ 5% PSI is biased across species and would be problematic for cross sample comparison due to unbalanced sequencing depths.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that differences in read depth of samples may bias to increased detection of circRNAs in datasets with greater depth. This would result in (i) the conserved circRNAs being within genes with higher expression than species-specific genes (ii) conserved circRNAs being more highly expressed.</p><p>We, therefore, compared the relative expression of genes with conserved circRNAs with genes with species-specific circRNAs (see Methods). This analysis showed no significant difference between the expression of genes with conserved circRNAs and genes with species-specific circRNAs (Figure 2—figure supplement 4B). To describe this result the following text has been added to the Results section of the manuscript:</p><p>“A comparison of genes containing conserved and species-specific circRNAs did not show any significant differences (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and 4B, p = 0.584 Wilcoxon rank-sum test)”.</p><p>Despite, similar levels of gene expression the difference may still be due to tissue-specific gene expression of genes containing conserved circRNAs. We therefore assessed if the genes with conserved circRNAs had the same tissue-specificity as the conserved circRNAs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Our results suggest that the conserved circRNA expression levels are not driven by the expression of the genes that contain the circRNA.</p><p>We have rewritten the Results section as follows to highlight this point more clearly:</p><p>“We next assessed if these changes may be explained by gene expression changes in the host gene. […] This suggests that circRNA conservation and expression is independent of these regulatory layers.”</p><p>We next assessed the expression of conserved circRNAs relative to species-specific circRNAs. If read depth were a major bias we would expect to observe that conserved circRNAs have an increased expression. However, our analysis reveals no significant differences of conserved versus species-specific circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. p&lt; 0.187, Wilcoxon rank-sum test conserved vs species-specific; Figure 2C).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Conserved and species-specific circRNAs expression distributions.</title><p>Violin plots describing relative expression levels of conserved and species-specific circRNAs. circRNA expression is measured in Relative TpM values.

The authors used Whippet to analyze both circRNAs and linear RNAs. However, this tool was originally developed to analyze canonical splicing events, and it is unclear how it performs on circRNA prediction. In addition, it has been suggested to combine some other tools, such as CIRCexplorer and MapSplice, together for reliable circRNA prediction (e.g. Hansen et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2016). Otherwise, the authors need to show convincingly that using Whippet alone is better than the suggested tools. In addition, the authors should carefully quantify circRNAs by considering different sequence depths across samples.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we have restricted circRNAs identification to only those using canonical and annotated splice sites, and to circRNAs derived from exons to avoid identification of circRNAs from cryptic splice sites, which is a major source of false positives in circRNA detection (Hansen et al. 2015). This is an important proviso to our analysis that we have now added to the Results section and we also mention it as a limitation in the Discussion section:</p><p>In the Results section: “For each species, we considered all primate-conserved internal exons as potential origins of back-spliced junctions with no restrictions on backward exon combination. Only canonical and annotated splice sites were used in the analysis.”</p><p>In the discussion: “An important limitation of our approach is our usage of annotated splice sites thus limiting our conclusions to exonic circRNAs from canonical splice sites.”</p><p>Whippet enables the detection of any combination of annotated exons. In the original paper, we only validated Whippet for combination of exons in the linear direction. The reviewer is correct that we did not benchmark Whippet for combination of exons in the reverse direction (i.e. circRNAs). To undertake this benchmark, we created a simulated dataset of circRNAs using the peer-reviewed program CIRI-simulator. This program stochastically selects whether a transcript will generate circular or linear reads. Combinations of exons to create the circRNAs are chosen at random. Reads for the linear RNAs and circRNAs are generated randomly from the RNA sequences. See the original article for more details (Gao et al. 2015. Genome Biology).</p><p>We used CIRI-simulator to generate different sequencing data from chromosome 1 using the chromosome 1 fasta from the hg19 human genome and its GTF annotation file obtained from the CIRI software repository (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ciri/). We selected read depths of 10, 20, and 40 fold with default insert length, read length of 75, and no sequencing errors (see Methods for details).</p><p>Whippet was run “—circ” flag to enable identification back-splicing and default settings (see methods). We compared Whippet to the most highly cited circRNA detection programs (CircExplorer3, find_circ, and CIRIquant). We used default recommended parameters as previously reported (see Methods for details). We benchmarked both the accuracy of all programs, plus their relative speeds and memory usage.</p><p>Whippet consistently identified ~90% of circRNAs simulated by CIRI-simulator across all read depths (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C). This suggests that read depth had relatively little impact on Whippet’s ability to detect circRNAs. At high read depths, CircExplorer 3 identified circRNAs with a similar detection rate to Whippet. However, CircExplorer v3 detection rate was more dramtically affected by read depth, as at lower read depths, its detection rate slipped to 77%. In contrast Whippet’s detection rate was 89.7%. Similarly for CIRIquant, at high read depths, it has a similar rate of detection than Whippet and CircExplorer 3. But, at low depths, the detection rate lowered to 82%. The sequencing depth most dramatically affects find_circ detection rate, where its lowest detection rate (42%) was found at the lowest sequencing depth and its highest detection rate (79%) was found at the highest sequencing depth (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C in Results section). Altogether, this suggests at high read depths Whippet and the majority of programs can successfully detect the majority of simulated circRNAs. However, in contrast to other programs, at lower read depths Whippet maintains its high detection rate.</p><p>We also analyzed matched datasets of poly(A) and ribo-minus RNA-seq data taken from the same samples to assess Whippet’s false positive rate (Gookol et al. 2019). This analysis revealed Whippet had a false positive rate (i.e. the percentage of circRNAs detected in DS1 data that were also detected in the polyA+ data from the same sample) of &lt;2%, which is in line with FPR from other tools (Gookol et al. 2019).</p><p>We next benchmarked the speed and computational efficiency of the programs using the default Linux terminal program “time” (Methods). We used the sample GOK5490A11_S15_ba9RD from Gookol et al. 2019 that has a sequencing depth of almost 55M. Whippet directly analyses fastq RNA-seq files, and therefore comparisons to other algorithms included alignment steps, which used aligner recommended by each respective program. This analysis shows that Whippet analyses RNA-seq data for circRNAs in 1 hr 9 mins and 20s with a memory usage of just ~2 GB (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and 3B). This is, on average, over 10x fold faster than other programs run with a considerably smaller memory overhead. Furthermore, Whippet also quantifies alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and gene expression within this same timeframe.</p><p>We have added this information to the methods, as well as the following text to the Results section:</p><p>“The circRNA analysis was done using Whippet (Sterne-Weiler, Weatheritt, Best, Ha, &amp; Blencowe, 2018)because, according to our benchmarking results (see Methods for details), it is an accurate and fast circRNA quantification tool. Our analysis of both simulated and collected RNA-seq data found that Whippet has a low false positive rate (&lt; 2%, see Methods for details), which is in line with other methods (Szabo et al., 2015, Gookol et al., 2020), a high rate of circRNA identification even at low read depths (~90%; Figure 1—figure supplement 3C) and is faster (~69 minutes) with less computational overhead (&lt; 3GB of memory on a single core) than other highly cited circRNA algorithms we compared with (circExplorer 3 (Ma et al., 2019), CIRIquant (Zhang et al., 2020), and find_circ (Memczak et al., 2013)) (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and 3B).”</p><p>Together, this suggests Whippet is able to accurately detect circRNAs. Furthermore, Whippet is more robust to changes in read depth and is considerably quicker than all other tested programs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a.4. A number of publications have shown the association of long introns with circRNA expression, and more importantly, that the pairing between flanking introns of circRNAs is required for circRNA biogenesis in mouse and human.

[…] This decreased diversity of conserved circRNA production and increased relative expression is in line with data from linear splicing (Baek and Green, 2005; Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012; Gueroussov et al., 2017; Irimia, Rukov, Roy, Vinther, and Garcia-Fernandez, 2009; Merkin et al., 2012) and suggests circRNA selection is occurring.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.4. In the abstract the authors state that &quot;many primate genes produce non-coding circular RNAs&quot;. This statement is not precise as it is not clear how many of the circRNAs are coding and how many non-coding. The non-coding should be eliminated. Moreover, seems like the authors don't even know about the research showing that some circRNAS are translated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed references to “non-coding” in the abstract and elsewhere in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.5. In line 41, the authors stated that &quot;Back-splicing occurs co-transcriptionally&quot; but it has been shown that back-splicing might occur not only co-transcriptionally (Ashwall Fluss et al. Mol Cell 2014) but both co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally (Zhang et al., Cell Rep 2016, PMID: 27068474).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that (back-)splicing can occur both co-transcriptionally, as well as post-transcriptionally. We have corrected this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.6. The most important model of this paper is that insertion of young transposon into downstream introns results in longer intronic regions, which delay the RNA polymerase II to the next splice site and increase the possibility of circRNA conservation. However, it has been reported that &quot;Pol II accelerates dramatically while transcribing through genes, but slows at exons&quot; (Jonkers et al., eLife 2014) and &quot;back-splicing outcomes correlate with fast RNA Polymerase II elongation rate&quot; (Zhang et al., Mol Cell 2016). In this case, longer introns might lead to fast, but not slow RNA polymerase II for circRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to these papers. We agree with the reviewer that RNA polymerase II slows down at exons. However, in this study, we are considering two orthologous intronic regions that differ in length due to the insertion of transposons.</p><p>In Zhang et al., they demonstrated that genes containing circRNAs have a faster elongation rate of RNA polymerase II. Our results do not contradict this result, as we are considering the two orthologous intronic regions with orthologous introns and not different genes.</p><p>Our model is based on two factors (i) that RNA polymerase slows down when transcribing repeat regions (relative to non-repeat regions) (ii) the time available for back-splicing will be greater in a longer intron than a shorter intron.</p><p>For the first factor, there are previous reports showing that the speed of RNA polymerase II decreases when transcribing repetitive elements (e.g. Veloso et al. 2014, Genome Research). The second point is that if you increase the size of the intron by 2 or 4 fold by the insertion of repeat elements it will increase the time prior to the transcription of the next splice site, compared to a shorter intron. This is supported by the relative speeds of RNA Polymerase elongation rate. For example, in Zhang et al., the median rates of elongation were 2.90 and 2.29kb/min for circRNA genes and non-circRNA genes, respectively. Given we identify a two-fold lengthening of the intron in human vs lemur, even an increased rate of RNA polymerase II wouldn’t have a major impact on the relative speed in which the RNA polymerase reaches the next canonical exon in the two orthologous introns. We acknowledge we haven’t described this clearly in the discussion and have therefore added the following section:</p><p>“The extension of the final intron therefore increases the likelihood of circRNA formation in time and space. […] This model conforms with previous observations of the enrichment of inverted-repeat Alu elements and of long introns surrounding circRNAs (Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014; Dong, Ma, Chen, and Yang, 2017; Ivanov et al., 2015; Jeck et al., 2013; Liang and Wilusz, 2014; Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.7. This manuscript mainly showed the insertion of LINE for circRNA expression and conservation. However, previous studies have suggested the importance of SINE elements, especially Alu elements of primates, in circRNA biogenesis (for example, Jeck et al., RNA 2013, PMID: 23249747; Zhang et al., Cell 2014, PMID: 25242744; Dong et al., RNA Biol 2017, PMID: 27982734). Did the authors observe that Alu is less involved in primate circRNA expression than LINE? Or, since Alu is prevalent among primates, their contribution to conserved circRNAs is less important than LINE?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not stating our results more clearly. In our analysis, we replicate previous findings of the importance of Alu elements in our comparisons of all circRNAs vs background. LINE elements display importance when comparing conserved circRNAs vs species-specific circRNAs. Our results, therefore, are in line with the previous literature. However, we agree this was not clearly described and have therefore added the following sentence with the citations requested to the Results section:</p><p>“This includes multiple features previously associated with conserved circRNAs, such as inverted-repeat Alu elements (Jeck et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014), as well as exon and intron length (Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014; Ivanov et al., 2015; Jeck et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017).”</p><p>and in the discussion:</p><p>“This model conforms with previous observations of enrichment of inverted-repeat Alu elements and observation of long introns surrounding circRNAs (Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014; Dong, Ma, Chen, and Yang, 2017; Ivanov et al., 2015; Jeck et al., 2013; Liang and Wilusz, 2014; Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014).”</p><p>and</p><p>“Similarly, we identify the adjacent introns of circRNAs are significantly longer with inverted Alu repeats (Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014; Ivanov et al., 2015; Jeck et al., 2013; Liang et al., 2017), however only in the conserved group do we observe a bias towards lengthening of the downstream adjacent intron with inverted L1 repeats dominating.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.8.

In line 44, Quaking was not likely to be suggested to facilitate &quot;these (assumedly inverted repeat elements) RNA-RNA interactions&quot;, instead, ADAR (Ivanov et al., Cell Rep 2015, PMID: 25558066; Rybak-Wolf et al., Mol Cell 2015, PMID: 25921068), DHX9 (Aktaş et al., Nature 2017, PMID: 28355180), NF90/110 (Li et al., Mol Cell 2017, PMID: 28625552) were suggested to be involved in inverted repeat element RNA-RNA interactions to regulate circular RNA biogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Quaking has been identified as a regulator of RNA-RNA interactions that promotes circRNA interactions (e.g. Conn et al. 2015 Cell).

In line 67, the authors cited Pipes et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2013 to suggest their used datasets in this study.

We will cite both studies in order to support the work of this consortium</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Revising causality claims based upon associative correlations:</p><p>c.1. In line 101 the authors state &quot;Many orthologous genes consistently express circRNAs even of the precise back-spliced junction is not conserved implicating importance of trans-factors in controlling cirRNA formation&quot;.

The authors claim that &quot;Anaylsis of the exonic structure of conserved circRNAs, showed that conserved circRNAs contain fewer exons, and rarely overlap with other circRNAs (Figure 2G, p = 4:08. 10*64, Fisher exact test; see Methods) displaying back-splicing at unique 5´- and 3´-splice sites. This indicates that these conserved circRNAs possess unique cis- or trans-regulatory features that enable a tight control of the number of exons within a circRNA and the back-spliced junctions used.&quot; This is not necessarily like that and the 2 aspects could be concurrent/codependent on a different factor (i.e. intron length).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

After looking for predictive genomic features for circRNA biosynthesis the authors conclude that: &quot;This indicates a core set of 24 cis- and trans-regulatory features drive the conserved formation of circRNAs compared to our background set of introns&quot; This is factually and conceptually wrong, as opredictive value does not mean causality. So likely most of these factors are co-occurring, which is still interesting but should not be overstated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.
