Ezrin, a major membrane–actin linker that assembles and coordinates macromolecular signaling complexes at membranes, has emerged recently as an important regulator of lysosomal function. Here, we report that endosomal-localized EGFR/Ezrin complex interacts with and triggers the inhibition of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC complex) in response to EGF stimuli. This is regulated through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Loss of Ezrin was not sufficient to repress TSC complex by EGF and culminated in translocation of TSC complex to lysosomes triggering suppression of mTORC1 signaling. Overexpression of constitutively active EZRIN<sup>T567D</sup> is sufficient to relocalize TSC complex to the endosomes and reactivate mTORC1. Our findings identify EZRIN as a critical regulator of autophagy via TSC complex in response to EGF stimuli and establish the central role of early endosomal signaling in the regulation of mTORC1. Consistently, Medaka fish deficient for Ezrin exhibit defective endo-lysosomal pathway, attributable to the compromised EGFR/AKT signaling, ultimately leading to retinal degeneration. Our data identify a pivotal mechanism of endo-lysosomal signaling involving Ezrin and its associated EGFR/TSC complex, which are essential for retinal function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>EZRIN</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>TSC complex</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018232</institution-id><institution>Orphan Disease Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDBR-21-103-CHM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001694</institution-id><institution>International Retinal Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRRF Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FISR2020IP_03551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PNRR_PRIN_P2022NPLZC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003407</institution-id><institution>Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MIUR PRIN _2022WJFN5X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013918</institution-id><institution>Sanfilippo Children's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCF GRANT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013927</institution-id><institution>National MPS Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MPS GRANT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conte</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ezrin controls endo-lysosomal signaling by maintaining TSC inhibition through EGFR signaling, activating mTORC1, and inhibiting lysosomal function, unveiling a critical endosome–lysosome network essential for autophagy and cellular homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endosomes are intracellular membrane-bound organelles that receive, integrate, and transmit a variety of signals to intracellular compartments. Trafficking of receptors, ion channels, lipids, and other effector proteins within the endosomal vesicles provides a mechanism to either sustain intracellular signaling pathways active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pálfy et al., 2012</xref>) or to downregulate signaling pathways through their degradation in lysosomes. Accordingly, altered endosomal maturation and function play a key role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, new insights about endosomal signaling and understanding the molecular components restricting signaling activity to specific pathways will uncover new opportunities for pharmacological targeting of such disorders. In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), endosomes contribute to the diurnal clearance of phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) that is required for RPE and photoreceptor health. This process is linked to circadian and light phase and is initiated by the scission from the plasma membrane of phagosomes containing POS, which undergo gradual fusion with endosomes and finally with lysosomes in a coordinated process termed ‘maturation’. The high demand on lysosomes for the digestion and recycling of phagocytosed POS rather than for the clearance of mitochondria, oxidized proteins, and other cellular components suggests the existence of a signaling pathway that can finely coordinate lysosomal function according to needs that will not upset cellular homeostasis. A long-standing question in the field is how functional diversity within the autophagy pathway is achieved in the RPE in the dark and light phases. Inhibition of endosomal biogenesis, trafficking, and fusion is associated with impairment of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy flux. Implicit in these findings is the idea that endosomes, by carrying signaling molecules, could serve as a signaling hub for the regulated transfer of signals to lysosomes, acting more specifically than diffusion-based signal propagation. However, how endosomes are essential for lysosomal function, and their relevant components regulating this process are still not well defined.</p><p>Ezrin (Ezr), a member of the ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM) protein family, is mainly localized just beneath the plasma membrane around cellular protrusions and villi. Ezrin acts as a scaffolding platform to cross-link F-actin cytoskeleton with specialized membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawaguchi and Asano, 2022</xref>) that are implicated in the spatiotemporal dynamics of phagosomes and endosomes. Its association with both F-actin filaments and membrane proteins is finely regulated and requires conformational activation through phosphorylation at unique (Y353, Y477, and T567) residues. The central role of Ezrin in regulating trafficking of vesicles has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tamma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, maturation of endosomes and recycling/exocytosis of their components (i.e., α1β-adrenergic receptor, NHE3, and others) require the Ezrin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barroso-González et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stanasila et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). The phosphorylated active Ezrin is observed within early and late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parameswaran et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, through its active and reversible interactions with actin filaments and endosomal proteins, Ezrin organizes signal transduction. Indeed, phosphorylation of the T567 residue of EZRIN leads to its co-localization in a functional complex with NHE1, EGFR, and β1-integrin in human breast tumors, suggesting its crucial role as a scaffold protein of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antelmi et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, Ezrin also interacts with EGFR at membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saygideğer-Kont et al., 2016</xref>). In mammalian cells, depletion of an Ezrin-interacting protein, Vsp11, delays the delivery of EGFR to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirivino et al., 2011</xref>), thus linking the Ezrin protein network with EGFR trafficking via clathrin-coated transport vesicles. However, the mechanisms of Ezrin–EGFR interaction and its function at the endosomal compartments remain largely unexplored. Interestingly, recent findings have shown that PI3K-mediated activation of AKT upon EGF stimulation is mediated by EGFR via an early endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that Ezrin may be required as a protein scaffold for coordinating EGFR/AKT signaling at endosomes. Interestingly, EZR interacts with AKT in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the Y353-phosphorylation of Ezrin is relevant for PI3K-initiated signaling through its interaction with p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gautreau et al., 1999</xref>). Notably, the Ezrin–p85 complex optimizes the physiological activation of AKT, supporting a central role of Ezrin in controlling intracellular pathways in response to external cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gautreau et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence has shown that the AKT-mediated Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC complex) phosphorylation is a major mechanism in triggering the activity of the GTPase Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), an essential activator of mTORC1 at lysosomes. We demonstrated recently that Ezrin is a key regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and functions in RPE/retina crosstalk by modulating TFEB nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, Ezrin overexpression leads to altered autophagy and an impairment of POS maturation and degradation in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is intriguing that Ezrin has been recently observed to be associated with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poupon et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, cancer cell proliferation and invasion through an activated Akt/mTORC1 pathway was linked with activation of Ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krishnan et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, depletion of Ezrin was found to be associated with the repression of the mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wan et al., 2005</xref>). Together, these data led us to hypothesize that Ezrin-mediated EGFR endosomal sorting and trafficking could play a central role in mTORC1 activation on lysosomes.</p><p>Here, we identify a previously undocumented function for Ezrin as a platform that is essential for the endosomal signaling network involving EGFR and AKT pathways, which provides an important insight into the spatial inactivation of the TSC complex on endosomal compartments. We show that inactivation of Ezrin is crucial to neutralize EGF-stimulated EGFR endosomal sorting and signaling from the plasma membrane with a reduction of AKT-mediated phosphorylation of TSC complex, which in turn translocates and inhibits mTORC1 on lysosomes. These results reveal an essential layer of mTORC1 regulation by Ezrin and EGFR signaling and uncover part of the paradigm of signaling from endosomes to lysosomes to coordinate the lysosomal function in the retina and other tissues. Consistent with the role of the Ezrin/EGFR/TSC complex axis in lysosomal biogenesis and function, alteration of this molecular network alters autophagy in vivo in Medaka fish, resulting in retinal degeneration. Derangement of this control mechanism may underpin human eye disorders and may be relevant as a therapeutic target to restore normal vision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ezrin regulates lysosomal biogenesis</title><p>Activated Ezrin represses the autophagy pathway in the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>), but the mechanism remains undefined.

The comparison of the transcriptomics and proteomics identified 572 commonly regulated genes: 317 and 213 genes are induced and inhibited in both datasets, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Gene Ontology and Functional Annotation Clustering analyses were performed on these 530 commonly differentially expressed genes, restricting the output Cellular Compartments (CC) terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We found an enriched overlap of these genes in cell compartments, including cell membrane and lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Consistent with this, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the EZR<sup>KO</sup> displayed an increased number of lysosomes, as assessed by quantification of lysotracker-fluorescent staining and Lamp1–LC3 co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–f</xref>). Compared with WT MEFs, lysosomal Cathepsin B (CTSB) activity of EZR<sup>KO</sup> MEFs was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Furthermore, western blot analysis also revealed that EZR<sup>KO</sup> increased the expression of lysosomal markers (LAMP1, CTSD, and LC3) as well as reducing the levels of the autophagy substrate p62 and NBR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).

Concordantly, we found that EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells have a significantly increased number of lysosomes and increased lysosomal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e–g</xref>), indicative of augmented lysosomal biogenesis and function.

To identify potential signaling pathways affected by Ezrin modulation, we performed an enrichment analysis of the 530 differentially expressed genes in EZR<sup>KO</sup>, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) phosphoproteomics, kinase perturbations from GEO database, and the Proteomics drug atlas. Interestingly, SILAC phosphoproteomics data highlighted a significant overlap with phosphorylation changes in HeLa cells upon EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Accordingly, kinase perturbation revealed a significant overlap with downregulated genes upon EGFR drug activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), whereas Proteomics drug atlas revealed a significant enrichment in cells upon AZ628 (a Raf inhibitor) or MEK162 (a MEK inhibitor) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Warde-Farley et al., 2010</xref>) (all resources are available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg/downloads">https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg/downloads</ext-link>). Thus, we hypothesized that the EGFR needs to be selectively recognized by EZRIN to be subjected to EZRIN-mediated endosomal trafficking and signaling. Consistent with this, gene network based on physical interaction reveals EGFR as a possible direct EZRIN protein partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Moreover, EGFR resulted strongly upregulated in our omics dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) experiments revealed a complex composed of EZRIN and EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), consistent with human biomedical interaction repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oughtred et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petschnigg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salokas et al., 2022</xref>). To further detail this possible interaction, we assessed all possible pairwise interactions between the known domains of Ezrin UID:P15311 and EGFR (UID:P00533) by mining 3did (10.1093/nar/gkt887) and PPIDomainMiner (10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008844) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the EZRIN–EGFR interaction appears to occur between the FERM central domain (PF00373) of Ezrin with the PK domain (PF07714) of EGFR, in line with previous structural studies by X-ray diffraction in which was patterned a direct interaction of the FERM domain with kinase domain of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lietha et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylated Ezrin (Thr567) localizes at curved cytoplasmic membranes and has been implicated as a membrane–cytoskeleton scaffolding protein rather than a membrane shaper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore tested whether phosphorylation at Thr567 of Ezrin was involved in interacting with EGFR in a complex at cytoplasmic membrane. As hypothesized, phosphomimic active EZR<sup>T567D</sup>, but not phospho-mutant inactive EZR<sup>T567A</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>), when expressed in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells, highly co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These data support that active EZRIN protein interacts with EGFR. Co-immunostaining analysis confirmed that EZRIN is localized at the plasma membrane with EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Moreover, a fraction of the EZRIN signal co-localizes with EGFR, within same intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), supporting the presence of an EZRIN/EGFR complex, in which EZRIN acts as a scaffold protein for EGFR. Thus, we postulated that EZRIN participates in EGFR trafficking and signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression levels and subcellular distribution of EGFR under normal and EZRIN-depleted conditions by immunofluorescence staining and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–i</xref>). Interestingly, the genetic depletion of EZRIN strongly induced a statistically significant localization of EGFR at the plasma membrane and dramatically reduced its presence within intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g, h</xref>). Considering that the specific EGFR signals can arise from intracellular compartments, such as the endosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke et al., 2001</xref>), we examined whether EZRIN depletion would impair EGFR signaling. Consistent with proteomic results, we found that the levels of total EGFR are increased in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). However, western blot analysis demonstrated that the absence of EZRIN induced a reduction in EGFR signaling. Notably, the level of HER3 and active pY845 EGFR were almost abolished following EZRIN depletion, in line with previous results where disruption of wild-type EGFR signaling induced reduction of HER3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, lack of EZRIN also reduced the EGFR-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at Threonine 180 (T180) and Tyrosine 182 (Y182). However, we noticed an increased phosphorylation at T222 of its substrate, MK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). The latter result could be due to an activation of the ERK pathway that might attenuate EZRIN/EGRF-dependent reduction of p38 MAPK signaling. Indeed, ERK2 binds and phosphorylates MK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sok et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies will be needed to investigate ERK1/2 signaling is part of the EZRIN/EGFR-mediated signaling network. Taken together, these data suggest a model by which the EZRIN interaction with EGFR contributes to EGFR trafficking and signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ezrin binds EGFR and regulates its activation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Bubble plot representing the enrichment analysis of 530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) performed in SILAC Phosphoproteomics data.

We asked if the increased EGFR protein level at cell membrane and the reduction of EGFR signaling in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells could be due to an alteration in EGFR dimerization and packaging into endosomal vesicles. To test this hypothesis, the cellular internalization and trafficking of EGFR basis was investigated by immunofluorescence and live-imaging studies. We found that the lack of Ezrin statistically reduced dimerization of EGFR upon EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>). These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence analyses; indeed, compared to control cells, Ezrin-depleted cells showed higher levels of EGFR on the cell surface, which was mirrored by reduced EGFR abundance at endosomal compartments, as assessed by a reduction in the overlap between EGFR and EEA1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d</xref>) and increased EGFR protein levels on purified membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e, f</xref>, upper panels). Consistently, EGFR endosomal localization was present on purified endosomes from control but not from EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e, f</xref>, lower panels). The reduced internalization of EGFR to endosomes was not accompanied by a suppression of endocytosis, as indicated by the slight and significant increase in the number of EEA1-positive early endosomes and endotracker-positive structures in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g, h</xref>). These results support that EGFR accumulation at the plasma membrane was not a result of an endocytosis defect. To better define whether the lack of EZRIN alters EGFR internalization and trafficking in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells upon EGF stimulation, we performed Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) time-lapse imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution. Both EZR<sup>−/−</sup> and control cells, transfected with an EGFR-GFP vector, were imaged every 0.5  s for 5 min upon EGF treatment. Notably, the EGF-induced EGFR endosomal internalization was dramatically abolished in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1 fig5video2 fig5video3 fig5video4">Figure 5—videos 1–4</xref>). Consistent with a defective EGFR integration in the early endosome, EGFR was localized at the plasma membrane in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells, despite EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1 fig5video2 fig5video3 fig5video4">Figure 5—videos 1–4</xref>). These results suggest that EZRIN play an important role for the dimerization, integration, and trafficking of EGFR in the endosomes. To strengthen these findings, we performed ultrastructural analysis using immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) that further revealed the reduced number of EGFR-positive endosomal compartments and the increased presence of EGFR at the plasma membrane in EGF-stimulated EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared with EGF-stimulated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Consistent with this, pY845 EGFR, pY1068 EGFR, pT202/Y204 p44/42 MAPK, and pT180/pY182 p38 MAPK were reduced upon EGF stimulation in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Moreover, the increased EGFR internalization from membranes to endosomes by EGF stimulation was significantly inhibited in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). As expected, we found that the endosomal EGFR internalization was further repressed in MEF-EZR<sup>KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d–h</xref>) and in HeLa cells upon NSC668394 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>), a specific Ezrin inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>).

Interestingly, EGFR stimulates several downstream effectors, including PI3K/AKT signaling in response to multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wee and Wang, 2017</xref>). This led us to investigate the role of Ezrin/EGFR axis in the control of AKT signaling. AKT binds, phosphorylates, and inhibits hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2) complex. TSC complex is essential to turn off the activity of Rheb, a crucial activator of mTORC1 at lysosomal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dibble and Cantley, 2015</xref>). This raised the possibility of Ezrin-mediated activation of EGFR signaling would be required for AKT activation and thus stimulation of the mTORC1 pathway via TSC complex repression. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the interaction between endogenous Ezrin/EGFR with AKT and TSC1 to define an endosomal signaling platform. In agreement with previously presented data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haddad et al., 2002</xref>), TSC1and AKT co-immunoprecipitated with EZRIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, upper panel). We also noticed that Ezrin was able to interact with TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, upper panel). The molecular basis of these interactions was investigated by in silico domain–domain interaction analyses. Accordingly, EZRIN (UID:P15311) was found as a scaffold protein interacting through its FERM central domain with the PK domain of EGFR, as detailed above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>), and binding TSC1. Although Alphafold3 modeling of the EZRIN/TSC1 dimer did not provide high-confidence results, suggesting that the TSC1 (PF04388) could interact with both FERM N-terminal (PF09380) and C-terminal (PF09379) domains of EZRIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c–h</xref>). Concordantly, PPIDomainMiner identifies the FERM-N/C-hamartin as moderately confident (silver class), further supporting the possibility of EGFR/EZRIN/TSC1 interactions. Consistently, immunoprecipitation of EGFR was able to pull down both TSC1 and AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, lower panel), suggesting that EGFR, AKT, TSC1, and EZRIN are present in a complex. The latter results led us to investigate whether EGFR could interact with AKT and TSC1 indirectly through EZRIN. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed this possibility, given that <italic>EZRIN</italic> depletion abolished the interactions of EGFR with TSC1 and AKT, thereby pointing out the role of Ezrin as a scaffold protein for the formation and activation of the EGFR/AKT/TSC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). In agreement with this hypothesis, the lack of Ezrin reduced pS473 AKT activation and in turn suppressed AKT-mediated phosphorylation of pS939 TSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). As expected, the inactivation of AKT promoted activation of TSC1 and TSC2, which localized on the lysosomes in EZR<italic><sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d, e</xref>). Consistently, translocation of the TSC complex on the lysosomes led to inhibition of mTORC1 pathway, as demonstrated by reduction of pT389 P70 S6 Kinase and pS65 4E-BP1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). In agreement, the insulin administration was not able to restore mTORC1 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) and lysosomal localization of TSC complex in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1j</xref>), in line with the hypothesis that Ezrin acts as a scaffold protein for AKT/TSC complex. Thus, we ensured that these findings were also confirmed when EZRIN was pharmacologically inhibited on HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>) and ARPE-19 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b, c</xref>). Concordantly, these results were mirrored in MEF EZR<sup>KO</sup> cells that yield a similar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d, e</xref>). To strengthen the molecular mechanism by which EGFR/EZRIN controls mTORC1 pathway via TSC complex, we investigated the effects of EZRIN inhibition on MEF TSC2<sup>KO</sup> cells and found that depletion of TSC2 rescue TORC1 signaling when Ezrin was pharmacologically inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Together, these results establish an Ezrin-dependent molecular machinery coordinating EGFR sorting and signaling at the endosome to a well-regulated signals transfer to lysosomes via AKT/TSC complex axis. Consistent with this idea, phosphorylation of pS473 AKT was significantly abolished in response to EGF treatment in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Accordingly, using confocal Airyscan high-resolution microscopy, we found that the majority of the TSC complex was present in early endosomes of HeLa WT cells upon EGF treatment, as shown by co-localization with the endosomal marker EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g, h</xref>). Notably, the endosomal TSC complex localization was abolished in EGF-treated EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g, h</xref>), which indicates that EGFR-mediated repression of TSC complex by AKT activation could occur in a stable endosomal complex dependent on Ezrin. Consistently, the ectopic expression of a constitutively active EZR<sup>T567D</sup> protein, but not a constitutively inactive Ezr<sup>T567A</sup> protein, rescued EGFR sorting and signaling activation at the endosome in EZR<sup>−/−</sup> cells upon EGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

Accordingly, we found that the EGFR expression pattern in the rodents’ retina diminished in response to light and increased after light off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>), coinciding with Ezrin expression and diurnal lysosomal biogenesis in the RPE/retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, we found an inhibition of TSC2 and an increase of AKT/mTORC1 pathway in the mice retina in response to dark condition, when active Ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>) and EGFR are highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Moreover, we found that TSC2 was dephosphorylated in response to light in the retina, when inactive Ezrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>) and EGFR are weakly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>) as a consequence of a decrease of the AKT/mTORC1 signaling, which suggests that activation of Ezrin underlies the requirement endosomal EGFR signaling to assemble the EGFR/AKT/TSC complex and represses lysosomal biogenesis. This data supported that EGFR signaling in retinal cells could be regulated by Ezrin for finely control lysosomal biogenesis and function in mTORC1-dependent manner. Thus, we used the highly effective CRISPR–Cas9-mediated mutagenesis to create stable Ezrin mutant lines in Medaka fish (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>, Ol) as in vivo model system. Targeting two sgRNAs (sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) in the exon 1 of <italic>Ezrin</italic> gene, we generated a 386-bp deletion and established founder lines for this deletion. This mutation eliminates the first 129 amino acids containing ATG (olEzrin<sup>Δ386</sup>), generating a severely truncated Ezrin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), which was not detectable by western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This indicated that the Δ386 Ezrin allele is likely functionally null, and mutants will hereafter be called Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line. Larval homozygous Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line appeared almost visually indistinguishable from wild-type siblings, and the Δ386 allele was inherited in Mendelian ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Interestingly, the Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka larvae recapitulated in part a previously reported phenotype characterized in postnatal ezrin knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonilha et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with our in vitro data, we observed increased levels of the EGFR protein accompanied by a significant reduction of active pY845 EGFR. This was associated by a significant reduction of the phosphorylation of pS473 AKT in Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> Medaka line compared to control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Consistently, we observed reduced AKT-mediated phosphorylation of pT1462 of TSC2, decreased mTORC1 signaling as shown by reduction of p4EBP1 (S65) and an increased autophagy, as demonstrated by higher levels of LC3-II and Lamp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d, e</xref>). Notably, endosomal internalization of EGFR was significantly repressed in the RPE of Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line. Consistent with defective EGFR internalization and trafficking, whole-mount immunofluorescence analysis showed that EGFR accumulated at plasma membrane of RPE of Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line compared with control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). Considering the role of endosomal sorting and signaling in the health of retinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Toops et al., 2014</xref>), we addressed the consequences of aberrant EGFR signaling pathway in retina of Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka line. Notably, defective endosomal EGFR signaling was sufficient to induce deleterious consequences for the health of photoreceptor cells, which showed reduction in POS compared with native rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>), similar to the pathogenesis of macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borrelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaur and Lakkaraju, 2018</xref>). Notably, depletion of <italic>olEzrin</italic> was also associated with a significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the retina from Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>). Altogether, these data support the dynamic regulation of EGFR signaling at endosomal compartments in response to Ezrin activation, which assembles and activates an EGFR/AKT/TSC complex signalosome at endosomes to finely regulate the lysosomal signaling by mTORC1 pathway, required for the correct autophagy and retinal cell health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title><italic>Ezrin</italic> depletion induces EGFR-mediated retinal degeneration.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of used CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate Ezrin<sup>−/−</sup> medaka lines.

The absence of active EGFR on the endosome causes the migration of TSC complex on the lysosome, where it inhibits mTORC1C1. On the contrary, the nocturnal activation of Ezrin favorites the phosphorylation and dimerization of EGFR, that translocate from the plasma membrane on the early endosome. Ezrin localized with EGFR, on the endosomal membrane, binds TSC complex, preventing mTORC1C1 inactivation on the lysosome.

Emerging studies have indicated that sorting of the EGF–EGFR complex to endosomal vesicles requires spatiotemporally defined encounters with distinct cytoskeleton platforms resulting in internalization, activation, maintenance, or termination of EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ceresa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this notion, it is now increasingly recognized that many molecules participating in signal transduction are central sorting hubs that coordinate signaling from and to different intracellular compartments, including early endosomes, late endosomes, phagosomes, and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009</xref>). However, molecular networks determining selective signal transduction from endosomes to lysosomes are not well defined. In this study, we demonstrated that EZRIN is a cytoskeleton scaffold protein aligned along internal membranes, and that this localization is essential for endosomal EGFR signal transduction to the TSC complex. Endosomal EGFR sorting and activation occurs mainly due to binding with EZRIN that facilitates dimerization and activation of the EGF–EGFR receptor complex, resulting in their recruitment to endosomes, followed by AKT activation that targets and inhibits the TSC complex. Indeed, time-lapse confocal imaging revealed that EGFR fails to be recruited to endosomal compartments upon EGF stimulation in the absence of Ezrin or in the presence of its inactive form (EZRIN<sup>T567A</sup>). The loss of Ezrin function compromises EGFR-mediated AKT activation, which in turn reduces TSC complex inhibition resulting in TSC complex translocation to lysosomes where it constrains mTORC1 activity. Consistent with this, not only does loss of Ezrin impact on lysosomal TSC complex translocation, but we also documented that dephosphorylation of Ezrin in its inactive form is required for EGFR inactivation and TSC1 and TSC2 release from an EGFR/EZRIN complex, possibly to support the lysosomal biogenesis and function. Indeed, autophagy appears to be highly sensitive to pharmacological Ezrin inhibition via the EGFR/AKT axis. Moreover, overexpression of EZRIN<sup>T567A</sup>, but not EZRIN<sup>T567D</sup>, fails to restore EGFR endosomal signaling and lysosomal function in Ezrin-defective cells, indicating that phosphorylation of Ezrin is indispensable for this activity. Supporting this possibility, loss of βA3/A1-crystallin affects PITPβ/PLC signaling axis associated with an age-related loss of PLC-mediated Ezrin phosphorylation and subsequent compromised RPE cell polarity and EGFR signaling. Notably, the lysosome-mediated POS clearance was disrupted in the Cryba1 cKO RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shang et al., 2021</xref>). Beyond this, our findings also showed an interaction of EGFR with the TSC complex and their co-localization with endosomes, opening to future work on mechanisms of how endosomal system connects extracellular signals with lysosomes under different physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p>Upregulation of Ezrin has been shown to induce an age-related macular degeneration-like phenotype in miR-211<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naso et al., 2020</xref>), where light-mediated cell clearance is completely abolished. We can speculate that recruitment of EGFR on endosomal compartments by Ezrin orchestrates a local signal between endosomes and lysosomes to drive tight control on the lysosomal cargo demands, although future studies are needed in this regard. Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR activity, by silencing Rubicon (RUBCN), switches lysosomal cargo degradation from POS- to LC3-associated phagocytosis to autophagy process in the RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muniz-Feliciano et al., 2017</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms are completely unknown. Therefore, Ezrin may represent a nodal point in endosomal compartments where EGFR signaling and AKT converge and integrate to directly control the TSC complex/mTORC1 pathway and lysosomal cargo demands and degradation. Notably, mutations affecting TSC1 and TSC2 alter lysosomal function with retinal manifestations in 40–50% of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosset et al., 2017</xref>). This phenotype is also showed in RPE-specific deletion of TSC1 profoundly leading to an age-related impairment in lysosomal function associated with RPE degeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The findings of the cellular mechanisms governing endosomal EGFR sorting and signaling might be of therapeutic relevance. Indeed, alteration of endosomal biogenesis and signaling have been shown to participate in the age-related, progressive neurodegeneration such as in age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaur and Lakkaraju, 2018</xref>). Thus, the identification of the mechanisms that control Ezrin/EGFR/mTORC1 molecular network might be exploited for the treatment of diseases in which defective endo-lysosomes play a part.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Searches were performed with tryptic specifications and default settings for mass tolerances for MS and MS/MS spectra. Carbamidomethyl at cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while oxidations at methionine and acetylation at the N-terminus were defined as variable modifications. The minimal peptide length was set to seven amino acids, and the false discovery rate for proteins and peptide-spectrum matches to 1%.

To evaluate EGFR localization in immunoelectron microscopy, HeLa cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich, C4859). Drug treatment was performed for 6 hr with 10 μM of NSC668394 or DMSO as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bulut et al., 2012</xref>). EGF stimulation was obtained with 10 ng/ml of animal-free recombinant human EGF (Peprotech AF-100-15) for 3 hr. Insulin stimulation was achieved with 1 μM of Insulin solution human (Sigma I9278) for 30 min, after 16 hr of serum starvation. We used a sub-confluent cell culture (i.e., 80% of confluence) for each in vitro experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Generation of an EZR<sup>−/−</sup> HeLa cell line</title><p>HeLa (ATCC CCL-2) full knockout of the <italic>EZRIN</italic> gene was generated using the CRISPr/Cas9 system.

RNA and protein expression analysis is consistent with upregulation of lysosomal proteins in Ezrin-deficient MEFs, which the authors confirm by immunostaining and western blotting for lysosomal markers. Expression analysis also implicates EGF signaling as being altered downstream of Ezrin loss, and the authors demonstrate that Ezrin promotes relocalization of EGFR from the plasma membrane to endosomes. Ezrin loss reduces downstream MAPK and Akt signaling, and represses mTORC1 signaling by promoting lysosomal localization of the TSC complex. An Ezrin mutant Medaka fish line is then generated to test its role in retinal cells, which are known to be sensitive to changes in autophagy regulation. Phenotypes in this model appear generally consistent with observations made in cultured cells, though milder overall.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Data on the impact of Ezrin-loss on relocalization of EGFR from the plasma membrane are extensive, and thoroughly demonstrate that Ezrin is required for EGFR internalization in response to EGF.</p><p>A new Ezrin-deficient in vivo model (Medaka fish) is generated.</p><p>Strong data demonstrating that Ezrin loss suppresses Akt signaling and mTORC1 signaling by promoting TSC complex localization to the lysosome.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have addressed all concerns</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98523.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors have attempted to demonstrate a critical role for the cytoskeletal scaffold protein Ezrin, in the upstream regulation of EGFR/AKT/MTOR signaling. They show that in the absence of Ezrin, ligand-induced EGFR trafficking and activation at the endosomes is perturbed, with decreased endosomal recruitment of the TSC complex, and a corresponding decrease in AKT/MTOR signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have used a combination of novel imaging techniques, as well as conventional proteomic and biochemical assays to substantiate their findings. The findings expand our understanding of the upstream regulators of the EGFR/AKT MTOR signaling and lysosomal biogenesis, appear to be conserved in multiple species, and may have important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases involving endo-lysosomal function, such as diabetes and cancer, as well as neuro-degenerative diseases like macular degeneration. Furthermore, pharmacological targeting of Ezrin could potentially be utilized in diseases with defective TFEB/TFE3 functions like LSDs. While a majority of the findings appear to support the hypotheses, there are substantial gaps in the findings that could be better addressed. Since Ezrin appears to directly regulate MTOR activity, the effects of Ezrin KO on MTOR-regulated, TFEB/TFE3 -driven lysosomal function should be explored more thoroughly. Similarly, a more convincing analysis of autophagic flux should be carried out. Additionally, many immunoblots lack key controls (Control IgG in CO-Ips) and many others merit repetition to either improve upon the quality of the existing data, validate the findings using orthogonal approaches or to provide a more rigorous quantitative assessment of the findings, as highlighted in the recommendation for authors.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed most of the concerns raised in the prior version, and have significantly improved upon the overall findings in the revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors demonstrate that, while the loss of Ezrin increases lysosomal biogenesis and function, its presence is required for the specific endocytosis of EGFR. Upon further investigation, the authors reveal that Ezrin is a crucial intermediary protein that links EGFR to AKT, leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC. TSC is a critical negative regulator of the mTORC1 complex, which is dysregulated in various diseases, making their findings a valuable addition to multiple fields of study. Their cell signaling findings are translatable to an in vivo Medaka fish model and suggest that Ezrin may play a crucial role in retinal degeneration.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Giamundo, Intartaglia, et al. utilized unbiased proteomic and transcriptomic screens in Ezrin KO cells to investigate the mechanistic function of Ezrin in lysosome and cell signaling pathways. The authors' findings are consistent with past literature demonstrating Ezrin's role in the EGFR and mTORC1 signaling pathways. They used several cell lines, small molecule inhibitors, and cellular and in vivo knockout models to validate signaling changes through biochemical and microscopy assays. Their use of multiple advanced microscopy techniques is also impressive.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the Editor and the Reviewers for their important and constructive comments, which amended us to improve our manuscript. We have now carried out new experiments and analyses to further support our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the authors demonstrated activation of TSC1 (lysosomal accumulation) and inactivation of Akt (decreased phosphorylation in TSC1), as well as decreased mTORC1 signaling in Ezrin knockout cells, direct experiments showing the rescue of mTORC1 activity by AKT and TSC1 mutants are required to confirm the linear signaling pathway and establish Ezrin as a mediator of EGFR-AKTTSC1-mTORC1 signaling. Although the authors presented representative images from advanced microscopy techniques to support their claims, there is insufficient quantification of these experiments. Additionally, several immunoblots in the manuscript lack vital loading controls, such as input lanes for immunoprecipitations and loading controls for western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank the Reviewer for his/her important and constructive comments on our manuscript and to consider that our study provides new information for understanding the mechanism regulating TSC/mTORC1 pathway. We have now extensively revised the manuscript according to his/her suggestions. Indeed, to expand on the evidence demonstrating Ezrin as a mediator of EGFR-AKTTSC1-mTORC1 signaling, the revised manuscript includes quantification of all advanced microscopy images, rescue experiments demonstrating the role of Ezrin in AKT/TSC/mTORC1 molecular network, and controls for WBs and immunoprecipitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors begin with the stated goal of gaining insight into the known repression of autophagy by Ezrin, a major membrane-actin linker that assembles signaling complexes on membranes. RNA and protein expression analysis is consistent with upregulation of lysosomal proteins in Ezrin-deficient MEFs, which the authors confirm by immunostaining and western blotting for lysosomal markers. Expression analysis also implicates EGF signaling as being altered downstream of Ezrin loss, and the authors demonstrate that Ezrin promotes relocalization of EGFR from the plasma membrane to endosomes. Ezrin loss impacts downstream MAPK/Akt/mTORC1 signaling, although the mechanistic links remain unclear. An Ezrin mutant Medaka fish line was then generated to test Ezrin's role in retinal cells, which are known to be sensitive to changes in autophagy regulation. Phenotypes in this model appear generally consistent with observations made in cultured cells, though mild overall.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Data on the impact of Ezrin-loss on relocalization of EGFR from the plasma membrane are extensive, and thoroughly demonstrate that Ezrin is required for EGFR internalization in response to EGF.</p><p>A new Ezrin-deficient in vivo model (Medaka fish) is generated.</p><p>Strong data demonstrates that Ezrin loss suppresses Akt signaling. Ezrin loss also clearly suppresses mTORC1 signaling in cell culture, although examination of mTORC1 activity is notably missing in Ezrin-deficient fish.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the recognition of our study and apologize for the insufficient evidence reported in the previous version of the manuscript. As requested by the Reviewer, we considerably expanded the number of experiments to support EZRIN/EGFR/TSC molecular network in regulating autophagy pathway in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, following the Reviewer’s comment we have expanded the interpretation of our findings in the &quot;Discussion” section. We hope the new version of our manuscript will satisfy the Reviewer’s worries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>LC3 is used as a readout of autophagy, however the lipidated/unlipidated LC3 ratio generally does not appear to change, thus there does not appear to be evidence that Ezrin loss is affecting autophagy in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree with the Reviewer on the importance of this issue and apologize for the lack of clarity. Ezrin is an already widely characterized protein participating autophagy pathway. Several studies, including our previous studies, demonstrated that both silencing and pharmacological inhibition of Ezrin may promote autophagy by promoting activation of TFEB, in part through the TRPML1-calcineurin signaling pathway (Naso et al 2020; Intartaglia et al 2022; Lou et al 2024). However, a full elucidation on how Ezrin controls autophagy is still not unknown. As suggested by the Reviewer, to reinforce our data, we have now fixed this inaccuracy by better elucidating this aspect in the revised manuscript. Accordingly, we have monitored the autophagic flux and LC3 expression level following the guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition) by Klionsky et al. 2021. The data presented in the new Figure supplement 1 now better support the notion that depletion of Ezrin increases autophagic flux. We hope the new version of our manuscript will satisfy the Reviewer’s worries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion is drawn that Ezrin loss suppresses EGF signaling, however this is complicated by a strong increase in phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK substrate MK2. Without additional characterization of MAPK and Erk signaling, the effect of Ezrin loss remains unclear. Causative conclusions between effects on MAPK, Akt, and mTORC1 signaling are frequently drawn, but the data only demonstrate correlations. For example, many signaling pathways can activate mTORC1 including MAPK/Erk, thus reduced mTORC1 activity upon Ezrin-loss cannot currently be attributed to reduced Akt signaling. Similarly, other kinases can phosphorylate TSC2 at the sites examined here, so the conclusion cannot be drawn that Ezrin-loss causes a reduction in Akt-mediated TSC2 phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that this is an interesting and important question. However, we respectfully disagree with the Reviewer and feel that addressing this point by additional studies on both MAPK and ERK pathways, as the Reviewer suggests, is outside the scope of this manuscript. We therefore prefer to address these questions in future studies. However, following the Reviewer’s comment we have expanded the interpretation of our findings in the &quot;Discussion” section. We hope the new version of our manuscript will satisfy the Reviewer’s worries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7, the conclusion cannot be drawn that retinal degeneration results from aberrant EGFR signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree with the Reviewer on the importance of this issue. We now fixed this inaccuracy by adding TUNEL staining that showed the retinal degeneration in Ezrin KO medaka fish. The results of these assays are described in the Results section and documented in revised Figure 7, panels H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear why TSC1 is highlighted in the title, as there does not appear to be any specific regulation of TSC1 here.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the title accordingly</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1 the conclusion is drawn that there is an increase in lysosome number with Ezrin KO, however it does not appear that the current analysis can distinguish an increased number from increased lysosome size or activity. Similarly, conclusions about increased lysosome &quot;biogenesis&quot; could instead reflect decreased turnover.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this Reviewer’s observation, we changed the text according to his/her suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Immunoprecipitation data for a role for Ezrin as a signaling scaffold appear minimal and seem to lack important controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for these inaccuracies. We have now carried out new experiments to further support our findings. Moreover, all blots were changed for better exposed images. In the revised Figures the controls were showed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3A it seems difficult to conclude that EGFR dimerization is reduced since the whole blot, including the background between lanes, is lighter on that side.</p></disp-quote><p>We now fixed this inaccuracy. The blots were changed for better exposed images in revised Figure 3, panel A. and quantified</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6C specificity controls for the TSC1 and TSC2 antibodies are not included but seem necessary since their localization patterns appear very different from each other in WT cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize because we have created some confusion. We have now emended this mistake and revised all panels in Figure 6C (now Figure 6D) for consistency between figures and text. Concerning the specificity of TSC1 and TSC2 antibodies and staining, indeed, antibodies labelling was showing the ordinary pattern from TSC in the cells as stated in Menon et al. 2014. We would like to point out that the antibodies are the same indicated in Menon et al. 2014 and our data are not only based on TSC1 and TSC2 staining but on a considerable number of in vivo and in vitro experiments in which many and different markers were used by performing several complementary approaches (i.e. immunofluorescence, western blot analysis, Omics, etc.)</p><p>Menon S, Dibble CC, Talbott G, Hoxhaj G, Valvezan AJ, Takahashi H, Cantley LC, Manning BD.

Further data on the retinal cell phenotypes would strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his/her comment. We have now fixed this inaccuracy in the revised manuscript. We added the analysis for p4EBP1 (S65), a mTORC1 substrate Figure 7 panel D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7F there appears to be more EGFR throughout the cell, so it is difficult to conclude that more EGFR at the PM in Ezrin-/- fish means reduced internalization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that it is an important question that helped us to improve the quality of the data presented. As correctly noted by the Reviewer, EGFR protein level is increased due to EZRIN deletion. This is evident in Figure 7 panel F, in line with both proteomic analysis and in vitro experiments (Figure 2I; Figure 3E; Figure 5C). We also agree that the increase of EGFR protein level could strength the background of immunofluorescence. Therefore, to better represent the EGFR membrane translocation on flat mount RPE from medaka lines, we add a highlighting box showing it in both WT and KO medaka line in the revised Figure 7 panel F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors have attempted to demonstrate a critical role for the cytoskeletal scaffold protein Ezrin, in the upstream regulation of EGFR/AKT/MTOR signaling. They show that in the absence of Ezrin, ligand-induced EGFR trafficking and activation at the endosomes is perturbed, with decreased endosomal recruitment of the TSC complex, and a corresponding decrease in AKT/MTOR signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have used a combination of novel imaging techniques, as well as conventional proteomic and biochemical assays to substantiate their findings. The findings expand our understanding of the upstream regulators of the EGFR/AKT MTOR signaling and lysosomal biogenesis, appear to be conserved in multiple species, and may have important implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of diseases involving endo-lysosomal function, such as diabetes and cancer, as well as neuro-degenerative diseases like macular degeneration. Furthermore, pharmacological targeting of Ezrin could potentially be utilized in diseases with defective TFEB/TFE3 functions like LSDs. While a majority of the findings appear to support the hypotheses, there are substantial gaps in the findings that could be better addressed. Since Ezrin appears to directly regulate MTOR activity, the effects of Ezrin KO on MTOR-regulated, TFEB/TFE3 -driven lysosomal function should be explored more thoroughly. Similarly, a more convincing analysis of autophagic flux should be carried out. Additionally, many immunoblots lack key controls (Control IgG in co-IPs) and many others merit repetition to either improve upon the quality of the existing data, validate the findings using orthogonal approaches, or provide a more rigorous quantitative assessment of the findings, as highlighted in the recommendation for authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the recognition of our study and apologize for the inaccuracies previously. We also greatly appreciate the efforts the reviewer went through with his/her support and help for the improvement of our manuscript. We considerably expanded the number of experiments to support EZRIN/EGFR/AKT network in controlling mTORC1 pathway in the revised manuscript as requested by the Reviewer. We hope the new version of our manuscript will satisfy the Reviewer’s worries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) While the authors show that, in the absence of Ezrin, TSC accumulates on the lysosome and suppresses mTORC1 signaling, they should perform additional genetic experiments to strengthen their conclusions. Can they knockout or knockdown TSC1/2 in Ezrin-deficient cells to rescue mTORC1 activity? Can they mutate the lysosomal localization signal on TSC1 (TSC1Q149E/R204E/K238E) in Ezrin-deficient cells to rescue mTORC1 activity? Does constitutively active AKT (myr-AKT or AKT-E40K) restore mTORC1 activity in Ezrin-deficient cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that it is an important concern that helped us to improve the quality of the data presented. We now provide in the revised version of Figure supplement 4F the results of pharmacological inhibition of Ezrin on MEF-TSC2 KO cells. In line with our findings, the lack of TSC2 is able to rescue mTORC1 signaling in absence of Ezrin activity. Thus, these data strongly support that Ezrin is required for TORC1pathway via TSC complex targeting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the absence of Ezrin, TSC1 constitutively localizes on the lysosome and suppresses mTORC1. Does this suppression hold in the presence of other mTORC1-activating signals (i.e., amino acids, insulin, oxygen)?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion we now provide this information in the revised Figure 6C, in which we showed that stimulation with insulin does not exert its activating effect on mTORC1 signaling (i.e. phosphorylation of pP70 S6 - pT389). These new data, together with the experiments on MEF TSC2 KO cells, clearly support the model by which Ezrin works as a scaffold protein connecting ATK signaling to TSC complex. The lack of Ezrin induces a disconnection between AKT and TSC complex, which is translocated on lysosomes and insensitive to inhibition of AKT signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3A, the authors showed EGFR dimerization through a western blot of a crosslinking assay. However, the western blot data are unclear and do not strongly support their statement. Additionally, the authors mentioned that the dimerization is confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis, but this statement should be revised since the imaging analysis only indirectly shows the copresence of EZR and EGFR, not necessarily the dimerized EGFR. The authors should perform additional experiments to strengthen their claim or tone down their statements in the text and model figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree with the Reviewer on the importance of this issue and now we have fixed this inaccuracy in the revised manuscript. The blots of crosslinking were changed for better exposed images in revised Figure 3, panel A. Moreover, we also properly quantified signals to support our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is interesting that Ezrin binds EGFR, AKT, and TSC as a scaffolding protein. To define the mechanisms by which Ezrin interacts with AKT, EGFR, and TSC, can the authors perform domain analyses to determine which regions of Ezrin are required for its binding with AKT, EGFR, and TSC in mediating EGFR-AKT-TSC-mTORC1 signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his/her comment that improves our manuscript. Conducting domain analysis in the lab would be ideal, although this seems to us a long tour de force that might be associated to several technical and experimental issues. However, in silico approaches provide a helpful alternative for generating initial hypotheses about domain-domain interactions, though they should be seen as a starting point rather than a complete solution. Recent advances in fold prediction suggest that AlphaFold3 could be used to predict dimer formation and, consequently, domain-domain interactions. However, such an approach is challenging in this case because some of the considered proteins are transmembrane, and all are prone to form multimeric complexes with multiple partners, making them poor candidates for reliable fold predictions. In fact, the predicted dimers are poorly supported, and AlphaFold3 lacks confidence in the relative positioning of interactors, limiting its interpretability. Alternatively, database mining and machine-learning methods, such as HINT, Domine, and PPIDomainMiner, provide more robust evidence. Indeed, these tools allow us to consistently identify a strong interaction between Ezrin's FERM central domain and EGFR's PK domain shown now in the Figure Supplement 2C and Supplement Figure 3C-H. Importantly, these findings generate valuable hypotheses, therefore experimental validation is still necessary. But we prefer to leave it for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>(1) There are several immunoblots that did not have adequate controls: - In Figure 2D, an input lane should be shown for each of the cell lysates to demonstrate the presence of other proteins in the cell lysate used for the IP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now fixed this inaccuracy in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 3A does not have a loading control.
