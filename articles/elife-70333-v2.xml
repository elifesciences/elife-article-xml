Several countries are now facing a second or third wave of COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the development of this pandemic is still difficult to predict considering the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations located in the receptor-binding domain of the surface spike protein, which creates a new hazard as evolved viral strains may be more infectious or evade the immune response and hinder vaccination efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">CDC, 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greaney et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Volz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wibmer et al., 2021</xref>). Particularly, the more infectious Alpha variant (B.1.1.7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frampton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rambaut et al., 2020</xref>), together with the Beta variant (B.1.351, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tegally et al., 2020</xref>), Delta (B.1617.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torjesen, 2021</xref>) and Gamma variant (P.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faria et al., 2021</xref> ), considered variants of concern by CDC, which share the antigenic drift and/or signature mutations E484K, L452R,K417N and N501Y in the region of the spike protein that is recognised by neutralising antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tchesnokova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greaney et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wibmer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Early in the pandemic, the RNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was made available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), enabling the testing of infected patients by reverse transcription (RT)–PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnaout et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corman et al., 2020</xref>). Regular and broad testing of SARS-CoV-2 seems essential to contain the propagation of SARS-CoV-2, as many infected individuals express no symptoms, inadvertently spreading the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferretti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kronbichler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petersen and Phillips, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pollock and Lancaster, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sayampanathan et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, successful epidemiological surveillance strategies required to monitor the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the outbreak of new strains should include large-scale screening methods that enable periodic and continuous testing of the general population.</p><p>However, testing capacity has been limited, hampering attempts to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. One obstacle is that reliable nasopharyngeal sampling and RT-PCR testing is highly invasive and requires both specialised staff and appropriate conditions for the manipulation and transport of the samples to comply with clinical standards and protocols expected by regulatory bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">CDC, 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">UK-Government U, 2021</xref>). Lateral flow device antigen tests are cheaper, accurate when detecting individuals with high viral load, and an epidemiologically effective option to identify SARS-CoV-2 contagious people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinnes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pavelka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wagenhäuser et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, correct testing also requires nasopharyngeal sampling. Therefore, regular large-scale testing is difficult because accurate tests are either too invasive, expensive, or logistically complicated to implement, which make them unviable for the task.</p><p>To provide a simple alternative to identify SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we designed and validated a method by which SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be RT-PCR detected from samples taken from a person’s smartphone screen. This <underline>P</underline>h<underline>o</underline>ne <underline>S</underline>creen <underline>T</underline>esting (<italic>PoST</italic>) method shows high sensitivity (81–100%) compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test results from individuals with a high viral load, making the smartphone screen a good proxy of the health status of contagious individuals. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 variants present in <italic>PoST</italic> samples with low RT-PCR Ct value were successfully identified. Overall, our results provide a new, non-invasive, cost-effective, and efficient method to identify COVID-19 contagious infected cases and limit the transmission of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>PoST</italic> pilot to identify COVID-19-positive cases</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected from many different kinds of surfaces, places, and devices, including phones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marshall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santarpia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, active SARS-CoV-2 virus is more likely to be recovered from some surfaces when expelled from individuals with seemingly high viral load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bullard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jefferson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sonnleitner et al., 2021</xref>). Smartphones are personal objects that are constantly exposed to peoples’ mouths, their screens becoming a likely contaminated surface. Therefore, we hypothesised that COVID-19 contagious individuals will regularly deposit aerosols, droplets of saliva, or upper respiratory tract secretions containing shed SARS-CoV-2 virions, over the screen of their phone, which could then be sampled and detected by RT-PCR.</p><p>To facilitate test-trace and isolating strategies of COVID-19-infected individuals, we assessed the RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from smartphone screen swab samples via <italic>PoST</italic>. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in phone screens was then correlated with clinical COVID-19 nasopharyngeal RT-PCR-positive diagnosis of the phones’ owner. The cohort sample in this pilot study consisted of both symptomatic and asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals who required SARS-CoV-2 testing due to a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, close contact to SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, or return to work and travel authorisation requests in Santiago, Chile, between September and October 2020 (3.81% ± 1.0 average positivity rate in Santiago, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>Polyester swabs embedded in saline solution were used by a member of our team to sweep the bottom half of smartphone screens of individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Of 540 individuals, 51 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR detection (9.4% positivity rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> [whole bar], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).

To aid this task, we performed a screen to address whether SARS-CoV-2 variants can be identified from <italic>PoST</italic> samples. Fluorescent probe-based multiplexed or single RT-PCR reactions in 69 <italic>PoST</italic> samples from the 2021 cohort was used to identify the following variations in the Spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 gene: del69/70, K417N/T, E484K, N501Y, P681H. From this analysis, 36 samples fulfilled the criteria of amplifying SARS-CoV-2 control genes S and N. Out of this group, seven samples tested positive for at least one SNP associated with new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two samples had all three variations described to be present in Beta (B.1.351-South African) or Gamma (P.1-Brasilian) variants (K417T, E484K, N501Y). Another three samples showed variations E484K and N501, which are only found together in Gamma and Beta variants. Even though these samples did not test positive for K417T, it is still likely that the virus in these samples corresponds to either Beta or Gamma, as the combination of variations that tested positive have only been found together in these two SARS-CoV-2 variants. One sample only tested positive for SNP K417T, which is only found in Gamma and Beta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Lastly, we identified one sample with variation del69/70 and P681H, which are only found together in the Alpha (B.1.1.7- UK) SARS-CoV-2 variant.

The Ct value of RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal samples may present a level of variability that is intrinsic to the nature of the technique, the sampling process, and because the results are not standardised to an internal reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahdouh et al., 2021</xref>). However, considering these inherent limitations, correlations have been found between nasopharyngeal samples with low RT-PCR Ct value results and the level of infectivity assessed by the capacity to propagate the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro from such samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bullard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jefferson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sonnleitner et al., 2021</xref>). Our results add support to the possibility that patients with low Ct RT-PCR results from nasopharyngeal samples present a high viral load and are actively shedding SARS-Cov-2, which can be detected on the screen of smartphones.</p><p>Of all the <italic>PoST-</italic>positive samples, most of which had low nasopharyngeal RT-PCR Ct results, 76% of the pilot and 35% in the validation study were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic at the moment of testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">2</xref>). Suggesting that <italic>PoST</italic> is effective in identifying COVID-19-positive individuals regardless of their symptoms.</p><p>SARS-CoV-2 variant identification is required to further enhance epidemiological surveillance to contain the spreading of variants of concern that are more pathogenic or infective, to contain and isolate their dissemination. We successfully identified one <italic>PoST</italic> sample that presented all three polymorphisms present in Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants. The rest of the tests did not unequivocally show which SARS-CoV-2 variant was present in the sample but was enough to conclude the nature of the variant present in the sample. Even though optimisation will be required to enhance SARS-CoV-2 variant identification in <italic>PoST</italic> samples, our results are encouraging, and could make <italic>PoST</italic> a viable option to screen for variants of concern. In this scenario, and although the output of results would take longer, PCR and sequencing will likely enhance the performance of variant detection in <italic>PoST</italic> samples.</p><p>Regarding nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results with a high Ct value (i.e., lower-viral load), these are probably in transition, and either starting or ending a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, they are less likely to shed SARS-CoV-2 virions that can be detected by <italic>PoST</italic>. This transition is the reason why periodic regular testing is required to identify those infected individuals once they enter a contagious phase.</p><p>To a lesser extent and against the overall trend we observe for <italic>PoST</italic> detection, <italic>PoST-</italic>positive results were identified in this high Ct value nasopharyngeal RT-PCR results group. Given the unstable nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman, 2020</xref>), and the pervasive activity of RNases that are ubiquitously present in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Probst et al., 2006</xref>), it is unlikely that these positive <italic>PoST</italic> results are due to the detection of long-lasting virus or RNA on the phone screen surface. Hence, we could exclude the possibility that these <italic>PoST-</italic>positive results are the consequence of detecting RNA from when individuals were passing through a moment of higher COVID-19 infection. Therefore, one could speculate that these results are the consequence of suboptimal nasopharyngeal sampling, which would explain the low amount of virus in the sample and hence, a high Ct value. Alternatively, it is plausible that these samples belong to individuals with a low viral load that are still actively contagious, which is against the observed trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bullard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jefferson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sonnleitner et al., 2021</xref>), but cannot be excluded as a possibility. It will be interesting to perform a follow-up study on these individuals as they could be part of a group with a higher capacity to shed SARS-CoV-2 along their infectious cycle, potentially explaining the COVID-19 superspreading capacity observed in some people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The distribution profile of the nasopharyngeal RT-PCR Ct test results in our study was different in the pilot and validation cohorts. The pilot Ct results presented an apparent bimodal distribution with low and high Ct value populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, in the validation study, the distribution was unimodal and most samples tended towards low RT-PCR Ct results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We speculate that this stark difference could be due to an inherent characteristic of these cohorts related to the positivity rates in the population of Santiago at the time of sampling. In fact, the distribution profile of the pilot nasopharyngeal Ct values is similar to that corresponding to samples taken when the pilot sampling was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G–H</xref>). At the time the pilot study was performed, Santiago, Chile, presented a low average positivity rate (3.8% ± 1.0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chilean Department of Health, 2021</xref>), and was recovering from the first COVID-19 wave. Likewise, the distribution profile of the validation cohort nasopharyngeal Ct results was similar to when Santiago was passing through the middle of first the COVID-19 wave, at a high average positivity rate (9.5–26.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). This observation suggests that the RT-PCR Ct value results distribution could show specific profile signatures that express the epidemiological status of the population.

Excluding staff and premises, the net cost of a nasopharyngeal test in Chile ranges between 20 and 35 USD, which includes sample tube, transport media, swab, RNA extraction kit, and RT-PCR kit. Because <italic>PoST</italic> does not use clinical-grade consumables and reagents, its net cost for the same items ranges between 2 and 3 USD when it is the result of a single sample tested RT-PCR reaction. This net cost can go below $1 USD when <italic>PoST</italic> samples are pooled and groups of 5 and a single RT-PCR is performed, which we have shown to produce reliable results for <italic>PoST</italic> samples (data not shown).</p><p>Besides <italic>PoST</italic> not using clinical-grade consumables and reagents, one key optimisation is that <italic>PoST</italic> does not require an RNA extraction step, which reduces the cost by approximately $7 USD. Furthermore, instead of purchasing an RT-PCR kit specifically designed for SARS-CoV-2 detection, we assembled a combination of off-the-shelf probe/primers to detect the SARS-CoV-2 gene ‘N’ together with a generic RT-PCR kit. All together this optimisation enables a 10-fold price reduction of the net cost of <italic>PoST</italic> compared to a regular nasopharyngeal RT-PCT test.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>High sensitivity and specificity</title><p>The <italic>PoST</italic> method has a similar sensitivity and specificity, compared to antigen lateral flow devices, which are extensively used for routine testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dinnes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jääskeläinen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wagenhäuser et al., 2021</xref>). Clinical-grade diagnostic RT-PCR kits include the detection of three SARS-CoV-2 genes, plus a human positive control, either multiplexed or individually detected. The specificity reached by <italic>PoST</italic> in this study was achieved only when detecting the ‘N’ SARS-CoV-2 gene. This could explain why PoST can miss identifying some positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR samples in the low Ct range. A study adding the detection of two or three SARS-CoV-2 genes in the <italic>PoST</italic> protocol to assess whether a higher sensitivity is achieved would enable us to calculate whether this trade-off is enough to justify increasing the net cost of the <italic>PoST</italic> assay. Especially considering that the sensitivity described in this study is already high enough to detect COVID-19-positive individuals to affect limiting the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kennedy-Shaffer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larremore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mina et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>Sampling speed and result turnaround of <italic>PoST</italic></title><p>One other advantage of the <italic>PoST</italic> method is that the sampling process takes around a minute at most and does not require a particular setup besides having a sterile swab and sample tube. To maximise the speed and minimise errors in the <italic>PoST</italic> processing of samples, we developed a barcode-based smartphone application (unpublished), which enables the efficient tracking of the samples through the testing pipeline, ending with the delivery of results to the tested individuals’ smartphone via SMS. Moreover, pooling samples can reduce the number of RT-PCR required to process, further decreasing the time to deliver results, when the positivity rate is below 5% to justify pooling. With all this in place, a minimal non-automatised laboratory setup with one 96-well plate real-time PCR machine has the potential to deliver 940 test results per day, when processed by two technicians, and working on two rounds of 470 samples.</p><p>Altogether, this enables an efficient turnaround of results such that after the samples arrive at the lab, the results of 940 can be delivered in approximately 5.5 hr, if no SARS-CoV-2-positive samples are found, and 6.5 hr if positive individual samples are to be identified from pools. These times consider two technicians processing the samples to feed one 96-well plate real-time PCR machine. Therefore, under these conditions, results for 940 tests could be provided within the same day of sampling, which is ideal to isolate contagious cases, and effectively curb the spreading of COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-4"><title><italic>PoST</italic> as an alternative self-testing method</title><p>Due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid result turnaround time, lateral flow device antigen testing has become widely used to screen for COVID-19 cases operated by trained staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pavelka et al., 2021</xref>) and self-administered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Riley et al., 2021</xref>).

If only the E gene was amplified, the test was considered presumably positive, thus requiring repetition by another extraction instrument (MagNAPure Compact System, Roche).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants</title><p>The detection of different SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide and deletion variants was performed using the Applied Biosystems TaqMan SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Panel kit (ThermoFisher) according to the conditions recommended by the manufacturer, on the AriaMx Real-time PCR system (Agilent Technologies) thermal cycler for fluorescence detection on VIC (reference sequence) and FAM channels (mutation sequence), and the AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Variants ID Real-Time RT-PCR kit (Bioneer) according to manufacturer conditions, on the Exicycler 96 V4 Real Time thermal cycler (Bioneer) to detect fluorescence on the TET, TexasRed, FAM, TAMRA, and Cyanine5 channels.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful for the help from the following colleagues: Rachel Aguilar Montes, Prof. Miguel Allende, José Aramburó, Mauricio Daza, Dr Carmen Feijóo, Camila Gonzalez Badilla, Itziar Linazaroso, Dr Jaime Mañalich, Dr Gonzalo Mena, Emiliana Montes, Dr Gareth Powell, Rodrigo Prieto, Esteban Quiñones, Dr Cristian Undurraga, Whitmy Valdés Araneda, Dr Carlos Vega, Mr Timothy Best, Dr Kathryn Harris, Dr Julianne Brown and Healthcare Scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital Microbiology Department RY was supported by a Moorfields Eye Charity Career Development Award and a Springboard Award.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Phone Screen Testing of SARS-CoV-2 complemented by a computer-based strategy to effectively tackle the COVID-19 pandemic&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan Dushoff (Reviewer #2); Ben S Cooper (Reviewer #3).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the testing of mobile phone screens is highly novel and this study demonstrates that it could be potentially useful to expedite more widespread testing. The major reservations related to the mathematical modeling and the lack of specific consideration about implementation issues. Reviewer two pointed out the these included models are &quot;neither necessary or sufficient to evaluate the possible usefulness of this testing method.&quot; It would be necessary to describe the specifics of a screening plan based on smartphone testing how it might interact with other interventions, or possible disadvantages due to displacing other tests that may have higher sensitivity or specificity. Testing smartphones at scale requires a plan, and an assessment of costs, including opportunity costs.</p><p>The modeling while robust, does not account for these real world issues and is not specifically calibrated to any specific COVID epidemiology data or parameters. Moreover, the effects in the model are mediated mostly by the quarantine associated with testing, whereas the greatest utility of this testing approach would require linkage to contact tracing.</p><p>A final comment on the cell phone testing strategy was that the sample size is small, with only 51 SARS-CoV-2 individuals (by nasopharyngeal swab). Overall, this presents as an extremely promising pilot study which needs further validation in a larger cohort.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Strengths of the study are:</p><p>– A novel and potentially extremely useful approach to testing;</p><p>– Exciting data showing that cell phone swabbing can clearly be used to detect most people who remain contagious;</p><p>– The key variable for this approach is turnaround time of the assay and this is addressed in the mathematical model.</p><p>Areas for potential improvement are:</p><p>– The model has not been linked to real epidemic data such that estimates of the daily percentage of people who must be tested to achieve epidemic control are likely not reliable.</p><p>– The model links testing to quarantine which is compatible with current clinical and public health practice even if testing is generally catered to people who are at risk for infection based on symptoms or contacts rather than mass screening. In that sense, the model is really capturing the effect of mass testing and quarantine. The more realistic implementation would be use of this approach in a focused test and trace model.</p><p>– In general, a more detailed and realistic model is needed to assess the degree of implementation required in order to flatten or eliminate subsequent epidemic curves.</p><p>My opinion is that the assay portion of the paper alone would do well as a short report. However, the modeling lacks sufficient link to data and details of an implementation plan to truly inform public health policy or practice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The technology proposed is interesting and may well have potential.</p><p>The authors argue for smartphone testing as a component of a COVID screening strategy. They have done a small pilot study that shows promising results. They add two sensible mathematical models which contain a lot of assumptions, at least some of which should be better justified. Crucially, these mathematical models are neither necessary or sufficient to evaluate the possible usefulness of this testing method. The authors do not discuss what a screening plan based on smartphone testing might look like, how it might interact with other interventions, or possible disadvantages due to displacing other tests that may have higher sensitivity or specificity.</p><p>The pilot study is very small. The results are certainly promising, but should not be over-interpreted. The authors do not say if the k-means based partitioning was pre-planned.</p><p>The authors dismiss their method's low sensitivity for samples with low viral loads too lightly: in particular, the claim that &quot;only&quot; individuals with Ct&lt;30 expel culturable virions is not supported by the cited studies. Even less is known about &quot;infectiousness&quot;. The authors also state that individuals early in infection are not likely to be infectious without discussing the fact that these people are likely to become infectious in reality, but not in the authors' model world, where they are not infected.</p><p>Testing smartphones at scale requires a plan, and an assessment of costs, including opportunity costs. The authors seem to assume that everyone in the population can be tested this way, either at random in the ODE model, or sequentially in the ABM. They do not discuss questions of access or of equity (which populations don't have smartphones?). The authors discuss the difficulty of nasopharyngeal testing (L60) but could provide more details about the relative advantages of smartphone testing.</p><p>The presented models are not a substitute for a clear plan or for a larger confirmatory study. There is nothing specific in the models to smartphone-based surveillance. In particular, the models do not incorporate the putative sharp difference in sensitivity to high vs. low viral loads, nor take into account how viral loads might vary through time in an infection. There are many models available to do what the authors' models do, but they are not discussed. The authors' models may well have new features, but absent a relevant literature review, the reader cannot judge.</p><p>The authors should avoid post hoc analysis pathways (like using k-means to divide into two clusters). It's probably OK to report that 26/28 high or medium-load samples were positive, but this proportion should be reported with confidence intervals and (unless the authors had a clearly written plan beforehand to not do this) the overall proportion should be reported with confidence intervals as well.</p><p>It's pretty well known that better surveillance techniques would be better.

The main advantage of swabbing phones rather than the nasopharynx, the authors argue, is that costs would be lower and testing could be faster.</p><p>The authors demonstrate feasibility of such an approach by applying their smartphone screening protocol to 540 individuals, 51 of whom are positive SARS-CoV-2 (by RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs. They demonstrate remarkable concordance between the nasopharyngeal and smartphone screening results. They then perform two model-based analyses, first using a simple deterministic model with homogeneous mixing, and second using an idealised individual based model (with transmission occurring on a 100x100 grid), and show that under the model assumptions daily smartphone testing of 10% of all individuals would be able to suppress transmission of the virus provided screening results are acted on between 0 and 3 days after the swabs are taken.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major strength of the work is its novelty: I am not aware of other attempts to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection routinely by screening smartphones, and if the very high concordance with nasopharyngeal swabbing achieved here could be demonstrated in a larger and better-characterised cohort the results could have considerable significance given the lower costs and greater ease with which smartphones can be screened (it could, for example, be mechanised reducing costs further).</p><p>Secondly, quite apart from whether the findings do have potential to be used in routine screening as the authors suggest, the finding concerning the agreement between results from screening phones and nasopharynx has infection control implications which, though not mentioned by the authors, may be of potential importance in some contexts.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The sample size is small, with only 51 SARS-CoV-2 individuals (by nasopharyngeal swab) so this must be considered a pilot study rather than a large-scale evaluation of the approach. Clearly, if the approach is to gain any traction a much larger study is needed.</p><p>The claimed advantages over conventional nasopharyngeal screening are lower costs and faster turnaround times, but no attempt to quantify these are given. This information seems crucial for comparison with other testing approaches (e.g. PCR-based tests of nasopharyngeal swabs and lateral flow tests which are now widely used).</p><p>While the modelling seems to be done with competence, conclusions are based on idealised assumptions. For example, models assume once isolated infected individuals do not contribute to further transmission. At least in settings where isolation occurs at home (which is most parts of the world) this is not a realistic assumption. Other aspects of the models also lack biological realism (for example, the assumption that infectivity does not change over the course of an infection and exponential sojourn times in model compartments). For these reasons, the claim that &quot;iterative testing over 10% of the population [daily] could effectively suppress the spread of COVID-19&quot; applies only to the hypothetical idealised world of the model, and the work tells us little about how such at an approach would work in practice (accounting for the fact that isolation will not stop within-household transmission and that isolation will be imperfect etc).</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Some of the terminology used is non-standard. For example &quot;quarantine&quot; traditionally applies to isolation of those considered at risk of being infected but who have not yet been shown to be infected. &quot;isolation&quot; would be a better term for what the authors are describing.</p><p>2. I don't think the comparison with influenza in 1918/19 and talk of the &quot;third wave&quot; (as a universal occurrence) is helpful – it's a very different pathogen, and different countries may experience different numbers of &quot;waves&quot; due to the timing of interventions, emerging variants and seasonal factors.</p><p>3. To better make the case for the advantages of the approach over nasopharyngeal screening, some numbers are needed: costs, turnaround times etc.</p><p>4. Very little information is given on how those screened are selected. This information would strengthen the paper.</p><p>5. To make the case for the value of the approach in a specific population information on smartphone ownership in different age groups is needed.</p><p>6. Another potential advantage over nasopharyngeal swabbing is the lack of physical discomfort. This could lead to greater acceptance of the approach. In future work, it would be interesting to explore this.</p><p>7. Clearly, if the remarkable findings reported are to translate into a real-world intervention a much larger study with a better characterised population is needed. In future work the authors could also consider exploring RT-PCR versus lateral flow testing of the phone swabs.</p><p>8. While the models reported are adequate for a rough back-of-the envelope assessment, a more thorough model-based assessment would require models that have a stronger biological basis (i.e. more realistic assumptions about how infectivity changes over time, see for example, Grassly et al. Lancet Inf Dis 2020), and also more realistic assumptions about isolation (i.e. adherence and transmission in isolation settings).</p><p>9. In line with the approach in Grassly et al., I think it would be more informative to report modelling results as % reductions in transmission, as baseline transmissibility varies widely between settings (due to variation in climate, behaviours, pathogen lineage etc).</p><p>10. Very few results are reported from the agent-based model (only the kurtosis plots). It wasn't clear to me why this model wasn't explored more fully.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Smartphone Screen Testing, a novel pre-diagnostic method to identify SARS-CoV-2 infectious individuals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers agreed that the testing of mobile phone screens is highly novel and this study demonstrates that it could be potentially useful to expedite more widespread testing. The major reservations related to the mathematical modeling and the lack of specific consideration about implementation issues. Reviewer two pointed out the these included models are &quot;neither necessary or sufficient to evaluate the possible usefulness of this testing method.&quot; It would be necessary to describe the specifics of a screening plan based on smartphone testing how it might interact with other interventions, or possible disadvantages due to displacing other tests that may have higher sensitivity or specificity. Testing smartphones at scale requires a plan, and an assessment of costs, including opportunity costs.</p><p>The modeling while robust, does not account for these real world issues and is not specifically calibrated to any specific COVID epidemiology data or parameters. Moreover, the effects in the model are mediated mostly by the quarantine associated with testing, whereas the greatest utility of this testing approach would require linkage to contact tracing.</p><p>A final comment on the cell phone testing strategy was that the sample size is small, with only 51 SARS-CoV-2 individuals (by nasopharyngeal swab). Overall, this presents as an extremely promising pilot study which needs further validation in a larger cohort.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their very helpful comments, all of which have been taken on board in this new improved manuscript. Besides removing the computational modelling section from the manuscript, the three main changes in the new version are:</p><p>1. In addition to the 51 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive samples, 182 new cases were added to the study.</p><p>2. We show that SARS-CoV-2 ‘variants of concern’ can be identified from the samples taken from smartphone screens.</p><p>3. We have extensively elaborated on the interpretation and limitations of our results in the Discussion section of the new manuscript.</p><p>In the following rebuttal, we have only addressed the comments of reviewers regarding the SARSCoV-2 phone screen testing method. Below, we provide a more detailed description of our responses to the reviewer comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] My opinion is that the assay portion of the paper alone would do well as a short report.

It's probably OK to report that 26/28 high or medium-load samples were positive, but this proportion should be reported with confidence intervals and (unless the authors had a clearly written plan beforehand to not do this) the overall proportion should be reported with confidence intervals as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The k-means post hoc analysis has been removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] What is needed to make this paper convincing is more data (or better scepticism about the existing data) and more discussion about logistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the SARS-CoV-2 Rt-PCR positive sample number four times and also extensively elaborated on the implications and potential of this new method in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't understand the claim at L123.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been removed from the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Not sure if this is in the reviewer's ambit, but I dislike the explanations surrounding the conflict of interest.
