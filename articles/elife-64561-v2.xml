prestigious institutions receive more credit for their work than scientists based at less prestigious institutions, as do scientists working in certain countries. We examined the extent to which country- and institution-related status signals drive such differences in scientific recognition. In a preregistered survey experiment, we asked 4,147 scientists from six disciplines (astronomy, cardiology, materials science, political science, psychology and public health) to rate abstracts that varied on two factors: (i) author country (high status vs lower status in science); (ii) author institution (high status vs lower status university).

Already in the 1960s, sociologists of science suggested that researchers, in the midst of this information overload, would search for cues as to what literature to read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Merton, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crane, 1965</xref>). One important cue was the author’s location. Academic affiliations would cast a “halo-effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crane, 1967</xref>) on scholarly work that would amplify the recognition of researchers based at prestigious institutions at the expense of authors from institutions and nations of lower status. This halo effect ties closely to the idea of the “Matthew effect” in science, i.e. “the accumulation of differential advantages for certain segments of the population [of researchers] that are not necessarily bound up with demonstrated differences in capacity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Merton, 1988</xref>).</p><p>From a social psychological perspective, country- and institution-related halo effects may arise from stereotypic beliefs about the relative performance capacity of scientists working at more or less prestigious institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jost et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greenwald and Banaji, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ridgeway, 2001</xref>). According to status characteristics theory, a scientist’s nationality or institutional affiliation can be considered “status signals” that, when salient, implicitly influence peer-evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Correll and Bernard, 2015</xref>). Moreover, system justification theory asserts that members of a social hierarchy, such as the scientific community, regardless of their position in this hierarchy, will feel motivated to see existing social arrangements as fair and justifiable to preserve a sense of predictability and certainty around their own position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jost et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jost et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Magee and Galinsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Son Hing et al., 2011</xref>). As a result, both higher and lower status groups may internalize implicit behaviours and attitudes that favour higher-status groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jost, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several observational studies have examined the influence of country- and institution-related halo effects in peer-reviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crane, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Link, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murray et al., 2018</xref>). Most of them indicate slight advantages in favor of researchers from high status countries (such as the US or UK) and universities (such as Harvard University or Oxford University). However, a key limitation of this literature concerns the unobserved heterogeneity attributable to differences in quality. Non-experimental designs do not allow us to determine the advantages enjoyed by scientists at high-status locations independent of their capabilities as scientists, or the content and character of their work.</p><p>Here we examine the impact of academic affiliations on scientific judgment, independent of manuscript quality. Specifically, we consider how information about the geographical location and institutional affiliation of authors influence how scientific abstracts are evaluated by their peers. In a preregistered survey experiment, we asked 4147 scientists from six disciplines (astronomy, cardiology, materials science, political science, psychology and public health) to rate abstracts that vary on two factors: (i) author country (high status vs. lower status scientific nation); (ii) institutional affiliation (high status vs. lower status university; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All other content of the discipline-specific abstracts was held constant.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Sample distributions for the three-way factorial design across the six disciplines.</title><p>Number of observations, N, by manipulation (rows) and disciplines (columns).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Manipulation/Discipline</th><th valign="top">Astronomy <break/>(N = 502)</th><th valign="top">Cardiology <break/>(N = 609)</th><th valign="top">Mat. science (N = 546)</th><th valign="top">Pol. science <break/>(N = 1008)</th><th valign="top">Psychology <break/>(N = 624)</th><th valign="top">Public health <break/>(N = 732)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Higher status (US)</td><td valign="top">N = 209</td><td valign="top">N = 191</td><td valign="top">N = 196</td><td valign="top">N = 351</td><td valign="top">N = 216</td><td valign="top">N = 241</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lower status (US)</td><td valign="top">N = 192</td><td valign="top">N = 213</td><td valign="top">N = 187</td><td valign="top">N = 319</td><td valign="top">N = 205</td><td valign="top">N = 237</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Lower status (non-US)</td><td valign="top">N = 191</td><td valign="top">N = 205</td><td valign="top">N = 163</td><td valign="top">N = 338</td><td valign="top">N = 213</td><td valign="top">N = 254</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>A few pioneering studies have already attempted to discern the influence of national and institutional location on scholarly peer-assessments, independent of manuscript quality. One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blank, 1991</xref>) used a randomized field experiment to examine the effects of double blind vs. single blind peer reviewing on acceptance rates in the <italic>American Economic Review</italic>. The study found no evidence that a switch from single blind to double blind peer reviewing influenced the relative ratings of papers from high-ranked and lower-ranked universities. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ross et al., 2006</xref>) examined the effect of single blind vs. double blind peer reviewing on the assessment of 13,000 abstracts submitted to the American Heart Association’s annual Scientific Sessions between 2000 and 2004. The study found that when abstracts underwent single blind compared to double blind reviewing the relative increase in acceptance rates was higher for US authored abstracts compared to non-US authored abstracts, and for abstracts from highly prestigious US institutions compared to abstracts from non-prestigious US institutions.</p><p>A recent survey experiment also found that professors at schools of public health in the US (N: 899) rated one abstract higher on likelihood of referral to a peer, when the authors’ affiliation was changed from a low-income to a high-income country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). However, each participant was asked to rate four abstracts and the results for the remaining three abstracts were inconclusive. Likewise, the study found no evidence of country-related bias in the ratings of the strength of the evidence presented in the abstracts. In another randomized, blinded cross-over study (N: 347), the same authors found that changing the source of an abstract from a low-income to a high-income country slightly improved English clinicians’ ratings of relevance and recommendation to a peer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, a controlled field experiment recently examined the “within subject” effect of peer-review model (single blind vs. double blind) on the acceptance rates of full-length submissions for a prestigious computer-science conference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tomkins et al., 2017</xref>). The study allocated 974 double blind and 983 single blind reviewers to 500 papers. Two single blind and two double blind reviewers assessed each paper. The study found that single blind reviewers were more likely than double blind reviewers to accept papers from top-ranked universities compared to papers from lower-ranked universities.</p><p>Our study contributes to this pioneering work by targeting a broader range of disciplines in the social sciences, health sciences and natural sciences. This allows us to examine possible between-discipline variation in the prevalence of country- or institution-related rater bias.</p><p>Our six discipline-specific experiments show weak and inconsistent evidence of country- or institution-related status bias in abstract ratings, and mixed regression models indicate that any plausible effect must be small in size.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In accordance with our preregistered plan (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/4gjwa">https://osf.io/4gjwa</ext-link>), the analysis took place in two steps. First, we used ANOVAs and logit models to conduct discipline-specific analyses of how country- and institution-related status signals influence scholarly judgments made by peer-evaluators. Second, we employed mixed regression models with disciplines as random effect parameter to estimate the direct effect and moderation effects of the presumed association between status signals and evaluative outcomes at an aggregate, cross-disciplinary level.</p><p>We used three measures to gauge the assessments of abstracts by peer-evaluators. <italic>Abstract score</italic> is our main outcome variable. It consists of four items recorded on a five-point scale (1=“very poor”, 5 = “excellent”) that ask the peer-evaluators to assess (i) the originality of the presented research, (ii) the credibility of the results, (iii) the significance for future research, and (iv) the clarity and comprehensiveness of the abstract. We computed a composite measure that specifies each participant’s total-item score for these four items (Cronbach’s <italic>α</italic> = 0.778). <italic>Open full-text</italic> is a dichotomous outcome measure that asks whether the peer-evaluator would choose to open the full text and continue reading, if s/he came across the abstract online. <italic>Include in conference</italic> is a dichotomous outcome measure that asks whether the peer-evaluator would choose to include the abstract for an oral presentation, if s/he was reviewing it as a committee member of a selective international scientific conference (the full questionnaire is included in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>As specified in the registered plan, we used G*Power to calculate the required sample size per discipline (N = 429) for detecting a Cohen’s <italic>f</italic> = 0.15 (corresponding to a Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.30) or larger with α = 0.05 and a power of 0.80 in the cross-group comparisons with abstract score as outcome. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> presents the final sample distributions for the three-way factorial design across the six disciplines.</p><p>To test for statistical equivalence in the discipline-specific comparisons of our main outcome (abstract score) across manipulations, we performed the two-one-sided tests procedure [TOST] for differences between independent means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lakens, 2017a</xref>). We used the pre-registered ‘minimum detectable effect size’ of Cohen’s <italic>D=</italic>±0.30 for the discipline-specific equivalence tests.</p><p>The boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> display the abstracts ratings for respondents assigned to each manipulation across the six disciplines.

All of these models yielded qualitatively similar results, with small residual effects and confidence intervals spanning 0 in the linear regressions and one in the logistic regressions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Tables S28–S33). Moreover, a pre-registered interaction analysis was conducted to examine whether the influence of country- and institution-related status signals was moderated by any of the following characteristics of the peer evaluators: (i) their descriptive beliefs in the objectivity and fairness of peer-evaluation; (ii) their structural location in the science system (in terms of institutional affiliation and scientific rank); (iii) their research accomplishments; (iv) their self-perceived scientific status. All of these two-way interactions had 99% CI intervals spanning 0 in the linear regressions and one in the logistic regressions, indicating no discernible two-way interactions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Tables S34–S39).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Contrary to the idea of halo effects, our study shows weak and inconsistent evidence of country- or institution-related status bias in abstract ratings. In the discipline-specific analyses, we observed statistically significant differences in two of 36 pairwise comparisons (i.e. 5.6%) and, of these, one was inconsistent with our a-priori expectation of a bias in favour of high-status sources. Moreover, the estimated confidence bounds derived from the multilevel regressions were either very small or small according to Cohen’s classification of effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cohen, 2013</xref>). These results align with the outcomes of three out of five existing experiments, which also show small and inconsistent effects of country- and institution-related status bias in peer-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blank, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris et al., 2017</xref>). However, it should be noted that even small effects may produce large population-level variations if they accumulate over the course of scientific careers. Moreover, one could argue that small effects would be the expected outcome for a lightweight manipulation like ours in an online survey context, where the participants are asked to make decisions without real-world implications. Indeed, it is possible that the effects of country- and institution level status signals would be larger in real-world evaluation processes, where reviewers have more at stake.</p><p>Certain scope conditions also delimit the situations to which our conclusions may apply. First, our findings leave open the possibility that peer-evaluators discard research from less reputable institutions and science nations without even reading their abstracts. In other words, our study solely tests whether scientists, after being asked to carefully read an assigned abstract, on average will rate contributions from prestigious locations more favourably.</p><p>Second, even <italic>when</italic> peer-evaluators identify and read papers from “lower-status” sources, they may still omit to cite them, and instead frame their contributions in the context of more high-status sources. In the future, researchers might add to this work by examining if these more subtle processes contribute to shape the reception and uptake of scientific knowledge. Third, our conclusion of little or no bias in abstract review does not necessarily imply that biases are absent in other types of peer assessment, such as peer reviewing of journal and grant submissions, where evaluations usually follow formalized criteria and focus on full-text manuscripts and proposals. Likewise, our study does not capture how country- and institution-related status signals may influence the decisions of journal editors. Indeed, journal editors play an important role in establishing scientific merits and reputations and future experimental work should examine how halo effects may shape editorial decisions. Fourth, although we cover a broad span of research areas, it is possible that our experiment would have produced different results for other disciplines. Fifth, it should be noted that our two dichotomous outcome items (open full text and include in conference) refer to two rather different evaluative situations that may be difficult to compare. For instance, a researcher may wish to read a paper (based on its abstract) while finding it inappropriate for a conference presentation and vice versa. Moreover, the competitive aspect of selecting an abstract for a conference makes this evaluative situation quite different from the decision to open a full text.</p><p>A key limitation is that our experiment was conducted in non-probability samples with low response rates, which raises questions about selection effects. One could speculate that the scientists that are most susceptible to status bias would be less likely to participate in a study conducted by researchers from two public universities in Denmark. Moreover, we decided to include internationally outstanding universities in our high-status category (California Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Harvard University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University, Stanford University, and University of California, Berkeley). By so doing, we aimed to ensure a relatively strong status signal in the abstract’s byline. There is a risk that this focus on outstanding institutions may have led some survey participants to discern the purpose of the experiment and censor their responses to appear unbiased. However, all participants were blinded to the study objectives (the invitation email is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and to reduce the salience of the manipulation, we asked each participant to review only one abstract. Moreover, in the minds of the reviewers, many other factors than the scholarly affiliations might have been manipulated in the abstracts, including the gender of the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forscher et al., 2019</xref>), the style of writing, the source of the empirical data presented in the abstract, the clarity of the statistical reporting, the reporting of positive vs. negative and mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahoney, 1977</xref>), the reporting of intuitive vs. counter-intuitive findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahoney, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hergovich et al., 2010</xref>), and the reporting of journal information and visibility metrics (e.g. citation indicators or Altmetric scores) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Teplitskiy et al., 2020</xref>). A final limitation concerns the varying assessments of abstract quality across disciplines. This cross-disciplinary variation was particularly salient for the <italic>Include in conference</italic> item (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, panel b), which may indicate differences in the relative difficulty of getting an oral presentation at conferences in the six disciplines. In the mixed-regression models based on data from all six disciplines, we attempt to account for this variation by including discipline as random-effect parameter. In summary, this paper presents a large-scale, cross-disciplinary examination of how country- and institution-related status signals influence the reception of scientific research. In a controlled experiment that spanned six disciplines, we found no systematic evidence of status bias against abstracts from lower status universities and countries. Future research should add to this work by examining if other processes related to the social, material and intellectual organization of science contribute to producing and reproducing country- and institution-related status hierarchies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Our study complies with all ethical regulations. Aarhus University’s Institutional Review Board approved the study (case no. 2019-616-000014). We obtained informed consent from all participants. The sampling and analysis plan was preregistered at the Open Science Framework on September 18, 2019. We have followed all of the steps presented in the registered plan, with two minor deviations. First, we did not preregister the equivalence tests reported for the discipline-specific analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Second, in the results section, we report the outcomes of the mixed regression models with abstract score as outcome based on linear models instead of the tobit models included in the registered plan.

To allow for the retrieval of contact information (specifically email addresses), we limited our focus to corresponding authors with a majority of publications falling into one of the following six disciplinary categories: astronomy, cardiology, materials science, political science, psychology and public health. These disciplines were chosen to represent the top-level domains; natural science, technical science, health science, and social science. We did not include the arts and humanities as the majority of fields in this domain have very different traditions of publishing and interpret scholarly quality in less comparable terms. While other fields could have been chosen as representative of those domains, practical aspects of access to field experts and coverage in Web of Science were deciding for the final delineation. We used the WoS subject categories and the Centre for Science and Technology Studies’ (CWTS) meso-level cluster classification system to identify eligible authors within each of these disciplines. For all fields, except for materials science, the WoS subject categories provided a useful field delineation. In materials science, the WoS subject categories were too broad. Hence, we used the article-based meso-level classification of CWTS to identify those papers most closely related to the topic of our abstract. In our sampling strategy, we made sure that no participants were asked to review abstracts written by (fictive) authors affiliated with their own research institutions.</p><p>We used G*Power to calculate the required sample size for detecting a Cohen’s <italic>f</italic> = 0.15 (corresponding to a Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.30) or larger with α = 0.05 and a power of 0.80 in the discipline-specific analyses with abstract rating as outcome. With these assumptions, a comparison of three groups would require at least 429 respondents per discipline. Response rates for email-based academic surveys are known to be low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Myers et al., 2020</xref>). Based on the outcomes of a pilot study targeting neuroscientists, we expected a response rate around 5% and distributed the survey to approximately 72,000 researchers globally (i.e. approximately 12,000 researchers per field) (for specifications, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Table S45). All data were collected in October and November 2019. Due to low response rates in materials science and cardiology, we expanded the recruitment samples by an additional ~12,000 scientists in each of these disciplines. In total, our recruitment sample consisted 95,317 scientists. Each scientist was invited to participate in the survey by email, and we used the web-based Qualtrics software for data collection. We sent out five reminders and closed the survey two weeks after the final reminder. Eight percent (N = 7,401) of the invited participants opened the email survey link, and about six percent (N = 5,413) completed the questionnaire (for specifications on discipline-specific completion rates, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Table S45). For ethical reasons, our analysis solely relies on data from participants that reached the final page of the survey, where we debriefed about the study’s experimental manipulations. The actual response rate is difficult to estimate. Some scientists may have refrained from participating in the study because they did not see themselves as belonging to one of the targeted disciplines. Others may not have responded because they were on sabbatical, parental leave or sick leave. Moreover, approximately 16 percent (15,247) of the targeted email addresses were inactive or bounced for other reasons. A crude estimate of the response rate would thus be 5,413/(95,317–15,247)=0.07, or seven percent. The gender composition of the six respondent samples largely resembles that of the targeted WoS populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Table S46). However, the average publication age (i.e. years since first publication in WoS) is slightly higher in the respondent samples compared to the targeted WoS populations, which may be due to the study’s restricted focus on corresponding authors (the age distributions are largely similar across the recruitment and respondent samples). The distribution of respondents (per discipline) across countries in WoS, the recruitment sample, and the respondent sample is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Table S47.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Pretesting and pilot testing</title><p>Prior to launching, the survey was pretested with eight researchers in sociology, information science, political science, psychology, physics, biomedicine, clinical medicine, and public health.

Moreover, we elicited how the participants arrived at answers to the questions and whether the questions were easy or hard to answer, and why.</p><p>In addition, we pilot-tested the survey in a sample of 6,000 Neuroscientists to (i) estimate the expected response rate per discipline, (ii) check the feasibility of a priming instrument that we chose not to include in the final survey, (iii) detect potential errors in the online version of the questionnaire before launching, and (iv) verify the internal consistency of two of the composite measures used in the survey (i.e. abstract score and meritocracy beliefs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Procedures</title><p>In each of the six online-surveys (one per discipline), we randomly assigned participants to one of the three manipulations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The following criteria guided our selection of universities for the manipulation of institutional affiliation: Candidates for the “high status” category all ranked high in the US National Research Council’s field-specific rankings of doctorate programs, and consistently ranked high (Top 20) in five subfield-specific university rankings (US News’ graduate school ranking, Shanghai ranking, Times Higher Education, Leiden Ranking and QS World University Ranking).</p><p>The universities assigned to the “lower status” category were selected based on the PP-top 10% citation indicator used in the Leiden University Ranking. For non-US universities, we limited our focus to less esteemed science nations in Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Institutions assigned to the “lower-status” category were matched (approximately) across countries with respect to PP-top 10% rank in the field-specific Leiden University ranking. We decided to restrict our focus to universities in the Leiden ranking to ensure that all fictive affiliations listed under the abstracts represented research active institutions in the biomedical and health sciences, the physical sciences and engineering, or the social sciences. By matching lower-status universities on their PP-top 10% rank, we ensured that the lower-status universities selected for each discipline had a comparable level of visibility in the scientific literature. Since a given university’s rank on the PP-top 10% indicator may not necessarily align with its general reputation, we also ensured that none of the lower-status universities were within the top-100 in the general Shanghai, Times Higher Education and QS World University rankings.</p><p>Given this approach, the specific institutions that fall into the “high status” and “lower status” categories vary by discipline. We carried out manual checks to ensure that all of the selected universities had active research environments within the relevant research disciplines. The universities assigned to each category (high-status [US], lower-status [US], lower-status [non-US]), and the average abstract scores per university, per discipline, are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

The outcome variables used in this analysis are specified above. We used dichotomous variables to estimate the effect of the manipulations on the outcomes in all regression models. We used the following measures to compute the moderation variables included in the two-way interaction analyses. Our measure of the respondents’ descriptive beliefs in the objectivity and fairness of peer-evaluation in their own research field (i.e. <italic>meritocratic beliefs</italic>) was adapted from ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). A sample item from this measure reads: “In my research field, scientists evaluate research primarily on its merit, i.e. according to accepted standards of the field”. We adapted the sample item from ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). The two other items were developed for this study. Ratings were based on a five-point scale ranging from (1) ‘Strongly agree’ to (5) ‘Strongly disagree’. Based on these items, we computed a composite measure that specifies each participant’s total-item score for these three items (i.e. meritocratic beliefs) (Cronbach’s <italic>α</italic> = 0.765). We used two pieces of information to measure the participants’ structural location in the science system (i.e. s<italic>tructural location</italic>): (i) information about scientific rank collected through the survey, and (ii) information about scientific institution obtained from Web of Science. Our measure of structural location is dichotomous. Associate professors, full professors, chairs and deans at top ranked international research institutions are scored as 1; all other participants are scored as 0. Here, we define top-ranked research institutions as institutions that have consistently ranked among the top 100 universities with the highest proportion of top 10% most cited papers within the past 10 years, according to the Leiden Ranking. We used article metadata from WOS to construct an author-specific performance profile for each respondent (i.e. <italic>research accomplishments</italic>). Specifically, we assigned researchers that were among the top-10% most cited in their fields (based on cumulative citation impact) to the “high status” group. All other participants were assigned to the “lower status” group. Our measure of <italic>self-perceived status</italic> was adapted from the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler and Stewart, 2007</xref>). We asked the respondents to locate themselves on a ladder with ten rungs representing the status hierarchy in their research area. Respondents that positioned themselves at the top of the ladder were scored as 9, and respondents positioning themselves at the bottom were scored as 0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Manipulation and robustness checks</title><p>As a manipulation check presented at the end of the survey, we asked the participants to answer a question about the author’s institutional affiliation/country affiliation in the abstract that they just read.

Responses were based on a five-point scale ranging from (1) ‘Extremely close’ to (5) ‘Not close at all’.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Weak evidence of institutional and country-related bias in experimental study of 4,000 scientists' research assessments&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as a Feature Article. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bjorn Hammarfelt (Reviewer #1).</p><p>In view of the reviewers comments, you are invited to prepare a revised submission that addresses their comments, please see below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a carefully designed study and a well-written paper about bias in peer review based on authors' institutional and country location. The survey design is novel and the results seem robust. The main results show weak evidence for the claim that researchers are biased towards high-status countries and institutions. The presentation is logical and the paper is well-structured, and the main arguments are clearly articulated. However, there are also a number of points that need to be addressed to make the article suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why choose the very top universities – like Harvard and MIT – rather than top universities that are less likely to be identified as the classic examples of “the best”. Is there a risk that participants of the survey would realize that this was part of the experiment, and thus acting accordingly in terms of “social desirability”. Perhaps a short discussion of these choices, maybe in the limitations section, would be useful.</p><p>2) Similarly, I wonder why there are no &quot;Elite (non-US)&quot; institutions (e.g. Oxford, ETH, etc.). Would not the inclusion of such universities make sense given that you include Elite (US) elite, and Non-elite (US) as well as Non-elite (non-US)? As it stands the selection might come off as a bit too focused on an American context, while the participants in the survey are from the entire world.</p><p>3) Please list somewhere in the article or supporting material the countries and institutions included in the survey that fall into each category and field.</p><p>4) The authors divide institutions into three categories. If I understood well, high US institutions are those in the top 20 of several discipline based rankings and in high positions in the US NRC doctorate programs ranking. Low status are those with low share of highly cited papers according to Leiden Ranking, and the same for non-US non-Elite from certain regions. While rankings may be a plausible way to go, I am not sure to what extent using the PP-top 10% score will help identifying low status institutions. In this case, the authors are looking for institutions with lower reputation (which not necessarily aligns with low citation performance), furthermore, the PP-top indicator is non-size independent, and therefore will work against larger institutions. Also, the Leiden Ranking ranks around 1000 institutions worldwide which fit certain publication threshold, probably including institutions that do not make it to the Leiden Ranking would give a better idea of low status.</p><p>5) I wonder to what extent the difference between the three categories is sufficiently detailed as to be able to show any differences. My concern is that you divide in so few groups that in the end differences may be hidden within those three large groups of institutions.</p><p>6) Effect sizes</p><p>The authors find that effect of manipulations on abstract quality ratings is likely not larger than the band -0.8 to 0.8 (16 pt scale) (Results). That does seem small, although in Cohen's d terms, d=-0.3 to 0.3 isn't all that small. Overall, we would expect effects of a light-weight manipulation in an online survey context to be tiny, but it's really hard to generalize such interventions to the field, where status effects may be large and subtle. So I'd like a little more language emphasizing low-ish (but informative) external validity here, and that the prior on light weight manipulation is very small effects.</p><p>7) You control for the reliability on the peers' judgment (how close is the abstract to their area of expertise). Why did you not do something similar with the institution as a means to control on the appropriateness of the category assignment of each institution? Could this be affecting also the results?</p><p>8) I understand that the six fields/disciplines were selected in order to cover a range of different disciplines, but a few paragraphs about why these particular fields were chosen would be useful.</p><p>9) Please discuss further the difference between choosing to read the full text and to include it in a conference. These are rather different evaluative situations: one may want to read a paper that one would not accept for a conference and vice versa. For example, a researcher might deem a paper as interesting, yet have doubts about the quality, or judge it as “worthy” of presentation while not being interested in reading it. You discuss that the disciplinary differences were higher when choosing to include in a conference or not (Discussion), and I would add that the competitive aspect of selecting for a conference makes this choice rather different than choosing to read a paper or not. This could be elaborated upon in the text and perhaps be something to study closer in future research.</p><p>10) In the framing of the paper the authors refer to biases on peer review but also discuss the Matthew Effect. While there is a relation between the halo effect that the authors are exploring and the Matthew Effect, the latter refers to the reception of publications (in terms of citations and prestige) while the former refers to biases in peer review. I think this difference is not sufficiently clear in the text, especially when reading the Appendix Text. I'd say that the fact that an halo effect may not be present in peer review would not necessarily reflect on a Matthew Effect or vice versa.</p><p>11) Situating this work in the existing literature.</p><p>I think the part of the literature review section that tries to distinguish this contribution from others isn't entirely fair. Here are the distinguishing points, followed by my comments on them:</p><p>a) Separating out location status vs. institution status</p><p>Comment: Why would this separating out really matter? Surely status of country is highly correlated with status of institution, and, presumably, the mechanism at work are inferences of quality from status. It seems fine to me to separate them out, but would be good to have an argument for why this is valuable to do</p><p>b) Previous RCTs in the peer review context may have been hampered by treatment leakage to the control group.</p><p>Comment: This surely happens ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01609 ). But it just means the reported effects in those RCTs are lower bounds, as those papers I believe readily admit. So I don't think this has been a major methodological problem in dire need of fixing.</p><p>So I don't think what this experiment is doing is super novel and fixes glaring oversights in the literature. BUT, that isn't a bad thing, in my view. Simply adding observations, particularly those that are well executed, adequately powered, and cross-disciplinary, is important enough. It's an important topic, so we should have more than just one or two RCTs in it. Crucially, we know there are file-drawer effects out there, likely in this space too, so this study is useful for making sure the published record is unbiased.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64561.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Why choose the very top universities – like Harvard and MIT – rather than top universities that are less likely to be identified as the classic examples of “the best”.

We decided to restrict the category of elite universities to the U.S. for the following reasons. (1) Our design allowed us to compare within-country variations in university status, and hereby tease apart the effect of country status and institution status. If we had included Oxford, Cambridge, ETH and University of Amsterdam, this would have required a more comprehensive set of lower-ranked universities in the UK, Switzerland and Netherlands as well, which in turn would have made our setup more complex. In other words, we wanted to keep the experiment simple. (2) 15 of the top 20 universities in the 2019 THE ranking, and 10 of the top 20 institutions in the 2019 US News ranking were located the U.S. Given this ratio, we found it justifiable to restrict our measure of institutional halo effects to elite universities in the U.S.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please list somewhere in the article or supporting material the countries and institutions included in the survey that fall into each category and field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this request. We have included information on countries and institutions in Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors divide institutions into three categories.

There is certainly a status differential between institutions included in the Leiden Ranking and those not included. However, there is also a concern that using institutions that are not internationally recognized, e.g. by being present on such a ranking, could create other sentiments, such as distrust. Our argument is that we measure a status differential because the institutions are “on the same scale”, since they can be found on these rankings, while if we had included those outside the rankings, we might end up measuring on two different scales. In this case, we decided to rely on the PP-top 10% indicator because it measures a university’s <italic>share</italic> of publications among the 10% most cited as opposed to the <italic>number</italic> of publications among the 10% most cited (i.e. P-top 10%). In the revised Materials and methods section, we reflect in more detail on these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I wonder to what extent the difference between the three categories is sufficiently detailed as to be able to show any differences. My concern is that you divide in so few groups that in the end differences may be hidden within those three large groups of institutions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. As an attempt to address this issue, we have computed the distribution of the average abstract ratings across universities, per discipline. As shown in Supplementary table 49 in Supplementary file 2, the within-group variations are quite modest. We chose to operate with the three categories to ensure reasonable statistical power in the analysis. As shown in Supplementary table 49 in Supplementary file 2 the Ns for individual universities are too small for any meaningful statistical comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Effect sizes</p><p>The authors find that effect of manipulations on abstract quality ratings is likely not larger than the band -0.8 to 0.8 (16 pt scale) (Results).

As we state in the Materials and methods section, “We carried out manual checks to ensure that all of the selected universities had active research environments within the relevant research disciplines.” Moreover, our selection of high-status institutions were all ranked highly in the U.S. National Research Council’s discipline-specific rankings of doctorate programs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) I understand that the six fields/disciplines were selected in order to cover a range of different disciplines, but a few paragraphs about why these particular fields were chosen would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point.

We designed the two dichotomous outcome items to capture additional types of evaluative situations. While the two dichotomous outcomes may not be comparable, we find both of them suitable for the purposes of our experiment.
