recruiting histone methylases and deacetylases. Using genome-wide nucleosome mapping, we show that CTD S2 phosphorylation controls nucleosome dynamics in the promoter of a subset of 324 genes, including the regulators of cell differentiation <italic>ste11</italic> and metabolic adaptation <italic>inv1</italic>. Mechanistic studies on these genes indicate that during gene activation a local increase of phospho-S2 CTD nearby the promoter impairs the phospho-S5 CTD-dependent recruitment of Set1 and the subsequent recruitment of specific HDACs, which leads to nucleosome depletion and efficient transcription. The early increase of phospho-S2 results from the phosphorylation of the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 by MAP kinase in response to cellular signalling. The artificial tethering of the Lsk1 kinase at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter is sufficient to activate transcription. Therefore, signalling through the CTD code regulates promoter nucleosomes dynamics.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09008.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09008.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09008.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The process of activating genes—known as gene expression—involves a number of steps. During the first step, the gene's DNA is copied or ‘transcribed’ to produce a molecule of messenger RNA. However, most of the DNA in a cell is wrapped around proteins called histones to make structures known as nucleosomes, and the DNA has to be unpacked to allow the enzymes that make messenger RNA to access it.</p><p>Cells regulate how the DNA is packed by attaching chemical groups to the histone proteins. Adding acetyl groups to histones usually causes the nucleosomes to unwrap and creates loosely packed DNA that helps with gene expression. On the other hand, the addition of methyl groups has the opposite effect.</p><p>RNA polymerase II is the enzyme that carries out transcription of messenger RNAs in all eukaryotic cells—that is, the cells of organisms like plants, animals, and fungi. Like all enzymes, RNA polymerase II is made of smaller building blocks called amino acids. One end of the RNA polymerase II enzyme, called the C-terminal domain (or CTD), contains a unique sequence of amino acids that serves as a scaffold to recruit other proteins involved in transcription and histone modifications. Different amino acids in this region of RNA polymerase II can be modified by the addition of phosphate groups. The pattern of these modifications is often thought of as a code and can influence which other proteins get recruited.</p><p>It remains poorly understood how RNA polymerase II regulates nucleosomes to allow transcription to occur. Materne, Anandhakumar et al. have now addressed this issue by engineering mutant yeast cells in which phosphate groups cannot be added to specific amino acids in the RNA polymerase II enzyme. Most genes were expressed as normal in these yeast cells, but a few hundred genes were not expressed.</p><p>Materne, Anandhakumar et al. then used a technique called MNase-Seq to map the position of nucleosomes across the genome and found that there were more nucleosomes near to start of these down-regulated genes. Further experiments showed that the addition of phosphate groups onto the RNA polymerase II is required to deplete the nucleosomes at the start of a gene called <italic>ste11</italic>, which allows transcription to occur.</p><p>Materne, Anandhakumar et al. also found that artificially tethering the enzyme that adds phosphate groups to the C-terminal domain to the start of the <italic>ste11</italic> gene was sufficient to oust nucleosomes and activate transcription by RNA polymerase II.</p><p>Future work will address if this newly discovered mechanism is implicated in the activation of specific patterns of gene expression during the development of more complex organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09008.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09008.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>Set1</kwd><kwd>MAP kinase</kwd><kwd>HDAC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2011-28804 / CSD2007-00015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antequera</surname><given-names>Francisco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRFC 2.4510.10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermand</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CR 1.5.013.09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermand</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MIS F.4523.11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermand</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II controls nucleosomes dynamics at specific promoters to regulate transcription.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The integration of various aspects of the transcription of DNA into mature mRNA relies on combinatorial phosphorylations of the flexible scaffold structure formed by the RNA polymerase II (PolII) subunit Rpb1 C-terminal domain (CTD), which is comprised of repeats of the consensus heptad YSPTSPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phatnani and Greenleaf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsin and Manley, 2012</xref>). Genes transcribed by the PolII show a stereotypical pattern of CTD phosphorylation with phospho-S5 (S5P) peaking near the transcription start site (TSS) and phospho-S2 (S2P) accumulating towards the 3′-end of the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buratowski, 2009</xref>). Despite discrepancies, genome-wide analyses of CTD phosphorylation support that the CTD cycle is uniform across genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mayer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tietjen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bataille et al., 2012</xref>), and a broad body of evidence supports the seminal role of CTD S5P and S2P in transcriptional regulation and chromatin metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buratowski, 2009</xref>). However, recent works showed that contrary to S5P, S2P is dispensable in both fission yeast and budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cassart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devos et al., 2015</xref>) and only affects the steady-state level of a subset of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coudreuse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saberianfar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sukegawa et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, a disconnect exists between the apparent uniform occupancy of the phosphorylated PolII and the gene-specific defects resulting from the disappearance of a phosphorylation; a similar case occurring with chromatin regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drogat and Hermand, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egloff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of histone H3K4 and K36 methylation mirrors CTD phosphorylation due to the direct recruitment of the H3 methyltransferases Set1-COMPASS (for H3K4) and Set2 (for H3K36) by the S5P and S2P of PolII, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>). Set1 is the only H3K4 methyltransferase in yeast, but it produces monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation states. In budding yeast, H3K4me3 is strongest near the TSS, while H3K4me2 is highest just downstream, and H3K4me1 is dispersed throughout the length of the transcribed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pokholok et al., 2005</xref>). However, in vertebrates, the majority of H3K4me2 colocalizes with H3K4me3 in discrete regions nearby the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</xref>). Set2 targets H3K36me2 and me3 that are both highest near the 3′-end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kizer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Despite a strong positive correlation between the H3K4 and K36 methylations and active PolII occupancy, their primarily function appears to be to repress histone acetylation and transcription because both serve as a binding platform for recruitment and the activation of histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) including Set3 complex (SET3C) and Rpd3C(S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buratowski and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govind et al., 2010</xref>). This paradox may only be apparent because HDACs counteract unregulated initiation that could profit from the elevated nucleosome dynamics associated with acetylation during active transcription.</p><p>Known methyl-lysine-binding domains include the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger and the chromodomain. Available data support that these domains are responsible for the H3 methylation-dependent recruitment of HDACs. For example, the chromodomain protein Eaf3 is a subunit of Rpd3C(S) deacetylase and binds H3K36me (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carrozza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keogh et al., 2005</xref>). Complementarily, the PHD finger protein Set3 is part of the SET3C complex and binds H3K4me2 to mediate deacetylation of histones in the 5′ regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the PHD domain of the HDAC-associated ING2 protein mediates its binding to the dimethylated and trimethylated H3K4 at the promoters of proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pena et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>How the balance between acetylation and deacetylation at promoters is regulated during transcription is poorly understood, and a role of the phosphorylated CTD in regulating that process is unknown. Here, we show that S2P affects promoter nucleosome occupancy at a subset of genomic loci. Mechanistic studies reveal that upon gene activation, the Sty1 MAP kinase directly phosphorylates the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1, which results in increased S2P nearby the promoter. We also show that the doubly phosphorylated S2P-S5P CTD has lower affinity for Set1 compared to the S5P CTD. Therefore, the peak of S2P at the promoter counteracts H3K4 methylation and the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Our results indicate that cellular signalling mediated by the PolII CTD directly controls promoter nucleosome dynamics and gene transcription of a subset of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CTD S2P regulates promoter nucleosome dynamics at a subset of genes</title><p>Authentic full-length <italic>rpb1 CTD S2A</italic> (<italic>S2A</italic>) mutants in fission yeast and budding yeast are viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coudreuse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwer and Shuman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cassart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drogat and Hermand, 2012</xref>) and are barely affected for steady-state transcription or termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lenstra et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that the function of S2P in the coupling between transcription and maturation is either not essential or ensured by redundant mechanisms. Yet, the transcription of a subset of genes is strongly defective in the fission yeast <italic>S2A</italic> mutant as typically shown for <italic>ste11</italic> that encodes the master regulator of sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otsubo and Yamamoto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anandhakumar et al., 2013</xref>), which results in sterility. In order to understand the molecular basis of this specific sensitivity of S2P, we performed a genome-wide screen for genetic interactions using synthetic genetic arrays (SGAs) with both the S2 kinase <italic>lsk1</italic> (<italic>cdk12</italic> that encodes the S2 kinase) deletion and the <italic>S2A</italic> mutant. Although both screens highlighted a genetic link between S2P and RNA maturation, about a third of the shared interactions found fell in chromatin remodelling and modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This genetic connection between S2P and chromatin biology led us to perform a genome-wide mapping of nucleosome position and occupancy by MNase-Seq. We used the DANPOS bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the data, which defines three categories of nucleosome dynamics: position shift, fuzziness change, and occupancy change. These analyses revealed that 3.8% of the nucleosomes were dynamics in the S2A mutant compared to the wt (based on a false discovery rate &lt;0.005), carrying mostly occupancy changes and position shifts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Statistical analyses revealed that these dynamic nucleosomes are enriched in the promoter region encompassing −350 bp to +50 bp flanking the TSS (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16, odds ratio = 2.82), and especially the −1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). A meta-gene analysis of the nucleosome occupancy signal for all protein-coding genes revealed higher occupancy around the TSS in the S2A mutant, and an 11 bp shift of the average −1 nucleosome toward the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel). When selecting the 10% protein-coding genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the absence of S2P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel), the shift of the average −1 nucleosome rose to 44 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left panel). In contrast, the 10% protein genes with the lower decrease in promoter NDR did not show a similar effect. In addition, the genes showing promoter dynamic nucleosomes in the absence of S2P tended to have larger NDRs and 5′-UTR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), two features reminiscent of the genes that we have previously characterized as showing a peak of S2P nearby the promoter during transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coudreuse et al., 2010</xref>), including <italic>ste11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we found that the 10% genes whose promoter NDR shrinks the most in the S2A mutant are highly enriched in this list of genes showing early S2P (Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.0013, odds ratio = 2.6) and in genes downregulated more than twofold in the S2A mutant (Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.0057, odds ratio = 1.4).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09008.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The RNA polymerase II S2P affects nucleosome dynamic at the promoter of a subset of genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left panel: the percentage of dynamic nucleosomes aligned relative to the transcription start site (TSS) in the fission yeast genome.

The deletion of <italic>hos2</italic> led to a marked derepression of <italic>ste11</italic>, while other single mutants somehow affected <italic>ste11</italic> but never to the extend of the loss of <italic>hos2</italic>. The Hos2 enzyme is part of the conserved SET3C deacetylase complex that is recruited in budding yeast by S5P either directly or through the methylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) by Set1, which itself depends on the S5P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govind et al., 2010</xref>). ChIP experiments revealed that Hos2 peaks at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter and that its recruitment was strongly dependent upon the S5-phosphorylated CTD as its occupancy was decreased in a CTD S5A mutant, which is kept viable by fusing the human capping enzyme Mce1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwer and Shuman, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

In the subset of genes we have analyzed, we propose that during transcriptional induction, the local increase of S2P nearby the promoter prevents the efficient association of Set1 with the S5P CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, previous work revealed a spread of the Set1-dependent H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks 3′ into the bodies of genes in the absence of Ctk1, the CTD S2 kinase in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wood et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>). These data were interpreted to mean that S2P phosphorylation acts as a barrier to prevent the CTD S5P-dependent association of Set1, which explain the restricted pattern of H3K4 dimethylation and trimethylation classically observed. We propose that the temporary, MAP kinase dependent, targeting of S2P at the promoter of target genes acts similarly. In this context, it was also shown that the presence of S2P upstream of S5P within a peptide abolishes the recognition by an anti-S5P antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hintermair et al., 2012</xref>), again suggesting that S2P somehow interferes with the recognition of the neighbour S5P, which we observe using an NLS-GST-CTD fusion expressed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09008.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of the control of promoter nucleosome dynamics by CTD S2 phosphorylation.</title><p>When gene expression is low in non-induced conditions, the phosphorylation of the CTD on S5 recruits the Set1 methylase and the SET3C or the RPD3L HDAC complexes.

Despite the fact that the SET3C and the Rpd3C(L) complexes have very different subunits composition, they are both responding to the signalling through CTD S2P because they harbour the histone methyl-lysine-binding domain proteins Set3 and Png2, respectively. A remaining question is why different HDAC complexes are required in the case of <italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>inv1</italic>. The Rpd3C(L) has been proposed to regulate transcriptional burst frequency, while the SET3C complex is thought to modulate the burst size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hnisz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinberger et al., 2012</xref>), so the involvement of different HDAC complexes is likely related to gene-specific induction dynamics.</p><p>In budding yeast, the current model of H3K4 methylation-dependent histone deacetylation proposes that Set1, recruited by the CTD S5P, deposits the H3K4me2 mark, which in turn recruits the SET3C via the Set3 PHD finger, localizing the Hos2 and Hst1 HDAC subunits of SET3C in 5′ transcribed regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buratowski and Kim, 2010</xref>). It was also reported that SET3C is directly recruited by the CTD S5P, whereas it is the interaction with methylated H3 that is required for the deacetylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govind et al., 2010</xref>). Whatever the exact mechanism, the promoter occupancy of the HDACs complexes requires S5P. Considering the evolutionary conservation of all the proteins implicated in this model, we envision that the process may be operating at some target genes in other eukaryotes. In support to this view, the budding yeast S2 kinase, Ctk1, is also phosphorylated within the N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</xref>). The reported defect of the <italic>ctk1</italic> mutant for gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Greenleaf, 1991</xref>) led us to test the requirement of Ctk1 for the increased acetylation of promoter histones during the induction of the master regulator of meiosis, <italic>IME</italic><italic>1,</italic> in diploid budding yeast cells. The absence of <italic>ctk1</italic> abrogated the burst of promoter histones acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and resulted in low expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Remarkably, the defect observed in the absence of CTD S2P was suppressed by the deletion of the Set3 subunit of the SET3C HDAC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), in agreement with the data obtained in fission yeast. These data, together with the recent discovery of a gene-specific role of Cdk12 in the control of gene expression in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blazek et al., 2011</xref>), support the conservation of the molecular mechanism we report here, which opens further dissection in higher eukaryotes. Interestingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the UpSet protein, an ortholog of yeast Set3, also recruits Rpd3-containing HDACs to developmental genes and its PHD domain was proposed to recognize methylation on H3K4, establishing a dependency to Set1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2013</xref>). The most common phenotype associated with the deletion of UpSet occurs during gametogenesis, similarly to yeast.</p><p>Our work also shows that S2 phosphorylation within the CTD responds to cellular signalling. Upon activation, the Sty1 MAP kinase phosphorylates the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 on multiple sites spread over the long N-terminal extension of the kinase. We show that the phosphorylation of Lsk1 is required for the 5′ peak of CTD S2P during the induction of the <italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>inv1</italic> genes, while it does not appear to be required for the kinase activity itself. This dependency on MAP kinase phosphorylation likely explains why only a subset of promoters is regulated in this manner. Considering that MAP kinases, including Sty1, are recruited to their target genes, they are likely to confer this specificity. Remarkably, the artificial tethering of the S2 kinase Lsk1 at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter is sufficient to induce <italic>ste11</italic> expression, independently of nitrogen starvation and MAP kinase phosphorylation. Further studies are required to understand how the phosphorylation of the conserved N-terminal extension of the S2 kinase modulates its recruitment. Previous work revealed that MAPK signalling exerts a multilayered control on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>).

Nucleosome occupancy was then calculated as the quantile-normalized count of adjusted reads covering each base pair in the genome. After this processing, DANPOS calculates the differential signal at single nucleotide position based on a Poisson test. Dynamic nucleosomes are then identified by peak calling on these signals. TSS and TTS-associated NDR length were quantified as the length of the longest DNA segment whose proximal border is located closer than 65 bp from the TSS (or TES) with nucleosome occupancy levels lower than an arbitrary threshold (mean(occupancy<sub>genome</sub>) − standard_deviation(occupancy<sub>genome</sub>)) at any point.</p><p>The processed data can be visualized on the web browser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nucleosome.usal.es/fgb2/gbrowse/S2A/">http://nucleosome.usal.es/fgb2/gbrowse/S2A/</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the GEMO laboratory for discussions and the ADRE team for excellent support.

The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Promoter nucleosome dynamics regulated by signaling through the CTD code” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work cannot be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although we recognize the potential novelty of the work describing a function of Ser-2 phosphorylation at the promoter, we believe that the phenomenon is likely not general, but most importantly in the absence of mechanism it only remains as an observation.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors identified chromatin remodellers and chromatin modifiers in a synthetic screen analyzing mutants of Pol II CTD serine 2 (S2A) and the CTD S2 kinase lsk in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Further analysis revealed that nucleosome dynamics and occupancy at promoters was altered in CTD S2A mutants in a subset of genes, including the genes <italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>inv1</italic>. Molecular and genetic experiments identified altered histone acetylation as a possible reason for increased histone occupancy at promoters.</p><p>Histone deacetylation at promoters is under the control of H3K4 methylation and the H3K4 methylation dependent recruitment of HDACs SET3C and RPD3 to promoters. The authors show that CTD S2 phosphorylation can block the recruitment of HDACs to promoters and thereby contribute to gene activation. Further, phosphorylation of kinase Lsk and its recruitment to promoters is growth regulated and under the control of MAP kinases. Mutation of MAP kinase specific phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain of Lsk prevents its recruitment to promoters, phosphorylation of CTD S2, and thereby the dissociation of HDACs from promoters. In line with these observations the authors can activate <italic>ste11</italic> expression after artificial tethering of LSK 1 at the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter. While the association of HDACs with promoters is CTD S5-P dependent the authors suggest that the combined phosphorylation of S5 and S2 can abolish this association, leading to hyperacetylation of chromatin and gene activation.</p><p>The assumption the CTD S2-P dependent mechanism of gene activation described here for <italic>S. pombe</italic> could be a more general mechanism is supported by supplementary data in paper. Inactivation of Ctk1, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CTD S2 kinase, abrogates promoter histone acetylation and results in low gene expression.</p><p>All together this is a very detailed and carefully performed analysis and all conclusions are supported by data.</p><p>How CTD S2-P marks mechanistically can abrogate the association of HDACs with promoters remains open but this question is beyond this paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Hermand and coworkers investigates a functional link between CTD phosphorylation at serine-2 and histone dynamics in the yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>.

A synthetic lethal screen found many interactions between the S2A mutant or Lsk1/Cdk12 (S2 kinase) and chromatin-related factors. Nucleosome mapping revealed a subset of genes with altered nucleosome positions near promoters in these mutants. The rest of the paper focuses on one of these genes (<italic>ste11</italic>), with a few other experiments done on the <italic>inv1</italic> gene. The story then gets a little confusing. The model proposed is that these promoters are repressed by H3K4 methylation recruiting either SET3C or Rpd3L HDACs. To activate the genes, the MAPK Sty1 phosphorylates Lsk1, which in turn phosphorylates S2 near the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter to block H3K4 methylation and subsequent HDAC recruitment. It's a complicated model, and the many experiments needed to look at each of these steps makes the paper difficult to follow.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) A big gap in the paper is understanding why only a small number of promoters are affected, since CTD phosphorylation and H3K4 methylation are seen at all active genes.

The core of our conclusion is twofold:</p><p>a) The S2 kinase Lsk1 (Cdk12) is regulated by MAP kinase dependent phosphorylation, which influences its chromatin distribution;</p><p>b) CTD S2P directly affects the occupancy of promoter nucleosomes, which leads to transcription activation.</p><p>There are quite some descriptive experiments in the paper that are necessary to give a detailed picture of the involvement of CTD S2P in gene activation. But in addition, we also provide experiments where we have interfered with the experimental system in various ways to demonstrate the causality between promoter CTD S2P and the activation of transcription. For example, our first conclusion is tested by mutating the phosphorylation sites of Lsk1 to a phosphomimmick or non phosphorylatable residues, which consistently uncouples the regulation of the S2 kinase from the MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Beside several genetic evidences that CTD S2P is targeted to the promoters of some genes (<italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>inv1</italic>), we also engineered a chimeric S2 kinase that we can artificially tether to the <italic>ste11</italic> promoter, which results in transcriptional activation and bypasses the MAP kinase regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Contrary to what referee 2 states, these experiments clearly discriminate between a cause and an effect.</p><p><italic>Many results and conclusions of this study have multiple interpretation issues</italic>.</p><p><italic>First, the authors present the combined results from two genome-wide SGAs using a CTD-S2 kinase deletion and an</italic> rpb1 CTD-S2A <italic>mutant allele.

I should add that we have a second manuscript in preparation identifying the RSC complex as the ultimate target of the pathway we describe.

We report a list of 324 genes that show dynamic changes at the -1 nucleosome in the <italic>rpb1 CTD S2A</italic> mutant. This list is highly enriched in genes we have previously identified as having an early CTD S2P profile (Coudreuse et al., Curr. Biol. 2010), and in genes downregulated in the <italic>CTD S2A</italic> mutant (Coudreuse et al., Curr. Biol. 2010, Schwer et al., PNAS 2012). These data are presented in the subsection headed “CTD S2P regulates promoter nucleosome dynamics at a subset of genes” of the manuscript. They establish that the phenomena we describe occur at a significant number of promoters. We propose that the gene specificity is established by MAP kinase signaling, which is essential to recruit the CTD S2 kinase nearby the promoters of the <italic>ste11</italic> and <italic>inv1</italic> genes that we have analysed in more details. In addition, the number of gene affected may be underestimated by the fact that the large-scale analyses were performed in a single growth condition. Regarding the mechanism, we provide a completely new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) where the association between the CTD and the H3K4 methylase Set1 is shown in vivo to require CTD S5 phosphorylation in the absence of CTD S2 phosphorylation. These new data support our model where a peak of CTD S2P displaces the Set1 methylase, which relieves its repressing effect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
