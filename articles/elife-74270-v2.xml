kinesin-1. Kinesin-1 has numerous cellular cargos which must be delivered to unique neuronal compartments. The process by which this motor selectively transports and delivers cargo to regulate neuronal morphogenesis is poorly understood, although the cargo-binding kinesin light chain (KLC) subunits contribute to specificity. Our work implicates one such subunit, KLC4, as an essential regulator of axon branching and arborization pattern of sensory neurons during development. Using live imaging approaches in <italic>klc4</italic> mutant zebrafish, we show that KLC4 is required for stabilization of nascent axon branches, proper microtubule (MT) dynamics, and endosomal transport. Furthermore, KLC4 is required for proper tiling of peripheral axon arbors: in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants, peripheral axons showed abnormal fasciculation, a behavior characteristic of central axons. This result suggests that KLC4 patterns axonal compartments and helps establish molecular differences between central and peripheral axons. Finally, we find that <italic>klc4</italic> mutant larva are hypersensitive to touch and adults show anxiety-like behavior in a novel tank test, implicating <italic>klc4</italic> as a new gene involved in stress response circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon transport</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>axon branching</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>motor protein</kwd><kwd>neural development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS086934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halloran</surname><given-names>Mary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 NS116326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halloran</surname><given-names>Mary C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS098689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haynes</surname><given-names>Elizabeth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Newly identified roles for the kinesin-1 light chain subunit KLC4 in patterning developing axon arbors, regulating microtubule dynamics and influencing behavior of larval and adult zebrafish.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proper development of complex neuronal morphology and assembly of neural circuits requires tight regulation of axon growth and branching. Precise control over axon branch formation is essential not only for development but also for plasticity and regeneration after injury. Branching allows one neuron to innervate numerous targets, and in many cases, neurons extend multiple axons or branches that navigate to distinct targets. Many molecular signaling pathways can influence branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>), although the mechanisms that control branch formation are still not fully understood. Highly arborized vertebrate sensory neurons, including Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons, serve as an ideal model to study mechanisms of branching and neuronal morphogenesis. Sensory neurons must extend separate axon branches to targets in the periphery and to the CNS to relay sensory information. Peripheral and central axons have different capacity for branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>), and behave differently when contacting other axons—central axons fasciculate with one another while peripheral axons show contact repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Halloran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sagasti et al., 2005</xref>). Contact repulsion of peripheral axons is necessary for establishment of proper axon arbor patterns that ‘tile’ with arbors from other neurons to effectively innervate the sensory field. Despite the importance of establishing axons with distinct character and branching patterns, the mechanisms regulating molecular compartmentalization of separate axons from one neuron are poorly understood.</p><p>Molecular compartmentalization of neurons depends on precisely controlled transport of vesicle and organelle cargos to specific cell locations. Cargos are transported by motor proteins that move in a directional manner along MT tracks. Kinesin-1, the founding member of the kinesin superfamily of motor proteins, is a heterotetramer composed of homodimers of kinesin heavy chains (KHCs), which contain the MT binding and ATPase motor domains, and of kinesin light chains (KLCs), which interact with cargos. Kinesin-1 can mediate long-distance, anterograde transport of multiple cargos including mitochondria, synaptic vesicle precursors, endosomes, lysosomes, and RNA granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morfini et al., 2016</xref>). Kinesin-1 also has roles in organizing MT tracks. The forces it exerts can physically influence the MT lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shima et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Triclin et al., 2021</xref>). It can also cross-link MTs by combined interactions of the motor domain and a second MT binding site in the KHC tail, and slide MTs along one another, thereby influencing cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lu and Gelfand, 2017</xref>). While it is clear that kinesin-1 is essential for proper development of the nervous system, the mechanisms by which it achieves cell-context specificity of its multiple functions and how its cargo-binding and MT-organizing functions are regulated have yet to be fully defined.</p><p>The specific activities of kinesin-1 in a given context are likely governed in part by KLCs. KLCs are known to mediate binding between the kinesin motor and cellular cargos, and also to activate the motor by releasing KHC autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morfini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Woźniak and Allan, 2006</xref>). Vertebrates have four <italic>klc</italic> genes (<italic>klc1-4</italic>), with <italic>klc1, 2</italic> and <italic>4</italic> expressed in the nervous system, but our knowledge of the different roles played by individual KLCs in neurons remains very limited. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, mutants for the single <italic>klc</italic> gene are lethal in larval stages and have defects in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gindhart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mochizuki et al., 2011</xref>), indicating essential neural functions for KLC. Growing evidence supports the idea that molecular functions are divided among vertebrate KLCs and that each has unique roles. Structural and biochemical studies show that KLC1 and KLC2 have differing affinities for cargo adaptor proteins such as JIP1 and JIP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cockburn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pernigo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Research to date has begun to define distinct neurophysiological functions of KLC1 and KLC2. Studies of mouse <italic>klc1</italic> mutants revealed functions for KLC1 in regulating motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rahman et al., 1999</xref>), transport of amyloid precursor protein into axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamal et al., 2000</xref>), phagosome transport in retinal pigment epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), and axon guidance and cannabinoid recepter transport during neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saez et al., 2020</xref>). Mouse <italic>klc2</italic> mutants have hearing loss, cochlear hair cell loss and mislocalized mitochondria in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2021</xref>). A study using a peptide inhibitor of KLC2 phosphorylation showed that KLC2 regulates synaptic plasticity, AMPAR trafficking and mood associated behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in human <italic>klc2</italic> can cause SPOAN syndrome, which is characterized by progressive spastic paraplegia, optic atrophy and neuropathy with onset in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazvand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melo et al., 2015</xref>). On the whole, previous work supports the idea that individual KLCs have unique, indispensable functions, but has only begun to reveal the specific cellular functions for individual KLCs.</p><p>In contrast to KLC1 and KLC2, KLC4 has been the subject of few studies. Mutation of <italic>KLC4</italic> in humans causes a type of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) that manifests in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayrakli et al., 2015</xref>), indicating essential developmental functions. To date, the only cellular function shown for KLC4 is that it supports mitochondrial function and confers resistance to radiation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek et al., 2018</xref>). A clear cellular function for KLC4 in neurons and therefore insight into the <italic>KLC4</italic> mutation-related pathology is lacking.</p><p>In this study, we reveal critical functions for KLC4 in sensory axon branching and axon arbor patterning during development, and in regulation of animal behavior. Using live imaging in <italic>klc4</italic> mutant zebrafish, we found that KLC4 is required for stabilization of nascent peripheral sensory axon branches. The branching defects do not reflect a general growth defect, as axons grew faster in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants and did not show signs of early degeneration. Live imaging also showed that <italic>klc4</italic> mutant peripheral axons have defects in mutual repulsion and instead often fasciculate with one another, a behavior characteristic of central axons, suggesting KLC4 may contribute to the molecular compartmentalization that defines differential behavior of these axons. Using high-speed, in vivo imaging of endosomal vesicle transport and MT dynamics, we showed that <italic>klc4</italic> mutant axons have altered vesicle transport and MT dynamics. Nascent branches in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants have less acetylated tubulin, suggesting less stable MTs. Finally, we investigated the ramifications of KLC4 loss on larval and adult behavior. Larval <italic>klc4</italic> mutant zebrafish show hyperactivity in response to touch, implying heightened sensitivity. Adult <italic>klc4</italic> mutants exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior, indicating essential roles for KLC4 in neural circuit formation and/or function in adults.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>klc4</italic> is expressed during early development</title><p><italic>klc</italic> genes encode proteins with conserved functional domains including the heptad repeat region that mediates binding to KHC, six cargo-binding tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a C-terminal lipid-binding amphipathic helix, and an LFP motif that mediates KLC auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antón et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cockburn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morfini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pernigo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). As a first step toward understanding developmental functions of KLC4, we investigated the expression of zebrafish <italic>klc4</italic> at different stages of development. Zebrafish <italic>klc4</italic> has two alternative splice isoforms, one long and one short, both of which are also present in other vertebrates including mice and humans. In zebrafish, the long <italic>klc4</italic> transcript encodes a full length protein of 620 amino acids while the short isoform is predicted to encode a 185 amino acid protein, ending just before the LFP motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether both transcripts are expressed during development, we performed non-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR with transcript-specific primers on RNA extracted from embryos during early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that both isoforms are expressed throughout early development, with expression detectable at 2 hours post fertilization (hpf) and continuing through the initial period of neuronal axon outgrowth, pathfinding and branching, between 16 and 28 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next used in situ hybridization to determine the spatial expression pattern of <italic>klc4</italic> during development, using a riboprobe that binds both transcripts. At 24 hpf, <italic>klc4</italic> is expressed in clusters of neurons in the telencephalon, epiphysis, diencephalon, ventral midbrain and hindbrain, and in the trigeminal and the posterior lateral line (pLL) ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In the spinal cord, <italic>klc4</italic> is strongly expressed in the Rohon-Beard sensory neurons, and at lower levels in other neuron populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). At 48 hpf, <italic>klc4</italic> continues to be expressed broadly in the nervous system with high expression levels in the trigeminal ganglia, pLL ganglia, and RB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G and H</xref>). A riboprobe that only binds the long isoform shows a similar expression pattern to the probe that recognizes both isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I, J and K</xref>), indicating the full-length <italic>klc4</italic> mRNA is present in developing neurons. The early expression of <italic>klc4</italic> in diverse neural populations in both the central and peripheral nervous system suggests it has functions in neural development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>klc4</italic> mRNA is expressed in developing zebrafish embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the highly conserved domains of KLC4.

We analyzed the growth direction of actively extending axons by measuring the orientation angle of the distal-most axon shaft at each time point over 2–4 hr movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and displaying the distribution of growth angles as rose plots. We found <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant axons had a preference for posterior growth paths, while wild-type axons had no anterior-posterior bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). We then measured the angles between newly bifurcating sister branches. Prior to bifurcation, axons commonly grow in a posterior direction in both wild type and mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). As growth cones bifurcate in wild-type embryos, the sister branches grow away from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D’ and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>), resulting in an average branch angle of 96.5 degrees 15 min after branch formation, and 91.7 degrees 75 min after branch formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>). This behavior results in axon arbors with an even distribution of axon orientation angles in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants, the newly formed branches did not separate as much, resulting in a shallower average angle of 79.7 degrees between sister branches 15 min after branch formation, and narrowing to 60.2 degrees after 75 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>). In fact, branches in <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants at times failed to repel at all, instead appearing to collapse onto one another (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Moreover, the posterior growth bias detected by automated orientation analysis in <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) is likely the result of branch separation failure. Because axons initially tend toward posterior growth, reduced branch separation or collapse of anteriorly directed branches onto the more posterior axon shaft leads to axon arbors with an overall increase in posterior orientation angles.

In wild-type embryos, they rarely cross the midline of the spinal cord.

Adult zebrafish were isolated in individual 1 L tanks, then 50 larval zebrafish were added to each tank. The fish were allowed to feed on the larvae for one hour, then removed from the tank to allow counting of the remaining larvae. Wild type fish were effective feeders, eating on average 90% of available zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In comparison, <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants ate on average only 60% of the larvae available. We noted that the mutant fish that performed the worst in the feeding assay underwent bouts of freezing behavior during the assay. Upon introduction of the larvae to the tank, the fish ceased movement for extended periods.</p><p>Freezing behavior in zebrafish in response to a novel environment has been previously described and interpreted as increased anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maximino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khan et al., 2017</xref>). To test whether <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant fish show anxiety-like behavior, we used a novel tank diving test, which is similar in principle to the open field test used in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maximino et al., 2010</xref>). In this test, fish are introduced to an unfamiliar tank and allowed to explore. Zebrafish typically prefer to stay in the lower zone of the tank initially, and once they become acclimated, they begin to explore the upper regions of the tank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). We introduced adult animals (7 months old) to a novel tank and filmed their behavior for 3 min. Analysis revealed that 90.9% of wild type fish explored the upper zone of the tank during the 3-min window, compared to only 18.8% of the <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>). Of the animals that did explore the upper zone, both wild type and <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant animals took an average of 100 s before their first cross into the upper zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). Wild type animals spent an average of 14 s in the upper region of the tank, compared to just 3.26 s for <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11G</xref>). Notably, freezing behavior, defined for this experiment as cessation of all movement except for gills for at least 3 s, was observed in an average of 43% of mutant fish, and only 3% of wild type fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11H</xref>). 15.4% of <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant fish, but no wild type animals, froze for the full 3-min duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11I</xref>).</p><p>Studies in both zebrafish and rodents have shown that repeated exposure to the unfamiliar environment leads to habituation of the anxiety behavior. In zebrafish, habituation manifests as increased exploration of the upper zone and reduced freezing behavior. Fish that do not habituate to the novel environment or that worsen over multiple exposures are thought to demonstrate a depression-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>). Behaviors driven by increased anxiety are expected to lessen with repeat exposures. We tested the ability of <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants to habituate to a novel environment after multiple exposures. In addition, because KLC4 and other kinesin-1 subunits have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, we sought to determine whether the anxiety-like behavior worsened with age. We challenged 1.25–1.5 year old <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants and their wild type cousins by repeated exposure to a novel tank for 10 min, twice a week for 3 weeks in succession. The first exposure allowed us to test the effects of age.

Aged wild-type animals worsened in performance, with 13.3% (3 out of 23) undergoing a bout of freezing behavior during first exposure. These numbers remained similar when the entire 10 min was analyzed (wt = 16.7%, mut = 29.2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In this study, we used automated analysis of sensory axon arbors and live, in vivo imaging of axon behavior and intracellular MT dynamics to define new roles for KLC4 in shaping neuronal morphology. We found that KLC4 is required for sensory axon branching and for repulsion between peripheral axons, behaviors which are important for proper innervation and tiling of the sensory field. <italic>Klc4</italic> mutant neurons do not have a general growth defect, in that their axons grow faster than wild type axons. In addition, <italic>klc4</italic> mutants are adult viable and show no signs of early neurodegeneration. These results suggest that KLC4 has a specific function in patterning developing neurons rather than simply being required for general neuronal health. Our finding that the mutant larvae are hypersensitive to touch stimuli suggests that the altered sensory arborization pattern affects sensory circuits. At least two axon defects could contribute to the increased response. Fasciculation of peripheral axons from neighboring neurons might lead to an increase in the number of neurons activated by a localized touch stimulus. Also, the aberrant midline crossing of axons in mutants could cause inappropriate activation of contralateral neurons. Behavioral analysis also showed that <italic>klc4</italic> mutant adults exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior, indicating roles for KLC4 in adult circuit function and identifying KLC4 as a novel gene associated with anxiety behavior. This work sheds light on potential mechanisms of human HSPs and provides a new animal model uniquely suited to further investigation of the cell biological and circuit mechanisms underlying disease.</p><p>Precise regulation of axon branching is critical for neurons to develop diverse and complex architecture. We identified KLC4 as a novel regulator of axon branching and show that it is required for stabilization of nascent branches. Axon branching requires extensive cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gallo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>). Branches begin as actin-based filopodial protrusions, which must be invaded by MTs to mature into branches. MT severing by proteins such as katanin and spastin is required to facilitate invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yu et al., 2008</xref>) and branch points are hot spots of increased MT dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dent and Kalil, 2001</xref>). Local unbundling of MTs in the axon shaft occurs at sites of interstitial branch formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ketschek et al., 2015</xref>). Kinesin-1 can bind MTs via the KHC C-terminal tail and crosslink or bundle MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seeger and Rice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Navone et al., 1992</xref>). Binding of KLC to KHC releases the autoinhibition of KHC and can tip the balance between kinesin-1’s cargo transport activities and the ability of the KHC tail region to bind MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wong and Rice, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba et al., 2021</xref>). Our finding that MT dynamics are affected in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants is consistent with a model in which KLC4 promotes the localized MT dynamics or severing that allows MTs to invade new branches, either by transporting/localizing MT regulators or by facilitating MT unbundling. The increase in MT velocity could suggest an increase in MT sliding or altered regulation or localization of polymerization-promoting MAPs such as CRMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakamura et al., 2020</xref>). CRMP2 has been reported to influence MT polymerization and stabilization and has been found in complex with KLC4, supporting its potential role in KLC4-mediated effects on MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koh et al., 2021</xref>). The model of KLC4 as a mediator of microtubule dynamics is also supported by the similarities in phenotype between <italic>klc4</italic> mutants and kinesore treatment. Kinesore blocks binding between KLCs and cargo adaptors, and also releases KLC autoinhibition and drives KHC toward increased MT bundling function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Randall et al., 2017</xref>). MTs that invade nascent branches in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants have less acetylation, suggesting KLC4 may influence post-translational modifications of MTs and thereby affect stabilization of new branches.</p><p>In addition to cytoskeletal remodeling, regulated organelle/cargo transport and membrane remodeling are important for axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winkle et al., 2016</xref>), although little is known about how individual regulators of trafficking contribute to branching patterns. We previously found that a properly functioning endosomal trafficking system is necessary for RB axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponomareva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ponomareva et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we showed that the kinesin adaptor Clstn1 is required for branching of peripheral RB axons and that it functions in part by trafficking endosomal vesicles to branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ponomareva et al., 2014</xref>). KLC4 loss has a relatively minor effect on Rab5 endosome transport, which is not likely to fully explain the branch stabilization phenotype. KLC4 could potentially influence transport or localization of other necessary organelle cargos, such as mitochondria, which must be localized to branch points to support branch growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courchet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Spillane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong et al., 2017</xref>), or organelles that support mitochondria, such as ER, which is a critical regulator of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csordás et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krols et al., 2016</xref>). An important future research goal is to determine whether KLC4 localizes specific organelles to branch points.</p><p>To maximize coverage of an innervation field, the axonal or dendritic arbors of neuronal populations that share a similar function must repel one another on contact to ‘tile’ the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spead and Poulain, 2020</xref>). Our results show that KLC4 is an important player in repulsion between sensory axons, and to our knowledge KLC4 is the first motor protein shown to be involved in tiling. Several cell surface or secreted proteins that meditate dendritic tiling have been identified, including protocadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>), DSCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soba et al., 2007</xref>), netrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 2012</xref>), and slit/robo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>). Less is known about the mechanisms of axon tiling, although similar molecules appear to be involved. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DSCAM mediates sister branch separation in mushroom body axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2002</xref>), and Dscam2 mediates repulsion between axons in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Millard et al., 2007</xref>). An atypical cadherin, Flamingo, is required for spacing of photoreceptor axon arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Senti et al., 2003</xref>), and functions together with the transmembrane protein Golden goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tomasi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hakeda-Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). More recent studies have shown that the protocadherin PcdhaC2 mediates repulsion between axons of serotonergic neurons in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the field has seen multiple advances in knowledge of the membrane proteins that mediate repulsion. However, the mechanisms that regulate their localization to the correct cellular compartments are unknown. Our work can drive new exploration into such mechanisms. For example, it will be interesting to determine whether KLC4 mediates transport of contact repulsion molecules and their specific targeting to peripheral versus central sensory axons.</p><p>The formation of polarized neuronal structure is a critical component of proper neural circuit development. An important early step in neuronal polarity development is determination of the location of axon emergence from the cell body. The ectopic apical axons we see in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants suggest that KLC4 also has roles in the polarity of axon initiation location. RB neuron axons normally emerge from basal edge of cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>), and their emergence correlates with centrosome movement to the basal region of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Halloran, 2012</xref>). We previously found that <italic>laminin-1</italic> mutants also have ectopic apical axons in RB neurons and these ectopic axons correlate with apically displaced centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Halloran, 2012</xref>). Laminin has been shown to influence the location of axon emergence from the cell body in zebrafish RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Randlett et al., 2011</xref>), and can direct the positioning of the centrosome in neurons in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Randlett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>). KLC4 may play a role in coordinating the response to extracellular signals such as laminin that help define the site of axon formation.</p><p>Overall, the developmental phenotypes seen in <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants are striking in that they appear to reflect problems with specific patterning of neuronal structure rather than problems in bulk cargo transport. Neurons appear healthy in the mutants, show no signs of axon degeneration during development, and in fact axons grow faster in mutants than in wild type embryos. Moreover, the <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants are adult viable. Interestingly, <italic>klc1</italic> knockout mice are also adult viable and show specific defects in transport of cannabinoid receptors in developing axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saez et al., 2020</xref>). Thus our findings may reflect a general theme, that the function of the KLC subunits of the kinesin-1 motor are to provide specificity to the process of localizing cargos to particular cell regions. Our results also give insight into mechanisms of the human disease caused by <italic>KLC4</italic> mutation, which may be caused by defects in developmental patterning. It will be important to fully define the unique cellular functions of individual KLCs in order to better understand mechanisms of disease.</p><p>Adult circuit function can be affected by both defects in circuit development and/or later defects in the function of neurons within circuits. Our finding that <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutant adults show freezing and reduced exploration in the novel tank assay implicates KLC4 in the circuits that regulate stress response and that are affected in anxiety and depression disorders. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is an important system that mediates stress responses, and zebrafish mutants with disruptions to the HPA also exhibit anxiety behavior in the novel tank test. Mutation of zebrafish glucocorticoid receptor, a target of the stress hormone cortisol, results in increased freezing and decreased exploratory behavior. Like <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants, glucocorticoid receptor mutants fail to habituate freezing behavior after repeated exposures to the novel tank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziv et al., 2013</xref>). However, unlike <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants, glucocorticoid receptor mutants do not habituate exploratory behavior over multiple exposures. This suggests that freezing behavior and exploratory behavior are controlled by different mechanisms. Interestingly, zebrafish with mutation in a chemokine gene expressed in multiple brain regions, <italic>sam2</italic>, freeze during the novel tank test, but show normal tank exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2018</xref>), providing additional evidence that these two behaviors can be uncoupled. The <italic>sam2</italic> mutants have disruptions in corticotropin releasing hormone neurotransmission, linking the mutation to HPA disruption, but not excluding contribution from other circuits. Our <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> mutants provide another tool to further investigate the circuit changes underlying anxiety disorders.</p><p>Whether developmental defects in RB neurons contribute to adult circuit function is unknown. RB neurons are traditionally thought to be a transient cell population that undergoes programmed cell death during larval stages. However recent evidence has shown that 40% of RBs are maintained for at least the first 2 weeks of development, suggesting they may be retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams and Ribera, 2020</xref>). Moreover, RB neurons have been shown to play significant roles in regulating larval behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knafo et al., 2017</xref>). Hypersensitivity to touch is a common trait of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although the relationship of somatosensory neurons to states like anxiety, depression, and hyperstimulation is not well defined. Interestingly, deletion of the ASD risk genes Mecp2 and Gabrb3 in mouse primary somatosensory neurons during development led to a reduction in exploratory behavior in the open-field test, while deletion of these genes only during adulthood caused no such impairment or anxiety behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orefice et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to sensory neurons, <italic>klc4</italic> is expressed in many cell types in the developing nervous system and thus likely has important roles in development and function of other neurons, which may include neurons that are directly involved in circuits mediating adult behavior. A future research goal is to test the functions of KLC4 in neurons of stress response circuits, such as the HPA axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Briefly, the Tg(<italic>3.1ngn1:GFP-CAAX</italic>) wild type or mutant embryos were mounted in an FEP tube (0.8 mm inner diameter, 1.2 outer diameter, Bola) suspended in 0.02% tricaine in E3 with an agarose plug to prevent leakage.</p><p>For live confocal imaging, embryos were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine and mounted in 1% low melting agarose in 10 mM HEPES E3 medium as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>). Axon outgrowth was imaged in Tg(<italic>3.1ngn1:GFP-CAAX</italic>) embryos with either an Olympus FV1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope using a UplanSApo 20 x Oil objective (NA 0.85) or an Opterra Swept-Field confocal (Bruker Fluorescence Microscopy) with a Nikon S Fluor 40 x Oil immersion objective (NA 1.30). Imaging was started between 18 and 19 hpf, when peripheral RB axons are extending out of the spinal cord. Optical sections (1–1.25 µm) covering a 30–36 µm Z depth were captured every 60–90 s for 2–4 hr.</p><p>High speed imaging of EB3-GFP comets was performed with the Opterra Swept-Field confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon Plan Apo VC 100 x oil immersion objective (NA 1.40). Embryos were imaged at stages between 18 and 26 hpf, during peripheral axon outgrowth. EB3-GFP comets in nascent branches were imaged at stages between 22 and 25 hpf with a Nikon Plan Apo 60 x oil immersion objective (NA 1.40). Z-stacks of 5–30 1 μm optical sections were captured at 2–5 s time intervals, for total durations between 7 and 10 min. High speed imaging of Rab5 vesicle dynamics was done with the Opterra Swept-Field confocal and the Nikon Plan Apo 100 x oil objective (NA 1.40). Embryos were imaged between 22 and 26 hpf. Z-stacks of 5–30 μm optical sections were captured at 2–5 s time intervals for a total duration of 7–10 min. Photoactivation and imaging of PA-GFP-Rab5 were performed on the Olympus FV1000 confocal using a 60 X UplanSApo oil immersion objective (NA 1.35). A region of interest encompassing the cell body was activated with the 405 nm laser during the scan of one Z-plane in the cell body. Z-stacks of 1 µm optical sections were captured every 30–170 s for durations ranging from 26 to 34 minutes (average 29.22 minutes, median 28.84 minutes).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Axon outgrowth analysis</title><p>To measure the speed of axon outgrowth, the area immediately behind the growth cone was measured using the Manual Tracking plugin in FIJI (Fabrice Cordelières). The generated data was loaded into the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool (Ibidi, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ibidi.com/chemotaxis-analysis/171-chemotaxis-and-migration-tool.html">https://ibidi.com/chemotaxis-analysis/171-chemotaxis-and-migration-tool.html</ext-link>) to generate velocity measurements and rose plot histograms. Rose plots were re-plotted in MATLAB (MathWorks) using secplot (Matthew Foster, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14174-secplot">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/14174-secplot</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Branch analysis</title><p>Custom macros for FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) were written to automate branch analysis. Briefly, stacks were processed to be maximum intensity projections and oriented with anterior to the left. A rectangular ROI was selected over the posterior region of the yolk tube extension such that the top of the selection was aligned with the bottom of the central RB axons. A tubeness filter was applied to reduce non-axonal background. A histogram of axon directionality was generated for the ROI using OrientationJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rezakhaniha et al., 2011</xref>). To measure differences in axon directional distribution, we computed the area under the curve (AUC) for the regions to be compared. We then performed a t-test using the resulting mean and standard error to determine significance. To measure axon branch density, eight ROIs measuring 3 µm in height were generated at regularly spaced intervals from dorsal to ventral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These selections were individually thresholded, binarized, and the number of objects contained in each ROI was determined using the Analyze Particles function. To analyze acetylated tubulin signal in nascent branches, terminal branches up to 10 µm in length were scored based on the presence or absence of visible acetylated tubulin signal. Total proportion of nascent branches with signal was compared between wild type and mutant embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Kymography</title><p>Hyperstacks of EB3-GFP or GFP-Rab5c images were assembled using FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and segments of axons were traced for kymography using the segmented line tool. For peripheral axons, a segment was defined as an area of axon between two branch nodes, or between the first visible portion of axon and the first node of branching. Growth cones and filopodia were excluded from analysis. For analysis of EB3-GFP in nascent branches, only branches &lt; 10 µm long were analyzed. For unbranched central axons, a segment was defined as the entire visible length of either the ascending or descending central axon within each field of view. Kymographs were made using the Multi Kymograph plugin (developed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/fiji/Multi_Kymograph/releases/tag/Multi_Kymograph-3.0.1">J. Rietdorf and A. Seitz,</ext-link> European Molecular Biology Laboratory, 2004). Comet or vesicle parameters were measured from the resulting kymographs. To measure Rab5 accumulation at branch points, movies were divided into 4 time periods (t1-t4), each containing 7–8 min. Maximum intensity projections were made for t1-t4 and the fluorescent signal at branch points was measured for each maximum intensity projection. Background signal from the branch point prior to activation was subtracted from measured t1-t4 values, and then all values were normalized to the signal at the t1 period. Comparisons between experimental conditions were made using the Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Adult Body Size Measurements</title><p>Zebrafish were raised for this experiment by in-crossing wildtype or <italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic> homozygous siblings. Larva were placed in 3 L tanks side-by-side and subjected to the same light cycle and feeding schedule during rearing. At 7 weeks and 9 weeks, fish were briefly anesthetized with 0.02% tricaine, placed on white waterproof surface, measured with a ruler, and photographed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Larval touch assay</title><p>To assess responsiveness to touch, 3 dpf zebrafish larva were individually placed in a 6 cm dish and allowed to acclimate for 2 min. A tail touch was administered to the end of the tail using a gel loading tip attached to a long applicator stick. The tail touch was given from a side angle to avoid looming stimulus. A high-speed camera was used to acquire 50 frames per second for a total of 1050 frames (21 s). The response time of each larva was measured from the first movement after a touch to the cessation of movement for more than 15 frames (inter-bout pauses only lasted ~7–8 frames). Some wild type and <italic>klc4</italic> mutant larva did not respond to an initial touch (10 wild type, 14 mutant), and these samples were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Feeding experiment</title><p>Feeding experiments were conducted as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Howe et al., 2018</xref>. Briefly, adult zebrafish were isolated in individual 1 L tanks without food for 48 hr, then 50 larval zebrafish were added to each tank. The fish were allowed to feed on the larvae for one hour, then removed from the tank to allow counting of the remaining larvae. All tested animals were of AB background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Novel tank diving test</title><p>The evening before an experiment, fish were moved to the behavior experiment room and allowed to acclimate overnight. Exposure to novel tank was carried out in the morning, and the order of which genotype received exposure first was randomized. The novel tank had 3 opaque sides to block potential views of other fish and one clear side for imaging. The water in the novel tank was changed between groups. Fish were netted from their 3 L home tank, released into the novel tank, and allowed to explore for 3 min before being removed and placed into a recovery tank. All tested animals were of AB background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Habituation experiment</title><p>Two weeks prior to an experiment, adults were sorted into separate 3 L tanks with 5–6 individuals of the same genotype in each. Experiment was conducted in a similar manner as described above, but fish were allowed to explore for 10 min before removal. Novel tank exposure was repeated on the same groups twice a week for 3 weeks. Exposures were conducted a minimum of two days apart. The experiment was repeated for another 3 weeks with an additional two groups of 6 fish per genotype. All tested animals were of AB background. When possible, groups were divided into similar ratios of male and female fish for a total of 11 females and 12 males within each genotype. The group compositions were as follows: <bold>wild type</bold>: group 1 (3 females [F], 2 males [M]) group 2, (3 F, 3 M), group 3 (3 F, 3 M), group 4 (2 F, 4 M), <bold><italic>klc4<sup>uw314</sup></italic></bold>: group 1 (2 F, 3 M), group 2, (3 F, 3 M), group 3 (3 F, 3 M), group 4 (3 F, 3 M).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Automated tracking of adults</title><p>For the habituation experiment, automated tracking of zebrafish through ToxTrac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>) was used to quantify swim velocity and percent of time spent in the upper zone. When necessary for accurate tracking, background subtraction was performed on movies prior to using ToxTrac. This was accomplished by subtracting the first frame of each movie (showing only the empty tank) from subsequent frames in the movie via FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Operations were performed using Clij2 where possible to speed up processing time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haase et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses and graphs were generated with Graphpad Prism. See figure legends for details on sample sizes, specific statistical tests used, error bars and p values. Data were checked for normality using Anderson-Darling test, D’Agostino &amp; Pearson test, and Shapiro-Wilk test before deciding on a statistical test. Non-normal data were tested for significance using a Mann-Whitney test. In some cases, the N values were too low to perform a statistical test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, the N for wild type is low because fasciculation events are very rare in wild type and obtaining a value for fasciculation length is contingent on the event occurring. For the behavioral data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, multiple animals were tested in each trial, but N is the number of individual behavioral trial days (N=3, which is too low to test for normality). In all these cases, individual data points are shown for comparison. Data tested using the Mann-Whitney test were independent of each other and comprised ordinal or continuous numbers.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is a consultant for Bruker, the manufacturer of the Opterra swept field confocal used in this work</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;KLC4 shapes axon arbors during development and mediates adult behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Fabienne E. Poulain as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>After discussing their reviews with one another, and as you will see from the individual reviews below, all three reviewers agree that your study describes novel and interesting functions of Klc4 in sensory axon development and has therefore a potential high impact. However, reviewers share four major concerns that need to be fully addressed before your manuscript can be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Essential revisions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) The study lacks a detailed analysis of axonal phenotypes in klc4 mutants and would be strengthened by analyzing single arbor dynamics and/or using additional morphological criteria to define branches and analyze axonal density.</p><p>2) The study lacks mechanistic insight into the roles of KLC4 and the phenotypes observed. Reviewers agree that at least some mechanistic experiments are necessary to explain how klc4 mutations cause axonal phenotypes. These include analyzing the transport of specific cargoes during axonal development and microtubule behavior during axonal branching. The localization and cell-autonomous function of klc4 could also be analyzed.</p><p>3) There is a disconnect between the description of sensory axonal defects in embryos and the characterization of behavioral defects in adults. Behavioral assays that rely on functional sensory neurons instead (touch-response in larvae for example) would be more appropriate for this study.</p><p>4) As described in detail by reviewer 2 (see below), multiple concerns about statistical analyses were raised and need to be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written and the conclusions are well supported by the data. The light sheet and swept confocal microscopy movies provide a unique view of sensory axon development in vivo and are beautiful! Below are a few questions / comments that I had while reading the manuscript:</p><p>1) The data in figures 3 and 5 show nicely that axon branches are not stabilized and that axonal growth is shifted posteriorly in klc4 mutants. Is the collapse of branches direction-dependent in the mutant? Is there a difference in branch stabilization/pruning depending on whether the branch elongates anteriorly or posteriorly?</p><p>2) The presence of apical protrusions crossing the midline in klc4 mutants suggests a defect in RB neuron polarity. Is the centrosome mislocalized in klc4 mutants?</p><p>3) The existence of both Klc4 isoforms is interesting, especially since corresponding transcripts seem to be differently regulated during development. Since the short isoform is not predicted to bind any cargo, is anything known about its functions? Are both isoforms expressed in RB neurons?</p><p>4) It would be interesting to analyze the localization of Klc4 in sensory neurons, although this might be difficult to do. Would it be possible to mosaically express low levels of tagged klc4 in mutant sensor neurons and analyze its distribution?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors use Crisper technology to generate a zebrafish line that lacks expression of KLC4. This animal is then used throughout, along with pharmacological inhibition of KLC binding to adaptor proteins, to address the roles of KLC4 in the development of the morphology of Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons in embryos and assess behavioral alterations in adult fish. Modern imaging methods are applied to study neuronal morphology in embryos and a battery of behavioral tests in adults. The study provides first line of inquiry assessment of the role of KLC4 in the development of RB morphology, focusing on the failure to establish proper axon arbors in the periphery. While each data set has intrinsic value and is novel, none is followed up to provide mechanistic insights into KLC4 functions in neurons. The value of the submission rests in providing a characterization of the effects of KLC4 knockout, but it does not further the understanding of the mechanistic contributions of KLC4 in the processes impacted by the genetic deletion of KLC4. While the significance of the question posed is well presented and clear, multiple issues regarding interpretation, presentation and analysis decrease enthusiasm for the submission in its current form.</p><p>For the authors' consideration:</p><p>1. The current in situ data uses a riboprobe that does not differentiate between the short and long forms of the KLC4 transcript. Given the large difference between short and long transcripts of KLC4, and expected differences in function of the resultant proteins, it would assist in the interpretation of the results to assess short and long transcript expression in RB neurons. Ideally, this would be followed up by specific knock down of the long form to dissect its contributions from the short form.</p><p>2. At first evaluation, it is not clear how the axon branching metric (presented in Supplemental Figure 2) is specific for axon branching. In the images provided there seem to be consistently fewer axons present as a function of distance from the central fasicle in the KLC mutant and kinesore treated embryos (e.g., Figure 2A,B,D,E,H,I; Figure 4A,B). How can the metric dissociate the number of main axons that arrived at the ROI from branches made from those axons?</p><p>Based on the high quality of the imaging, it seems that it would be possible to use morphological criteria to define axon branches and measure the density along individual axons. This form of assessment would be much more stringent than the ROI crossing method used. Indeed, this form of assessment is used in the live imaging studies addressing rates or branch formation and stability.</p><p>3. Considering the above comment (2) regarding the consistent observable decrease in the apparent number of axons and their lengths into the periphery noted above, it is surprising that an increase in the rate of axon extension was detected in the live imaging analysis (Figure 3E). It is suggested that the authors analyze the density of axons and their total length as a function of distance from the central axon fascicle, noting that the ROI based approach in supplemental Figure 2 should serve this purpose by simply changing the distance from the fascicle into the periphery at constant intervals (currently only 65 microns was addressed).</p><p>Based on the images presented I would expect that a decrease in axon density and length will be determined in the KLC4 mutant. If so, then these data would stand in conflict with the observed increase rate of axon extension, but may indicate that earlier aspects of axon formation were also impacted in the KLC4 mutant. The formation of axons from the cell body may share mechanistic similarity to the emergence of branches, and thus may be delayed in the mutant due to failure to stabilize the new axon at its early stages of formation which could then result in the difference suggested by the images provided without being confounded by the subsequent increase in axon extension rate. It would also be insightful to perform this analysis at multiple points in ontogenesis.</p><p>4. An interpretational caveat is that with both the genetic mutant and the drug treatment all cells are expected to be affected. From the in situ is it not clear to this reviewer if there is no expression of KLC4 in the environment the axons/branches are migrating through. Might this issue be resolved using zebrafish genetics with lines allowing for specific knockdown in RB neurons? or some other approach to address whether the effects are cell intrinsic.</p><p>5. Statistical analysis. There are multiple concerns regarding the statistical presentation and analysis.</p><p>The section in the methods requires much elaboration, starting with which test was used to determine the normalcy of data sets, and addressed by subsequent comments.</p><p>Figures4 and 10 require statistical analysis of the data. &quot;Plots using 95% confidence intervals (CI) were considered to be significant when the 95% CI ranges did not overlap.&quot; Is not considered a stringent analytical method, although a valid &quot;rule of thumb&quot;. The authors are urged to seek assistance from a statistician.</p><p>6E, no 95% CI shown as claimed in the legend. The mean is not likely to be significant as the WT only have 3 points and one is an outlier relative to the other 2. I also do not see how the mean in the +/+ could be as shown, as claimed in the legend, it seems to be the median. I would estimate the mean to be somewhere around 20 um. For the mutant data, the distribution does not strike me as normal. Were these data analyzed for normality? Also, there is no statistical analysis shown, appreciating that with an n=3 for the WT this is problematic and power would have to be increased through greater sampling.</p><p>The legend to Figure 8 states that t-test with Mann-Whitney correction are used. I am not familiar with this correction for a t-test and was not able to find references to such a correction for t-test. Was Welch correction intended? The statistical description in the method is very sparse as presented and details should be presented. How the basic assumptions of the rather limited t-test were met by data prior to selection of specific t-test should be clearly denoted.</p><p>Figure 9. In panel C, a t-test is used but (1) the data are bounded values, and (2) the distribution in WT is clearly non normal with many data points at the boundary (i.e., 100%). A t-test is not applicable as basic assumptions are broken, and do not appear to have been determined. E and H have no p values or test shown in legend and it is not clear why individual data points are not shown here as in other panels. F and G have no test denoted. The meaning of * and multiples thereof is only defined for one panel. Panel G has *** not defined at all.</p><p>6. Strictly speaking, the authors are inferring contact repulsion but do not use the imaging data sets to directly address it (i.e., through direct analysis of the consequences of contacts between the two sister branches after growth cone bifurcation). The observed changes in angles between sister branches could be due to a variety of other mechanisms altering the ability of sister branches to generate larger angles.</p><p>The self-contact examples in Figure 6 are not particularly compelling. Perhaps, presentation of all relevant frames in the timelapse with greater annotation and description would assist a reader.</p><p>In Figure 6B, in contrast to what the text claims, this reviewer does not see a clear growth cone bifurcation followed by fasiculation due to lack of self-repulsion. It appears a small back branch from the second panel from the left aligns with the main axon.</p><p>Also, the &quot;appearing to collapse onto one another&quot; (line 232) could be interpreted as a consequence of the prior analysis of branch stability.</p><p>7. Figure 8D,E. &quot;Comet Frequency&quot; in comets/um/min. It is not clear if this reflects new comets observed during the imaging or all observed comets/um/min.</p><p>The imaging sets would benefit from additional analysis to extract the duration of EB3 comets (i.e., summed period spent polymerizing per comet) and total distance from initiation to loss of the comet.</p><p>It is not clear why central axons are analyzed for only these data sets and not others. As the focus of the paper is on peripheral axons the suggested additional data sets for peripheral axons would suffice.</p><p>As a whole, I would suggest that the data in Figure 8 from EB3 imaging indicate increased polymerization of plus tips along axons in the mutant. This is not immediately reconcilable with decreases branch stability as one would presume that microtubules would be more prone to catastrophe and depolymerization in conjunction with decreased branch stability. The data are broadly consistent with the detected increase in axon extension rate. However, analysis of EB3 comets needs to be provided in branches (collateral and bifurcated) in order to be linked to the main observed phenotype of decreased branch stability.</p><p>8. While of general interest, the behavioral assays do not address RB neuron function or circuitry, which is embryonic. The fit of these data to the rest of the study is not clear.

Whether it localizes to the RB axons remains unknown, or whether it ever targets to branches. One would presume so, but this needs to be assessed. It is hard to interpret results with any degree of mechanistic insight without knowledge of the localization of the molecule addressed.</p><p>10. Final considerations: Overall, this submission contains interesting and valuable data sets that are however preliminary in nature as none is followed up to achieve a deeper mechanistic understanding. This manuscript presents a characterization of phenotypes in KLC4 mutant zebrafish RB neurons but does not provide insights into how KLC4 is mechanistically contributing to the observed phenotypes, or whether it is acting cell intrinsically. Having said this, the discussion carefully considers the potential implications of the individual findings and notes relevant future directions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Further characterization of axonal defects:</p><p>– While the population-based methods for characterizing axonal defects are elegant and informative, these defects could potentially be further appreciated with single cell resolution, What do the arbors of individual neurons look like in these mutants? Does the mutant affect all sensory neurons equally, or is a sub-population of neurons more severely affected? It should be possible to analyze single neurons with transient transgenesis in the zebrafish model. This could be particularly helpful since aberrant fasciculation may make it difficult to distinguish multiple fasciculated axon branches when the whole population of neurons is labeled. Identifying defects at a single neuron level could also make it possible to carry out rescue experiments to address the cell autonomy of axon arborization defects.</p><p>Explanation of axonal defects mechanistically:</p><p>– The impact of this paper would be most enhanced by characterizing the axonal trafficking of cellular cargos in klc4 mutants, particularly if defects in specific trafficked cargoes could plausibly explain the axonal defects. In the discussion of the paper, the authors note that they have previously found that endosomal trafficking regulates branching. Characterizing endosomal trafficking, as well as trafficking of mitochondria, lysosomes, golgi, etc, thus has the potential to make this study substantially more mechanistically satisfying.</p><p>– The changes in microtubule dynamics of klc4 mutants are interesting, but how trafficking defects affect these dynamics, and how defects in MT dynamics affect branching, is unclear. To address how trafficking affects MTs, the authors could attempt to identify MTOCs in axons. For example, since golgi outposts are thought to be MTOCs, is their trafficking into axons affected by klc4 mutation? To address how MT defects affect branching, the authors could characterize MT dynamics during branching-for example, do mutants display any defects in the frequency of MT invasion into nascent branches?</p><p>Behavior:</p><p>– As mentioned above, the analyses of adult behavioral defects, while interesting and rigorously carried out, do not complement the morphological analysis in larval sensory neurons. It would be exciting if axonal arborization defects in a specific neuron type could be linked to behavioral defects. Could the authors attempt to characterize touch-response behaviors in larval fish? This would be a particularly exciting if it were possible to do cell-autonomous rescue experiments, thus directly testing if defects in sensory neuron morphology affect behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74270.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) The study lacks a detailed analysis of axonal phenotypes in klc4 mutants and would be strengthened by analyzing single arbor dynamics and/or using additional morphological criteria to define branches and analyze axonal density.</p></disp-quote><p>To get more detailed information about axon density, we increased our image sampling by using a grid ROI instead of a single line ROI.

Details are described in response to Reviewer 2, points 2 and 3 below, and data added to Figure 2F, G, and Supplemental Figure 2.

Reviewers agree that at least some mechanistic experiments are necessary to explain how klc4 mutations cause axonal phenotypes. These include analyzing the transport of specific cargoes during axonal development and microtubule behavior during axonal branching. The localization and cell-autonomous function of klc4 could also be analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new experiments to image endosomal dynamics (new Figure 8), trafficking of Rab5-labeled endosomes from the cell body to branch points (new Figure 8 —figure supplement 1A, 1B), microtubule behavior during axon branching (new Figure 10), and acetylation of microtubules in nascent branches (new Figure 10). We chose Rab5-labeled endosomes because of our previous work showing a correlation between their transport and RB axon branching. Although the <italic>klc4</italic> mutants did not have a decrease in endosome delivery to branch points, high-speed imaging of vesicle dynamics revealed some alterations in transport of these vesicles in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants. These alterations in endosome transport are not likely to be the only effects of <italic>klc4</italic> mutation on cargo dynamics or to fully explain the mechanism by which KLC promotes branch stabilization. However, an exhaustive analysis of all potential cargos would require many months to years of work and is outside the scope of this manuscript. Further description is in response to Reviewer 3, point 2.</p><p>We also added new experiments analyzing microtubules in nascent branches (new Figure 10). We used live imaging with EB3-GFP to measure frequency of comets entering nascent branches. Although comet frequency in established axons is increased in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants, there is no difference in frequency of comets entering nascent branches, suggesting a relative decrease. We used anti-acetylated tubulin labeling to show that <italic>klc4</italic> mutants have fewer nascent branches with stable, acetylated tubulin. Further description is in our response to Reviewer 2, point 7 and Reviewer 3, point 3.</p><p>As described in our response to Reviewer 2, point 4, we believe the effects of <italic>klc4</italic> mutation are likely cell autonomous because <italic>klc4</italic> is not expressed in the somites or the skin, which are the tissues in contact with RB peripheral axons, and RB neurons are the predominant cells in the dorsal spinal cord that express <italic>klc4</italic> at the stages when we see the axon phenotypes.</p><p>As described in response to Reviewer 1, point 4 and Reviewer 2, point 9, there are major obstacles that prevent visualization of KLC4 protein localization within neurons. There are no available antibodies to zebrafish KLC4. We tried using expression of KLC4-GFP fusion constructs (as suggested by Reviewer 1), but expression leads to diffuse labeling throughout the cytoplasm. This problem has been previously reported by others attempting to visualize kinesin-1 heavy chains (Yang et al. 2019, <italic>Traffic</italic> 20:851-866). Because the vast majority of kinesin light chains and heavy chains exist in an auto-inhibited conformation that is freely diffusible, the diffuse signal resulting from expression of tagged proteins obscures visualization of motors bound to cargos. Thus, we are unfortunately not able to image KLC4 protein localization with current available approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a disconnect between the description of sensory axonal defects in embryos and the characterization of behavioral defects in adults.

However, we kept the data on adult anxiety-like behavior in the main Figures 11 and 12. We believe these results will be of interest to the community and potentially useful as a new model to study stress response behaviors and circuits.

The light sheet and swept confocal microscopy movies provide a unique view of sensory axon development in vivo and are beautiful! Below are a few questions / comments that I had while reading the manuscript:</p><p>1) The data in figures 3 and 5 show nicely that axon branches are not stabilized and that axonal growth is shifted posteriorly in klc4 mutants. Is the collapse of branches direction-dependent in the mutant? Is there a difference in branch stabilization/pruning depending on whether the branch elongates anteriorly or posteriorly?</p></disp-quote><p>We scored the directionality of the axon branches that failed to stabilize and did not find a significant difference in the percent that were anteriorly or posteriorly directed. We have added this result to the text of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The presence of apical protrusions crossing the midline in klc4 mutants suggests a defect in RB neuron polarity. Is the centrosome mislocalized in klc4 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We previously showed a correlation between mislocalized centrosomes and apical protrusions with two other manipulations that lead to apical protrusions in RB neurons: inhibition of LIM homeodomain transcription factors and lamininA1 mutation (Andersen and Halloran, 2012, <italic>Development</italic> 139:3590-3599). We expect that we would also see apical mislocalization of the centrosome in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants. However, because showing a third condition under which these two events are correlated would be a relatively incremental conceptual advance, and because centrosome imaging is one of several time-intensive experiments requested by reviewers, we focused our efforts on the experiments deemed to be essential revisions (imaging of cargo transport and microtubule dynamics during branching, and larval behavior experiments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The existence of both Klc4 isoforms is interesting, especially since corresponding transcripts seem to be differently regulated during development. Since the short isoform is not predicted to bind any cargo, is anything known about its functions? Are both isoforms expressed in RB neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We made a riboprobe that recognizes sequence found only in the long isoform. We found that the expression pattern of the long isoform is very similar to that of the riboprobe that binds both isoforms, indicating that the long isoform is likely present in all <italic>klc4</italic>-expressing neurons, including RB neurons. We added those data in Figure 1. The short isoform does not have unique sequence that isn’t present in the long isoform, so we are not able to make a short isoform specific riboprobe. To our knowledge, nothing is known about the function of the short isoform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be interesting to analyze the localization of Klc4 in sensory neurons, although this might be difficult to do. Would it be possible to mosaically express low levels of tagged klc4 in mutant sensor neurons and analyze its distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried using expression of KLC4-GFP fusion constructs, but expression leads to diffuse labeling throughout the cytoplasm.

This animal is then used throughout, along with pharmacological inhibition of KLC binding to adaptor proteins, to address the roles of KLC4 in the development of the morphology of Rohon-Beard (RB) sensory neurons in embryos and assess behavioral alterations in adult fish. Modern imaging methods are applied to study neuronal morphology in embryos and a battery of behavioral tests in adults. The study provides first line of inquiry assessment of the role of KLC4 in the development of RB morphology, focusing on the failure to establish proper axon arbors in the periphery. While each data set has intrinsic value and is novel, none is followed up to provide mechanistic insights into KLC4 functions in neurons. The value of the submission rests in providing a characterization of the effects of KLC4 knockout, but it does not further the understanding of the mechanistic contributions of KLC4 in the processes impacted by the genetic deletion of KLC4. While the significance of the question posed is well presented and clear, multiple issues regarding interpretation, presentation and analysis decrease enthusiasm for the submission in its current form.</p><p>For the authors' consideration:</p><p>1. The current in situ data uses a riboprobe that does not differentiate between the short and long forms of the KLC4 transcript. Given the large difference between short and long transcripts of KLC4, and expected differences in function of the resultant proteins, it would assist in the interpretation of the results to assess short and long transcript expression in RB neurons. Ideally, this would be followed up by specific knock down of the long form to dissect its contributions from the short form.</p></disp-quote><p>We made a riboprobe that recognizes sequence found only in the long isoform.

We added those data in Figure 1. The short isoform does not have unique sequence that isn’t present in the long isoform, so we are not able to make a short isoform specific riboprobe. We also do not have a means to specifically knock down the short isoform. Splice blocking morpholinos could potentially be used to knock down the long isoform, but given the issues with morpholinos and interpretation of morpholino phenotypes, this would not be a definitive experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. At first evaluation, it is not clear how the axon branching metric (presented in Supplemental Figure 2) is specific for axon branching. In the images provided there seem to be consistently fewer axons present as a function of distance from the central fasicle in the KLC mutant and kinesore treated embryos (e.g., Figure 2A,B,D,E,H,I; Figure 4A,B). How can the metric dissociate the number of main axons that arrived at the ROI from branches made from those axons?</p></disp-quote><p>The metric does not distinguish between primary peripheral axons and those arising from secondary, tertiary or higher order branches. Most RB peripheral axons form as a branch from the central axon close to the cell body, and often this primary branch bifurcates shortly after spinal cord exit. Thus, all the axon segments in the periphery should be considered branches. We modified our language in the manuscript to avoid use of the term “main axon” because there is no clear definition of this term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the high quality of the imaging, it seems that it would be possible to use morphological criteria to define axon branches and measure the density along individual axons. This form of assessment would be much more stringent than the ROI crossing method used. Indeed, this form of assessment is used in the live imaging studies addressing rates or branch formation and stability.</p></disp-quote><p>To get more detailed information about axon density, we increased our image sampling by using a grid ROI instead of a single line ROI. This analysis approach provides information about axon density as a function of dorsal-ventral location (as suggested by the reviewer in point 3 below). This approach also provides information about both growth cone bifurcation and interstitial branching. We added the new data to Figure 2F, G, and Figure 2 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Considering the above comment (2) regarding the consistent observable decrease in the apparent number of axons and their lengths into the periphery noted above, it is surprising that an increase in the rate of axon extension was detected in the live imaging analysis (Figure 3E). It is suggested that the authors analyze the density of axons and their total length as a function of distance from the central axon fascicle, noting that the ROI based approach in supplemental Figure 2 should serve this purpose by simply changing the distance from the fascicle into the periphery at constant intervals (currently only 65 microns was addressed).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we now added this additional, multiple ROI analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the images presented I would expect that a decrease in axon density and length will be determined in the KLC4 mutant. If so, then these data would stand in conflict with the observed increase rate of axon extension, but may indicate that earlier aspects of axon formation were also impacted in the KLC4 mutant. The formation of axons from the cell body may share mechanistic similarity to the emergence of branches, and thus may be delayed in the mutant due to failure to stabilize the new axon at its early stages of formation which could then result in the difference suggested by the images provided without being confounded by the subsequent increase in axon extension rate. It would also be insightful to perform this analysis at multiple points in ontogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>There are fewer axons present in the mutants because there is less branching. In both wild type and mutants, axons that are shorter at one snapshot in time likely formed more recently than the longer axons. Live imaging is required to make conclusions about extension rate, and our live imaging showed that in the mutants, the axons that do form grow faster than wild type axons. We previously showed that the peripheral axons most often arise as a branch off the central axon (Andersen et al. 2011, <italic>Neural Dev</italic> 6:27), and we do believe that process shares mechanistic similarity to the formation of subsequent branches. Interestingly, the grid ROI analysis showed fewer branches in the mutants at all dorsal-ventral levels, indicating that the initial formation of peripheral axons may also be affected in the mutants, as the reviewer suggests. We added discussion of our interpretation of these results to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. An interpretational caveat is that with both the genetic mutant and the drug treatment all cells are expected to be affected. From the in situ is it not clear to this reviewer if there is no expression of KLC4 in the environment the axons/branches are migrating through. Might this issue be resolved using zebrafish genetics with lines allowing for specific knockdown in RB neurons? or some other approach to address whether the effects are cell intrinsic.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the effects in the mutant are likely cell autonomous. While it may be difficult to see from images captured at one focal plane, we can clearly distinguish the different tissues when looking through the microscope. We see no <italic>klc4</italic> expression in the somites or the skin cells, which are the tissues that RB peripheral axons contact while growing. In addition, the RB neurons are the predominant cell type in the dorsal spinal cord expressing <italic>klc4</italic> at the stages we see the axon phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Statistical analysis. There are multiple concerns regarding the statistical presentation and analysis.</p><p>The section in the methods requires much elaboration, starting with which test was used to determine the normalcy of data sets, and addressed by subsequent comments.</p></disp-quote><p>On every analyzed dataset tests of normality were run before a method to test significant differences was decided. We used Prism’s suite of normality tests, which include Anderson-Darling test, D’Agostino and Pearson test, and Shapiro-Wilk test. In nearly all cases these tests were in agreement about whether the data were normal or not normal. Occasionally, one test of the three would suggest data were non-normal when the other two tests would count them as normal. In these cases, the data were always considered to be non-normal. We have elaborated this process in the revised Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures4 and 10 require statistical analysis of the data. &quot;Plots using 95% confidence intervals (CI) were considered to be significant when the 95% CI ranges did not overlap.&quot; Is not considered a stringent analytical method, although a valid &quot;rule of thumb&quot;. The authors are urged to seek assistance from a statistician.</p></disp-quote><p>We consulted with a statistician, who advised us to calculate the area under the curve. For Figure 4, in the portion of the graph where the 95% confidence intervals do not overlap (posterior angles -20 to -45, area shaded in Figure 4D), we calculated the area under the curve, which gives us a mean and standard error of the mean and allows a t-test to be run on the data. The t-test showed that the difference in area under the curve was significant (p=0.0047). In Figure 12 (formerly Figure 10), we calculated the area under the curve in panels B-F and found all to be significant, with p values p=0.0005 or p&lt;0.0001. We added these analyses to the Methods section and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6E, no 95% CI shown as claimed in the legend. The mean is not likely to be significant as the WT only have 3 points and one is an outlier relative to the other 2. I also do not see how the mean in the +/+ could be as shown, as claimed in the legend, it seems to be the median. I would estimate the mean to be somewhere around 20 um. For the mutant data, the distribution does not strike me as normal. Were these data analyzed for normality? Also, there is no statistical analysis shown, appreciating that with an n=3 for the WT this is problematic and power would have to be increased through greater sampling.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret the inaccuracy of the legend which likely occurred during changes to that figure. The figure has been updated to show the mean with standard error of the mean. As the reviewer noted, these data were not analyzed for significance because of the paucity of fasciculation events in wildtype (all events are shown). We did not report the normality test because we were not running a statistical test on the data. However, a normality test showed that mutant distribution was normal by Anderson-Darling, D’Agostino and Pearson, and Shapiro-Wilk. Normality could not be assessed for wild type because of the small number of fasciculation events. Our statistical consultant confirmed that it would not be appropriate to run a statistical test on the data because the events are so rare in wild type. They advised us to note in the legend that length measurements are conditional on event occurring, which we have done. We believe that reporting these measurements is still informative to readers even if they can’t be tested for statistical significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The legend to Figure 8 states that t-test with Mann-Whitney correction are used. I am not familiar with this correction for a t-test and was not able to find references to such a correction for t-test. Was Welch correction intended? The statistical description in the method is very sparse as presented and details should be presented. How the basic assumptions of the rather limited t-test were met by data prior to selection of specific t-test should be clearly denoted.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inaccurate description. The Mann Whitney test is not a corrected t-test, but rather an alternative to the t-test for non-normal data. This test is the same as the Wilcoxon rank sum test. This does not change the results, as the Mann-Whitney test is still an appropriate test for these data. We added more description to the statistical section of the Methods. Before selection of a test, the data were tested for normality by the previously described methods. In most cases, data were not normally distributed in all samples, leading to use of the Mann-Whitney test. In cases where data were determined to be normal, a standard t-test was used. Data tested by Mann-Whitney or t-tests were independent of each other and comprised ordinal or continuous numbers. Data tested by t-test were confirmed to have no difference in variance by performing an F test to compare variances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9. In panel C, a t-test is used but (1) the data are bounded values, and (2) the distribution in WT is clearly non normal with many data points at the boundary (i.e., 100%).

E and H have no p values or test shown in legend and it is not clear why individual data points are not shown here as in other panels. F and G have no test denoted. The meaning of * and multiples thereof is only defined for one panel.

The Mann-Whitney test accepts ordinal values, which should include bounded variables. The Mann-Whitney test is also equivalent to the Wilcoxon rank sum test. To be thorough, we also performed a Kruskal-Wallis test, which also works on independent data that are non-normal and ordinal or continuous. We found that the Kruskal-Wallis test agreed with the Mann-Whitney test and found that there was a significant difference in the number of larvae eaten between wildtype and mutant fish, with p&lt;0.0001.</p><p>For E and H (now Figure 11 E, H), these graphs represent 3 individual experiments. Multiple animals were tested in each trial, but the N is the number of individual behavioral trial days. N=3 is too low to test for normality, therefore it was not appropriate to perform a statistical analysis on the data. The Mann-Whitney test (used for non-normal data) fails with an N this low—if the N is less than 7, the Mann-Whitney will always give a p value greater than 0.05 no matter how much the groups differ. We were able to test significance of the total time spent in the upper zone (Figure 11G) and the time spent freezing (Figure 11I). We believe it is informative to also report the percent fish that entered the upper zone in each experiment (Figure 11E) and the percent that froze (Figure 11H), even though these can’t be tested for significance. We have updated the data display to show individual points for each experiment, along with mean and standard error of the mean. We have updated the legends to include all statistical test descriptions and p values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Strictly speaking, the authors are inferring contact repulsion but do not use the imaging data sets to directly address it (i.e., through direct analysis of the consequences of contacts between the two sister branches after growth cone bifurcation).

Instead we are making use of two separate approaches to address questions about KLC4 function: (1) We take advantage of the superficial position of the RB neurons, which makes them ideal for imaging, and their distinctly polarized morphology to uncover cell biological processes influenced by KLC4. (2) We use adult behavioral analysis to more broadly assess roles of KLC4 in other neural circuits. We believe that publication of the adult behavior phenotypes will benefit the scientific community and be useful as a new model to study stress response behaviors and circuits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. One fundamental aspect of the study that is missing is consideration of KLC4 localization in the RB neurons. Whether it localizes to the RB axons remains unknown, or whether it ever targets to branches. One would presume so, but this needs to be assessed. It is hard to interpret results with any degree of mechanistic insight without knowledge of the localization of the molecule addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in response to reviewer 1, we tried using expression of KLC4-GFP fusion constructs, but expression leads to diffuse labeling throughout the cytoplasm. This problem has been previously reported by others attempting to visualize kinesin-1 heavy chains (Yang et al. 2019, <italic>Traffic</italic> 20:851-866). Because the vast majority of kinesin light chains and heavy chains exist in an auto-inhibited conformation that is freely diffusible, the diffuse signal resulting from expression of tagged proteins obscures visualization of motors bound to cargos. Thus, we are unfortunately not able to image KLC4 protein localization with current available approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Final considerations: Overall, this submission contains interesting and valuable data sets that are however preliminary in nature as none is followed up to achieve a deeper mechanistic understanding. This manuscript presents a characterization of phenotypes in KLC4 mutant zebrafish RB neurons but does not provide insights into how KLC4 is mechanistically contributing to the observed phenotypes, or whether it is acting cell intrinsically. Having said this, the discussion carefully considers the potential implications of the individual findings and notes relevant future directions.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Further characterization of axonal defects:</p><p>– While the population-based methods for characterizing axonal defects are elegant and informative, these defects could potentially be further appreciated with single cell resolution, What do the arbors of individual neurons look like in these mutants? Does the mutant affect all sensory neurons equally, or is a sub-population of neurons more severely affected? It should be possible to analyze single neurons with transient transgenesis in the zebrafish model. This could be particularly helpful since aberrant fasciculation may make it difficult to distinguish multiple fasciculated axon branches when the whole population of neurons is labeled. Identifying defects at a single neuron level could also make it possible to carry out rescue experiments to address the cell autonomy of axon arborization defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We did analyze individual neurons labeled with transient transgenesis for the Rab5 and microtubule imaging experiments, and the single-cell labeling in Figure 7 to follow the trajectory of apical processes. As the reviewer points out, this is important because fasciculation of multiple axons would confound results. We used stable transgenics for the live imaging of axon growth, fasciculation and branch dynamics. This was absolutely necessary for the fasciculation analysis because all axons must be labeled to detect non-self-fasciculations. We are able to do the growth rate and branch dynamics analyses on individual neurons using the stable transgenics because we can easily resolve individual neurons by following videos of axons growing over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explanation of axonal defects mechanistically:</p><p>– The impact of this paper would be most enhanced by characterizing the axonal trafficking of cellular cargos in klc4 mutants, particularly if defects in specific trafficked cargoes could plausibly explain the axonal defects. In the discussion of the paper, the authors note that they have previously found that endosomal trafficking regulates branching. Characterizing endosomal trafficking, as well as trafficking of mitochondria, lysosomes, golgi, etc, thus has the potential to make this study substantially more mechanistically satisfying.</p></disp-quote><p>We added new experiments to image endosomal dynamics (new Figure 8), trafficking of Rab5-labeled endosomes from the cell body to branch points (new Figure 8 —figure supplement 1), microtubule behavior during axon branching (new Figure 10), and acetylation of microtubules in nascent branches (new Figure 10). We chose Rab5-labeled endosomes because of our previous work showing a correlation between their transport and RB axon branching. Although the <italic>klc4</italic> mutants did not have a decrease in endosome delivery to branch points, high-speed imaging of vesicle dynamics revealed some alterations in transport of these vesicles in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants. These alterations in endosome transport are not likely to be the only effects of <italic>klc4</italic> mutation on cargo dynamics or to fully explain the mechanism by which KLC promotes branch stabilization. However, an exhaustive analysis of all potential cargos would require many months to years of work and is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The changes in microtubule dynamics of klc4 mutants are interesting, but how trafficking defects affect these dynamics, and how defects in MT dynamics affect branching, is unclear. To address how trafficking affects MTs, the authors could attempt to identify MTOCs in axons. For example, since golgi outposts are thought to be MTOCs, is their trafficking into axons affected by klc4 mutation? To address how MT defects affect branching, the authors could characterize MT dynamics during branching-for example, do mutants display any defects in the frequency of MT invasion into nascent branches?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to detect MTOCs using an antibody to γ tubulin, but that labeling in whole embryos has a very low signal to noise. It was not possible for us to detect signal above noise. We added new experiments analyzing microtubules in nascent branches (new Figure 10). We used live imaging with EB3-GFP to measure frequency of comets entering nascent branches. Although comet frequency in established axons is increased in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants, there is no difference in frequency of comets entering nascent branches, suggesting a relative decrease. We used anti-acetylated tubulin labeling to show that <italic>klc4</italic> mutants have fewer nascent branches with stable, acetylated tubulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Behavior:</p><p>– As mentioned above, the analyses of adult behavioral defects, while interesting and rigorously carried out, do not complement the morphological analysis in larval sensory neurons. It would be exciting if axonal arborization defects in a specific neuron type could be linked to behavioral defects. Could the authors attempt to characterize touch-response behaviors in larval fish? This would be a particularly exciting if it were possible to do cell-autonomous rescue experiments, thus directly testing if defects in sensory neuron morphology affect behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have now added larval touch response assays (Figure 11). We found that <italic>klc4</italic> mutant larvae showed increased number of swim bouts and longer duration swim runs after a touch stimulus, suggesting the mutant larvae are hypersensitive to touch. We added these data to Figure 11. We moved the data on adult body size and feeding behavior to Figure 11 —figure supplement 1. However, we kept the data on adult anxiety-like behavior in the main Figures 11 and 12. We believe these results will be of interest to the community and potentially useful as a new model to study stress response behaviors and circuits.</p></body></sub-article></article>
