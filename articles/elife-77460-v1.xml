with aging. Inhibition of the mitoribosome can be caused by off-target binding of antimicrobial drugs and was shown to be coupled with a bilateral decreased visual acuity. Previously, we reported mitochondria-specific protein aspects of the mitoribosome, and in this article we present a 2.4-Å resolution structure of the small subunit in a complex with the anti-tuberculosis drug streptomycin that reveals roles of non-protein components. We found iron–sulfur clusters that are coordinated by different mitoribosomal proteins, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) associated with rRNA insertion, and posttranslational modifications. This is the first evidence of inter-protein coordination of iron–sulfur, and the finding of iron–sulfur clusters and NAD as fundamental building blocks of the mitoribosome directly links to mitochondrial disease and aging. We also report details of streptomycin interactions, suggesting that the mitoribosome-bound streptomycin is likely to be in hydrated gem-diol form and can be subjected to other modifications by the cellular milieu. The presented approach of adding antibiotics to cultured cells can be used to define their native structures in a bound form under more physiological conditions, and since streptomycin is a widely used drug for treatment, the newly resolved features can serve as determinants for targeting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>mitoribosome</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>Fe–S cluster</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007459</institution-id><institution>Ragnar Söderbergs stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M44/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amunts</surname><given-names>Alexey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2018-StG-805230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amunts</surname><given-names>Alexey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018.0080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amunts</surname><given-names>Alexey</given-names></name><name><surname>Rorbach</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-term fellowship LTF-2020-606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Minh Duc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rorbach</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rorbach</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>H2020-MSCA-IF-2017</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>799399-Itohribo</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Itoh</surname><given-names>Yuzuru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>H2020-MSCA-ITN-2016</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural analysis of the mitoribosomal small subunit with streptomycin reveals the molecular basis for antibiotic binding and new physiological components such as FeS clusters that assemble between mitochondria specific proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human mitoribosome has a distinct structure, it receives mRNAs with involvement of Leucine-rich PPR-motif-containing protein (LRPPRC) and synthesizes 13 respiratory chain proteins delivered to the inner mitochondrial membrane via the OXA1L insertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). Cryo-EM has been instrumental in the structure determination of the mitoribosome, however, the description is currently limited to mitoribosomal proteins, rRNA, and associated factors, whereas important metabolic cofactors of potential therapeutic interest are largely excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aibara et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, dysfunction of the human mitoribosome can be caused by the off-target binding of antimicrobials to structured rRNA core that is similar to bacteria, which can lead to clinical symptoms of deafness, neuropathy, and myopathy. However, off-target binding studies are currently not incorporated in pharmaceutical companies’ research and development pipelines. The antimicrobial binding has also been used to suppress glioblastoma stem cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sighel et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that repurposing of mitoribosome-targeting antibiotics offers a therapeutic option for tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vendramin et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the structure-based design of molecules that bind RNA can be used to optimize physicochemical properties and has the potential of improving pharmacokinetics and potency.</p><p>The aminoglycoside streptomycin targets the ribosomal small subunit (SSU), but the therapy with streptomycin was also shown to be coupled with a bilateral decreased visual acuity with central scotomas and an altered mitochondrial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kogachi et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, patients carrying mitochondrial DNA mutations in the 12S rRNA gene, such as 1555A&gt;G or 1494C&gt;T are more prone to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). To minimize toxic off-target effects, the approaches based on in silico modeling employing high-resolution single-particle cryo-EM structures can be used. Although the sensitivity of mitoribosomes to antimicrobials has been documented, no detailed structural information elucidating specific molecular interactions is available, thus mechanistic details remain unknown.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, we set to solve the structure of complex of streptomycin with the mitoribosomal SSU at a resolution level that can detect cofactors and modifications in order to provide new structural information on potential mitoribosomal constituents. We explored fine structural elements of the antibiotic and determined unique features of the mitoribosome, such as iron–sulfur clusters positioned between different proteins, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and a new guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination</title><p>To characterize the binding under close to physiological conditions, we added streptomycin to cultured human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and not to any of the biochemical purification steps. This approach implies that the antimicrobial would have to be imported into mitochondria, and therefore has an advantage over in vitro complex formation (that we performed as a control), as more native inhibitory properties would be preserved. Mitochondria were isolated, and the mitoribosomal SSU was purified in the presence of 5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GMPPNP) and subjected to a cryo-EM analysis. Monosome and large subunit (LSU) particles were removed during 2D classification, and the remaining particles underwent 3D auto-refinement and 3D classification with local angular search with a solvent mask to remove poorly aligned particles. The resolution was further improved by applying contrast transfer function (CTF) refinement including beam-tilt, per-particle defocus, and per-micrograph astigmatism, followed by Bayesian polishing in RELION 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zivanov et al., 2020</xref>). Particles were then separated into multi-optics groups based on acquisition areas and the date of data collection. A second round of CTF refinement (beam-tilt, trefoil, and fourth-order aberrations, magnification anisotropy, per-particle defocus, per-micrograph astigmatism) was performed, followed by 3D auto-refinement. Finally, to improve the local resolution, local-masked 3D auto-refinements were systematically applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The resulting structure of the SSU with bound streptomycin was determined at 2.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This represents a substantial improvement of the X-ray crystal structures at 3.0–3.5 Å resolution of the in vitro formed complexes of streptomycin with <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demirci et al., 2013</xref>), as well as the previous cryo-EM structures at ~3 Å of the human mitochondrial SSU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khawaja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Itoh et al., 2022</xref>). The higher resolution allowed us to detect a possible modification of the bound streptomycin and previously unknown cofactor components of the mitoribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although compared to bacteria, human mitoribosomal rRNA is known for its substantial reduction in size, we detected and modelled a specific nucleotide insertion C1048 paralleled by a stabilizing tetraamine spermine (SPM) and NAD. Four other cofactors reported in our structure are: two iron–sulfur clusters (2Fe–2S), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the added GMPPNP. In addition, three protein modifications could be detected from the density.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM collection, processing, model

The positions of both clusters are correlated with rRNA reduction compared to the bacterial counterpart. We identified the clusters in two ordered densities, adjacent to sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues in four different mitoribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each of the clusters is composed of four atoms organized in a planar square, with two of the atoms bound by two cysteinyl S atoms of the mitoribosomal proteins. The map shows a weaker density in the center of the planar squares. Such a chemical arrangement corresponds to the 2Fe–2S cluster, where iron atoms with bridging sulfur atoms are coordinated by proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beinert et al., 1997</xref>). A unique feature of our structure is that both 2Fe–2S clusters are coordinated not by the same protein but by two different proteins, which is an unprecedented occurrence in any other known Fe–S systems.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Iron–sulfur clusters bridge mitoribosomal proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each of the two 2Fe–2S clusters is coordinated by mitochondria-specific components (red) from two different proteins.

The former forms a mitochondria-specific intersubunit protein–protein contact that contributes to sampling a larger conformational space than the bacterial counterpart. In <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> the binding of bS6:bS18 requires a formation of the central RNA domain first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agalarov et al., 2000</xref>), and therefore occurs during an advanced assembly process.

Despite being a peripheral mitoribosomal protein, the correct assembly of mS25 is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bugiardini et al., 2019</xref>), and mutations in its binding partner bS16m are associated with corpus callosum agenesia, hypotonia, and fatal neonatal lactic acidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we found another homolog of bS18m on the SSU: mitochondria-specific protein mS40.

Together, our observation of iron–sulfur clusters bridging between different proteins suggests a role in the mitoribosomal assembly, rather than a catalytic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NAD is associated with a single rRNA nucleotide insertion</title><p>Another notable feature of the map is the presence of two related densities associated with rRNA that we assigned as spermine and NAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the SSU-body, we found a spermine buried within the reduced rRNA core, bound to the rRNA h20. Surprisingly, despite the general conception that human mitochondrial rRNA only has large deletions, we found an insertion of the nucleotide C1048 in the mitochondrial genome. In the structure, the addition of this residue disrupts the base-paring that supports the h20 architecture, and the residues A1047 and C1048 are flipped out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Spermine is then inserted through h20 and contacts the backbone of C1048 for stabilization. Spermine forms salt bridges with the phosphate groups of U946, U1044, G1045, and C1048 and forms hydrogen bonds with the base moieties of U944 and G945. While polyamines, like spermine, are commonly found in ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zgadzay et al., 2022</xref>), we also detected an NAD at the same site, and both cooperatively compensate for the lack of internal rRNA interactions in this region as a result of the insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). NAD adopts a compact conformation, where its two base rings are stacked on each other. The adenine ring forms a base pair with U948 and is further stacked on A1046. NAD also interacts with A781, A782, A1047 (through Mg-ion coordination), and C1048 of rRNA and Tyr196 of uS15m. The density is suggestive that the ring may be a mixture of oxidized and reduced states, although the structure does not reveal whether it might have a regulatory function on the mitoribosome or affect the local environment.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spermine-NAD functionally compensates for rRNA and protein alterations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the spermine-NAD binding site with <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome (PDB ID: 7K00, white) shows that it provides structural stability that compensates for rRNA alterations.

To clarify its structure, we performed our studies in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog GMPPNP. Careful inspection of the map at the improved resolution revealed that the reported nucleotide pocket binds ATP with an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, and the previously modeled GDP was misassigned due to the limited resolution. Our argument is based on N6-amino and N1-imino groups of the adenine ring that form hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl and NH groups of Met100, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> ). This would be incompatible with guanine, since its O6-carbonyl and N1-amino groups impart repulsive interactions with the backbone carbonyl and NH groups of Met100, respectively (acceptor with acceptor and donor with donor). Therefore, this binding site does not seem to bear a functional GTPase activity, which is also consistent with a fungal mitoribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Itoh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Interactions of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), GMPPNP in mS29, and 1-methyl iso-aspartate in uS11m.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Interactions of the bound ATP with the surrounding residues of mS29.

The density is found in the hydrophobic cavity formed by Tyr173, Tyr208, Trp210, and Ile242, where it stabilizes a beta-hairpin (residues 208–216) on the top of mS29 in the SSU head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The local environment for the base specificity reveals that N1-amino and O6-carbonyl groups form hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH and carbonyl groups of Val209, respectively, while the N2-amino group forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl group of Val209 and the side chain carboxyl group of Asp238. The ribose moiety has hydrogen bonds with Asp238 and Asn292 and the phosphate groups have polar interactions with Tyr173, Arg177, Lys245, His291, and Lys295. Thus, the chemical environment and the density features suggest a separate GTP/GDP-binding pocket. The network of interactions indicates that GTP would be favored over GDP in the binding pocket, and this explains why the SSU has a high affinity for GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denslow et al., 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Protein modifications identified from the density</title><p>Some posttranslational chemical modifications of ribosomal proteins can be identified directly from the density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottilli et al., 2022</xref>), and our study reveals a mainchain modification 1-methyl-isoaspartate at position 184 in uS11m, and the N-terminal acetylations in bS21m and mS37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The density around Asn184 was incompatible with the placement of an asparagine residue as indicated by the primary sequence. Instead, an isoaspartate (iso-Asp) was modeled, so that the β-carbonyl group forms backbone peptide linkage with Gly185, and the α-carboxyl group is exposed, in agreement with the modification detected in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">David et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watson et al., 2020</xref>) and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottilli et al., 2022</xref>). Due to the elongated backbone peptide by one methylene group at the iso-Asp, the loop is kinked between His183 and iso-Asp184. This specific kinked loop interacts with rRNA h23–24, and thereby likely contributes to its stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, an additional density was observed continuous with an α-carboxyl oxygen atom, and thus it corresponds to a non-hydrogen atom, which led us to replace the isoaspartate with 1-methyl-isoaspartate that is known as a product of the enzyme <sc>L</sc>-isoaspartyl <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reissner and Aswad, 2003</xref>).

The density replacing the aldehyde group is within the hydrogen bonding distance of four phosphate groups of rRNA (C898, G899, A1166, and A1167).

We discovered distinct structural elements of the mitoribosome, including 2Fe–2S clusters and NAD. The comparison with bacteria allowed us to propose that 2Fe–2S clusters play a structural role, being organized between mitoribosomal proteins to stimulate a tighter association. This phenomenon likely reflects the importance of mechanical properties, such as the stability of newly added proteins in the regions where rRNA has been deleted during evolution. Therefore, the clusters facilitate protein complex formation to support the assembly of the human mitoribosome. Although there is evidence that iron–sulfur clusters contribute to the structural stability of the apoproteins into which they are integrated, the involvement in maintaining a complex of proteins was not reported before. It is unknown whether the facilitation of inter-protein interactions that we found is unique to the mitoribosome or represents a more general characteristic. One of the implications of our finding is that since iron–sulfur clusters are not stable in an aqueous solution without being bound to a protein, there might be yet to be characterized chaperones required for the assembly on the mitoribosome. Notably, the biogenesis of iron–sulfur complexes is associated with acyl carrier protein and fatty-acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Van Vranken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>), which we also previously identified as a component of the LSU assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, our data provide a potential regulatory link between the three main metabolic pathways in mitochondria: mitoribosomal biogenesis, iron–sulfur assembly and fatty-acid synthesis. In addition, the mitochondrial disease Friedreich’s ataxia that is caused by a depletion of an Fe–S cluster biogenesis factor, leads to deficit in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marmolino, 2011</xref>), which might also involve mitoribosomes.</p><p>The improved resolution also allowed us to identify and model an NAD, which is a metabolite the depletion of which has been proposed to promote aging and mitochondrial myopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pirinen et al., 2020</xref>). Apart from acting as an electron carrier in metabolic pathways, NAD is a co-substrate of several regulatory pathways, and its loss induces a pseudohypoxic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomes et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that its presence on the mitoribosome contributes to the rRNA stability, and thus might be important for mitochondria function. Among other newly found cofactors, we re-assign the previously modeled GDP to ATP with an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the mitoribosomal protein mS29. At the same time, based on the local chemical environment, we identified a new GTP/GDP-binding pocket. This provides essential structural information and an accurate model that in the future will help to further our understanding of GTP binding to the SSU and its consequences for the activity of the human mitoribosome.</p><p>Our structures detect specific water molecules and metal ions involved in the streptomycin coordination that exert its effects. The comparison between the two methods of adding the antibiotic (cultured cells vs. purified mitoribosome) allowed us to directly observe small differences in terms of hydration and a possible chirality inversion by the cellular milieu. The notion that hydrated aldehyde is present is supported by mass spectrometry analysis. These observations complement previous models of streptomycin-bound bacterial ribosomes and allow us to propose a refined model of binding that also includes alternative conformations. In addition, two alternative states of rRNA residues are found in the vicinity of the streptomycin site in the mRNA-binding region that is mechanistically important for the translation mechanism. Since our structures suggest those residues would lose their flexibility upon streptomycin association, this can explain the potential toxicity. Given that streptomycin is a drug that is used for the treatment of tuberculosis, these structural studies are informative for designing less-toxic drugs.</p><p>Overall, these findings demonstrate that high-resolution cryo-EM of native assemblies with therapeutic compounds combined with a mass spectrometry approach is a powerful method to address potential modifications and identify specifically bound cofactors. Conceptually, the approach of adding drugs to cultured cells to study their binding could be applied to other medically relevant subjects and antibacterial compounds. Here, we used streptomycin to study its off-target binding, and since the sensitivity of the mitoribosome can also be exploited to suppress leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skrtić et al., 2011</xref>) and glioblastoma stem cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sighel et al., 2021</xref>), advances in structure-based design can lead to specific RNA-targeted small molecules for cancer research as well. The presence of cofactors can also affect the activity or selectivity of a compound, thus more data will be needed to define mitoribosomal profiles in different conditions, especially in the context of mRNA and tRNAs. In addition, since cofactors such as polyamines are implicated in aging and regulation of mitochondrial metabolism, determining their roles on the LSU and under native, biologically relevant conditions will allow to better understand how the functions of mitoribosome might be modulated. The disease phenotypes associated with mitoribosomes still remain poorly understood, yet high-resolution cryo-EM of native samples underscores the importance of modifications and cofactors, and thus defining their structural principles will help to better understand the related pathological dysfunctions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample preparation for native SSU–streptomycin complex</title><p>Flp-In T-Rex human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cell line (Invitrogen) was cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khawaja et al., 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tristan I Croll (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the manuscript, the authors present both a streptomycin-bound mitochondrial small subunit as well as an apo-subunit structure (Figure 1c). However, there is no description of the structural determination for the unbound state in either the methods or Table 1. The authors should add this information. This also raises the question of whether the short format captures all that these structures can provide. Considering the size of these complexes and the dramatically improved resolution, surely there must be some other observations worthy of mention.</p><p>2) There are some questions about the interpretation of the density for the streptose ring. Although the overall density strongly supports the presence of bound streptomycin, the map does not convincingly support the proposed hydrated aldehyde within the streptomycin streptose moiety. While the claim that the poor density may reflect increased mobility of the hydrated aldehyde as the authors suggest is completely reasonable (and is supported by previously published NMR data), this would need to be independently validated given the ambiguity in the map. The authors could also cite two high-resolution crystal structures containing streptomycin (6fux and 5luh), which both show strong extra density consistent with the gem-diol form. A structure of streptomycin added in vitro to the mitochondrial small subunit would resolve whether the added molecule is indeed modified by the cellular milieu. While the authors suggest that adding the streptomycin to cultured cells rather than in vitro is an advantage of the work, the disadvantage is that it generates uncertainty that has not been resolved by the cryo-EM map alone about the chemical nature of the bound compound. The density might also be consistent with a potassium ion, for example.</p><p>A second issue with the streptose ring is the density surrounding the methyl group. The map is of high enough quality to suggest that it is possible that the stereochemistry for the methyl group has been inverted, possibly by an enzymatic activity within the cells. However, the map is not unambiguous in this regard. The reviewers think the authors would be justified in noting the possible change in stereochemistry as an alternative interpretation of the density.</p><p>3) The precise source of the streptomycin used in the study is not currently stated in the text. It is not clear if the compound was subjected to detailed mass spectrometry analysis to validate the composition assumed by the authors and to identify any potential chemical heterogeneity. This is an important control given the unexpected findings with the streptose ring in the structure.</p><p>Below are other itemized questions and comments from the reviewers for your consideration:<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Density for the O6&quot; supports modeling two rotamers (Figure 1d, left), one like in the published structure, and the second as modeled here.</p><p>2. The modeling in Figure 1d to the right is really hard to follow, the way the figure is laid out.</p><p>3. The authors should show the density for the K71 interaction, as it is quite clear in the map, and would give the reader a sense of the map quality, with respect to the interactions.</p><p>4. Line 73 p. 3, Instead of shoulder, use body-shoulder junction?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– In the introduction, it is mentioned that mutation of C1494 to T increases susceptibility to streptomycin toxicity. The very strong excess density seeming to extend the base of A1492 (and to a lesser extent C1493) therefore seems to me to be in need of discussion (and ideally explanation). Given the spectacular local resolution it doesn't seem to be a simple artifact (and I note that there is more-or-less identical density associated with the same base in 6rw4) – is there any known evidence for modification at this base? I considered the possibility of an alternate conformation of the adjacent A1558, but (a) this clearly didn't fit the density, and (b) the excess density appears more contiguous with A1492 than with the complementary strand. I think some more careful evaluation of this site would not go astray.</p><p>– Much clearer in diagnosis, but less clear in terms of relevance: the base C931 (modelled stacking against Tyr31 of chain N) has a very clear alternate configuration that instead stacks against A1137 (a roughly 150 degree flip around the backbone). Considering that it is reasonably close (~25Å) to the bound streptomycin there may be some significance to this, but of course that is very difficult to speculate on.</p><p>– I found a small handful of what I believe are incorrect rotamers (Thr 4:492, His X:154, His H:147, His R:247, Arg N73). None of these are critical to interpretation of the model, but if you're feeling enthusiastic it might be worth revisiting them.</p><p>– Figure 1d: I think colour assignments in the caption are wrong (looks like this model is green, previous models are purple and cyan)?</p><p>– Page 9, line 203: &quot;phenix.real_space_refine&quot;, not &quot;phenix.real_space_refinement&quot;</p><p>– Various small language issues (e.g. on line 19: &quot;Inhibition of the human mitoribosome…&quot;; line 24: &quot;we report a 2.23Å resolution structure…&quot;; etc.). None of this actually affects interpretation, in my opinion.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It would help the reader if the authors could highlight in the main text what they consider are the key methodological innovations in their study that allowed them to generate such a high resolution map of the mitochondrial small subunit compared to the previously published studies.</p><p>2. Please clarify the source of the streptomycin used and what quality control assessment was made for the molecule.</p><p>3. To support the claim that a chemical modification has been introduced into the exogenously added streptomycin with the cell, the authors should either repeat the analysis using in vitro added streptomycin or try to obtain mass spectrometry data comparing the bound versus added form of the streptomycin.</p><p>4. Please improve the quality of Figure 1 to allow the reader to clearly distinguish the current model from the bacterial complexes. I find the presentation confusing. For example, the pink color is unexplained in the legend. On the left panel, which one is the current structure (green and cyan are stated to be bacterial in the legend)?</p><p>5. At least some discussion of the rest of the mitochondrial small subunit structure would be welcomed given the high resolution of the current mitochondrial small subunit map.</p><p>6. Line 86 &quot;the previously modeled aldehyde&quot;-modeled by whom? Please add a reference.</p><p>7. Does the structure explain why &quot;patients carrying mtDNA mutations in the 12S rRNA gene, such as 1555A&gt;G or 1494C&gt;T more prone to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity&quot; (line 49)? Please discuss.</p><p>8. Line 20: &quot;Inhibition of human mitoribosome can be caused by antimicrobial off-target binding, which leads to clinical appearances&quot;. This is an example illustrating how the text would benefit from better clarity in the writing.</p><p>9. Given the high quality of the map, it is surprising that there is no discussion about the remainder of the mitochondrial small subunit, including ligands/spermine listed in Table 1. What is the rationale for GMPPNP and ATP, which are listed as ligands in Table 1?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77460.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the manuscript, the authors present both a streptomycin-bound mitochondrial small subunit as well as an apo-subunit structure (Figure 1c).

The density might also be consistent with a potassium ion, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we performed cryo-EM analysis of the in vitro bound streptomycin, as suggested. For this, the purified SSU (150 nM) was incubated with streptomycin solution (~600 µM) (Thermo Fisher, 15140122) for 30 min at room temperature to form the complex, before the sample was applied to the carbon coated grids for cryo-EM analysis. The resulting structure of the SSU with in vitro bound streptomycin was determined at 2.3 Å nominal resolution. As suggested by Reviewers, the streptose moiety is resolved better than in the native structure. Particularly, the density around the aldehyde moiety is branched and supports the modeling of one stabilized rotamer with the oxygen atoms within hydrogen bond distance from backbone phosphates of rRNA residues G898, G899, A1166 and A1167 and an adjacent water molecule. This indicates that the aldehyde is in the hydrated gem-diol state and participates in the potential interactions.</p><p>A section presenting the new data has been added on lines 255-282 and in Figure 3D. It has been further expanded in the Discussion section on page 12.</p><p>The cryo-EM of the in vitro bound streptomycin is shown in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><p>The comparison with X-ray electron density maps of the streptomycin bound to adenylyltransferase AadA (PDB: 5LUH, Stern et al., 2018) and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3″)-Id (PDB: 6FUX, Alekseeva et al., 2019) is discussed on lines 245-251 and shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second issue with the streptose ring is the density surrounding the methyl group.

This information has now been added on page 9, lines 236-239: “The density surrounding the methyl group also suggests the stereochemistry for the methyl group might have been inverted, possibly by enzymatic activity within cells, however the map quality is not unambiguous in this region”; on lines 263-264: “Unlike in the native structure, the streptose moiety is well resolved, and no chirality flip is observed around the methyl group”; and the data is shown in Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The precise source of the streptomycin used in the study is not currently stated in the text. It is not clear if the compound was subjected to detailed mass spectrometry analysis to validate the composition assumed by the authors and to identify any potential chemical heterogeneity. This is an important control given the unexpected findings with the streptose ring in the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm the chemical structure of the streptomycin, we now also performed mass-spectrometry analysis using a dual jet stream electrospray ion source operating in positive ion mode. The data is presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and shows that the mass to charge ratio is consistent with the cryo-EM analysis of in vitro bound streptomycin displaying the highest peak at ~600.28, which corresponds to the hydrated gem-diol form, and a less-abundant peak at ~582.2, which corresponds to the exact m/z of streptomycin. This suggests that both forms of soluble streptomycin, hydrated and non-hydrated are retained in solution. The results are now described on page 10, lines 271-278, and the corresponding Methods section is on page 26, lines 569-594.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Thus, the middle panel shows the overview superposition of our structure with the previous model of streptomycin-bound T. thermophilus ribosome (Demirci et al., 2013, PDBID: 4DR3). The left panel has been replaced with a zoom-in to show alternative conformations of O6&quot; N-methyl-L-glucosamine. The right panel shows a zoom-in to the methyl with its chemically more favorable conformation with the amino group at the 2″ position (protonated secondary amine), forming two hydrogen bonds/salt bridges with two backbone phosphates of rRNA. We hope the new illustration clarifies the data and also resolves discrepancies of the methyl-group orientation in the previous study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should show the density for the K71 interaction, as it is quite clear in the map, and would give the reader a sense of the map quality, with respect to the interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 5—figure supplement 1 that shows the densities of all the elements involved in streptomycin interactions, including the requested K71. In this figure, the bound streptomycin is shown as a model, and the interacting SSU region that forms the binding pocket is shown as a model with density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Particularly, we found that A1558 is flipped out in one state, whereas its base is stacked between G1559 and A1492 in the other state, thus causing a shift of the residues in the other strand. Since this feature indicates a flexibility that might be related to recruitment of mRNA for translation, a possible mechanistic insight from our work is that by directly interacting with A1555 and C1556 on the mitoribosome, the streptomycin binding decreases that flexibility, and thus results in an enhanced translation inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Much clearer in diagnosis, but less clear in terms of relevance: the base C931 (modelled stacking against Tyr31 of chain N) has a very clear alternate configuration that instead stacks against A1137 (a roughly 150 degree flip around the backbone).

Please improve the quality of Figure 1 to allow the reader to clearly distinguish the current model from the bacterial complexes. I find the presentation confusing.

Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for encouraging us to expand on the medically related theme, as this aspect of the study is indeed important. We added an analysis of the structural basis for streptomycin toxicity with respect to the mutations 1494C&gt;T and 1555A&gt;G in h44 of the rRNA on lines 292-304. Particularly, the human mitochondrial rRNA appears to be more flexible in this region due to a loss of the G:C base-pair at the 1494:1555 position. The mutations then introduce Watson-Crick base pairs that limit the rRNA local flexibility and resemble the corresponding binding site in bacteria. Our density indicates two alternative states in this region, and previously this feature was reported in the context of recruitment of mRNA for translation (Khawaja et al., 2020). Thus, a possible mechanistic insight from our work is that by directly interacting with A1555 and C1556 on the mitoribosome, the streptomycin binding decreases that flexibility, and thus results in an enhanced translation inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
