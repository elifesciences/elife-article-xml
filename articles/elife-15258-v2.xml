of deafness. Using a forward genetic screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we identified an E3 ligase, Ubr3, as an essential gene for auditory organ development. Ubr3 negatively regulates the mono-ubiquitination of non-muscle Myosin II, a protein associated with hearing loss in humans. The mono-ubiquitination of Myosin II promotes its physical interaction with Myosin VIIa, a protein responsible for Usher syndrome type IB. We show that <italic>ubr3</italic> mutants phenocopy pathogenic variants of Myosin II and that Ubr3 interacts genetically and physically with three Usher syndrome proteins. The interactions between Myosin VIIa and Myosin IIa are conserved in the mammalian cochlea and in human retinal pigment epithelium cells. Our work reveals a novel mechanism that regulates protein complexes affected in two forms of syndromic deafness and suggests a molecular function for Myosin IIa in auditory organs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15258.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15258.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15258.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Over half of the world’s population has hearing loss by the age of 65, and inherited forms of deafness are responsible for many of the hearing impairments in newborn children. Because the auditory organs that enable insects and mammals to hear work in similar ways, we have learnt a lot about genetic forms of deafness from identifying faulty genes in humans and mice, and studying their effects in model organisms.</p><p>Sensory cells in the inner ear respond to sound by detecting vibrations in the air and converting them into electrical impulses. A family of motor proteins called myosins play key roles in this conversion process. Mutations in the gene that produces one of these proteins, called myosin VIIa, cause an inherited deaf-blind disorder called Usher syndrome. Mutations in the gene for another type of myosin protein, called myosin II, also cause disorders associated with hearing loss, but it is not clear how they produce such effects.</p><p>Li et al. have used <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit flies to explore the role of myosin proteins in hearing by looking for genes that prevent the insect's auditory organ from developing or working properly. The search identified one gene called E3 ubiquitin ligase (<italic>ubr3</italic>), which is required for the auditory organ to develop normally and had not previously been implicated in deafness. Mutating the <italic>ubr3</italic> gene caused a defect similar to that seen for mutations in the gene that produces the fruit fly equivalent of myosin VIIa.</p><p>Through genetic and biochemical studies, Li et al. found that in the fruit flies, myosin VIIa interacts with myosin II. This interaction is regulated by a chemical modification of myosin II that is controlled by <italic>ubr3</italic>. Li et al. showed that the equivalent mammalian proteins display the same behaviour in the cells of mammals. Therefore, mutations that affect myosin II alter how the protein interacts with myosin VIIa, which explains why myosin II is associated with deafness in humans.</p><p>In addition, Li et al. found that three other proteins that have been shown to cause Usher syndrome in humans have equivalents in flies and play a role in fly hearing. This will allow the <italic>Drosophila</italic> auditory organ to be further developed as a model system for future studies of deafness genes, and should provide insights into how specific genes are required for proper hearing in mammals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15258.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15258.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Myosin</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>hearing</kwd><kwd>Usher syndrome</kwd><kwd>MYH9 disorder</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC010362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eberl</surname><given-names>Daniel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC010987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Andrew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellen</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mechanism links two myosins associated with deafness in auditory organs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanosensory receptor cells have organelles derived from modified cilia or microvilli that contain protein complexes dedicated to the detection of, and adaptation to, mechanical force. Myosins, a family of eukaryotic actin-dependent motor proteins, play key roles in the assembly and function of mechanosensory protein complexes. In humans, pathogenic variants of six different myosin genes cause syndromic and non-syndromic deafness, and in many cases these myosins regulate either the assembly of the mechanotransduction apparatus of sensory hair cells, or constitute an integral part of the mechanotransduction complex itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petit and Richardson, 2009</xref>). For example, Myosin VIIa is a motor protein present in the tips of hair cell stereocilia where mechanotransduction occurs but it is also present in the cuticular plate that is important for the growth and stability of the stereociliary hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>). Pathogenic variants of MYO7A, the human homologue of <italic>myosin VIIa</italic>, can cause Usher syndrome, the leading cause of deaf-blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet and El-Amraoui, 2012</xref>), as well as the non-syndromic forms of deafness DFNA11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 1997</xref>) and DFNB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weil et al., 1997</xref>). Dominant mutations in <italic>MYH9</italic>, which encodes Myosin IIa, cause a number of syndromes which are now grouped as '<italic>MYH9</italic>-related disorders' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seri et al., 2003</xref>). Many <italic>MYH9</italic>-related disorder patients exhibit sensorineural deafness, and variants of <italic>MYH9</italic> have also been reported in non-syndromic deafness DFNA17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalwani et al., 2000</xref>). However, the cellular basis of deafness in pathogenic variants of <italic>MYH9</italic> is unclear as MYH9 is widely expressed within the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Etournay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalwani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer Zum Gottesberge and Hansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mhatre et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>One approach to identifying new genes that regulate the development and function of mechanosensory organs is to exploit the power of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to conduct forward genetic screens. The auditory organ of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> Johnston’s organ, is localized in the second antennal segment. Johnston’s organ responds to near-field sound, gravity and wind flow transduced by motion of the third antennal segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boekhoff-Falk and Eberl, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gopfert and Robert, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). Although the organs and cells that mediate hearing in vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic> are morphologically different, they share a striking evolutionary conservation of molecular and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert and Gopfert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boekhoff-Falk and Eberl, 2014</xref>). The transcriptional cascades that control key aspects of chordotonal development in flies and hair cell development in vertebrates are regulated by conserved transcription factors, such as the Atonal/Atoh1 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jarman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, myosins such as Myosin VIIa, encoded by the gene <italic>crinkled</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, that function in mammalian hair cell mechanotransduction, are also conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and are required for hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Todi et al., 2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2008</xref>). Therefore, other molecular pathways and regulatory protein partners that function in hearing are also likely to be shared between insects and vertebrates.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel ubiquitination pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that functions to regulate the activity and physical interaction of two proteins implicated in deafness, Myosin II and Myosin VIIa. We identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase, <italic>ubr3</italic>, from a collection of lethal mutations on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haelterman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>), whose loss of function causes morphological defects in the Johnston’s organ. Ubr3 negatively regulates the mono-ubiquitination of Myosin II and modulates Myosin II-Myosin VIIa interactions, which are required for normal development of Johnston’s organ. We show that <italic>ubr3</italic> mutations are phenotypically similar to known pathogenic variants of Myosin II and that Ubr3 physically and genetically interacts with <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologues of the Usher syndrome proteins Protocadherin 15 (Pcdh15) and Sans. We also show that Myosin IIa interacts with Myosin VIIa in the mouse cochlea and human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Our study reveals a novel conserved ubiquitination pathway in the auditory organs of flies and mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A forward genetic screen identifies Ubr3, an E3 ligase necessary for correct morphological development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> auditory organ</title><p>Johnston’s organ is a large chordotonal organ located in the second antennal segment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

One potential mechanism is that Ubr3 may negatively regulate a second ubiquitin ligase complex that in turn mono-ubiquitinates Myo II. We tested the expression of widely expressed E3 ligase, Cullin1, a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deshaies, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2005</xref>), and found that it is strongly up-regulated in <italic>ubr3</italic> mutant clones in imaginal discs. We observed a similar up-regulation of Cul1 in <italic>ubr3</italic> mutant cells in Johnston’s organ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that Ubr3 negatively regulates Cul1. To test if Cul1 was also implicated in scolopidial attachment, we over-expressed Cul1 in wild-type cells and found that it recapitulated the apical detachment of scolopidia that was seen in <italic>ubr3</italic> and <italic>myoVIIa</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,F</xref>). This suggests that increased Cul1 expression is likely to cause scolopidial detachment in <italic>ubr3</italic> mutant clones. In addition, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of Cul1 produced a similar detachment of scolopidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,F</xref>). The observation that both gain- and loss-of-function of Cul1 produce the same specific detachment phenotype in Johnston’s organ implies that a critical range of Cul1 activity or level is necessary for its proper function. To test if other components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, SkpA and Roc1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noureddine et al., 2002</xref>), affect scolopidial attachment we performed RNAi experiments and also observed detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

Thus, it is possible that phosphorylation and ubiquitination function respectively as an 'accelerator' and 'brake' for MyoII activity. Our data suggests that ubiquitination of MyoII is regulated by multiple E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’</xref>), in which Ubr3 negatively regulates the Cul1-SCF complex directly or indirectly. This complex probably regulates an E3 ligase that directly ubiquitinates MyoII.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15258.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A novel ubiquitination pathway regulates MyoII-MyoVIIa interactions in the auditory sensory organs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, MyoVIIa and MyoII are present in the apical regions of scolopidia of Johnston’s organ and are enriched in the tips of the scolopale cells where they contact the cap cell.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The E3 ligase Ubr3 regulates Usher syndrome and <italic>MYH9</italic> disorder proteins in the auditory organs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, K VijayRaghavan, is a member of our editorial board and also oversaw the process as Senior editor. Andrew Jarman (peer reviewer) has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript makes a significant advance in our knowledge of the proteins that underlie USH1 (Usher Syndrome type I), which function in mammalian auditory mechanotransduction. Strikingly and unexpectedly, convincing evidence is provided that these proteins are not only conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but also their interactions are important for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> auditory apparatus. The significance of this is that it establishes <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model for future general understanding of USH1's role in mechanotransduction.</p><p>In addition, evidence is provided for a role for ubiquitination of <italic>myoII</italic> as a key step in regulating USH1 interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Although the roles of various E3 ligases in this is clearly not straightforward, the overall conclusion appears sound and this represents a useful mechanistic advance. Importantly, this ubiquitination appears to be conserved in mammals, although this is mostly on the basis of experiments in an ARPE-19 cell line.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One general important comment is that this potential conservation of mechanism (which strongly implies its importance) would be further substantially strengthened if the 'smoking gun' of ubiquitinated mammalian MyoII could be detected (e.g. by IP) in the cells or in the cochlea. However, the data as currently presented will clearly be a trigger for future studies in mammals.</p><p>In addition, we have some specific experimental suggestions to that can bolster conclusions made on the mechanisms of action. The authors should decide which can be done speedily to strengthen the conclusions of this study. While points 1 and 2 (below) are straightforward fly genetics if the directions suggested are embarked upon, we do appreciate that they may not be doable in the 8 weeks’ time we would like to see for resubmission (unless the authors have already embarked on these directions). The authors may want to consider other speedier experimental directions or make a case why the current data suffices. In other words, while we would like more data on this front, we are prepared to be convinced by other compelling experiments or arguments.</p><p>Specific points to be addressed.</p><p>1) The Ubr3 and SCF regulate indirectly the mono-ubiquitination of Myosin II and the interaction with Myosin VIIa. The involvement of E3 ligase activity of Ubr3 could be addressed more directly such as by making specific point mutations.</p><p>2) The effect of mono-ubiquitination on Myosin II does not appear strong in the assay used. One way to resolve this is to identify the ubiquitination site and test its effects.</p><p>3) Myosin II and Myosin VIIa do not seem colocalized while using mammalian cells, which is difficult to reconcile with the fly results. Also whether the dis-localization on stress fiber in UBR3 knockdown is due to the absence of stress fibers or due to mislocalization is not clear.</p><p>4) It is not clear whether human-mimetic mutations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are related to UBR3 regulation or Myosin VIIa interaction. Examining their mono-ubiquitination status and interaction could resolve this.</p><p>5) While including Cad99C and Sans to describe the phenotypes and interaction with Cul1, Myosin VIIa and UBR are nice, it is not clear how these components could be put together to delineate a significant mechanism? For example, are they substrates for ubiquitination by Ubr3 or SCF?

However, the data as currently presented will clearly be a trigger for future studies in mammals.</italic></p><p>In response to this comment, we purified MyoIIa from ARPE-19 cells through immuno-precipitation and detected the mono-ubiquitinated form of MyoIIa using the FK2 antibody in ARPE-19 cells. This data is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>.</p><p><italic>In addition, we have some specific experimental suggestions to that can bolster conclusions made on the mechanisms of action. The authors should decide which can be done speedily to strengthen the conclusions of this study. While points 1 and 2 (below) are straightforward fly genetics if the directions suggested are embarked upon, we do appreciate that they may not be doable in the 8 weeks’ time we would like to see for resubmission (unless the authors have already embarked on these directions). The authors may want to consider other speedier experimental directions or make a case why the current data suffices. In other words, while we would like more data on this front, we are prepared to be convinced by other compelling experiments or arguments.</italic> </p><p><italic>Specific points to be addressed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The Ubr3 and SCF regulate indirectly the mono-ubiquitination of Myosin II and the interaction with Myosin VIIa. The involvement of E3 ligase activity of Ubr3 could be addressed more directly such as by making specific point mutations.</italic> </p><p>To address this comment, we generated transgenic flies with an E3 ligase dead form of Ubr3 to assess if this mutant version rescues the scolopidial detachment in <italic>ubr3</italic> mutant clones in the Johnston’s organ. This E3 ligase dead form has no E3 ligase activity (Li et al., 2016). We now show that this E3 dead form of Ubr3 fails to rescue the detachment phenotype in <italic>ubr3</italic> mutant cells while the wild type Ubr3 rescues the phenotype. This provides further evidence that the ligase activity is indeed necessary for its function in the auditory organ. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The effect of mono-ubiquitination on Myosin II does not appear strong in the assay used. One way to resolve this is to identify the ubiquitination site and test its effects.</italic> </p><p>Although this is an excellent point, and we are planning to do these experiments, it will require a mass-spec experiment, a mutagenesis experiment, creating transgenes, and testing their phenotype to address this question. This is likely to take about 5-6 months. Hence, we cannot provide the answer to this question.</p><p><italic>3) Myosin II and Myosin VIIa do not seem colocalized while using mammalian cells, which is difficult to reconcile with the fly results. Also whether the dis-localization on stress fiber in UBR3 knockdown is due to the absence of stress fibers or due to mislocalization is not clear.</italic> </p><p>We are confused by this comment as we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that most MyoVIIa and MyoIIa co-localize in the stress fiber (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and in cytosolic punta in the ARPE-19 cells (solid arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We agree that some MyoVIIa proteins do not co-localize with MyoIIa in the peri-nuclear region (empty arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To address whether the dis-localization of MyoIIa on stress fiber in UBR3 knockdown cells is due to the absence of stress fibers or due to mis-localization, we stained ARPE-19 cells transfected with UBR3 siRNA or treated with Bleb with phalloidin, which label the stress fibers. We show that the stress fibers are decreased in the UBR3 knock-down cells or in the cells treated with Bleb, suggesting that stress fiber formation is affected in these cells. The data is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) It is not clear whether human-mimetic mutations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are related to UBR3 regulation or Myosin VIIa interaction. Examining their mono-ubiquitination status and interaction could resolve this.</italic> </p><p>To address these questions we first tried to express the mutant MyoII proteins in the proper cells and at the proper time, essentially mimicking the endogenous expression profile of MyoII. To this end we generated a <italic>myoII</italic>-T2AGal4 in which the coding sequence of Gal4 is inserted into an intron of <italic>myoII</italic>. This abolishes gene function but now permits Gal4 expression under control of the endogenous regulatory elements of the locus. Using this Gal4 driver we expressed wild type MyoII as well as the different MyoII variants. Expression of the wild MyoII did not cause any obvious defects and the animals were viable. However, expression of the MyoII pathogenic variants caused early larval lethality. This is consistent with a dominant toxic effect of MyoII variants. To bypass the lethality, we used <italic>ey</italic>-Gal4 to express the pathogenic variants of MyoII or wild type MyoII in eye-antennal discs and performed IP to assess their interactions with MyoVIIa. We found that MyoII<sup>D1847K</sup> exhibited an increased interaction with MyoVIIa when compared to wild type MyoII. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. The data for the other three are either not changed or there is a decrease in their interaction. However, we were not able to purify enough MyoII protein using <italic>ey</italic>-Gal4 to detect the ubiquitination of MyoII (too little tissue). Hence, we cannot assess if the ubiquitination of MyoII variants are affected.</p><p><italic>5) While including Cad99C and Sans to describe the phenotypes and interaction with Cul1, Myosin VIIa and UBR are nice, it is not clear how these components could be put together to delineate a significant mechanism? For example, are they substrates for ubiquitination by Ubr3 or SCF? This point could be addressed in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“It is interesting that Ubr3 and Cul1 can bind to a complex containing MyoVIIa, Cad99C and Sans in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. It is possible that Ubr3, Cul1 and the unknown E3 ligase that mono-ubiquitinates MyoII all interact in a protein complex, and that the Usher proteins Cad99C or Sans may facilitate ubiquitination of MyoII or may be ubiquitinated themselves.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
