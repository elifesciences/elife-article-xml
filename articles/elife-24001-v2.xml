deacylase (DTD) to discriminate between D-amino acids and achiral glycine. The consequent Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> ‘misediting paradox’ is resolved by EF-Tu in the cell. Here, we show that DTD’s active site architecture can efficiently edit mischarged Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species four orders of magnitude more efficiently than even AlaRS, the only ubiquitous cellular checkpoint known for clearing the error. Also, DTD knockout in AlaRS editing-defective background causes pronounced toxicity in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> even at low-glycine levels which is alleviated by alanine supplementation. We further demonstrate that DTD positively selects the universally invariant tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>-specific G3•U70. Moreover, DTD’s activity on non-cognate Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is conserved across all bacteria and eukaryotes, suggesting DTD’s key cellular role as a glycine deacylator. Our study thus reveals a hitherto unknown function of DTD in cracking the universal mechanistic dilemma encountered by AlaRS, and its physiological importance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24001.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24001.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made up of many different building blocks called amino acids, which are linked together in chains. The exact order of amino acids in a protein chain is important for the protein to work properly. When a cell makes proteins, molecules known as transfer ribonucleic acids (or tRNAs for short) bind to specific amino acids to guide them to the growing protein chains in the correct order.</p><p>Most amino acids – except one called glycine – have two forms that are mirror images of one another, known as left-handed (L-amino acids) and right-handed (D-amino acids). However, only L-amino acids and glycine are used to make proteins. This is because of the presence of multiple quality control checkpoints in the cell that prevent D-amino acids from being involved. One such checkpoint is an enzyme called D-amino acid deacylase (DTD), which removes D-amino acids that are attached to tRNAs.</p><p>Other enzymes are responsible for linking a particular amino acid to its correct tRNA. Along with mistaking D-amino acids for L-amino acids, these enzymes can also make errors when they have to distinguish between amino acids that are similar in shape and size. For example, the enzyme that attaches L-alanine to its tRNA can also mistakenly attach larger L-serine or smaller glycine to it instead. Previous research has shown that attaching L-serine to this tRNA can lead to neurodegeneration in mice, whereas attaching glycine does not seem to cause any harm. It is not clear why this is the case.</p><p>Pawar et al. investigated how incorrectly attaching glycine or L-serine to the tRNA that usually binds to L-alanine affects a bacterium called <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The experiments show that, if the mistake is not corrected, glycine can be just as harmful to the cells as L-serine. The reason that glycine appears to be less of a problem is that the DTD enzyme is able to remove glycine, but not L-serine, from the tRNA. Further experiments show that DTD can play a similar role in a variety of organisms from bacteria to mammals.</p><p>The findings of Pawar et al. extend the role of DTD beyond preventing D-amino acids from being incorporated into proteins. The next step is to understand the role of this enzyme in humans and other multicellular organisms, especially in the context of nerve cells, where it is present at high levels.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24001.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24001.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>genetic code</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>chirality</kwd><kwd>tRNA synthetase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12th Five Year Plan Project BSC0113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sankaranarayanan</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JC Bose Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sankaranarayanan</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centre of Excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sankaranarayanan</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pawar</surname><given-names>Komal Ishwar</given-names></name><name><surname>Routh</surname><given-names>Satya Brata</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Associateship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suma</surname><given-names>Katta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INSPIRE Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuncha</surname><given-names>Santosh Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Along with preventing D-amino acids from being incorporated into proteins, D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase clears achiral glycine that is incorrectly attached to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) is a key factor that keeps chiral errors away from the translational machinery by allowing only L-amino acids to form proteins and has therefore been implicated in perpetuation of homochirality in the protein world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calendar and Berg, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soutourina et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2000</xref>). The design principle by which this remarkable configurational specificity is achieved by DTD involves only strict L-chiral rejection, rather than D-chiral selection. An invariant cross-subunit Gly-<italic>cis</italic>Pro motif forms the structural and mechanistic basis for DTD’s enantioselection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the architecture of DTD’s chiral proofreading site is such that it cannot prevent misediting of achiral glycine charged on tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and seems to have an inherent flaw. The glycine ‘misediting paradox’ is, however, effectively resolved through protection of the cognate achiral substrate by elongation factor thermo unstable (EF-Tu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Routh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While occasional chiral errors that occur during aminoacylation are cleared by DTD to ensure the accuracy of aminoacyl-tRNAs present in the cellular pool, a major role is played by editing functions associated with about half of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to rectify the incorrect pairing of a similar non-cognate L-amino acid with a tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Schimmel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibba and Soll, 2000</xref>). These aaRSs can edit the non-cognate amino acid at the aminoacylation site itself after the amino acid has been activated (i.e. formation of aminoacyl-AMP using ATP as a substrate) but prior to its transfer to the tRNA (pre-transfer editing). Alternatively, proofreading can happen at a distinct editing site after the activated non-cognate amino acid has been esterified with the tRNA (post-transfer editing). These proofreading processes are so crucial that even mild defects can lead to adverse cellular outcomes like cell growth retardation, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullwinkle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karkhanis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korencic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moghal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nangle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roy et al., 2004</xref>), although a compromise in editing can also be beneficial as it helps the organism to tide over stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moghal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Being comparatively small and similar to the cognate alanine, glycine and serine are misactivated by alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) at significantly high frequencies of 1/240 and 1/500, respectively, relative to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsui and Fersht, 1981</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, these misactivation rates are much higher than the overall error rates of ~10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup> observed during protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</xref>). Once (mis)activated, these non-cognate amino acids are mischarged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by AlaRS. This creates a unique mechanistic challenge for the editing domain of AlaRS, which has to specifically remove two non-cognate amino acids—the larger serine and the smaller glycine—attached to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> without acting on the cognate alanine, which is intermediate in size between serine and glycine. This 3.5-billion-year-old double-discrimination problem is shown to be unavoidable for AlaRS in all forms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). It has also been shown that serine mischarging on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is detrimental to the cell and even a mild deficiency in the proofreading activity of AlaRS leads to cell death and severe neuropathologies in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The problem is so severe that several standalone <italic>trans</italic>-editing modules (collectively called AlaXs), which are homologous to AlaRS <italic>cis</italic>-editing domain, have come into being. However, these <italic>trans</italic>-editing factors are not ubiquitously present; their distribution is more in archaea than in eukaryotes and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Schimmel, 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, only archaeal AlaXs are known to clear both Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahel et al., 2003</xref>); eukaryotic AlaXs have been shown to act as cellular redundancies to edit only Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2009</xref>), whereas biochemical activity of bacterial AlaXs is yet to be probed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These findings corroborated the notion that only serine mischarging by AlaRS poses the major threat to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mischarging by AlaRS.</title><p>AlaRS activates and charges alanine (<bold>A</bold>) to form cognate Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> which is routed for protein synthesis. In this process, AlaRS also misactivates glycine (G) and serine (S) at frequencies of 1 per 240 alanine and 1 per 500 alanine, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsui and Fersht, 1981</xref>). The two non-cognate amino acids are then charged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> to produce Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species, with glycine mischarging being nearly twice that of serine. Since AlaRS does not distinguish much between Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> while clearing the two, higher levels of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> might accumulate in the cell. However, there are additional free-standing <italic>trans-</italic>editing factors called AlaX (found in all domains of life but not in all organisms), which are known to edit mainly Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>. This leads to a fundamental question as to how the problem of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> editing is solved in the cellular context.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24001.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24001.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24001-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>In the current study, we show that there is significant glycine mischarging by AlaRS in the presence of EF-Tu which can be equally pernicious as serine mischarging. We demonstrate that DTD plays an active and crucial role in preventing the accumulation of mischarged Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species. A cell lacking DTD in AlaRS editing-defective background displays pronounced toxicity toward even low levels of glycine which is, nevertheless, alleviated by alanine supplementation. Our data also indicate that DTD has selectivity for the G3•U70 wobble base pair that is unique to tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, suggesting that in the primordial scenario, DTD could have been recruited primarily as a glycine-removing factor. Our study thus brings to the fore three important aspects of translational fidelity, which were underappreciated or unknown so far. Firstly, glycine, like serine, can be toxic and deleterious to the cell under conditions wherein the cell is deficient in disposing of the mischarged Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species. Secondly, how the design of the active site of DTD, notwithstanding its unwarranted activity on Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, is used to efficiently decouple glycine mischarged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> despite the presence of EF-Tu, thereby fortifying translational fidelity. Thirdly, there is a positive selection of the element(s) of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by DTD, indicating for the first time the role of tRNA elements in modulating DTD’s activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mischarging by AlaRS leads to significant accumulation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup></title><p>To test whether Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is accumulated due to mischarging of glycine on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by AlaRS, we performed aminoacylation assays in the presence of EF-Tu. In comparison to alanine charging, significant glycine mischarging was observed. Furthermore, the level of glycine mischarging was about twice that of serine mischarging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This clearly indicated that even with full AlaRS editing potential, there can be significant accumulation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species in the cell. Moreover, this is in accordance with the twofold higher misactivation rate of glycine by AlaRS when compared to that of serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsui and Fersht, 1981</xref>). We then checked the accumulation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> when AlaRS editing was compromised, and it was found to be significantly high, almost equal to the level of Ala-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To accomplish a compromise in the proofreading activity of AlaRS, a known editing site mutation (viz., C666A) in AlaRS from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beebe et al., 2003</xref>). The above data lead to a couple of fundamental questions: (a) why does a defect in the same editing domain that edits both serine and glycine from tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> cause toxicity only due to serine? and (b) how does the cell tackle the problem of glycine mischarging? Furthermore, based on structural considerations and evolutionary substitution patterns of alanine, where it is replaced more by serine than by glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betts et al., 2003</xref>), it is to be expected that substitution of glycine for alanine is more detrimental than substitution of serine.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Misacylation of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> with glycine by AlaRS and its prevention/rectification by DTD.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by EcAlaRS in the presence of activated EF-Tu: L-alanine (green square), L-alanine and 10 pM EcDTD (green triangle), glycine (pink square), glycine and 10 pM EcDTD (pink triangle), L-serine (purple square), L-serine and 10 pM EcDTD (purple triangle).

The deacylation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by DTD was so striking that ~20,000 times more AlaRS (which is the only universally occurring editing factor for Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>) as compared to DTD was required for similar kind of deacylation under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3b</xref>). In addition, unlike DTD, AlaRS showed a significant decrease in deacylation activity on Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> when tested in the presence of EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). Moreover, our assays demonstrated that DTD is not only efficient in eliminating Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> despite the presence of EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) but can also very effectively prevent the accumulation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> during aminoacylation by AlaRS in the presence of EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>DTD has higher activity than AlaRS for the editing of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Deacylation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in the presence of unactivated EF-Tu: buffer (blue diamond), 10 nM EcAlaRS (red circle), 50 nM EcAlaRS (green circle), 100 nM EcAlaRS (purple circle), 500 nM EcAlaRS (pink circle).

To this end, we performed competition assays involving AlaRS, DTD and EF-Tu. In both aminoacylation and deacylation conditions, we found that DTD deacylated Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> even in the presence of EF-Tu and AlaRS at just 10 pM concentration of DTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref>). Considering the cellular ratio of DTD to AlaRS (viz, ~1:5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and their relative activities on Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, it is evident that when DTD is present, it will eliminate Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> more efficiently than AlaRS if the non-cognate achiral substrate is released in solution from the synthetase. In this context, it is important to note that compared to Class I synthetases, enzymes belonging to Class II, which include AlaRS, have been shown to have faster product release rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, Class II aaRSs require resampling of the released mischarged product to edit the cytosolic pool of mischarged tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ling et al., 2009</xref>). This makes even more sense as regards AlaRS, since our structural analysis of AlaRS in complex with tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (PDB id: 3WQY) suggests that it would be very difficult for the CCA-arm at the 3′ end of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> harboring the non-cognate amino acid to flip from the aminoacylation site to the editing site without undergoing major conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naganuma et al., 2014</xref>). Such a dynamics would naturally facilitate a faster release of the misacylated product in solution, implying that a significant fraction of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is released from AlaRS prior to their recapture for proofreading by the <italic>cis</italic>-editing domain. Moreover, our own data, in which we observed significant accumulation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in the presence of EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), corroborate the aforementioned aspects of Class II synthetases in general and AlaRS in particular. Overall, the above data suggest that the problem of glycine mischarging by AlaRS would have been so detrimental that a highly efficient factor like DTD was required to be employed for this function in addition to AlaRS editing domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Editing-defective AlaRS and DTD knockout in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>Earlier in vivo studies had shown that AlaRS editing defect causes glycine toxicity only at very high levels of glycine supplementation (80 mM) as opposed to serine which causes toxicity at significantly lower levels (2.5 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beebe et al., 2003</xref>). It is worth noting that these studies were carried out in strains harboring DTD, hence explaining the need for supplementation with more glycine to show toxicity. To check if the absence of DTD makes <italic>E. coli</italic> susceptible to glycine, we generated an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain in which <italic>dtd</italic> (the gene encoding DTD) was knocked out in the background of editing-defective AlaRS. To create a strain that was completely devoid of AlaRS editing activity, the genomic copy of AlaRS gene (<italic>alaS</italic>) was knocked out and a triple-mutant AlaRS (viz., T567F/S587W/C666F) was expressed from a plasmid. The editing site mutations were designed on the basis of a structural (homology) model of <italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS <italic>cis</italic>-editing domain that was generated using the structure of <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> AlaRS (PDB id: 2ZTG) as a template.

Three residues in the proposed editing site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beebe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sokabe et al., 2005</xref>) were supplanted by bulkier residues to occlude the pocket and prevent substrate binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). The triple-mutant was found to be inactive on both Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> even when the protein concentration was increased to 1500-fold that of wild-type AlaRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). It is worth mentioning here that the previously known editing-defective mutants of AlaRS (C666A and C666A/Q584H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beebe et al., 2003</xref>), when checked for deacylation activity on both Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> and Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, were found to show significant activity at just 10-fold higher concentration of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). Thus, to completely abrogate AlaRS editing activity and to see the effect of editing from only DTD, we chose to use AlaRS triple-mutant for our cell-based toxicity studies.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS editing site mutants.</title><p>Homology model of <italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS depicting serine (green sticks/spheres) in the editing site. <italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS <italic>cis</italic>-editing domain was modeled using <italic>A. fulgidus</italic> AlaRS (PDB id: 2ZTG) as a template, whereas the position and orientation of serine in the model corresponds to that observed in serine-bound <italic>P. horikoshii</italic> AlaX structure (PDB id: 1WNU).

At 10 mM of glycine supplementation, the cells showed severe growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). To check whether this was specifically due to mischarging caused by AlaRS, toxicity experiments were carried out in the presence of alanine, since the latter is expected to compete for the AlaRS aminoacylation site during charging of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>. It was observed that alanine supplementation completely recovered the toxicity caused by glycine and rescued the growth completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b,c,d</xref>). Moreover, to rule out any non-specific effects due to amino acid supplementation, histidine was used as a negative control, and it was found that it failed to rescue the cells from glycine toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Furthermore, DTD was found to be totally inactive on Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in our biochemical assays which confirmed that the toxicity observed in the DTD-lacking cells in the background of AlaRS editing defect was not due to serine mischarging on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by AlaRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The above observation is expected since it has been shown earlier that DTD’s chiral proofreading site rejects even L-alanine, the smallest L-chiral substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Routh et al., 2016</xref>).

Since G3•U70 is unique to and one of the major identity elements of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> across all life forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hou and Schimmel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClain and Foss, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ripmaster et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shiba et al., 1995</xref>), we envisaged that DTD could be positively selecting tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> using the wobble base pair. To test this hypothesis, we transplanted G3•U70 at the same position in tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>. We found that DTD had more than 10-fold increased activity on Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> harboring G3•U70 as compared to the wild-type achiral cognate substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,c</xref>). To strengthen this hypothesis, we substituted the G3•C70 in the wild-type Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> with the other Watson-Crick base pair, that is A3•U70. This substitution did not cause any increase in the activity of DTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This clearly suggests that the G3•U70 wobble base pair, which is a universally conserved feature of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, acts as a positive determinant for DTD. It also suggests the existence of other features in tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> distinct from tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> that accounts for the higher activity of DTD on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> when compared to tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>, and this aspect requires further exploration. Since DTD is expected to act on all D-aminoacyl-tRNAs, it was assumed that there is no specificity code for its action on tRNAs. The identity determinant–switching experiment resulting in higher activity suggests for the first time an underlying tRNA-based code for DTD action.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>DTD positively selects the tRNA acceptor stem element G3•U70.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Deacylation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> by buffer (blue diamond), 5 nM EcDTD (purple square), 50 nM EcDTD (pink circle).

It is important to investigate this aspect because we found significant differences in residues—which are believed to interact with the acceptor stem of tRNA—around the chiral proofreading site of DTD. To this end, we first superimposed crystal structures of DTD from various organisms and manually docked tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> was taken from PDB id: 3WQY) on the superposed structures. Since DTD is not expected to establish contacts beyond the acceptor stem of tRNA, we took into consideration only those residues of DTD that were within 6 Å from the 3′-terminal CCA-arm of tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and looked for their conservation/variation using structure-based multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Notably, only 7 out of 20 residues in the selected region are invariant across bacterial and eukaryotic DTDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given the significant differences observed in a region around the active site of DTD which is likely to interact with tRNA, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that they may affect DTD’s activity on Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>.

The discovery of DTD as a key cellular factor for the elimination of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> provides an elegant explanation as to why glycine mischarging by AlaRS was not encountered or considered as a cellular hazard in all the previous studies. So far, only serine mischarging on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by AlaRS was believed to be the major threat to the cell, since cells harboring editing-defective AlaRS would show toxicity only to low levels of serine but not glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beebe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). However, this observation seemed puzzling for two reasons. Firstly, glycine misactivation by AlaRS is known to occur at about twice the rate of serine misactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsui and Fersht, 1981</xref>). Secondly and more importantly, it is unlikely that a defect in the proofreading domain that edits both serine and glycine would cause toxicity only due to serine but not glycine. Moreover, for a protein’s structure and function, the substitution of glycine for alanine is expectedly more subversive than the substitution of serine for alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betts et al., 2003</xref>). Our study thus brings forth the criticality of glycine mischarging problem, which was largely overlooked and underappreciated prior to this work. It also reveals that nature was forced to devise and retain throughout evolution a key checkpoint in the form of DTD that is more efficient than even AlaRS’s proofreading function to tackle this problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, for <italic>E. coli</italic> under laboratory conditions, knockout of DTD in AlaRS editing-proficient background did not cause toxicity on glycine supplementation. Very likely, errors caused due to defect in proofreading by DTD knockout are tolerated by <italic>E. coli</italic>, as noted in several cases of other proofreading deficiencies in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reynolds et al ., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2010b</xref>). Moreover, defects in error correction are known to manifest in toxic effects only in special growth conditions like oxidative stress, oxygen deprivation, starvation etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullwinkle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cvetesic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kermgard et al., 2017</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.021</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>DTD doubles as a key factor to uncouple glycine mischarged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>.</title><p>In the cell, aminoacylation by aaRSs leads to the formation of different aa-tRNAs, of which L-aa-tRNAs (left extreme) are not acted upon by DTD, while D-aa-tRNAs (right extreme) are effectively decoupled in the presence or absence of EF-Tu, thereby enforcing homochirality. Glycylated tRNAs are acted upon by DTD (centre) but EF-Tu offers protection to the cognate Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> to prevent its misediting, while the mischarged/non-cognate Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> is efficiently cleared even in the presence of EF-Tu. Thick connecting arrows indicate the cellular scenario, wherein both DTD and EF-Tu are present.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24001.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24001.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24001-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>The study also highlights the necessity of keeping DTD’s active site design intact during the course of evolution, probably because removal of the mischarged Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> species from the cellular pool took precedence over DTD’s unwarranted activity on Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>. Nevertheless, the glycine ‘misediting paradox’ was effectively resolved by safeguarding the cognate achiral substrate using EF-Tu as well as keeping the cellular levels of DTD low and tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Routh et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, what seemed to be an apparent flaw in the architecture of DTD’s active site proved to be a necessity. Moreover, the dual activity of DTD on both achiral and D-chiral substrates depicts it as a plausible ‘connecting link’ or ‘bridging factor’ between D-chirality–based and the canonical L-chirality–based proofreading during protein biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This view gains support from the fact that a DTD-like fold appended to archaeal threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) as the N-terminal editing domain (NTD) is specific for editing L-serine mischarged on tRNA<sup>Thr</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dwivedi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2010</xref>). It is also worth noting here that the DTD-like fold present in two functional contexts—as NTD in archaea, and as DTD in bacteria and eukaryotes—operates majorly through main chain-mediated contacts for substrate recognition and performs catalysis through RNA, suggesting its primordial origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Routh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Glycine mischarging by AlaRS is inevitable and is a classic case of error made by the aminoacylation site of aaRS, whereas serine mischarging is an offshoot of amino group selection for alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). DTD’s significantly higher activity on Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> as compared to AlaRS suggests that wherever and whenever present, DTD plays the major role in clearing the non-cognate achiral substrate from the cellular pool. This probably helps the cell to overcome the double-discrimination problem that is encountered by AlaRS in all extant organisms. In the primordial scenario, DTD could have been primarily employed as a glycine-removing factor. This activity of DTD could have aided the formation of relatively rigid and stable peptide/protein scaffolds by precluding glycine misincorporation, since the latter would have been detrimental to their stability.</p><p>Another interesting facet of DTD that has emerged from this study is its ability to specifically recognize G3•U70 in the acceptor arm of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>. This wobble base pair is a unique and major identity determinant of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> which marks it for both aminoacylation and deacylation by AlaRS from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beebe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hou and Schimmel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McClain and Foss, 1988</xref>). The specificity of AlaRS for G3•U70 is so robust that incorporation of this base pair into other tRNAs or minihelices converts non-alanine-accepting tRNAs to be recognized and charged by AlaRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Musier-Forsyth and Schimmel, 1999</xref>). This primordial mode of recognition was proposed to be an acceptor stem-based genetic code that could have been operational since the pre-tRNA era. The G3•U70-based selection of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by DTD clearly indicates towards the role of DTD in editing Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> even before the recruitment of AlaRS editing domains, which have primarily evolved to remove serine mischarged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Novoa et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, modulation of DTD’s activity depending on tRNA elements is counter-intuitive as DTD is expected to act on multiple tRNAs with comparable efficiencies. Hence, the present work has unveiled a completely new aspect of DTD’s aminoacyl-tRNA recognition code in which the role of the amino acid as well as the tRNA component needs to be looked at separately. Interestingly, a recognition code exists for EF-Tu, wherein three successive base pairs in the T-stem of tRNA thermodynamically compensate for the differential binding affinity of EF-Tu toward different amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LaRiviere et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanderson and Uhlenbeck, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schrader et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it becomes important to understand how DTD treats multiple aminoacyl-tRNAs using its own recognition code.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in certain cellular contexts, glycine as well as some D-amino acids can be present in relatively high concentrations, wherein these amino acids play important physiological roles. For example, in neuronal tissues, D-serine and D-aspartate along with glycine are abundant and act as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hashimoto and Oka, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Snyder and Kim, 2000</xref>). In such instances, especially in neuronal tissues, DTD’s function and its corresponding up-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2009</xref>) suggest an all-pervasive requirement of this protein from a primordial domain involved in perpetuation of homochirality to current-day proofreader in physiological context. It has been established that even a mild compromise in AlaRS editing for Ser-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> causes severe pathological conditions, such as neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). In this regard, the role and regulation of DTD in various cellular contexts, and more importantly in higher eukaryotes, will be an important aspect which needs to be probed to gain newer insights into DTD’s physiological significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and protein purification</title><p>DTD genes from the genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> and cDNAs of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (fruit fly) and <italic>D. rerio</italic> (zebrafish) were cloned, and the proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Routh et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Jonathan P Staley (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Ibba (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>tRNA charging fidelity is a fundamental issue in promoting protein synthesis and cellular fitness. In this manuscript, the authors define a novel mechanism for editing Gly-tRNA(Ala) by the universal factor DTD, previously known to function only in discrimination against tRNAs mischarged with D-amino acids. While editing Ser-tRNA(Ala) has been shown to be physiologically important, evidence that editing of Gly-tRNA(Ala) has not, even though tRNA(Ala) is as efficiently mischarged with Gly as with Ser, as the authors show. The authors further show that the canonical editing activity of AlaRS is inefficient in cleaving Gly-tRNA(Ala) but that DTD does cleave efficiently – many orders of magnitude more efficiently. While EF-Tu protects Gly-tRNA(Gly) from DTD, EF-Tu does not protect Gly-tRNA(Ala), and DTD acts orders of magnitude more efficiently on Gly-tRNA(Ala) than Gly-tRNA(Gly), highlighting the specificity of DTD for Gly-mischarged tRNA. Strikingly, the authors show that a knockout of DTD in <italic>E. coli</italic> (in an editing-deficient AlaRS background) renders concentrations of glycine toxic that can be rescued by alanine, establishing both the physiological challenge of glycine mischarging and the role of DTD in editing. The authors further show that this activity is conserved across all branches of life and unexpectedly appears to require recognition of the tRNA body. Overall, this elegant and clever manuscript resolves a long-standing question in the field of translation quality control.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A main question is whether the role of DTD in editing Gly-tRNA(Ala) is greater than the role of AlaRS. The physiological role for DTD was determined in a background deficient for editing by AlaRS. If the role of DTD is critical, it's role should remain important in a wild-type AlaRS background, which the authors should test. Either possible outcome will be informative.</p><p>2) Table 1: kcat/Km values are much higher than the typical diffusion-limited, macromolecular reaction at ~100 uM-1/s<sup>-1</sup> (table 1 values are &gt;10,000 uM-1/s<sup>-1</sup>). This does not seem to be possible. How can these values be justified? There may be some fundamental issues in these measurements.</p><p>3) Subsection “DTD effectively decouples glycine mischarged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: It's unclear how the conclusion that ~20,000 times more AlaRS than DTD is needed for Gly-tRNAAla deacylation is derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> data. I assume that the authors are comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref> without an active EF-Tu? Or is it a comparison of 3B with 2B? In order to make this strong statement, one needs to at least take earlier time points than 2 min, and not in mixed AlaRS/DTD experiment where these two proteins may interact; indeed, because one cannot be sure which protein is responsible for the activity in 3C and because 3C is somewhat redundant with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, the panel 3C should be removed. In addition, why does the DTD only deacylate ~75% of misacylated tRNA (3C), whereas AlaRS deacylates almost all tRNA (3A)?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: the requirement of G3U70 for DTD deacylation is a major conclusion of the paper.

More mutation data, e.g. from other tRNAGly isoacceptors are needed. It is also crucial to mutate tRNAAla G3U70 to show a severe reduction of the deacylation activity. To bypass the difficulty of making sufficient amount of Gly-tRNAAla G3U70 mutant by AlaRS, one could use flexizyme to make these substrates.

Either possible outcome will be informative.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out an important aspect of the effect of DTD knockout in the background of wild-type AlaRS. We have now done the experiments to check the effect of glycine supplementation on both <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 ∆<italic>dtd</italic> strains. We do not observe glycine toxicity in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 ∆<italic>dtd</italic> strain in the background of wild-type AlaRS. This suggests that for <italic>E. coli</italic>, in the absence of DTD, AlaRS editing is sufficient to prevent glycine toxicity under laboratory conditions. This could be due to AlaRS’s ability to recycle Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in the absence of DTD and/or errors produced because of the absence of DTD are tolerated by <italic>E. coli</italic> under laboratory conditions.</p><p>Although translational quality control functions are known to be conserved in all domains of life, it is very well known that they are not essential for cellular growth under most laboratory conditions (Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010a). The real implications of editing defects are only recently being appreciated in some specific growth conditions like oxidative stress, oxygen deprivation, starvation or nutrient-limiting conditions, etc. (Bullwinkle <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Cvetesic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014; Kermgard <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017). These editing defects are also found to show differential effects in different cell compartments and cell types (Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010b; Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014).</p><p>In many cases, the importance of editing functions is found only in slow growth conditions. During exponential growth of both <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast, certain translational quality control processes are also found to be dispensable (Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010a; Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010b). To test the contribution of only DTD in proofreading Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, we carried out our experiments in the background of AlaRS editing defect (the so far known editor of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>). As correctly pointed out by the reviewers, we have now included the data comprising toxicity assays of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 ∆<italic>dtd</italic> strain in wild-type AlaRS background in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) and have also added a few sentences regarding this effect in the main text.</p><p><italic>2) Table 1: kcat/Km values are much higher than the typical diffusion-limited, macromolecular reaction at ~100 uM-1/s<sup>-1</sup> (table 1 values are &gt;10,000 uM-1/s<sup>-1</sup>). This does not seem to be possible. How can these values be justified? There may be some fundamental issues in these measurements.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for highlighting a very important aspect of measuring the kinetic parameters for DTD. As rightly pointed out by the reviewers, we find the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> values to be significantly higher than the typical diffusion-limited macromolecular reaction. In this case, we have found that our K<sub>m</sub> values are not very different from those estimated for several other editing modules (Pasman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011), but our k<sub>cat</sub> values are too high, thus tilting the overall enzyme efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>). One of the major reasons for this is that DTD is active at low picomolar concentrations, whereas other editing modules work at best only in nanomolar concentration range.</p><p>We have also discussed this issue of unusual values of kinetic parameters of DTD with some of the experts in enzyme kinetics within the country and outside but have still not been able to figure out the exact reasons for such high k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> values. There are a few enzymes, like 4-oxalocrotonase tautomerase and superoxide dismutase, which have been reported to cross the diffusion limits (Traut, 2008), but to come to a conclusion that DTD comes in that category, we need to establish these numbers thoroughly using different methods. A couple of issues that could have led to an aberrant estimation are given below:</p><p>a. Error in protein concentration estimation.</p><p>b. Error in estimation of initial velocities, since DTD is a fast enzyme.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that we underestimated the enzyme concentration, we have again measured the concentration of DTD and AlaRS, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard protein, using multiple methods (Absorbance at 280 nM (A<sub>280</sub>), Bradford assay and Bicinchoninic acid assay) which work on different principles for estimation of protein concentration. We have found that the estimations using these methods are similar to our earlier estimations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Author response table 1</xref>) which were carried out using A<sub>280</sub>.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.022</object-id><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><p>Protein concentration estimation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24001.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24001.022</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"><bold>Protein Name</bold></th><th rowspan="2"><bold>Concentration of protein taken (mg/ml) measured using A<sub>280</sub></bold></th><th colspan="2"><bold>Protein concentration estimation (mg/ml) using</bold></th></tr><tr><th><bold>Bicinchoninic acid Assay</bold></th><th><bold>Bradford Assay</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><bold><italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS</bold></td><td><bold>4</bold></td><td><bold>3.82</bold></td><td><bold>5.22</bold></td></tr><tr><td><bold>8</bold></td><td><bold>7.45</bold></td><td><bold>9.02</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2"><bold><italic>E. coli</italic> DTD</bold></td><td><bold>4</bold></td><td><bold>4.36</bold></td><td><bold>4.83</bold></td></tr><tr><td><bold>8</bold></td><td><bold>8.08</bold></td><td><bold>7.93</bold></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Even after further validation if the kinetic parameters are found to be similar and high as represented here, it will have serious impact and implication on enzyme kinetics in general and translational proofreading in particular, and one would also need to explain this in the context of physiological relevance and evolutionary implications. This would include generating slower variants and then to test their impact on rescuing DTD-induced phenotype.</p><p>Nevertheless, since the focus of the manuscript is that DTD functions to edit Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>, we felt that the kinetics data as represented in Table 1 (in the manuscript) do not directly contribute to the overall implications of the work. The kinetic constants of DTD for different substrates have to be looked into as a whole using multiple methodologies before presenting such a high value, as also noted correctly by the reviewers. Therefore, we propose to remove this table and once again thank the reviewers for pointing out to us the abnormal values (able 1 has been removed from the revised manuscript). However, as suggested by them in the next concern, the relative editing efficiencies of AlaRS and DTD are to be compared, which we have addressed below.</p><p><italic>3) Subsection “DTD effectively decouples glycine mischarged on tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: It's unclear how the conclusion that ~20,000 times more AlaRS than DTD is needed for Gly-tRNAAla deacylation is derived from Figure 3 data. I assume that the authors are comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref> without an active EF-Tu? Or is it a comparison of 3B with 2B? In order to make this strong statement, one needs to at least take earlier time points than 2 min, and not in mixed AlaRS/DTD experiment where these two proteins may interact; indeed, because one cannot be sure which protein is responsible for the activity in 3C and because 3C is somewhat redundant with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, the panel 3C should be removed. In addition, why does the DTD only deacylate ~75% of misacylated tRNA (3c), whereas AlaRS deacylates almost all tRNA (3A)?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing forth this point and we regret that our projection has inadvertently led to some confusion while reading the manuscript. The comparison we want to make is between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref> in the manuscript, where in the presence of activated EF-Tu, DTD at 5 pM concentration and AlaRS at 100 nM concentration show similar activities on Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> under identical reaction conditions, thus leading to a difference of ~20,000-folds between the two enzymes. Also, for this comparison, we have not used a mixture of enzymes. DTD and AlaRS were used in separate reactions for checking their activities in the presence of activated EF-Tu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, respectively, in the manuscript). We have now mentioned explicitly in the revised manuscript that we are comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, so that the readers will not have this confusion, as in the original manuscript.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> in the manuscript, we are checking the activity of DTD on Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in the absence or presence of increasing concentration of AlaRS. We find that the presence or absence of AlaRS does not make much difference in the deacylation of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> by DTD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is different from other experiments as this is the only competition deacylation experiment between DTD and AlaRS to deacylate Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup>. We would like to keep this figure (retained in the revised manuscript) as now the original confusion between the earlier figures is resolved. However, if the reviewers still feel that this dataset is redundant and unnecessary, we can remove it from the manuscript.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> in the manuscript shows deacylations of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in the presence of unactivated EF-Tu. In this case, unactivated EF-Tu does not offer any protection to the substrate and thus, in general, higher deacylations are observed (as also seen for the buffer/no enzyme control). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and C</xref> in the manuscript are deacylations of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> in the presence of activated EF-Tu. Here, activated EF-Tu offers some protection to the substrate (as seen by negligible deacylation in buffer/no enzyme control) and in both the reactions, AlaRS and DTD deacylate ~75% of the misacylated tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B and C</xref>, respectively).</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: the requirement of G3U70 for DTD deacylation is a major conclusion of the paper. Yet, this conclusion is based entirely on one single mutation in tRNAGly. This figure is so poorly presented that one cannot even see what the sequence differences are between the E. coli tRNAGly and Ala used. More mutation data, e.g. from other tRNAGly isoacceptors are needed. It is also crucial to mutate tRNAAla G3U70 to show a severe reduction of the deacylation activity. To bypass the difficulty of making sufficient amount of Gly-tRNAAla G3U70 mutant by AlaRS, one could use flexizyme to make these substrates. Without such experiments, the authors would need to dramatically tone down the significance and implications of this result concerning a single mutation of a single tRNA.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> figures should have details about their sequence. As correctly suggested by the reviewers, we have now included the sequence details of the tRNAs used in the study (in the improved version of the figure). Regarding DTD’s role in positively selecting the G3•U70 wobble base pair on tRNA, we have now performed additional experiments following the reviewers’ advice to further strengthen our claim. We have carried out deacylation experiments with <italic>E. coli</italic> Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> A3•U70 and found that this tRNA variant does not show increase in activity compared to wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> Gly-tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This indicates that DTD positively selects the structure and/or chemical interaction coming especially from G3•U70 wobble base pair. Besides, as per the suggestion of the reviewers, we have compared the three isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> and have found that their acceptor stem is identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). Since DTD is not expected to interact beyond the acceptor stem of tRNA, we do not anticipate the plausibility of variation in DTD’s activity on different isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Gly</sup>.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that it is crucial to mutate G3•U70 of tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> to show reduction of deacylation activity. In this regard, we have generated an aminoacylation site mutant of <italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS, <italic>viz.</italic>, D400A. The corresponding mutation in AlaRS from <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> (D450A) has been previously shown to aminoacylate tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> A3•U70 (Naganuma <italic>et al.,</italic> 2014). However, using <italic>E. coli</italic> AlaRS D400A mutant, we were not able to generate sufficient amounts of Gly-tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> A3•U70 substrate to carry out deacylation reactions. Another strategy, as rightly indicated by the reviewers, is to use flexizymes to generate the desired substrate. We need to establish the system to test the above in the future.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24001.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Gly</sup> isoacceptors showing identical acceptor stem.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24001.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24001.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24001-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) The conclusions are overstated for the experiments to determine how applicable this mechanism is across different domains (subsection “DTD is recruited throughout bacteria and eukaryotes for Gly-tRNAAla removal”).
