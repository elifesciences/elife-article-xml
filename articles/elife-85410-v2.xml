Despite this interest, the mechanistic bases of these uncanny processes have remained mostly a mystery. Here, we leverage the <italic>Entomophthora muscae</italic>-<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> “zombie fly” system to reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of summit disease, a manipulated behavior evoked by many fungal parasites. Using a high-throughput approach to measure summiting, we discovered that summiting behavior is characterized by a burst of locomotion and requires the host circadian and neurosecretory systems, specifically DN1p circadian neurons, pars intercerebralis to corpora allata projecting (PI-CA) neurons and corpora allata (CA), the latter being solely responsible for juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and release. Using a machine learning classifier to identify summiting animals in real time, we observed that PI-CA neurons and CA appeared intact in summiting animals, despite invasion of adjacent regions of the “zombie fly” brain by <italic>E. muscae</italic> cells and extensive host tissue damage in the body cavity. The blood-brain barrier of flies late in their infection was significantly permeabilized, suggesting that factors in the hemolymph may have greater access to the central nervous system during summiting. Metabolomic analysis of hemolymph from summiting flies revealed differential abundance of several compounds compared to non-summiting flies. Transfusing the hemolymph of summiting flies into non-summiting recipients induced a burst of locomotion, demonstrating that factor(s) in the hemolymph likely cause summiting behavior. Altogether, our work reveals a neuro-mechanistic model for summiting wherein fungal cells perturb the fly’s hemolymph, activating a neurohormonal pathway linking clock neurons to juvenile hormone production in the CA, ultimately inducing locomotor activity in their host.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Entomophthora muscae</italic></kwd><kwd>summit disease</kwd><kwd>parasitic mind-control</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>juvenile hormone</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GT11087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elya</surname><given-names>Carolyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

For example, ‘zombie ant’ fungi of genus <italic>Ophiocordyceps</italic> compel their host carpenter ants to aberrantly leave the nest, wander away from established foraging trails, scale nearby stems or twigs, and, in their dying moments, clamp onto vegetation to ultimately perish in elevated positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pontoppidan et al., 2009</xref>). Days later, a fungal stalk emerges from the dead ant’s pronotum, well poised to rain spores on the ants that forage below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Evans and Samson, 1984</xref>). But this is far from the only example: jewel wasps that subdue cockroaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gal and Libersat, 2010</xref>), protozoans that suppress a rodent’s fear of cat odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Vyas et al., 2007</xref>), and worms that drive crickets to leap to watery deaths are all examples of parasites hijacking host behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Thomas et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>One of the most frequently encountered behavior manipulations in parasitized insects is summit disease (also referred to as tree-top disease or Wipfelkrankheit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hofmann, 1891</xref>). Summit disease is induced by diverse parasites, ranging from viruses to fungi to trematodes, and affects a broad range of insect species, including ants, beetles, crickets, caterpillars, and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goulson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Krasnoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Loos-Frank and Zimmermann, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Pickford and Riegert, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Steinkraus et al., 2017</xref>). The most consistently reported symptom of summit disease is elevation prior to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Evans, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lovett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Roy et al., 2006</xref>). This positioning advantages the parasite by either making the spent host more conspicuous, and therefore, likely to be consumed by the next host in its life cycle (e.g. <italic>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</italic>-infected ants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Martín-Vega et al., 2018</xref>), or by positioning the spent host for optimal dispersal of infectious propagules (e.g. <italic>Mamestra brassicae</italic> nuclear polyhedrosis virus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goulson, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Some of the deepest mechanistic understanding of parasite-induced summiting comes from nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs). Disrupting the <italic>ecdysteroid uridine 5’-diphosphate</italic> (<italic>egt</italic>) gene in NPVs of the moths <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> or <italic>Spodoptera exigua</italic> prevents summiting in infected larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hoover et al., 2011</xref>). This effect is thought to occur via <italic>egt</italic>’s inactivation of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone and the resulting disruption of molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">O’Reilly and Miller, 1989</xref>). However, <italic>egt</italic> has been found to be dispensable for driving summit disease in other NPV-insect systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kokusho and Katsuma, 2021</xref>), suggesting there are undiscovered viral mechanisms driving summiting in NPV-infected hosts. On the host side, evidence in NPV-infected <italic>L. dispar</italic> and <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> point to changes in the host phototactic pathway underlying summiting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bhattarai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Outside of NPVs, work in <italic>Ophiocordyceps</italic> suggests that the parasitic fungus may use enterotoxins and small secreted proteins to mediate end-of-life ‘zombie’ behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beckerson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">de Bekker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Will et al., 2020</xref>), potentially targeting host phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andriolli et al., 2019</xref>), circadian rhythm, chemosensation, and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">de Bekker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Trinh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Will et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>Entomophthora muscae</italic> is a behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen that infects dipterans and elicits summit disease prior to host death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Graham-Smith, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">MacLeod et al., 1976</xref>). <italic>E. muscae</italic> infection begins when a fungal conidium (informally: spore) ejected from a dead host lands on a fly’s cuticle. The spore penetrates the cuticle and enters the hemolymph where it begins to replicate, first using the fat body (a tissue analogous to the liver and used for storing excess nutrients) as a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Brobyn and Wilding, 1983</xref>). When nutrients are exhausted, <italic>E. muscae</italic> elicits a stereotyped trio of behaviors to position its dying host for the next round of spore dispersal. The fly (1) summits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Graham-Smith, 1916</xref>), (2) extends its proboscis, which glues the fly in place via sticky, exuded secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Brobyn and Wilding, 1983</xref>), and finally, (3) the fly’s wings lift up and away from its dorsal abdomen, clearing the way for future spore dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Krasnoff et al., 1995</xref>). Fungal structures (conidiophores) then emerge through the cuticle and forcefully eject infectious spores into the surrounding environment via a ballistic water cannon mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">de Ruiter et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>E. muscae</italic> kills flies at a specific time of day: flies die around sunset and exhibit their final bout of locomotion between 0–5 hr prior to lights off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Krasnoff et al., 1995</xref>). Time-of-day specificity is a common feature of fungal-induced summit disease: <italic>Ophiocordyceps</italic>-infected ants die around solar noon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Entomophaga grylli</italic>-infected grasshoppers within a 4 hr window prior to sunset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Roffey, 1968</xref>), and <italic>Erynia neoaphidis</italic>- and <italic>Entomophthora planchoniana</italic>-infected aphids die most frequently around 8.5 and 14 hr after sunrise<italic>,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Milner et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected ‘zombie flies’ have been known to the scientific literature for the last 167 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cohn, 1855</xref>), yet the mechanistic basis of their behavior manipulation is still a mystery. It is challenging to culture <italic>E. muscae</italic> in the laboratory and typical host species, like houseflies, lack experimental access. A strain of <italic>E. muscae</italic> that infects fruit flies was recently isolated and used to establish a laboratory-based ‘zombie fly’ system in the tool-replete model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>), permitting investigation of the specific host mechanisms underlying manipulated behaviors.</p><p>The rich experimental toolkit of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has been used to decipher the mechanistic underpinnings of host-symbiont interactions ranging from mutualism to parasitism. For example, a mutant screen identified the Toll pathway as essential for <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s antiviral immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Zambon et al., 2005</xref>). Genetic access to specific neuronal populations allowed the identification of class IV neurons as mediating the larval escape response to oviposition by <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>). It was recently shown that the gut bacterium <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> alters fly octopaminergic pathways to drive an increase in locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Schretter et al., 2018</xref>). Fruit flies have also been leveraged to investigate mechanisms of medically important parasites naturally vectored by other dipterans, including the protozoans <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Leishmania,</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">dos-Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Peltan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Tonk et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe our progress using the zombie fruit fly system to unravel the mechanistic basis of summiting behavior. We first show that the hallmark of summiting behavior is an increase in locomotion beginning ~2.5 hr before death. By combining the powerful fruit fly genetic tool kit with a custom high-throughput behavioral assay, we demonstrate that the fly circadian and neurosecretory systems—specifically DN1p clock neurons, pars intercerebralis projection neurons that innervate the corpora allata (PI-CA neurons), and the juvenile hormone-producing corpora allata—are essential components mediating summiting. Using a real-time machine learning classifier to identify the moment flies begin to summit, we were able to characterize the anatomy and physiology of summiting flies with temporal precision. We found that <italic>E. muscae</italic> specifically invades the brain region harboring DN1p axons and PI-CA dendrites. The hemolymph of summiting flies contains specific metabolites that, when transfused into recipient flies, induce summiting-like locomotion. Taken together, these experiments reveal that <italic>E. muscae</italic> uses hemolymph-borne factors, targets a specific neural circuit, and hijacks endogenous neurohormonal control of locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel assay to measure summiting behavior</title><p>We first set out to develop an assay that would allow us to characterize the behavioral mechanisms of summit disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the variability in the day and exact time when flies die, and the unknown duration of summiting, our assay needed to accommodate continuous monitoring of flies over many hours. The assay also needed to allow flies to express behavior with respect to the direction of gravity. We also wanted to make sure our chambers provided enough space for flies to lift their wings without interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each behavioral arena was 65 mm long along the main gravitational axis, 5 mm wide, and 3.2 mm deep, and housed a single fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The bottom of the chamber was plugged with food to sustain flies over long periods of observation (24–96 hr). Four rows of 32 arenas each were fabricated in laser-cut acrylic trays, allowing us to measure the behavior (position along the main gravitational axis, referred to as ‘relative y position,’ and overall speed) of 128 flies simultaneously.

Experiments started no later than Zeitgeber time 20 (ZT20, i.e. 19 hr after the dark-to-light transition) on the day prior to their earliest possible death, until flies either succumbed to or survived their infection (ZT13 of day 4–7, depending on the experiment). After tracking, we manually assessed if each fly was alive or dead, and if the latter, whether it had sporulated. Henceforth, we will use the term ‘zombies’ as a shorthand for <italic>E. muscae</italic>-exposed flies that perform fungus-induced behaviors before dying and sporulating. Sporulated flies were retroactively declared ‘zombies’ and living flies ‘survivors.’ Dead flies without signs of sporulation were excluded from further analysis. The time of zombie deaths was manually determined by the time of the last movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As expected, wild-type flies killed by <italic>E. muscae</italic> tended to die in the evening (mean death time = ZT9:50 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), but there was variability in the timing of death. 90% of all deaths occurred between ZT7 and ZT12. E. muscae-exposed flies continued to die at specific times of the day even in complete darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the timing of death is under circadian control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A burst of locomotion before death is a key signature of <italic>E. muscae</italic>-induced summiting</title><p>With our assay in its standard configuration (angled 30° with respect to gravity, food at the bottom), <italic>E. muscae</italic>-exposed survivors and zombies exhibited significantly different time-varying patterns in the mean vertical position and mean speed in the final 12 hr before death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; survivors were randomly assigned a fictive time of death to enable this comparison). Survivor flies typically resided close to the center of the summit arena throughout tracking. In contrast, the average position of the zombie fly was near the bottom of the arena until approximately 2.5 hr before death when the average elevation increased, ultimately surpassing that of survivors. The difference between zombies and survivors in average speed over time was even more striking. Zombies maintained a low average speed (0.18 mm/s) until ~2.5 hr before death when it increased substantially, peaking at 0.87 mm/s approximately one hour prior to death. In contrast, survivors exhibited high mean speed (~0.8 mm/s)~12 hr prior to the end of the experiment and a small increase in mean activity (0.22 m/s)~2 hr after the burst of zombie activity. These peaks of survivor activity correspond to the crepuscular peaks of activity expected in healthy flies.</p><p>Surprisingly, the average ‘elevation’ and speed trajectories of zombie flies did not change in the absence of a gravitactic gradient (i.e. when the arena was laid flat, and the food was designated as the ‘bottom’ of the arena) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Flies resided near the food and exhibited low average speed (0.19 mm/s) until ~2.5 hr prior to death, when speed peaked at 0.8 mm/s and flies had a mean position near the middle of the chamber. These patterns were largely statistically indistinguishable from those of the 30° experiment. When the chamber was angled at 30°, but with food at the top, average y position trends were essentially flipped, with flies on average residing near the top of the chamber until 2.5 hr prior to death, at which point they moved downward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Notably, speed trends were statistically indistinguishable in this new configuration: flies still exhibited low average speed (0.15 mm/s) until ~2.5 hr prior to death when they exhibited a marked increase in speed peaking at 0.66 mm/s ~1 hr prior to death.</p><p>The burst of speed prior to death in zombie flies was specific to how they died. Unexposed flies that were killed by starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) or desiccation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) did not exhibit a burst of speed prior to death. In both cases, flies maintained a high average speed at 12 hr before death (2.2 mm/s and 2.9 mm/s, respectively) with the average speed of starved flies gradually declining over ~5 hr before death. The mean speed of desiccated flies gradually increased from 12 to ~3 hr before death, peaking at 4.85 mm/s, then exhibited a steady decline until death. Unlike zombie flies, starved or desiccated unexposed flies did not die at a specific time of day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, S1D). These experiments suggest that an increase in speed ~2.5 hr before death and dying at specific times are signatures of <italic>E. muscae</italic> mortality.</p><p>Average zombie y position appeared to be dictated by the location of food in our assay. Zombie flies began to reside closer to the food than survivors starting ~24 hr prior to death in the food-at-the-top configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This behavior was dependent on the nutritive content of the food. When given a choice between sugar-containing and sugarless agar in a 0° assay, zombie flies tended to reside near the sugar-containing media before moving away ~2.5 hr prior to death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Providing food within the last 24 hr was necessary for the pre-death burst of locomotion: flies that were housed on sugarless media starting the day prior to death failed to exhibit a pre-death burst of locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>) though still died with the expected circadian timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). These results suggest that flies are likely starving by late infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>) and need access to sustenance to exhibit a final burst of locomotion during summiting.</p><p>A burst of locomotion will move flies, on average, away from the closed end of an arena, a consequence of that boundary condition. We were curious about what would happen if flies were residing at food in the middle of an arena at the onset of summiting. We lengthened the arena and situated the food in the middle. As expected, in 0° arenas, zombie flies remained on average centered on the food prior to death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). However, in 30° arenas, zombie flies moved on average slightly upward at the end of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). The distance that flies traveled during summiting did not differ between arenas angled at 0–30° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J and K</xref>), indicating that the net upward motion of summiting in this condition could not be attributed to differences in activity.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments reveal a burst of speed in the final 2.5 hr before death as a key signature of <italic>E. muscae</italic>-induced summiting in our assay. We devised a simple metric, the summit metric (SM), to quantify the ‘summity-ness’ of individual flies. SM is calculated as the integral of baseline-corrected speed over the summiting window. Three example speed traces for Canton-S flies and their corresponding SM values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. As expected, there was a weak, positive correlation across individual flies between SM and change in y-position over summiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Comparing SM values across over 400 male and female Canton-S flies, we observed that, on average, males are moderately more ‘summity’ (have 18% higher SM values) than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2L and M</xref>). However, this difference is dwarfed by interindividual variation in summiting, and since <italic>E. muscae</italic> infects both males and females in the wild, we opted to use mixed-sex experimental groups in subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Summiting behavior requires host circadian and neurosecretory pathways</title><p>With the understanding that a burst of activity shortly before death is the signature of summiting in this assay, we performed a screen to identify circuit and genetic components mediating summiting in the host fly. We adopted a candidate approach, but cast a wide net for neurons and genes involved in neuromodulation or previously implicated in arousal and gravitaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To disrupt neurons, we drove the expression of tetanus toxin (TNT-E; a vesicle release blocker; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Keller et al., 2002</xref>) using 103 different Gal4 drivers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Similarly, we screened 101 lines targeting candidate genes, either by pan-neuronally reducing their expression via RNAi (i.e. driving CNS-wide expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting the desired gene) or testing mutant alleles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Again, effect sizes were estimated by comparing each line’s summiting metric to common control genotypes, for pan-neuronal RNAi, the heterozygous pan-neuronal driver (<italic>R57C10-Gal4</italic>/+); for mutants, wild-type (CantonS) control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Genotype details and our rationales for including each line in the screen are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>.

Three different mutants of Clock (Clk), a gene expressed in all clock cells, showed greatly reduced summiting behavior (62–104%, 3.4e-28&lt;p&lt;7e-8). The cryptochrome gene (cry) encodes a blue light sensor expressed by a subset of circadian neurons that synchronizes the molecular oscillator with environmental lighting cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Emery et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Benito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref>).

DN1ps are a heterogeneous population of neurons numbering approximately 15 cells per brain hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). About half of DN1ps express cry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yoshii et al., 2008</xref>). Silencing neurons with two drivers that label many, but not all, of the DN1ps (Clk4.1 and R18H11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kunst et al., 2014</xref>) via TNT-E expression reduced summiting by 24–25% (p=0.005, 0.019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). However, silencing the entire population of DN1p neurons by driving the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baines et al., 2001</xref>) with a pan-DN1p driver had no apparent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) as did silencing neurons labeled by an additional driver previously reported to be expressed in DN1ps (R51H05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kunst et al., 2014</xref>). Silencing a sparser population of DN1ps (Clk4.5) with TNT-E led to an increase in summiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Genetic disruption of two signaling molecules expressed by DN1ps, Diuretic Hormone 31 (<italic>Dh31</italic>) and the neuropeptide CNMamide (<italic>CNMa</italic>), reduced summiting by 59–72% (3e-16&lt;p&lt;0.025; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, flies mutant for the receptors that recognize these molecules (Dh31R and PdfR for Dh31; CNMaR for CNMa) did not show significantly impaired summiting (0.054&lt;p&lt;0.3), though Dh31R came close with a 33% impairment at p=0.054. Taken together, these results implicate DN1ps as mediating fungal manipulation while also revealing fine-scale complexity, as activity in some DN1ps, but not others, is required for full summiting.</p><p>DN1p activity is influenced by a class of pacemaker neurons called small ventrolateral neurons (sLNvs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) that express the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Helfrich-Förster and Homberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Renn et al., 1999</xref>).

We also did not observe a significant decrease in summiting in Pdf receptor (PdfR) mutants (0.3&lt;p&lt;0.38). Disrupting sLNVs by expressing TNT-E, channel Kir2.1, or pro-apoptotic protein hid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Grether et al., 1995</xref>) also had no effect on summiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, E). This suggests that the main population of clock neurons upstream of DN1ps is irrelevant for summiting.</p><p>DN1ps send some processes medially, with presynaptic sites occurring at or near the PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Reinhard et al., 2022b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Chatterjee et al., 2018</xref>). We tested the effect on summiting of silencing neurons in the PI using 16 different Gal4 drivers. Of these, seven produced significant reductions in summiting ranging from 44-79% (2.6e-9&lt;p&lt;0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). While some of these drivers were quite broad (such as <italic>fru-Gal4</italic>), others were quite sparse and specific to the PI, including <italic>R19G10-Gal4</italic> which is expressed in ~12 neurons (all but two of which are in the PI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Silencing R19G10 neurons reduced summiting by 60% (p=2.4e-8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given the sparseness of this Gal4 driver and the large effect on summiting of expressing TNT-E with it, we focused on its PI neurons as the likely target of manipulation in this neuropil.</p><p>We next tested whether the ectopic activation of DN1ps or R19G10 neurons could drive ‘summiting’ in flies that had never been exposed to <italic>E. muscae</italic>. We expressed a thermosensitive cation channel TrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) using <italic>Clk4.1-Gal4</italic> (to target DN1ps) or <italic>R19G10-Gal4</italic> (to target the PI) in flies unexposed to <italic>E. muscae</italic>. We conducted a 20 hr summiting assay with these flies, raising the temperature from 22–28°C, for 2 hr (ZT6-8) between the flies’ daily circadian activity peaks that occur at the light-dark transitions (ZT0 and ZT12). Activating either DN1p or R19G10 neurons in this way led to a 28.7-fold or 9.7-fold increase in mean fly speed compared to sibling controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). This effect was significant across both males and females, though the effect was smaller in females for both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C, D</xref>). As another test of the sufficiency of activating R19G10 neurons to induce summiting-like behavior, we expressed the optogenetic reagent CsChrimson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) in these cells. We ran these flies in a modified summiting assay with alternating periods of 3 min of darkness and red light. R19G10&gt;CsChrimson flies fed all-trans retinal (ATR), the CsChrimson cofactor, exhibited a burst of mean speed for the first 60 s after light onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>) and suppressed walking speed for the last 90 s of light stimulation, perhaps due to depolarization block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Herman et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the control fly speed remained roughly constant throughout. The higher mean walking speed reflects a higher portion of flies walking after light onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Thus, ectopically activating DN1Ps and R19G10 neurons appear to robustly induce a summiting-like increase in activity in flies unexposed to the fungus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The corpora allata are post-synaptic to R19G10 (PI-CA) neurons and necessary for summiting</title><p>In insects, pars intercerebralis neurons often project to the neurohemal organs of the retrocerebral complex (RC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Carrow et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">de Velasco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hartenstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Pipa, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Rüegg et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Siegmund and Korge, 2001</xref>). We suspected this might be the case for R19G10 neurons. The RC in <italic>Drosophila</italic> consists of two pairs of fused neurohemal organs: the corpora cardiaca (CC) and the corpora allata (CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Nässel, 2002</xref>), the sole sites of adipokinetic hormone (Akh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Noyes et al., 1995</xref>) and juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Klowden, 2008</xref>). Akh null mutants exhibited intact summiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), so we focused on potential R19G10 connections to the CA. We expressed the presynaptic marker synaptotagmin-GFP in R19G10 neurons and co-stained dissected brain-RC complexes for the CA-specific marker JH methyltransferase (JHMAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Niwa et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We observed R19G10 presynaptic terminals at the CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), so we named R19G10 neurons ‘PI-CA’ neurons to reflect this connectivity (Following the convention of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>, the letters before the dash indicate the postsynaptic compartment, the letters after the presynaptic compartment).</p><p>To test if the CA was required for summiting, we turned to genetic ablation. First, we drove the expression of a Nuclear inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase type 1 (NiPP1) with a driver that targets the CA (Aug21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Siegmund and Korge, 2001</xref>). NiPP1 overexpression causes cell-autonomous lethality in a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Parker et al., 2002</xref>) and has been previously used to ablate the CA in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Aug21 &gt;NiPP1 animals showed reduced summiting by 60% (p=2.7e<sup>-5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but immunohistochemistry showed that the degree of CA ablation varied by the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In a second ablation approach, we used a temperature-sensitive Gal80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>) to repress the expression of diphtheria toxin (DTI) driven by Aug21 until flies had reached wandering 3rd instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bilen et al., 2013</xref>). Tub-Gal80(ts), Aug21 &gt;DTI flies housed at the restrictive temperature also showed reduced summiting 72% (p=1.1e<sup>-5</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and were confirmed by microscopy to have either greatly reduced or absent CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We used pharmacology as a complementary approach to confirm the role of the CA in summiting. First, we blocked the production of JH by feeding flies fluvastatin, a compound that targets the JH synthesis pathway by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-coA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Debernard et al., 1994</xref>). Flies fed with fluvastatin at 72 hr after exposure to the fungus showed severely reduced summiting (110% (p=3.1e-11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, these flies released very few spores compared to untreated zombies and died at atypical times (after sunset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This observation led us to suspect that fluvastatin was impairing fungal growth. A series of experiments confirmed that feeding fluvastatin to flies well in advance of summiting (24 hr post-exposure) led to the premature death of infected flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>) and abolished the circadian timing of death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that while fluvastatin disrupted summiting, that effect was likely due to disruption of fungal growth. We next turned to precocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Bowers, 1981</xref>), a natural product that reduces JH titers per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amsalem et al., 2014</xref> by inducing CA necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Pratt et al., 1980</xref>). Applying 2.5 or 5 μg of precocene to exposed flies led to a 47% and 70% reduction of summiting behavior (p=0.001 and 6e-6, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Increased doses of precocene led to more off-target deaths in both exposed and control flies, suggesting that precocene toxicity is fungus-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Precocene treatment did not alter the timing of death by <italic>E. muscae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p><p>We wondered if we could enhance summiting by dosing flies with the juvenile hormone analog (JHA) methoprene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cerf and Georghiou, 1972</xref>). We topically applied methoprene at two different concentrations (2.5 and 5 μg). Surprisingly, these treatments led to a statistically non-significant reduction of summiting by 22.2 and 30.9% (p=0.13, 0.09, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>). We also tried to rescue the effects of precocene, either by co-application of methoprene (2.5 μg) or by feeding flies another JHA, pyriproxyfen (5 μg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Riddiford and Ashburner, 1991</xref>). Neither of these treatments rescued the effects of precocene treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that CA function is necessary for summiting, but that supplementing flies with JHA is not sufficient to elicit this behavior. It could be that the acute release of JH is critical for driving summiting or that the CA produces a specific cocktail of juvenile hormones that are not well mimicked by our drug treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A real-time, automated classifier for summiting behavior</title><p>Having identified a neurohormonal circuit that is required in the fly host for summiting, we next sought to investigate how the fungus gains access to this target and manipulates it to induce summiting. We reasoned that there may be physiological and anatomical differences between summiting and non-summiting flies that reflect causal mechanisms on the fungal side. These correlates likely degrade by the time the fly dies, so real-time identification of summiting flies is needed. We developed an automated classifier to identify summiting flies and alert an experimenter real-time. Our ground-truth dataset for training the classifier was made from a dataset of ~20 hr recordings of speed and y-position from 1306 <italic>E. muscae</italic>-exposed Canton-S flies, 345 of which were zombies. Each of the zombie traces was manually annotated with the time of summiting onset and time of death. Based on these timepoints, every frame was labeled as ‘pre-summiting,’ ‘during summiting,’ or ‘post-summiting.’ Every frame from survivor flies was labeled as ‘never summiting’ to reflect that they would not summit for the period of observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A random-forest classifier (RFC) for identifying summiting flies in real-time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: classes learned by the classifier for zombies were pre-summiting=prior to the onset of summiting (yellow), during summiting = after the onset of summiting but before the time of death (red), and post-summiting=after the time of death (black).

Occasionally, we observed holes within the axon bundle of PI-CA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but there was no indication of broken axons.

Males tend to be smaller than females, so this choice of sexes maximized the quantity of hemolymph we could extract while minimizing its dilution in recipients. We observed a modest (37%) but significant increase in the distance traveled between 80 and 90 min post-transfusion, in flies that received summiting hemolymph compared to controls that received non-summiting hemolymph (0.033&lt;p &lt;0.039; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

The fungus invades the brain as early as 48 hr prior to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>), establishing extensive SMP occupancy by at least 24 hr before death. When summiting behavior begins ~2.5 hr prior to death, the fungus has altered host hemolymph, likely via secretion of secondary metabolites. We hypothesize that these metabolites lead to the activation of PI-CA neurons, potentially via upstream DN1p clock neurons. In turn, we suspect that PI-CA activation stimulates the CA, leading to the release of JH. This hormone ultimately feeds back on the nervous system to generate the increase in locomotion at the heart of summiting. This framework unites the observations from many experiments and provides several specific hypotheses that we aim to tackle in future work.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed sequence of <italic>E.</italic><italic>muscae</italic>-induced summiting mechanisms in zombie flies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Events in the host brain leading to <italic>E. muscae</italic>-induced summiting.

If the fly was previously in a low position, such as on the ground, or, in our assay, on the food, the net effect of increased activity will be upward motion. Perhaps it may be easier for parasites to evolve to manipulate neural mechanisms underlying activity in general, rather than the more specific circuits mediating negative gravitaxis. Notably, flies tend to die in higher positions when they begin summiting in the middle of a long arena (as determined by the positioning of the food) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I</xref>). This implies that <italic>E. muscae</italic> induces both increased activity and negative gravitaxis (to some degree), which interact with the geometry of the arena and the position of the fly prior to behavioral manipulation, to produce the summiting phenotype. Enhanced locomotor activity (ELA) is emerging as a recurring theme in insect behavior manipulation, having now been reported as a result of parasitism by not only fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Boyce et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Trinh et al., 2021</xref>) but also viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kamita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">van Houte et al., 2012</xref>).

Dh44-positive PI neurons project to a population of hugin-positive neurons in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG), some of which send descending processes to the VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">King et al., 2017</xref>).

However, we did observe an effect of silencing hugin+ neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). While it remains to be seen if any PI-CA neurons express Dh44, it is likely there are multiple connections between the PI and neurosecretory organs, and these pathways collectively exert control over locomotion.

While thermogenetic activation of DN1ps and PI-CA neurons induced both males and females to locomote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), the effect was 22.4- and sixfold stronger in males, respectively. This difference is consistent with previous work implicating JH and the PI in sexually dimorphic locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gatti et al., 2000</xref>) and supports our conclusion that the CA and JH are the major output of DN1p and PI-CA neurons with respect to summiting. Given the sexually dimorphic effects of JH and ectopic PI-CA activation, one might expect strong sexual dimorphism in zombie summiting, but this is not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2M</xref>). We propose that the apparent absence of sexual dimorphism in summiting is a consequence of effective castration by the fungus. Histological data showed that summiting flies either have severely damaged gonads or lack them entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G1</xref>), similar to other instances of parasitic castration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cooley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ewen, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Lafferty and Kuris, 2009</xref>). As JHRs are present in gonads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baumann et al., 2017</xref>), it follows that in the absence of these sexually dimorphic tissues, JH-mediated behavioral differences between the sexes would be minimized.</p><p>We showed that summiting was reduced in <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected flies with ablated CA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or when treated with the JH synthesis inhibitor precocene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, we did not observe exacerbated summiting behavior in animals that had been treated with the juvenile hormone analog (JHA) methoprene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>) or a restoration of summiting behavior when animals received JHAs in addition to precocene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I</xref>). JH manipulations were not part of our initial screen, becoming a focus after the discovery of the role of the PI-CA neurons. We suspect that summiting is driven by an acute spike in JH starting ~2.5 hr before death, and our JHA experiments did not have this timing: methoprene was delivered in a single burst 20 hr prior to summiting and pyriproxyfen was administered chronically via the food. Second, we have strong reason to believe that whatever we applied to the fly was also making its way to the fungus (recall that healthy flies treated with both fluvastatin and methoprene were fine, but that this treatment was lethal for exposed flies <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, another possibility is that the fungus is metabolizing the JHAs before they have a behavioral effect. We did not detect JH in any of our metabolomic experiments, however, this was expected given that we used extraction and separation methods appropriate for polar, not hydrophobic, compounds. Future work leveraging targeted, high-sensitivity chemical detection of hydrophobic compounds is needed to verify that JH titers are indeed elevated during the transient summiting window.</p><p>The role of the CA in <italic>E. muscae</italic>-induced summiting is consistent with the growing list of examples of parasites exploiting host hormonal axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamo and Robinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beckage, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Herbison, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Tong et al., 2021</xref>). The JH pathway, in particular, has been shown to be modulated by a variety of insect parasites, ranging from nematodes to baculoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jiao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Nakai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Palli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Saito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Subrahmanyam and Ramakrishnan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). While there is a clear consensus that JH is involved in a multitude of host physiological and behavioral processes, the extent of JH’s activities in insects is still being uncovered. Our data reveal another role for JH in the fruit fly: mediating <italic>E. muscae</italic>-induced summiting behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Machine learning classification of summiting animals in real-time</title><p>Identifying the molecular and physiological correlates of summiting is challenging for several reasons: summiting behavior is subtle to a human observer, summiting lasts just a few hours within a specific circadian window, and flies’ small size makes procuring sufficient material non-trivial. To make such experiments possible, we developed an automated classifier to identify flies as early into summiting behavior as possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The random forest algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Breiman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Pedregosa et al., 2012</xref>) at the heart of our classifier identified time of day (evening), previous position (low), previous speed (low), and current speed (high) as key features identifying summiting flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The classifier achieved excellent precision and good recall on a novel cohort of exposed flies. By interfacing the classifier with an email alert system, we created a robust, scalable pipeline for procuring summiting flies for a variety of downstream experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Morphological correlates of summiting</title><p>Using our real-time classifier, we conducted a comparison of host morphology prior to and during summiting. Previous analyses of infection progression suggested that the fungus was not occupying the brain with any spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>), but here we found otherwise. There is a clear pattern of fungal cells densely invading the SMP of summiting flies, a neuropil that harbors DN1p axons and PI-CA cell bodies and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C and F</xref>). This concentration of fungal cells is apparent at least 72 hr after exposure to <italic>E. muscae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Fungal cells are present in the brain as early as 48 hr after exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Elya et al., 2018</xref>), and the exact timing of when they accumulate in the SMP remains to be established. The distribution of <italic>E. muscae</italic> across neuropils, which is consistent across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>)<italic>,</italic> is interesting both for where fungal cells are and are not found. Fungal cells are noticeably absent from the central complex, a pre-motor center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Strausfeld, 1976</xref>) that may be involved in coordinating walking during summiting. Though morphological examination suggested that fungal cells are displacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), rather than consuming, nervous tissue, more work is needed to determine if neurons are damaged or dying as a result of adjacent fungal cells. In addition, it remains unclear what role, if any, the pattern of fungal brain occupancy plays in the mechanism of summiting or if the fungal cells in the brain play a distinct role in behavior manipulation compared to those in the body cavity. Additional work is needed to address these questions.</p><p>We observed extensive degradation of host abdominal tissues in summiting animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We were stunned to find flies with obliterated guts and gonads walking apparently normally. Despite widespread destruction in the body, the CA and PI-CA neurons appear intact in summiting animals, which is consistent with an acute role in summiting. We speculate that the fungus might achieve preservation of these tissues by preferentially digesting the remaining host tissues from posterior to anterior. However, just because PI-CA neurons and the CA are present doesn’t mean they are functioning normally or at all. Future work should assess the physiology of these cells throughout the course of <italic>E. muscae</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Physiological correlates of summiting</title><p>We discovered that the permeability of the blood-brain barrier was increased in exposed flies, as determined by assaying RhoB retention in fly brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data suggest that BBB integrity degrades by the end of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), rather than rapidly after fungal exposure (by 21 hr) or upon fungal invasion of the nervous system (around 45 hr). A variety of insults, including bacterial infection, can lead to increased BBB permeability in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). We speculate that the progressive reduction in BBB integrity may result from the growing burden of the infection as the flies become sicker and sicker. In addition, the permeability of the BBB fluctuates over the day in a clock-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). If the host’s circadian system is disrupted during infection, this could also be a source of compromised BBB integrity.</p><p>We found that the hemolymph metabolome of exposed, summiting flies differs from that of exposed, non-summiting flies and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Three compounds of putative chemical formulae C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>16</sub>N<sub>6</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>19</sub>N<sub>2</sub>PS appeared unique to summiting flies but could not be identified further. These compounds are prime candidates for further studies. Seven other compounds were significantly more abundant in summiting versus non-summiting flies across our replicate experiments: three of these could not be identified (MW 276.08, 179.08, and 429.15 g/mol) and the other four were putatively identified as guanosine, uridine, cytosine, and 5-methylcytosine. Future collection of large quantities of summiting flies and fractionation approaches could be used to home in on compounds of interest and determine their chemical structure such that these compounds can be produced synthetically and assayed for behavioral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beckerson et al., 2022</xref>). Cytosine is a pyrimidine nucleobase used in both DNA and RNA, a core molecular building block. It is intriguing that it was only detected in fungus-exposed fly hemolymph. High levels of cytosine have also been detected in the hemolymph of <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>-infected silkworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and the serum of Sars-Cov2-infected humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Blasco et al., 2020</xref>), with cytosine levels actually being predictive of infection status. Notably, a major derivative of cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, is also more abundant in summiting than non-summiting hemolymph. We hypothesize that elevated levels of cytosine could be a general indicator of infection, and its specific correlation with summiting warrants further investigation.</p><p>We detected ergothioneine in flies exposed to the fungus, either summiting or non-summiting. Ergothioneine has been hypothesized to play a role in host tissue preservation in <italic>Ophiocordyceps</italic> manipulated ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Loreto and Hughes, 2019</xref>). Our data are consistent with ergothioneine being produced by <italic>E. muscae</italic>, but are not consistent with ergothioneine being produced only during summiting.</p><p>We saw that N-acetyldopamine (NADA), methionine sulfoxide, and trans-3-indoleacrylic acid were more abundant in non-summiting versus summiting flies. NADA is a product of dopamine (DA) breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Neckameyer and Leal, 2017</xref>) and has been found to inhibit CA synthesis of JHs in <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Granger et al., 2000</xref>). DA, on the other hand, has been detected in the CA of <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Krueger et al., 1990</xref>) and studies in bees suggest a positive correlation between dopamine (DA), JH, and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akasaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mezawa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To test whether hemolymph-circulating factors in summiting animals can cause an increase in locomotion, we transfused hemolymph from classifier-flagged summiting flies into fungus-exposed and non-exposed recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). In both of these experiments, recipient flies exhibited a significant increase in locomotion over ~1.5 hr post-transfusion. The effect size was modest (40% increase in total distance traveled in that interval), but this was not surprising as (1) we could only extract and transfer very small quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">MacMillan and Hughson, 2014</xref>) of hemolymph between animals and (2) this small quantity was diluted throughout the whole recipient fly’s body. Overall, this experiment provides direct evidence that one or more factors in the hemolymph of summiting flies cause summiting. The identity of these factors and their precise timing and origin of production (fungal or fly) remain mysteries that we hope to address in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>A mechanistic framework for summiting behavior and beyond</title><p>Our experiments have revealed key mechanisms likely to underlie the summiting behavior of zombie flies. <italic>E. muscae</italic> cells perturb the activity of circadian and neurosecretory neurons, leading to the release of JH and a resultant increase in locomotion. This effect is at least partially mediated by summiting-specific factors circulating in the hemolymph. Of course, many questions remain. What compounds mediate the effect of transfused hemolymph? What cells are targeted by these compounds and by what molecular mechanisms? Do the fungal cells need physical access to the brain to induce a full summiting response? Is the proximity of fungal cells adjacent to DN1p axons and PI during summiting merely a coincidence? Future work should use spatially-resolved transcriptomic, metabolomic, and immunohistochemical approaches to answer these questions.</p><p>It is likely there are yet-to-be-discovered circuit elements mediating summiting. Silencing PI-CA neurons or ablating the CA severely attenuated summiting, but did not completely eliminate it. The dispersal and survival of <italic>E. muscae</italic> depend on a robust summiting response in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Carruthers, 1981</xref>), and the co-evolutionary relationship between these species likely extends back 200–400 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Boomsma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Elya and De Fine Licht, 2021</xref>). Such a robust strategy is unlikely to rely on a single perturbation that could be countered by simple evolutionary changes in the host. An increase in locomotion can be achieved in many ways and is the likely output of many different behavioral circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bidaye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), so it would be unsurprising to find that multiple host circuits are targeted, including others yet to be discovered. Nevertheless, our study has identified a host pathway that likely mediates the predominant effects of the zombie fly summiting manipulation. These discoveries were made possible by studying summiting in a genetic model organism using high throughput behavioral assays. These tools and more will be essential to answer the many exciting questions arising from this work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Nine behavior boxes were assembled from laser-cut acrylic and extruded aluminum railing (80/20 LLC). Each box consists of a ⅛” black acrylic base supporting an edge-lit dual-channel white (5300 K) and infrared (850 nm) light LED board (KNEMA, Anyang City, South Korea), three ⅛” black acrylic sides, a ¼” black hinged door and a ⅛” black ceiling upon which is mounted a digital camera (ELP #USB130W01MT-FV, Shenzhen, China) equipped with an 87° C Wratten infrared longpass filter (B&amp;H Video #KO87C33O, New York City, New York). The summit arenas sit on a ⅛” clear acrylic board held 6–7 cm above the illuminator by fasteners in the aluminum rail supports. 850 nm infrared illumination (invisible to flies) is used for tracking and white illumination (visible to flies) provides 12 hr light:dark circadian cues. Intensity of infrared and white light was independently controlled by pulse-width modulation via a Teensy (v3.2, PJRC, Sherwood, OR) microcontroller mounted to a custom printed circuit board (PCB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Werkhoven et al., 2019</xref>). Each box’s camera and PCB connect to a dedicated Lenovo mini-tower PC running Windows 10 and Matlab v.2018b equipped with MARGO v.1.03, Matlab-based software optimized to track many objects simultaneously, to record centroid positions for each of the assayed flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Werkhoven et al., 2019</xref>).

All arenas were fabricated in arrays in acrylic trays that fit snugly into the assay boxes. Each arena includes a small hole at one end through which a fly can be aspirated and subsequently sealed using a small cotton ball. Arenas were 3.2 mm tall, allowing flies to walk freely and raise their wings, the final manipulation by <italic>E. muscae</italic>.</p><p>An early prototype summiting assay was angled at 90°, but we found that even with a sandpaper-roughened walking surface, dying flies struggled to maintain their grip on the vertical surface. This was manifested in two ways: (1) flies exhibited sudden, rapid downward movement in their behavioral traces consistent with falls and (2) <italic>E. muscae</italic>-killed flies were predominantly found at the bottom of the well at the end of the experiment. This was subsequently confirmed by reviewing videos taken from these experiments. To remedy this, we reduced the incline to 30°, which is sufficient for flies to respond behaviorally to the direction of gravity (M. Reiser, personal communication). This eliminated obvious falling bouts and yielded a wide range of final positions ranging from the bottom to the top of the arena.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Standard arena (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>)</title><p>Standard arenas measured 6.5 cm long by 0.5 cm wide by 0.32 cm tall and housed a single fly. Arenas were constructed in rows of 32 from three layers of ⅛” laser-cut acrylic consisting of a clear base manually roughened with 120 grit sandpaper, black walls, and a clear top. The layers were held together with 8–32 screws and nuts. A 3 mm loading hole in the lid at one end of the arena permitted the loading of an anesthetized fly with a paintbrush. This entry hole was sealed with a piece of dental cotton after the fly was loaded. A minimal medium, 5AS, was provided at the opposite end of the chamber. The end of the chamber with food was sealed with two layers of Parafilm to slow the desiccation of the food. Fully prepared (i.e. with food at the bottom and the loading hole sealed), the long axis of the arena had ~5 cm of open space. Each tray had four rows of arenas, for a total of 128 arenas per tray.

These layers were rotated 180° with respect to each other, leaving gaps in the floor and ceiling at opposite ends of the arena that could be filled with media. Thus, the total height of the arena, except at the ends, was 1/8”. Each chamber was 4.6 cm long and contained 5AS at one end, and 1.5% agar at the other. The lid layer consisted of ⅛” clear acrylic. Flies were loaded quickly into the arenas and the lid was placed before the flies could wake up.

A ruler was used to mark 1.5 cm above the top of the disc. 0–5-day-old flies of the experimental genotype were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub>, and 35 (~half male, ~half female) were transferred into the vial. The vial was capped with a Droso-Plug (Genesee #59–201) which was pushed down into the vial until the bottom was level with the 1.5 cm mark. For each experimental tray, three vials of flies were prepared in this way to expose a total of 105 flies; one additional vial of 35 flies was prepared identically but omitted cadavers as a non-exposed control. Together, these four vials were sufficient to fill a tray of 128 arenas. All prepared vials were incubated in a humid chamber (a small tupperware lined with deionized water-wetted paper towels) at 21 °C on a 12:12 L:D cycle. After 24 hr, the vials were removed from the humid chamber, and the Droso-plugs were pulled to the top of the vial to reduce fly crowding.</p><p>After 48–72 hr in the incubator, flies were loaded into the arenas using CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia. Flies loaded into arenas during scotophase (the dark period of their 12:12 L:D circadian cycle) were shielded from ambient light in a foil-lined cardboard box. To begin behavioral experiments, arena trays were placed in the summit assay box and flies were tracked starting between ZT17 and ZT20. Tracking proceeded until ZT13 the next day (day 4). If many flies remained alive, tracking continued until ZT13 the following day. Some experiments, particularly in periods of COVID-restricted lab access, ran unattended until ZT13 on day 6 or 7. This variation in the timing of the end of the experiment had no effect on our measured outcomes, since all behavioral data were analyzed with respect to times of fly death, and any tracking data after death were ignored.</p><p>Tracking data were collected at 3 Hz using the circadian experiment template (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo/tree/master/examples/Circadian">https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo/tree/master/examples/Circadian</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Werkhoven, 2018</xref>) in MARGO v1.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Werkhoven et al., 2019</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo">https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo</ext-link>) with the following settings: white light intensity 50%, infrared between 70–100%, adjusted to provide the best contrast for tracking, tracking threshold = 18, minimum area = 10, min trace duration = 6. Default settings were used for other configuration parameters. After tracking concluded, flies were manually scored as either alive (coded as survival = 1 and outcome = 0), dead with evidence of E. muscae sporulation (survival = 0, outcome = 1), or dead with no E. muscae sporulation (survival = 0, outcome = 0). These annotations were saved in a metadata file accompanying each MARGO output file and used in downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Summit behavior data analysis</title><p>For each tray of flies (N≤128), we generated an experiment metadata table that incorporated the manually-scored survival outcome described above as well as fly genotype, sex, and fungal exposure status (exposed or non-exposed). Experiment metadata along with tracking data were input into a Matlab-based analysis pipeline that proceeded through the following steps: (1) automatic denoising, (2) manual time of death calling, (3) behavioral trajectory alignment to time of death, (4) SM calculation, (5) effect size estimation. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://lab.debivort.org/zombie-summiting/">http://lab.debivort.org/zombie-summiting/</ext-link>.</p><p>The automatic denoising algorithm scanned speed throughout the experiment and flagged any ROIs that exhibited more than 20 instances per day of experimental time greater than ~40 mm/s. This threshold was chosen based on the examination of individual ROI speed traces as a value that would only be exceeded with noise. The bulk of noisy behavioral recordings arose when the flies’ position was erroneously tracked as moving along the long edges of the arenas. Denoising was achieved by reducing the horizontal width of the arena region-of-interest (ROI) and recalculating centroid trajectory until speed violations fell below the threshold or the ROI was trimmed to nine pixels, at which point its data was discarded.</p><p>Time of death was called manually for every cadaver (N=~23,500) by CE throughout this study by checking time-aligned plots of y position and speed. Time of death was estimated as the time the fly was last observed to exhibit walking behavior. Extremely slow changes in y-position and tracking jitter around a particular y-position were not considered to be walking behavior. These definitions were initially validated by comparing paired behavioral video and tracking data. ROIs were flagged if sparse tracking occurred or residual noise was so great that the time of death couldn’t be reasonably determined. These ROIs were dropped in subsequent analysis. For the gene and Gal4 screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), the scoring of time-of-death was not blind to the fly genotype; for all subsequent experiments, times of death were scored blind to the experimental group. Time of death was stored as a frame number in the experimental metadata file.</p><p>Denoised tracking data and experimental metadata with time-of-death calls were input into a script that performed the following tasks: (1) determined the earliest start time for all experiments and aligned all data relative to this timepoint. This was necessary as experiments were not all started at precisely the same time (e.g. one experiment may start at 5:08 pm, another at 5:24 pm); (2) categorized each fly-trajectory as either a zombie (cadaver), survivor (alive), or unexposed control (uninfected), based on experimental metadata; (3) randomly assigned a ‘time of death’ for survivor and control flies from the pool of observed times of death within cadavers for that genotype, to make data between groups more comparable; (4) align all fly behavioral (y position and speed) trajectories relative to their time of death; (5) output a variable containing aligned and original vectors of data by category (zombie, survivor, unexposed) for a given genotype.</p><p>To calculate the summit metric (SM) for each cadaver, we first determined the period of summiting. The beginning of summiting was defined as 2.5 hr before death. The speed trajectory was smoothed with a 1 hr sliding window average and the end of summiting was defined as the earliest moment when the smoothed speed dropped to the same level as the start of summiting. The speed trajectory was baseline corrected by subtracting the smoothed speed at the onset of summiting, and the area under the resulting curve during the period of summiting divided by the duration of summiting (end of summiting – the start of summiting) was taken as the value of SM. Thus, SM has units of distance/time and is a measure of speed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Summiting effect size estimate distributions were calculated by bootstrapping flies, separately in experimental and control groups, calculating the manipulation effect size as (mean(Experimental SM) – mean(Control SM))/mean(Control SM), over 1,00 resamplings. Distributions were plotted as kernel density estimates. Two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used to assess the significance of differences between SM in experimental and control groups. All reported p-values are nominal. Confidence intervals on time-varying data were calculated by bootstrapping individual flies over 1000 replicates and shading the original mean values and +/−1 standard deviation of the bootstrapped means.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Thermogenetic activation of DN1p and PI-CA</title><p>Unexposed flies (up to 8 days post eclosion) were loaded into standard summiting arenas (5AS food placed at y position = 0, 30° incline) and were tracked starting at ~ZT17 in a temperature-controlled room initially held at 21 °C, below the activation temperature of TrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>).

Donor tracking began at ~ZT17 and the summiting classifier was launched.</p><p>The next day, two experimenters, A and B for the purposes of this explanation, implemented the transfusion experiment from ZT8 until ZT12 or until 32 pairs of recipient flies had been transfused. Experimenter A collected donor flies; experimenter B performed the transfusions. Each transfusion began when a fly was flagged by the classifier (see <italic>Real-time summiting classifier</italic>) and Experimenter A was alerted via email. Experimenter A inspected behavioral traces to confirm the accuracy of the summiting classification and selected one of five identified non-summiters to serve as a time-matched control. Experimenter A then collected these flies from arenas via vacuum-assisted aspiration, anesthetized them with CO<sub>2</sub>, and placed them in adjacent wells of a 96-well plate on ice. Fly placement was randomized (i.e. sometimes the summiting fly was placed first, sometimes the non-summiting fly) and recorded before the plate was passed to Experimenter B. Thus, Experimenter B was blind to fly summiting status. Experimenter B then used a pulled capillary needle to remove ~50 nL of hemolymph from the first donor through the mesopleuron and injected this material into the mesopleuron of a cold-anesthetized recipient. The needle was rinsed thoroughly in molecular-grade water between transfusions. Immediately after transfusion, recipient flies were transferred to standard summiting arenas that were already in place in an imaging box and being tracked by MARGO. Tracking continued for no less than 3 hr after the final fly had been transfused. Used donor flies were transferred into individual housing and monitored for the next 48 hr for death by <italic>E. muscae</italic>.</p><p>Behavioral data were processed blind by Experimenter B. The time of recovery from anesthesia (i.e. resumption of locomotion) was manually determined for each fly based on its behavioral trace. Flies that did not recover or showed very little total movement were discarded from subsequent analysis. Fly summiting status was then revealed by Experimenter A to determine the average distance traveled vs time for each treatment group. After the data had been curated in this blinded manner, Experimenter A revealed the behavior calls for each donor to Experimenter B. Experimenter B used this information as well as donor outcome to determine the average distance traveled for each treatment group. Donors that were identified as summiting but failed to sporulate on the day of the experiment were interpreted as misclassified and their corresponding recipients were dropped from the analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Fly strains tested in summit inactivation screen.</title><p>Genotypes are abbreviated for lines deposited at stock centers, for clarity.

Aside from this, there are specific edits that have been recommended in the detailed reviews provided below that the authors would need to pay attention to.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really enjoyed reading this manuscript and appreciate how well the authors have used the fly model to study an otherwise intractable, but extremely interesting, biology and behaviour. There are a few points I wanted to make, most of which will likely only be addressed through textual edits.</p><p>– The manuscript consists of two parts – the timeline of the fungal infection with the metabalomics, and the neuromechanistic framework of the behaviour. The manner in which the story is currently presented leaves a few loose ends and the reader with the impression that these are two somewhat disjointed stories. I am sure that this can be addressed through some deft writing : For example, would it be possible, to begin with, the timeline of infection and metabolomics and end with the circuitry? This would also tie in with their preferred mechanistic model. I recognise the possible issues with this approach (not knowing the PI-CA axis, for example), but it might be worth considering ending the story on firmer ground, albeit with a few loose ends (see below).</p><p>– The authors identify two factors – Dh31 and CNMa – as responsible for summiting behaviour. This was not followed up, but neither was it explicitly set aside for the reader. I also didn't completely understand who secretes them (DPN1?) and it looks like there were other factors too, which were not addressed in the text. Were any of the JH pathway genes in their screen?</p><p>– The model the authors favour is one where the release of metabolites from the fungus might induce the PI-CA axis to induce the release of JH, which might stimulate the locomotory burst prior to summiting. Aspects of this have not been worked out. For example, based on this, one might expect an increase in activity of the DPN1&gt;PI&gt;PC neurons upon infection (possibly addressable by CaMPARI or a similar tool). One might also expect an increase in JH at the time of summiting. The link between the fungal infection timeline and the metabolite build-up was also not clear to me. Neither was the implication of the location of the fungal infection to the pathology (do the secreted molecules have anything to do with this?). I am not suggesting that these experiments be done (unless the authors think them feasible), but that the authors revisit their writing to explicitly address these loose ends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>If there was some evidence of change in circadian phase by manipulating the photoperiod or by using the knockdown of circadian genes, it would have been more helpful to imagine circadian control. The best evidence at this time is the fact that the event anticipates lights off by a few hours which suggests that it is not a startle response to some environmental factor. However, one cannot rule out with the current experiments that the lights-on which happened 12 hours ago had set in motion a series of steps that eventually culminated in the locomotion followed by death around ZT 10-11.</p><p>Ln 72-73 Reference de Bekker 2015 is incorrect, it should be de Bekker 2022.</p><p>Ln 85 – 90 While the facts that in all the examples cited, the behaviour happens at a specific time of day, it is not automatic that they are under circadian control – merely that there is a daily rhythmicity which suggests circadian control. Hence I would re-word this statement.</p><p>Ln 270 – That DN1p receives inputs from sLNv was not shown by Kaneko &amp; Hall. In fact, we have only indirect evidence and no proof that sLNv receives synaptic contact from sLNv – (recent connectomics data also suggest a total of 3 contacts, Shafer et al. 2022).</p><p>Ln 278 “DN1ps send their axons medially, with many projections terminating at or near the π (Kaneko and Hall, 2000).” This is not correct, DN1ps were not even categorised as such. Please refer to more recent literature (10.3389/fphys.2022.886432; Chatterjee et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Lamaze et al., 2018).</p><p>Figure 2 – S1 D What do the two N values depicted represent? Bold and grey font?</p><p>Ln 496 – Is this surprising that the BBB is disrupted, considering how heavily the nervous system has been infiltrated by the fungus as shown in previous figure 5? It's not clear whether the question is about the temporal sequence of events. As it is presented now, it appears that BBB being disrupted is obvious. The supplementary data suggests that its disruption increases over time.</p><p>Ln 509: include the method (LC-MS) for metabolomics in the text.</p><p>Authors may wish to clarify how they arrive at the current model of an enhanced break in the barrier at -2.5 hrs while the fungus is already detected in the SMP much before that (almost 48 hrs). There is something wrong with how the legend describes a dashed outline (Ln572-3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors write &quot;(Following the convention of Wolff and Rubin, 2018, the letters before the dash indicate the postsynaptic compartment, the letters after the presynaptic compartment).&quot;</p><p>Is this reversed? Should the letters before the dash indicate the presynaptic compartment?</p><p>What about the effects of the fungus on the thoracic and abdominal ganglions?</p><p>If injecting infected hemolymph is sufficient to trigger summiting behaviors, is the permeability of the BBB also affected by the infected hemolymph? Does this experiment indicate that the BBB effects are unimportant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85410.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Circadian control of the behaviour:</p><p>The authors identify a few circadian neurons in their screen and show that the behaviour is circadian-locked.

Rather, we interpret the data presented here as evidence that the host’s circadian network is exploited by the fungus to mediate the characteristic burst of pre-death locomotor activity that we refer to as summiting. We have added the following paragraph in the discussion (see Host circadian and pars intercerebralis neurons mediate summiting) to clarify this point:</p><p>“Our data indicate that the host circadian network is involved in mediating the increased locomotor activity that we now understand to define summiting. However, our data do not speak to how the timing of this behavior is determined in the zombie-fly system. That is, we have yet to address the mechanisms underlying the temporal gating of summiting and death. Our observation that <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected fruit flies continue to die at specific times of day in the absence of proximal lighting cues (Figure 1-S1) suggests that the timing of death is under circadian control and aligns with previous work in <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected house flies (Krasnoff et al., 1995). Given that molecular clocks are prevalent across the tree of life, it is likely that two clocks (one in the fly, one in <italic>E. muscae</italic>) are present in this system. Additional work is needed to determine if the host clock is required for the timing of death under free-running conditions and to assess if <italic>E. muscae</italic> can keep time.”</p><p>This paragraph references new supplementary data that we’ve added showing that infected flies continue to die in a gated fashion under free-running conditions, addressing the reviewer’s suggestion of experiments that alter photoperiod to demonstrate that this behavior is under circadian control (Figure 1-S1). We have accordingly added the following sentence in the Results section at the end of A novel assay to measure summiting behavior:</p><p>“As expected, wild-type flies killed by E. muscae tended to die in the evening (mean death time = ZT9:50 Figure 1E), but there was variability in the timing of death. 90% of all deaths occurred between ZT7 and ZT12. <italic>E. muscae</italic>-exposed flies continued to die at specific times of day even in complete darkness (Figure 1-S1), suggesting that the timing of death is under circadian control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The writing:</p><p>There are a few things the authors could fix and I am listing them below.</p><p>1. Better descriptions of the screens, their analyses of the screens, and the metabolomics in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this concern. We have improved the description of our summiting screen (see first paragraph under Summiting behavior requires host circadian and neurosecretory pathways) with the following bolded edits.</p><p>“With the understanding that a burst of activity shortly before death is the signature of summiting in this assay, we performed a screen to identify circuit and genetic components mediating summiting in the host fly. We adopted a candidate approach, but cast a wide net for neurons and genes involved in neuromodulation or previously implicated in arousal and gravitaxis (Figure 2A-C, Table 1). To disrupt neurons, we drove the expression of tetanus toxin (TNT-E; a vesicle release blocker; Keller et al., 2002) using 103 different (Gal4 drivers Table 1). The effect size of each of these perturbations on summiting behavior was estimated relative to a common heterozygous control (<italic>UAS-TNT-E</italic>/+), and confidence intervals on each effect size was calculated by bootstrapping (Figure 2B). Similarly, we screened 101 lines targeting candidate genes, either by pan-neuronally reducing their expression via RNAi (i.e., driving CNS-wide expression of short hairpin RNAs targeting the desired gene) or testing mutant alleles (Table 1). Again, effect sizes were estimated by comparing each line’s summiting metric to common control genotypes, for pan-neuronal RNAi, the heterozygous pan-neuronal driver (<italic>R57C10-Gal4</italic>/+); for mutants, wild-type (CantonS) control (Figure 2C). Genotype details and our rationales for including each line in the screen are given in Tables 1 and 2. In both the circuit and genetic screens we observed a range of effects on summiting from extreme impairment of the behavior (effect size -1) to rare amplification of summiting (effect size &gt; 0). Most perturbations had effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero.“</p><p>We have also elaborated on our analysis strategy for our screen data. The following are our revisions to the second paragraph under Summiting behavior requires host circadian and neurosecretory pathways:</p><p>“Our manipulations targeted low-level biological elements (single genes and sparse neuronal expression patterns, as well as some broad expression patterns). To determine what higher level systems might be <italic>E. muscae</italic>’s target, we looked for enrichment of large effect sizes in the genes (or circuit elements) involved in the same higher level functions (or brain regions). We binned the behavioral data for each reagent type (i.e., neurons or genes) into quintiles according to effect size, looked at annotation frequencies across these bins, and noted annotations that occurred in a given quintile more frequently than expected by chance (Figure 3D, E). We found that neurons in the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), subesophageal ganglion (SOG), circadian system, and pars intercerebralis (PI) were overrepresented in the quintile of most negative effect size (Figure 3D). Underscoring the potential importance of the PI, we observed that many of the neurons of large effect in the AMMC, SOG, and circadian system also innervated the π (Figure 3D – pink overlay). In a similar analysis for our genetic manipulations, we saw a clear enrichment for genes expressed in circadian cells (Figure 2E). Thus, our screen pointed conspicuously toward roles for the π and the circadian network in summiting behavior. “</p><p>We’ve also added more details of the metabolomics experiment in the main text (second paragraph under Evidence for the metabolic induction of summiting behavior)&gt;</p><p>“We next used LC-MS metabolomics to compare the molecular composition of hemolymph in summiting flies to that of exposed, non-summiting flies. We performed this experiment twice: once staging animals by hand based on flightlessness, which occurs during mid to late summiting (Figure 1B), and a second time using our automated classifier. For each experiment, we collected 1 μL samples of hemolymph bled from a pool of 20 mated females for each of three conditions: (1) healthy (unexposed flies), (2) exposed, non-summiting, and (3) summiting. Triplicate samples were analyzed when the classifier was employed (Figure 6-S2B) and duplicate samples were analyzed in the manual experiment (Figure 6-S2C). We found that 168 compounds were detected in both of these experiments (Figure 6B, Figure 6-S2A-C),…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Closure on the candidates they did not follow up, who might be secreting them, and whether JH was on their list.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer is asking for close on screened lines that had significant effects on summiting, but were not the focus of follow-up experiments. We have added additional descriptions of these hits in Figure 2F, and clarification as to who is secreting what:</p><p>“With these high level systems implicated as targets of fungal manipulation, we returned to a granular analysis to determine what specific circuit elements in circadian cells and the π best recapitulated the high level effects. We measured the summiting response of an individually tailored genetic control for each circadian gene and π or circadian circuit element (rather than screen-wide controls), and recalculated the effect size of each perturbation (Figure 2F,G). With respect to the circadian experiments, eleven mutants (Figure 2F) and four Gal4 lines (Figure 2G) showed impaired summiting compared to matched genetic background and/or sibling controls. Three different mutants of <italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Clk</italic>), a gene expressed in all clock cells, showed greatly reduced summiting behavior (62%-104%, 3.4e-28 &lt; p &lt; 7e-8). The cryptochrome gene (<italic>cry</italic>) encodes a blue light sensor expressed by a subset of circadian neurons that synchronizes the molecular oscillator with environmental lighting cues (Emery et al., 2000; Benito et al., 2008; Yoshii et al., 2008). A <italic>cry</italic> mutant and a pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of <italic>cry</italic> both showed reduced summiting (32%, p = 0.018; 45%, p = 0.00097, respectively).</p><p>We noticed that several of our hits affected a subtype of clock neurons, the group 1 posterior dorsal neurons (DN1ps). DN1ps are a heterogeneous population of neurons numbering approximately 15 cells per brain hemisphere (Ma et al., 2021). About half of DN1ps express <italic>cry</italic> (Yoshii et al., 2008). Silencing neurons with two drivers that label many, but not all, of the DN1ps (Clk4.1 and R18H11; Zhang et al., 2010; Kunst et al., 2014) via TNT-E expression reduced summiting by 24-25% (p = 0.005, 0.019; Figure 2G, Figure 2-S1B,C). However, silencing the entire population of DN1p neurons by driving the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (Baines et al., 2001) with a pan-DN1p driver had no apparent effect (Figure 2-S1D) as did silencing neurons labeled by an additional driver previously reported to be expressed in DN1ps (R51H05; Kunst et al., 2014). Silencing a sparser population of DN1ps (Clk4.5) with TNT-E led to an increase in summiting (Figure 2G). Genetic disruption of two signaling molecules expressed by DN1ps, Diuretic Hormone 31 (<italic>Dh31</italic>) and the neuropeptide CNMamide (<italic>CNMa</italic>), reduced summiting by 59 to 72% (3e-16 &lt; p &lt; 0.025; Figure 2F). However, flies mutant for the receptors that recognize these molecules (<italic>Dh31R</italic> and <italic>PdfR</italic> for <italic>Dh31</italic>; <italic>CNMaR</italic> for <italic>CNMa</italic>) did not show significantly impaired summiting (0.054&lt;p&lt;0.3), though <italic>Dh31R</italic> came close with a 33% impairment at p=0.054. Taken together, these results implicate DN1ps as mediating fungal manipulation while also revealing fine-scale complexity, as activity in some DN1ps, but not others, is required for full summiting.</p><p>DN1p activity is influenced by a class of pacemaker neurons called small ventrolateral neurons (sLNvs) (Zhang et al., 2010) that express the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf; Helfrich-Förster and Homberg, 1993; Renn et al., 1999). While one <italic>Pdf</italic> mutant (<italic>Pdf<sup>01</sup></italic>) exhibited a large, significant reduction in summiting (67%; p = 1.8e-16; Figure 2F), we saw no effect with another mutant whose <italic>Pdf</italic> locus was completely replaced (<italic>Pdf<sup>-</sup></italic>). We also did not observe a significant decrease in summiting in Pdf receptor (PdfR) mutants (0.3 &lt; p &lt; 0.38). Disrupting sLNVs by expressing TNT-E, channel Kir2.1, or pro-apoptotic protein hid (Grether et al., 1995) also had no effect on summiting (Figure 2-S1D, E). This suggests that the main population of clock neurons upstream of DN1ps is irrelevant for summiting.”</p><p>Genes involved in JH metabolism were not part of the initial screen, which we now mention in the discussion (see second paragraph of PI-CA neurons induce summiting via their connection to the corpora allata):</p><p>“We showed that summiting was reduced in <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected flies with ablated CA (Figure 3C) or when treated with the JH synthesis inhibitor precocene (Figure 3E). However, we did not observe exacerbated summiting behavior in animals that had been treated with the juvenile hormone analog (JHA) methoprene (Figure 3-S2H) or a restoration of summiting behavior when animals received JHAs in addition to precocene (Figure 3-S2I). JH manipulations were not part of our initial screen, becoming a focus after the discovery of the role of the PI-CA neurons.”</p><p>We also now clarify in the discussion that we didn’t detect JH in our metabolomics experiment (see fourth paragraph of PI-CA neurons induce summiting via their connection to the corpora allata):</p><p>“Thus, another possibility is that the fungus is metabolizing the JHAs before they have a behavioral effect. We did not detect JH in any of our metabolomic experiments, however this was expected given that we used extraction and separation methods appropriate for polar, not hydrophobic, compounds. Future work leveraging targeted, high-sensitivity chemical detection of hydrophobic compounds is needed to verify that JH titers are indeed elevated during the transient summiting window.”</p><p>Additional clarifying edits are described in the detailed responses to reviewer comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Aside from this, there are specific edits that have been recommended in the detailed reviews provided below that the authors would need to pay attention to.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We agree that there are many loose ends at this point, though we like to think of them as “future research opportunities.” We are hoping that the manuscript is nevertheless satisfying for addressing many aspects of the mechanisms of summiting.</p><p>We originally decided to organize the manuscript with the metabolomics at the end because this section culminates in an important, open question: what is the identity of the effector in the hemolymph? We thought that placing such an open question at the end of the manuscript was more appropriate than in the middle of the manuscript, as it segues naturally to the discussion of future work. We acknowledge that our narratively abruptly transitioned from results on fly neural circuits to fungal inputs. We have modified the text to ease this transition:</p><p>“Having identified a neurohormonal circuit that is required in the fly host for summiting, we next sought to investigate how the fungus gains access to this target and manipulates it to induce summiting. We reasoned that there may be physiological and anatomical differences between summiting and non-summiting flies that reflect causal mechanisms on the fungal side.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I really enjoyed reading this manuscript and appreciate how well the authors have used the fly model to study an otherwise intractable, but extremely interesting, biology and behaviour.

Aspects of this have not been worked out. For example, based on this, one might expect an increase in activity of the DPN1&gt;PI&gt;PC neurons upon infection (possibly addressable by CaMPARI or a similar tool). One might also expect an increase in JH at the time of summiting. The link between the fungal infection timeline and the metabolite build-up was also not clear to me. Neither was the implication of the location of the fungal infection to the pathology (do the secreted molecules have anything to do with this?). I am not suggesting that these experiments be done (unless the authors think them feasible), but that the authors revisit their writing to explicitly address these loose ends.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are many details of our proposed framework that have yet to be worked out. The scope of the mechanism that we proposed is very broad and we don’t think all details can be satisfactorily addressed in a single paper. That said, we have made various edits to better resolve these loose ends in the main text. For example, we made these changes:</p><p>Penultimate paragraph of Discussion: PI-CA neurons induce summiting via their connection to the corpora allata</p><p>“We showed that summiting was reduced in <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected flies with ablated CA (Figure 3C) or when treated with the JH synthesis inhibitor precocene (Figure 3E). However, we did not observe exacerbated summiting behavior in animals that had been treated with the juvenile hormone analog (JHA) methoprene (Figure 3-S2H) or a restoration of summiting behavior when animals received JHAs in addition to precocene (Figure 3-S2I). JH manipulations were not part of our initial screen, becoming a focus after the discovery of the role of the PI-CA neurons. We suspect that summiting is driven by an acute spike in JH starting ~2.5 hours before death, and our JHA experiments did not have this timing: methoprene was delivered in a single burst 20 hours prior to summiting and pyriproxyfen was administered chronically via the food. Secondly, we have strong reason to believe that whatever we applied to the fly was also making its way to the fungus (recall that healthy flies treated with both fluvastatin and methoprene were fine, but that this treatment was lethal for exposed flies (Figure 3-S2D)). Thus, another possibility is that the fungus is metabolizing the JHAs before they have a behavioral effect. We did not detect JH in any of our metabolomic experiments, however this was expected given that we used extraction and separation methods appropriate for polar, not hydrophobic, compounds. Future work leveraging targeted, high-sensitivity chemical detection of hydrophobic compounds is needed to verify that JH titers are indeed elevated during the transient summiting window.”</p><p>First paragraph of Discussion: Host circadian and pars intercerebralis neurons mediate summiting</p><p>“We leveraged our high throughput assay to screen for fly circuit elements mediating summiting and found evidence for the involvement of circadian and neurosecretory systems (Figure 2A-E). We identified two specific neuronal populations important for summiting: DN1p circadian neurons labeled by <italic>Clk4.1-Gal4</italic> (Figure 2F) and a small population of PI-CA neurons labeled by <italic>R19G10-Gal4</italic> (Figure 2G). Silencing these neurons significantly reduced summiting and ectopically activating them induced a summiting-like burst of locomotor activity (Figure 2I-K). These neurons are likely part of the same circuit; the projection of DN1ps to the π has been confirmed both anatomically (Cavanaugh, et al., 2014) and functionally (Barber et al., 2021). Future work to visualize PI-CA and DN1p activity during summiting is needed to verify this assertion.”</p><p>First paragraph of Discussion: Morphological correlates of summiting</p><p>“The distribution of <italic>E. muscae</italic> across neuropils, which is consistent across animals (Figure 5C)<italic>,</italic> is interesting both for where fungal cells are and are not found. Fungal cells are noticeably absent from the central complex, a pre-motor center (Bender et al., 2010; Strausfeld, 1976) that may be involved in coordinating walking during summiting. Though morphological examination suggested that fungal cells are displacing (Figure 5-S1B), rather than consuming, nervous tissue, more work is needed to determine if neurons are damaged or dying as a result of adjacent fungal cells. In addition, it remains unclear what role, if any, the pattern of fungal brain occupancy plays in the mechanism of summiting or if the fungal cells in the brain play a distinct role in behavior manipulation compared to those in the body cavity. Additional work is needed to address these questions.”</p><p>Last paragraph of Discussion: Physiological correlates of summiting</p><p>“To test whether hemolymph-circulating factors in summiting animals can cause an increase in locomotion, we transfused hemolymph from classifier-flagged summiting flies into fungus-exposed and non-exposed recipients (Figure 6C,D). In both of these experiments, recipient flies exhibited a significant increase in locomotion over ~1.5 hours post-transfusion. The effect size was modest (40% increase in total distance traveled in that interval), but this was not surprising as (1) we could only extract and transfer very small quantities (MacMillan et al., 2014) of hemolymph between animals and (2) this small quantity was diluted throughout the whole recipient fly’s body. Overall, this experiment provides direct evidence that one or more factors in the hemolymph of summiting flies cause summiting. The identity of these factors and their precise timing and origin of production (fungal or fly) remain mysteries that we hope to address in future studies.”</p><p>Looking at neural activity in π cells during summiting is a great idea, but will require improvement of existing techniques in order to be viable. We attempted to measure Ca++ levels in DN1ps and PI-CA neurons using 2-photon imaging during application of hemolymph from summiting flies to the saline bath. These experiments were not successful for technical reasons, predominantly difficulties constructing a flow chamber to direct a tiny volume of summiting hemolymph to perfuse a living fly brain without getting lost in the bulk volume of saline, while at the same maintaining oxygenation of tissues. We hope to resolve these challenges and do this experiment in the future. We likewise attempted R19G10&gt;Campari experiments, but did not detect a signal in positive control flies that expressed Campari under pan-neuronal-Gal4 and were exposed to apple cider vinegar. At that point, we set these experiments aside, concerned that the UV needed to activate Campari might interfere with the fungus, whose effects are light- and heat-sensitive. Like the GCaMP experiments, we feel these technical challenges are worth revisiting in the future.</p><p>We attempted to measure JH levels to test our hypothesis, but were unable to reliably detect JH in summiting hemolymph. We hypothesize that circulating JH titers could be exceptionally low due to a few possibilities: (1) acute starvation (production of JH is regulated by nutritional state, e.g., Clifton &amp; Noriega, 2012, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2012.05.005), (2) degradation by <italic>E. muscae</italic> (we have observed that compounds we’ve tried to deliver to the fly via injection/feeding have wound up affecting the fungus – fluvastatin, dextran-labeled beads). We speculate that the local release of JH from the intact CA is sufficient to drive behavior. However, given the quantities of material involved, we haven’t yet been able to do that experiment.</p><p>We don’t yet understand the kinetics of metabolomic changes. We have only sampled time-matched non-summiting and summiting animals. We also do not yet understand whether the localization of fungal cells in the brain is important for driving summiting, just that a specific pattern of occupancy correlates with summiting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>If there was some evidence of change in circadian phase by manipulating the photoperiod or by using the knockdown of circadian genes, it would have been more helpful to imagine circadian control. The best evidence at this time is the fact that the event anticipates lights off by a few hours which suggests that it is not a startle response to some environmental factor. However, one cannot rule out with the current experiments that the lights-on which happened 12 hours ago had set in motion a series of steps that eventually culminated in the locomotion followed by death around ZT 10-11.</p></disp-quote><p>We are similarly intrigued by the mechanism of timing of summit behavior. We regret not having clearly stated this in our manuscript. As mentioned above, we have added a paragraph in Host circadian and pars intercerebralis neurons mediate summiting to clarify this point.</p><p>“Our data indicate that the host circadian network is involved in mediating the increased locomotor activity that we now understand to define summiting. However, our data do not speak to how the timing of this behavior is determined in the zombie-fly system. That is, we have yet to address the mechanisms underlying the temporal gating of summiting and death. Our observation that <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected fruit flies continue to die at specific times of day in the absence of proximal lighting cues (Figure 1-S1) suggests that the timing of death is under circadian control and aligns with previous work in <italic>E. muscae</italic>-infected house flies (Krasnoff et al., 1995). Given that molecular clocks are prevalent across the tree of life, it is likely that two clocks (one in the fly, one in <italic>E. muscae</italic>) are present in this system. Additional work is needed to determine if the host clock is required for the timing of death under free-running conditions and to assess if <italic>E. muscae</italic> can keep time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 72-73 Reference de Bekker 2015 is incorrect, it should be de Bekker 2022</p></disp-quote><p>We have double-checked the cited reference and believe it to be correct.
