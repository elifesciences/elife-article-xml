of mammals are lined with cartilage, comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in a specialized extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21074.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21074.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21074.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cartilage is a flexible tissue that cushions the joints in our body, allowing them to move smoothly. It is made of cells called chondrocytes that are surrounded by a scaffold of proteins known as the extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes regularly experience mechanical forces, which can arise from the movement of fluid within the joints or be transmitted to chondrocytes via the extracellular matrix. These cells sense mechanical forces by a process known as mechanotransduction, which allows chondrocytes to alter the composition of the extracellular matrix in order to maintain an appropriate amount of cartilage. If mechanotransduction pathways are disrupted, the cartilage may become damaged, which can result in osteoarthritis and other painful joint diseases.</p><p>The membrane that surrounds a chondrocyte contains proteins known as ion channels that are responsible for sensing mechanical forces. The channels open in response to mechanical forces to allow ions to flow into the cell. This movement of ions generates electrical signals that result in changes to the production of extracellular matrix proteins. However, there is little direct evidence that mechanical forces can activate ion channels in chondrocytes and it not known how these cells respond to different types of forces.</p><p>To address these questions, Servin-Vences et al. exposed chondrocytes from mice to mechanical forces either at the point of contact between the cell and its surrounding matrix, or to stretch the cell membrane. The experiments show that two ion channels called PIEZO1 and TRPV4 both generate electrical currents in response to forces transmitted between cells and the extracellular matrix. However, only PIEZO1 generates a current when the cell membrane is stretched. Thus, chondrocytes are able to distinguish between different types of mechanical forces.</p><p>More work is needed to understand how mechanical forces are able to activate these ion channels. Understanding how these processes work at the molecular level will hopefully lead to new therapies that boost cartilage production to treat joint diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21074.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21074.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mechanoelectrical transduction</kwd><kwd>PIEZO1</kwd><kwd>TRPV4</kwd><kwd>chondrocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB958 (A09)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewin</surname><given-names>Gary R</given-names></name><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cecile Vogt Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001773</institution-id><institution>University of New South Wales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GoldStar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The application of different types of mechanical stimuli to chondrocytes, either by stretching the membrane or deflecting cell-substrate contacts, reveals that there are distinct but overlapping mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in these cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In diarthrodial joints, which allow a large degree of movement, the surfaces of the opposing bones are lined with hyaline cartilage which reduces friction. This tissue is avascular and non-innervated and comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). Production and homeostatic maintenance of cartilage structure is dependent on chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 1996</xref>). Chondrocytes sense changes in the physical microenvironment and mechanical loading within the joints and adjust the balance of anabolic and catabolic processes to maintain the integrity and physical properties of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldring and Marcu, 2009</xref>). Disrupting these homeostatic processes can lead to osteoarthritis (OA) whereby inappropriate activation of catabolic pathways leads to cartilage degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997b</xref>). It is therefore important to define how chondrocytes respond to mechanical stimuli and to understand how the sensitivity of the mechanotransduction pathways is modulated as both excessive and insufficient mechanical loading of the joint can lead to joint dysfunction.</p><p>Chondrocytes are embedded within a complex, viscoelastic environment formed by specialized ECM, proteoglycans and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sophia Fox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mow et al., 1984</xref>). Physiologically, the cartilage is subjected to a spectrum of mechanical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez-Adams and Athanasiou, 2011</xref>). Cartilage is regularly impacted by compressive forces that are initially carried by the fluid phase, before being transferred to the elastic ECM molecules within the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mow et al., 1980</xref>). The movement of fluid within the joints also generates shear forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2008</xref>), whereas tensile forces are transmitted to chondrocytes via the surrounding pericellular matrix (PCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guilak et al., 2006</xref>). Given the biomechanical complexity of this system, it is difficult to model precisely how these various mechanical inputs are experienced by the cells; however, in the simplest terms, cells will experience mechanical stimuli propagated both via the fluid phase and via the matrix to which the cells are bound.</p><p>Cellular mechanotransduction depends on a number of distinct processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2012</xref>) including channel-mediated ionic flux across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nilius and Honoré, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martinac, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnadóttir and Chalfie, 2010</xref>), integrin-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schwartz, 2010</xref>), action of strain gauge proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirata et al., 2008</xref>) or cytoskeleton-mediated transfer of mechanical signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maniotis et al., 1997</xref>). In chondrocytes, a number of these pathways have been implicated in the mechanotransduction that is required for homeostasis; however, in this study, we focus on the role of mechanically gated ion channels. We refer here to channel-mediated mechanotransduction as <italic>mechanoelectrical transduction</italic> in order to distinguish this process from parallel mechanotransduction mechanisms.</p><p>It has long been proposed that ion channels play a role in the process of chondrocyte mechanotransduction. Hyperpolarization of chondrocytes on application of mechanical loads is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wright et al., 1996</xref>) and matrix production is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mouw et al., 2007</xref>) in the presence of GdCl<sub>3</sub>, a non-specific inhibitor of mechanically gated ion channel activity. Blocking the TRPV4 ion channel using a specific antagonist (GSK205) inhibits matrix production in response to compressive mechanical stimulation and the TRPV4 agonist, GSK1016790A, stimulates matrix production in the absence of mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Conor et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, mutations in the human <italic>TRPV4</italic> gene can lead to joint dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamandé et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loukin et al., 2010</xref>). In mouse models, a global <italic>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> knockout leads to an increased susceptibility to obesity-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Conor et al., 2013</xref>) and age-related OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2010</xref>), whereas conditional knockout of <italic>Trpv4</italic> in adult cartilage decreases the risk of age-related OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Conor et al., 2016</xref>). Despite this growing body of evidence that TRPV4 is directly involved in chondrocyte mechanotransduction, no evidence for gating of TRPV4 by mechanical stimuli (other than osmotic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lechner et al., 2011</xref>), and membrane-stretch in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loukin et al., 2010</xref>)) has been presented. More recently, it has been shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in isolated porcine chondrocytes (detected using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) are reduced when the mechanically gated <italic>Piezo1</italic> and <italic>Piezo2</italic> channel transcripts are knocked down using siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 have been demonstrated to mediate mechanically gated ion currents in neuronal cells and neuronal cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coste et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ranade et al., 2014a</xref>). Beyond the nervous system, PIEZO1 has been found to be functionally relevant in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>), urothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>), tubal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peyronnet et al., 2013</xref>), erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>), as well as in porcine chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2014</xref>). However, in these non-neuronal cell types there has, to date, only been one publication that has directly measured mechanical activation of ion channels in intact cells and a reduction in channel gating when PIEZO1 is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peyronnet et al., 2013</xref>). What has been lacking is: (1) a direct demonstration of mechanically gated channel activity in chondrocytes; (2) a quantitative analysis of the relative contributions of distinct mechanically gated ion channels in chondrocyte mechanotransduction and (3) an analysis of how chondrocytes respond to distinct mechanical stimuli.</p><p>Here, we have used an experimental approach wherein we apply mechanical stimuli at cell-substrate contact points and concurrently monitor membrane currents using whole-cell patch-clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). This approach allows us to measure channel activity in response to mechanical stimuli that are applied via connections to the substrate. Using this approach, we show that we can measure mechanically gated currents in intact chondrocytes. To the best of our knowledge, these measurements represent the first direct demonstration of mechanically gated ion channel activity in primary chondrocytes. We have further demonstrated that both the TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to this current and that, in particular for TRPV4, the nature of the membrane environment and applied stimulus are crucial for channel gating.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary, murine chondrocyte cultures</title><p>To study mechanically gated ion channels in chondrocytes, we prepared primary cells from mouse articular cartilage isolated from the knees and femoral heads of 4- to 5-day-old mouse pups.

The cells attached and initially exhibited the spherical morphology typical of chondrocytes. Within 3 hr, the morphology of a subset of cells became more fibroblast-like as the cells dedifferentiated. We investigated whether the chondrocytes and the cells that had dedifferentiated in situ exhibited similar mechanoelectrical transduction properties in order to determine if these cells with distinct morphologies could be treated as a coherent sample. The application of stimuli to the chondrocytes evoked deflection-gated inward currents in 88.9% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (24/27 cells). Deflection-gated currents were also observed in dedifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (88.2% (15/17 cells)). The kinetics of these currents suggested a channel directly gated by mechanical stimuli (chondrocyte currents: latency = 3.6 ± 0.3 ms, activation time constant (τ<sub>1</sub>) = 1.7 ± 0.3 ms, dedifferentiated cell currents: latency = 3.1 ± 0.3 ms, τ<sub>1</sub> = 1.4 ± 0.3 ms, mean ± s.e.m., n = 99 and 109 currents, measured across 24 chondrocytes and 15 dedifferentiated cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that both the latency and the τ<sub>1</sub> values were significantly faster for currents measured in the dedifferentiated cells (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.018, p=0.04, respectively). In addition, whilst no significant difference was noted in the τ<sub>2</sub> values (p=0.19), the variance in the τ<sub>2</sub> of currents measured in dedifferentiated cells was significantly higher compared to chondrocytes (F test, p&lt;0.0001, n = 109 and 99 currents, respectively). These data demonstrate ion channel-mediated mechanoelectrical transduction in chondrocytes. Such measurements have previously proven impossible due to application of techniques incompatible with simultaneous patch-clamp analysis or that result in the destruction of cellular integrity before any mechanical activation of ion channels can be observed, such as cellular indentation of chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chondrocytes and dedifferentiated cells display distinct mechanosensitivity</title><p>An advantage of applying stimuli via pillar arrays is that the stimuli are applied to a defined area of membrane. We therefore quantified the magnitude of each applied stimulus, and compared the sensitivity of mechanoelectrical transduction in distinct subsets of cells. Each individual pilus acts as a light guide, such that the center can be calculated from a 2D Gaussian fit of intensity values within a bright-field image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">du Roure et al., 2005</xref>). An image was taken before, during and after the stimulus, and the magnitude of each deflection was subsequently calculated from the difference between the coordinates of the center of the pilus in successive images.</p><p>In order to collect stimulus-response data, we applied stimuli across the range 1–1000 nm to each cell and measured the currents that were evoked. To compare the sensitivity of the mechanoelectrical transduction in chondrocytes versus dedifferentiated cells, our analysis included only those cells that responded to at least one stimulus within the 1–1000 nm range. We binned current amplitude data by stimulus size and averaged across cells for each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In addition, the smallest stimulus required to gate currents was significantly lower for the dedifferentiated cells, compared to chondrocytes (59 ± 13 nm (mean ± s.e.m., 15 cells); 252 ± 68 nm (mean ± s.e.m., 24 cells), Mann-Whitney test p<italic>=</italic>0.028) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

PIEZO1 exhibited large amplitude (&gt;50 pA) and robust macroscopic currents in response to pressure-stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel). We also confirmed that PIEZO1 responds to indentation stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, center panel), in accordance with published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coste et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peyronnet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gottlieb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2016</xref>).

Given that such an experimental approach requires access to the cell membrane, our studies have been conducted on chondrocytes in a 2D environment, as opposed to the 3D environment found in vivo.</p><p>Using pillar arrays, we were able to determine that the average substrate-deflection required for channel gating in chondrocytes was 252 ± 68 nm. Accordingly, chondrocyte mechanoelectrical transduction sensitivity to stimuli applied at the cell-substrate interface does not rival that of mechanoreceptor sensory neurons (known for their low mechanical threshold) but is comparable with the higher mechanoelectrical transduction threshold of nociceptive sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poole et al., 2014</xref>). Within the cartilage, chondrocytes are subjected to deformation but these shape changes are markedly different depending on the specific joint region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). However, changes of 10–15% along the chondrocyte height axis in response to mechanical loading have been measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amini et al., 2010</xref>). Given that such changes represent average differences in cell length of &gt;1 µm, this threshold lies within the range of conceivable membrane displacements that would occur in situ.</p><p>There is variation in the amplitude of the mechanically gated currents measured in response to pillar deflections, resulting in data with large error bars. We have noted this variability in all systems tested to date: sensory mechanoreceptive neurons, sensory nociceptive neurons, Neuro2A cells and HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing either PIEZO1 or PIEZO2. There are two likely reasons for this variability. Firstly, the pillar deflection stimuli are applied to a 10 μm<sup>2</sup> contact area between the cell and the pilus, restricting the number of potentially activated domains and resulting in noisier data than methods where stimuli are applied over a larger area, e.g. indentation. Secondly, stimuli are applied via dynamic cell-substrate contact points, likely introducing additional confounding factors such as changes in the local mechanical environment dictated by adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton. It is interesting to note that, despite clear differences in mechanosensitivity between chondrocytes and dedifferentiated cells measured using pillar arrays, no differences were observed when HSPC was used to apply pressure-stimuli to membrane patches. This phenomenon may reflect differences in the mechanical environment of the cell matrix contact points in the spherical chondrocytes versus the flattened edges of the dedifferentiated cells that display a more fibroblast-like morphology. These data suggest that the behavior of mechanically gated channels in response to membrane stretch cannot be directly related to channel function when stimuli are applied via cell-substrate contact points and suggests that distinct pathways may mediate mechanoelectrical transduction within the cartilage in response to applied forces that stretch the membrane versus those forces propagated via movements within the matrix.</p><p>The elements of the pillar arrays are elastomeric cylinders, i.e. springs, meaning that the deflection of each pilus can be converted into a corresponding restoring force, using Hooke’s Law (see Materials and methods). When we applied this conversion to our deflection data we obtained an average threshold for current activation of 63 nN in chondrocytes when deflection stimuli are applied to a 10 µm<sup>2</sup> patch of membrane, i.e. approximately 2% of the cell surface. These data do not indicate the force that is transferred to the mechanically gated ion channel, and this value for the restoring force will also be influenced by the mechanical properties of the cell at the cell-pilus contact. However, given that the elasticity of chondrocytes (approx. 1 kPa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trickey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shieh and Athanasiou, 2006</xref>)) is three orders of magnitude lower than that of the substrate (2 MPa(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poole et al., 2014</xref>)), the influence of the mechanical properties of the cell on the restoring force will be minimal. These data allow a first comparison with earlier studies that investigated chondrocyte responses to compression. The calculated threshold for transduction in response to pillar deflection is almost 10x smaller than the compressive forces, applied to the whole cell, required in order to generate a robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (500 nN, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2014</xref>)). This comparison suggests that current activation is more sensitive to deflections applied at the cell-substrate interface than to whole-cell compression.</p><p>We have found that both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 are involved in mediating deflection-gated currents in chondrocytes. In the light of recent work on TRPV4 and PIEZO1 in porcine chondrocytes, it has been proposed that TRPV4 responds to fine mechanical stimuli and PIEZO1 to injurious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boettner et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, studies using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to measure mechanotransduction in response to substrate-stretch in urothelial cells found that PIEZO1 mediates cellular mechanosensitivity in response to smaller stimuli than TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>). In both cases, the ‘readout’ of mechanotransduction is down-stream of the mechanoelectrical transduction event, monitoring alterations in matrix production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Conor et al., 2014</xref>) or changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Conor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyamoto et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the relative differences in mechanosenstivity that depend on TRPV4 or PIEZO1 expression in the two systems could either reflect (a) differential modulation of channel sensitivity in distinct tissues by accessory molecules (as previously demonstrated for PIEZO1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Poole et al., 2014</xref>]) or (b) that the pathways downstream of the channel event amplify the signal in a differential fashion. These two possibilities are also not mutually exclusive. Our data suggest that, in chondrocytes, it is the downstream amplification of the original mechanoelectrical transduction current that differs, as we observed very similar effects on mechanoelectrical transduction sensitivity when either TRPV4 or PIEZO1 levels were ablated. Some care does need to be taken with this interpretation due to the fact that a specific TRPV4-antagonist acutely and reversibly blocked 87% of the deflection-gated current, yet chondrocytes from <italic>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice did not display a similar reduction in current amplitude. We conclude that the chronic loss of one mechanosensitive channel in chondrocytes can be compensated for by other molecules, particularly given the fact that both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 were found to be active in all viable chondrocytes isolated from the articular cartilage. Such a conclusion supports the theory that there are multiple redundancies in mechanoelectrical transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnadóttir and Chalfie, 2010</xref>) and highlights the possibility that potentially more mechanically gated channels await discovery.</p><p>Whilst both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 are required for normal mechanoelectrical transduction in response to substrate deflections, only PIEZO1 is required for normal current activation in HSPC measurements. A recent paper has demonstrated that PIEZO1 gating can be directly mediated by changes in membrane tension in membrane blebs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting an underlying mechanism for this stretch-mediated channel gating. In our experiments, when <italic>Piezo1</italic> transcript levels in chondrocytes were knocked-down using miRNA, stretch-activated currents largely disappeared, whereas a complete absence of TRPV4 did not significantly change the peak current amplitude nor the P<sub>50</sub>, in comparison with WT chondrocytes. This is a clear demonstration that current activation in response to membrane stretch cannot be used as an indicator of the overall mechanoelectrical transduction pathways within a cell. In addition, this observation highlights the impact of quantitative measurements of channel activity when precise stimuli are applied directly to a specific membrane environment, such as the cell-substrate interface.</p><p>Our data suggest that both PIEZO1 and TRPV4 similarly contribute to mechanoelectrical transduction of nanoscale deflection-stimuli in chondrocytes, whilst differing in their response to membrane stretch. We therefore addressed whether the two channels behave similarly in a heterologous system. We confirmed that TRPV4, unlike PIEZO1, is not efficiently gated by pressure-induced membrane-stretch, and demonstrated that TRPV4 is not activated by cellular indentation. It has previously been shown that TRPV4 can be gated by membrane-stretch in <italic>X. laevis</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loukin et al., 2010</xref>); however, the recording conditions used to demonstrate this effect all promote TRPV4 channel gating (holding potential + 50 mV, 20 mM Sodium Citrate and a pH of 4.5). Taken together with our observations, these data suggest that whilst TRPV4 can be gated by pressure stimuli, this process is not particularly efficient. However, we observed that HEK-293 cells expressing TRPV4 are more sensitive to mechanical stimuli applied at cell-substrate contact points than HEK-293 cells expressing PIEZO1. For TRPV4-expressing cells, the latency between stimulus and response (&lt;2 ms, indistinguishable from PIEZO1 expressing cells) and the activation time constant (&lt;0.5 ms, significantly faster than PIEZO1-expressing cells) suggest that, in response to deflection stimuli, TRPV4 is directly gated by the mechanical stimulus. These data directly address the long-standing question of whether TRPV4 is a mechanically gated channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen and Corey, 2007</xref>). A number of criteria have been proposed to determine whether a channel is mechanically gated: the latency of current activation should be less than 5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen and Corey, 2007</xref>), the channel should be present in mechanosensitive cells, ablation of the channel should eliminate the response, expression of the channel in a heterologous system should produce mechanically gated currents and there should be an effect on mechanotransduction processes in vivo when the channel is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnadóttir and Chalfie, 2010</xref>). As shown in this study, TRPV4-mediated current activation occurs with sufficiently rapid latencies. TRPV4 is expressed in the chondrocytes (along with other mechanosensory cells): its deletion leads to a reduction in mechanotransduction, in WT chondrocytes mechanotransduction currents are largely blocked by a TRPV4 antagonist and <italic>Trpv4<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are more likely to develop OA (although given the polymodal nature of TRPV4 these changes do not definitively reflect changes in mechanoelectrical transduction). In addition, we demonstrate here that TRPV4 mediates mechanically-gated currents in response to substrate deflections in a heterologous system. Whilst the loss of this channel does not produce a complete loss of current, the observed redundancy in mechanoelectrical transduction pathways suggests that this criterion is too stringent.</p><p>We propose that studying how mechanically gated channels function when stimuli are applied at cell-substrate contact points will prove instrumental in elucidating the role of both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 in mechanosensing pathways in additional cell types. PIEZO1 has recently been shown to be inherently mechanosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the data that we present here suggests that TRPV4 mechanosensitivity depends on the type of stimulus and the membrane compartment to which stimuli are applied. We speculate that differences in channel gating in response to physical stimuli applied to distinct membrane compartments represents a mechanism by which cells can promote mechanoelectrical transduction events to changes in the surrounding matrix without increasing cellular sensitivity to localized membrane stretch. As such, the direct measurement of mechanically gated ion channel activity in response to stimuli applied via cell-substrate contact points is essential in order to understand how cells respond to changes in their immediate physical environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>The mouse-<italic>TRPV4</italic> in pcDNA3 plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Veit Flockerzi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wissenbach et al., 2000</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Kenton Swartz, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the skeletal system, cartilage that covers bone joints, and chondrocytes present within cartilage, is exposed to extensive mechanical changes. Response of chondrocytes to mechanical stimulation has been well characterized but the mechanotransduction channel or the molecular mechanism involved in sensing biophysical changes in this environment remains elusive.</p><p>There is evidence in the literature implicating TrpV4 in chondrocyte mechanotransduction but none conclusively demonstrating that they are mechanically activated ion channels. For example, mutations in Trpv4 have been implicated in skeletal dysplasia and joint dysfunction, and mice lacking TrpV4 are easily susceptible to osteoarthritis, a condition caused due to disrupted extracellular matrix homeostasis in chondrocytes. However, TRPV4 is a polymodal sensor activated by a variety of stimuli, and nailing down a role of TRPV4 mechanotransduction in vivo has been a challenge. On the other hand, Piezos are bona fide mechanically activated ion channels, but their role as the primary mechanotransducer in murine chondrocyte biophysics hasn't been explored yet.</p><p>In the current manuscript Servin-Vences et al. address the role of Piezo1 and TrpV4 in chondrocyte mechanotransduction. As a first, they report mechanically activated currents recorded from primary murine chondrocytes, and show that Piezo1 and TrpV4 together mediate these currents. In primary chondrocytes and heterologous expression in HEK cells, Piezo1 can be mechanically activated by membrane stretch as well as stimulation of the cell-substrate interface, while TrpV4 is activated only when the cell-substrate is mechanically stimulated and not by direct membrane stretch. Thus suggesting that TrpV4 mechanical activation occurs only when the cell is mechanically stimulated via the extracellular matrix.</p><p>The data presented in the manuscript support the idea that Piezo1 and TrpV4 mediate the mechanotransduction signal in chondrocytes. However, it is important to reiterate that TRPV4 is a polymodal sensor, and whether TRPV4 is playing a role in mechanotransduction in vivo has not been demonstrated yet. Therefore, we think it is important for the authors to discuss this issue in the Discussion section. Overall, we support the publication of this manuscript but would like the authors to address the following issues:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that selective activation of TrpV4 by deflecting the cell-substrate interface is observed because the pillar deflection assay is more sensitive than apical membrane indentation or membrane stretch (both of which are extensively characterized and widely used and accepted mechanical stimulation assays in the field of mechanotransduction). An alternative, and more relevant, conclusion is that TrpV4 is activated only when the cell membrane is stretched via the extracellular matrix and not by direct membrane stretch. One way to test this is to check if mechanical indentation of the apical membrane results in TrpV4 activation. If one doesn't see TrpV4 mediated currents then it only means that TrpV4 mechanical activation is dependent on the cell matrix, which could also explain why TrpV4 KO mice are more prone to osteoarthritis which is a result of disrupted ECM homeostasis. Beyond proving any mechanism, testing mechanical indentation for TrpV4 activation is important, as it is a very commonly used method for mechanotransduction, and it is important to compare to responses to deflections (as is already done with stretch).</p><p>2) An important conclusion of the work is that stretch (in HSPC experiments) and &quot;substrate deflections&quot; reflect different mechanical stimuli that activate distinct mechanoelectrical transduction pathways. This is mainly based on the finding that TRPV4-dependent currents are activated by moving a pilus, but not in the HSPC experiments using outside-out patches. However, it is well known that in cell-free patches components that are critical for TRPV4 function are lost, which may well explain the absence (or rather, the small amplitude) of TRPV4-dependent currents in the HSPC experiments. For instance, it is known that TRPV4 loses heat sensitivity in cell-free patches (see Chung et al. JBC, 2003; Watanabe et al. JBC, 2002), so it is conceivable that TRPV4 can be activated by stretch, but that the responsiveness is lost upon patch excision. Thus, additional experiments comparing how Piezo and TRPV4 respond to membrane stretch in cell-attached patches would be necessary if the authors want to make the case that activation of TRPV4 in the pillar deflection experiments is not due to membrane stretch.</p><p>3) The authors calculate a force from the displacement of the pilus, which they use to determine a &quot;threshold for current activation&quot; (subsection “Chondrocytes and dedifferentiated cells display distinct mechanosensitivity”). This calculation, based on Hooke's law, is in our opinion incorrect, as it only represents the force needed to deflect the pilus &quot;in isolation&quot;. However, given that the pilus displacement activates a current in the cell, there must be a force applied from the pilus on to the cell and from the cell on the pilus. These forces depend on factors that are unknown, including the strength of the interaction between membrane and pilus (i.e. is the pilus tightly attached to the membrane patch, or rather rubs it), and the mechanoelastical properties of the cells, and thus invalidate the force estimations. In simple words, if the cell would be made out of concrete, the force to create a certain pilus displacement would be much higher than if the cell were made of butter. Thus, any conclusion on absolute force or differences in force threshold seems inappropriate at this point.</p><p>4) Much of what is described here for the Piezo1-currents is similar to what is already described in several earlier papers from these and other authors. The real novelty lies in the direct mechanical activation of TRPV4. However, it would be ideal if this novel aspect of the work could be extended. For instance, the mechanosensitive current attributed to TRPV4 shows very rapid inactivation, which has not been described for this channel for any other stimulus, but is partly reminiscent of the properties of Piezo's. Description of some basic properties of the mechano-activated TRPV4-currents (e.g. voltage dependence of the inactivation, recovery from inactivation, selectivity etc.) would add to the novelty aspect of the manuscript.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors show that KD of Piezo1 or TrpV4 results in only 50% of the tested cells responding to mechanical stimulation. While, the effect is additive when both Piezo1 and TrpV4 is knocked down simultaneously. This suggests that TrpV4 and Piezo1 are expressed in different cells. However, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref> it appears that there is a reduction in currents in the remaining cells when either Piezo1 or TRPV4 is targeted. This is confusing. The first set of experiments suggest that Piezo1 and TRPV4 are expressed in mainly non-overlapping cells. If this was the case, one would not expect reduced current in other half when each is individually targeted. The authors should evaluate TRPV4 and Pieoz1 expression in individual chondrocytes and attempt to make sense of the recordings.</p><p>6) Overall, the relevance of the applied stimuli for chondrocyte function in vivo is quite vague and not well discussed. Neither the HSPC nor the pillar structure seem to match well with the structures and forces that are experienced by these cells in situ. The relevance of comparing chondrocytes with the dedifferentiated cells is also not clear. The authors should discuss these issues openly in the manuscript.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. It is puzzling that the application of the TrpV4 antagonist GSK205 results in almost 80% block of the MA current, which we know is a combination of Piezo1 and TrpV4. This suggests that GSK205 inhibits Piezo1 as well? The authors should test the effect of the antagonist on Piezo1 to see if this is true. Also, an N of 4 in this experiment is low, given the importance it holds. Finally, it appears that the current was rescued in only 3/4 cells tested?</p><p>8) The error bars for most of the pillar deflection experiments are large, indicating variability. Does the peak current vary so much between cells? And, this is seen both in primary chondrocytes and HEK cells. Can the authors comment on what would cause this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21074.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors claim that selective activation of TrpV4 by deflecting the cell-substrate interface is observed because the pillar deflection assay is more sensitive than apical membrane indentation or membrane stretch (both of which are extensively characterized and widely used and accepted mechanical stimulation assays in the field of mechanotransduction).

These data have been added to a reconfigured <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (PIEZO1 and TRPV4 traces). We have also prepared a figure supplement containing further current traces including those acquired from the negative control. We found this to be important as on occasion, small, slowly inactivating currents are measured in the negative control cells in response to large stimuli. In the interests of transparency we have provided these data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We have also modified the text to reflect that these data strengthen the conclusion that the TRPV4 channel activation depends on the application of mechanical stimuli via the matrix, as suggested by the reviewers above.</p><p>Our contention that the use of pillar arrays is a more sensitive approach stems from our earlier work investigating mechanoelectrical transduction in dorsal root ganglia neurons. In that system we could measure currents in response to pillar defection or indentation. However, the deflection of the membrane required to activate channels in the pillar array experiment was significantly smaller than the size of the indentation required for robust channel gating. We have now clarified in the text to avoid confusion.</p><p>The addition of these data means that we have now compared our pillar array measurements with both commonly used methods for studying mechanical gating of ion channels, i.e. pressure clamp and indentation.</p><p><italic>2) An important conclusion of the work is that stretch (in HSPC experiments) and &quot;substrate deflections&quot; reflect different mechanical stimuli that activate distinct mechanoelectrical transduction pathways.

Thus, any conclusion on absolute force or differences in force threshold seems inappropriate at this point.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that there are significant limitations in interpreting these data as a force. Indeed, we write in the original manuscript “These data do not indicate the force that is transferred to the mechanically-gated ion channel” and we have presented our stimulus magnitude as a deflection in all of the figures because of these concerns. We have now updated this section of the Discussion to note that the physical properties of the cell will also confound this force calculation. However, the deformability of chondrocytes has been empirically tested and values are reported in the literature of around 1-2 kPa. Given that the modulus of the substrate that we use is 2.1 MPa the cell is 3 orders of magnitude more compliant than the substrate. So whilst there would be an influence on the force calculation due to the physical interaction with the cell, we feel there is still value in reporting the restoring force in the discussion due to the fact that the properties of the substrate will predominate.</p><p>Our motivation for reporting a force was to allow us to compare the values that we have measured with our system with those collected using the cantilever of an Atomic Force Microscope to compress the cells.</p><p>Given that this force measurement is problematic we have removed the section reporting the threshold in pN force from the results, leaving all reporting of thresholds in the Results section in nm deflection.</p><p>We have maintained the section in the Discussion, adding additional caveats to make clear that care should be taken in drawing conclusions from these values. We feel it is important to include this conversion in the discussion (with the appropriate cautions) to allow some comparison across methodologies. That is, to allow some degree of comparison with the compression data obtained using atomic force microscopy.</p><p><italic>4) Much of what is described here for the Piezo1-currents is similar to what is already described in several earlier papers from these and other authors.

In addition, we found that this TRPV4-mediated current does not seem to be outwardly rectifying. This is in contrast to studies on activation of TRPV4 by 4αPDD, heat and cell swelling. Taken with the rapid latency of activation, we speculate that these data reflect a distinct pathway of TRPV4 activation, as previously reported for swelling vs heat.</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors show that KD of Piezo1 or TrpV4 results in only 50% of the tested cells responding to mechanical stimulation.

We have added these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We feel that this has strengthened this section of the manuscript and allowed a more informative interpretation of our results.</p><p>We contend that the differences between the two experiments reflect the difference between an acute and a chronic manipulation</p><p>– acutely blocking TRPV4 represents the contribution of TRPV4 in the WT cells vs</p><p>– chronic absence of the TRPV4 channel is partially compensated for by PIEZO1</p><p>We have clarified this in the text in the light of the new [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] data.</p><p><italic>6) Overall, the relevance of the applied stimuli for chondrocyte function</italic> in vivo <italic>is quite vague and not well discussed.

We have now added additional text to the Discussion to address how our experiments may relate to cellular function within this in vivo environment.</p><p>It is indeed difficult to model the complex physical impacts experienced by chondrocytes and here we have made the first steps to address how stretching the membrane alone compares to deflecting regions of cell-substrate contacts. The use of electrophysiology to directly monitor channel activity means that cells must be accessed with a patch pipette. As such, we are working with cells in a 2D environment rather than 3D. Clearly we are addressing a very localised phenomena, yet we contend that this is an important first step to highlight;</p><p>– the fact that the local channel environment can modulate channel activation.</p><p>– That there are distinct but overlapping mechanoelectrical transduction pathways reflecting the fact that TRPV4 only responds to mechanical stimuli propagated via cell-matrix contacts</p><p>Our data additionally suggest a mechanistic pathway for how changes in the ECM composition and compliance may lead to osteoarthritis.</p><p>With respect to why we compared chondrocytes and dedifferentiated cells: this question was motivated by logistics and current available published data.</p><p>– Logistically, it is much easier to culture, manipulate with molecular biology and patch dedifferentiated cells.

However, current amplitude after washout was not significantly different to the current amplitudes measured pre-treatment.
