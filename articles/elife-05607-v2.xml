and related clinical and molecular traits in more than 100 unique inbred mouse strains, which were fed a diet rich in fat and carbohydrates. A &gt;30-fold variation in hepatic TG accumulation was observed among the strains. Genome-wide association studies revealed three loci associated with hepatic TG accumulation. Utilizing transcriptomic data from the liver and adipose tissue, we identified several high-confidence candidate genes for hepatic steatosis, including <italic>Gde1</italic>, a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase not previously implicated in triglyceride metabolism. We confirmed the role of <italic>Gde1</italic> by in vivo hepatic over-expression and shRNA knockdown studies. We hypothesize that <italic>Gde1</italic> expression increases TG production by contributing to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate. Our multi-level data, including transcript levels, metabolite levels, and gut microbiota composition, provide a framework for understanding genetic and environmental interactions underlying hepatic steatosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05607.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05607.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05607.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a major health problem worldwide and is caused by an abnormal build-up of fat molecules in liver cells that disrupts how the cells work. Although many people with the disease show only mild or no symptoms, if the disease progresses the consequences—such as organ damage and an increased risk of liver cancer—can be severe.</p><p>Although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has been linked with obesity and diabetes, how it develops is poorly understood. The most widely supported explanation suggests that the disease begins with an imbalance in the process that normally maintains the correct amount of fat molecules called triglycerides inside cells. As a result, triglycerides accumulate in the liver cells in a process known as steatosis, which is then thought to make the liver vulnerable to further problems. However, this theory has been questioned by genetic experiments that suggest triglyceride build-up actually protects cells from other kinds of damage.</p><p>Hui et al. studied mice that had been fed a diet that was high in fat and sugar. The extent of liver steatosis varied considerably between the mice, with some mice accumulating 30 times more triglyceride in their liver than others. The underlying variation in the genes of the mice was then examined to investigate whether this can explain the differences in liver condition. This revealed at least three DNA stretches that appear to be linked to triglyceride accumulation in the liver, including several genes that appear to be active during steatosis. One of these genes, known as Gde1, had not previously been shown to have a role in controlling how cells make and use triglycerides.</p><p>To confirm the role of Gde1, Hui et al. artificially turned the gene on in some mice and prevented it from turning on in others. Turning on Gde1 significantly increased the amount of triglyceride in the liver and keeping it turned off decreased triglyceride levels. Hui et al. suggest that this is because Gde1 helps to make a precursor molecule that is needed to build triglycerides. Certain gut bacteria also appear to be linked to steatosis.</p><p>This study used a population-based approach in mice to examine genetic factors in the development of fatty liver disease. The challenge now is to find out how the genes work and to understand their interactions with each other and with the environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05607.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05607.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hepatic steatosis</kwd><kwd>genome-wide association</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>metabolome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL028481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lusis</surname><given-names>Aldons J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7 - 330381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Org</surname><given-names>Elin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>240405/F20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Norheim</surname><given-names>Frode</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK094311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lusis</surname><given-names>Aldons J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-HD07228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parks</surname><given-names>Brian W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A system genetics approach reveals a unique molecular signature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice and identifies novel genetic factors affecting hepatic steatosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a wide spectrum of liver abnormalities, ranging from benign hepatocellular accumulation of lipids (steatosis), through non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to fibrosis and cirrhosis in the absence of excessive consumption of alcohol and hepatitis viral infection. Advanced NAFLD can eventually progress to end-stage liver disease with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kopec and Burns, 2011</xref>). Population studies have shown that NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marchesini et al., 2003</xref>). As such, NAFLD can be viewed as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. With the increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, it is not surprising that NAFLD is rapidly becoming the most common form of chronic liver disease worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ratziu et al., 2010</xref>). It is estimated that 20–30% of the population in Western developed countries is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vernon et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the high prevalence of this disease, its natural history and etiology is poorly understood. Although simple steatosis appears to be benign and non-progressive in the majority of individuals affected with NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teli et al., 1995</xref>), excessive fat accumulation in the liver is associated with organ pathology, including NASH and cirrhosis. NASH frequently progresses to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and HCC, resulting in poor long-term prognosis.</p><p>The factors determining the progressive phenotype of this complex disease remain largely unknown, although it is clear that subtle genetic variations and environmental factors (such as diet and lifestyle) play a role in determining the disease phenotype and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Day, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anstee et al., 2011</xref>). According to the prevailing ‘two-hit hypothesis’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day and James, 1998</xref>), it is believed that the first insult involves lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes, due to an imbalance in triglyceride homeostasis. Subsequently, steatosis increases the vulnerability of the liver to a ‘second hit’, which promotes liver injury, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. However, silencing of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) by an antisense oligo improved steatosis but worsened liver injury and fibrosis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yamaguchi et al., 2007</xref>). DGAT2-knockdown mice exhibit increased fatty acid (FA) oxidation through CYP2E1, leading to increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue damage. These findings lead to the proposal that steatosis may be an adaptive response to protect the liver from lipotoxicity through partitioning toxic lipids into stable intracellular triglyceride stores. Hence, despite the fact that accumulation of TG was alleviated in DGAT2-knockdown liver, blocking this protective mechanism exacerbated lipotoxicity and led to more severe liver injury. These data suggest that TG accumulation per se is not the ‘first hit’ but the underlying inability to compensate for increased FA flux, which makes the liver prone to subsequent oxidative damage. It is proposed that the ‘second hit’ could involve diverse parallel pro-inflammatory signals derived from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tilg and&amp; Moschen, 2010</xref>).</p><p>So far, there exists no established therapy targeting NAFLD. Since most NAFLD patients suffer from obesity and insulin resistance, treatment options aim at weight reduction, control of dyslipidemia and improving insulin sensitivity through lifestyle changes and pharmacological agents, such as metformin, statins, fibrates, and thiazolidinediones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schreuder et al., 2008</xref>). Understanding the underlying genetic factors contributing to NAFLD would not only fill the void of knowledge but would also facilitate the design of effective strategies in treating and preventing this important disease.</p><p>Considerable variations in the flux of TG and FAs occur in the liver in response to changing nutritional and hormonal status. Nevertheless, under normal physiological conditions, the liver does not accumulate considerable amounts of TG despite its active regulatory role in lipid trafficking. Processes that offset the balance of TG acquisition and disposition give rise to hepatic steatosis, which is the hallmark of NAFLD. These include increased FA uptake or de novo biosynthesis, reduced FA oxidation, and impaired lipoprotein production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farrell and Larter, 2006</xref>). The FA moiety of hepatic TG is derived from three major sources: diet, de novo biosynthesis, and adipose tissue. In humans, it is estimated that 15% of hepatic TG comes directly from the diet, 26% from de novo lipogenesis, and 59% from adipose tissue in the form of non-esterified FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donnelly et al., 2005</xref>). Together, the adipose tissue and liver play a major role in hepatic TG accumulation and supply &gt;85% of FAs for the biosynthesis of TG in the liver.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies in human populations and animal studies indicate that genetics plays a substantial role in determining the susceptibility to the development of NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browning et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guerrero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kahle et al., 2013</xref>). The coexistence of NASH and cirrhosis clusters within families supports the existence of a common genetic link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Struben et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Willner et al., 2001</xref>). The broad-sense heritability of hepatic steatosis has been estimated to be ∼39% after adjustment for age, sex, race, and body mass index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwimmer et al., 2009</xref>). Although genetic predisposition to obesity and diabetes undoubtedly explains a fraction of the genetic component, additional independent genetic factors clearly contribute to the susceptibility to NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browning et al., 2004</xref>). To date, only a small fraction of genes accounting for fatty liver disease have been identified and the molecular pathogenesis of NAFLD is poorly understood.</p><p>To gain insight into the etiology of NAFLD, we have employed a ‘systems genetics’ strategy to generate a comprehensive view of the genetic architecture of NAFLD in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Civelek and Lusis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mato et al., 2014</xref>). We examined natural variations in the development of steatosis in a panel of inbred strains of mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet for 8 weeks. This diet has previously been shown to have a profound effect on obesity and insulin resistance depending upon the genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). We observed a wide range in phenotypes associated with hepatic steatosis following feeding the HF/HS diet. To further understand the molecular basis of steatosis, we employed a multi-omic approach to characterize the steatotic phenotype. Using global expression analysis of liver and adipose transcriptomes, we identified pathways enriched in strains susceptible to steatosis. We also showed that the susceptibility to steatosis is highly dependent on genetic background and was able to identify genetic loci contributing to steatosis. A causal gene at one of the loci was identified as <italic>Gde1</italic>. Furthermore, we identified metabolites and gut microbes, which are associated with steatosis. These multi-dimensional data provide a valuable resource for understanding the genetic–environmental interactions in the disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in mice fed with HF/HS diet</title><p>NAFLD is often referred to as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, as it is associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lazo and&amp; Clark, 2008</xref>). The development of NAFLD is strongly influenced by both dietary and genetic factors. We previously showed that the increase in body weight and fat accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet in mice is highly dependent on the genetic background of individual strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). To study the gene-by-diet effects on hepatic steatosis, a panel of 8-week-old male HMDP mice were fed a HF/HS diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity and steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). Lipids were extracted and quantified in 478 individual livers from 113 strains of male mice. A wide spectrum of hepatic TG content was observed among the strains with more than 30-fold difference between the high and low responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Hepatic TG content was significantly correlated with the liver weight (r = 0.38, p = 5.75 × 10<sup>−14</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Contrary to the large variations in TG among strains, less than threefold difference in cholesterol and phospholipid levels was observed among the strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Modest correlations between these lipids with hepatic TG were observed. The TG content in the liver was positively correlated with hepatic total cholesterol (TC) content (r = 0.35, p = 1.18 × 10<sup>−12</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) but negatively correlated with the levels of phospholipids (r = −0.26, p = 3.45 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data suggest that increased neutral lipids content, in particular TG, contributes significantly to the enlarged livers.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05607.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of genetic background on hepatic TG accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hepatic TG levels in male mice after 8 weeks of HF/HS feeding.

Similar to hepatic TG content, we also observed a large variation in ALT activities among the strains. Plasma ALT activities showed a positive correlation with hepatic TG levels, implicating a role of increased hepatic TG levels in liver damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). ALT is an established biochemical and clinical marker for liver damage as this enzyme is released into the circulation when the integrity of the cell membrane of hepatocytes is compromised. We performed histologic examination of livers from a subset of strains including some with high TG and did not observe evidence of significant pathology other than lipid accumulation (data not shown). Furthermore, mRNA levels of markers for B-lymphocytes (CD45/PTPPRC) and macrophages (CD68) were not increased in steatotic liver samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

Many of these genes are involved in wound healing and fibrosis, consistent with the observation of positive correlation between ALT and hepatic TG levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Complement and the coagulation cascade were specifically enriched (3.03 fold, adjusted p = 3.93 × 10<sup>−3</sup>) and the genes were predominantly (15 out of 18 genes) lower in steatotic livers.

The genome-wide significant threshold was set at 1.31 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, which corresponds to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). We identified one genome-wide significant peak associated with hepatic TG content on chromosome 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In addition, the peak locus on chromosome 7 still reached genome-wide significance when association mapping was conditioned using adiposity (% fat) or insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) as covariates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating that the effect of the chromosome 7 locus on hepatic steatosis is independent of obesity and diabetes.

Most of the large differences in gene expression are due to local differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Orozco et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, a useful approach to prioritizing candidate genes at a locus is to determine if the genes at the locus exhibit variation in expression that is controlled in <italic>cis</italic>. Such a variant is termed a <italic>cis</italic>-expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL). We therefore identified significant <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL for liver and adipose for the genes in the chromosome 7 locus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">Table 8</xref>). In addition, we asked whether the expression levels correlated with the clinical trait of interest (i.e., hepatic TG levels), since that would be consistent with a causal relationship. Among the candidate genes in the chromosome 7 locus, only three genes (<italic>Coq7</italic>, <italic>Gde1</italic>, and <italic>Knop1</italic>) have significant <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL and are also expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6 tbl8">Tables 6, 8</xref>). These three genes also have significant <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL associations in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">Table 8</xref>). The expression variation of these three candidate genes showed a continuous spectrum across the strains, indicating that the expression variations are not bimodal (data not shown). Hepatic TG levels correlated with <italic>Gde1</italic> expression in both the liver (r = 0.35, p = 1.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) and adipose tissue (r = −0.21, p = 1.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Knop1</italic> expression correlated with hepatic TG levels (r = 0.29, p = 2.5 × 10<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) but not in the adipose tissue (r = 0.14, p = 0.133). On the other hand, hepatic TG levels did not correlate with <italic>Coq7</italic> expression in the liver (r = 0.09, p = 0.368) or adipose tissue (r = −0.14, p = 0.142). <italic>Gde1</italic> (also known as <italic>MIR16</italic>) encodes glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1, a ubiquitously expressed enzyme involved in phospholipid metabolism, whereas <italic>Knop1</italic> encodes a lysine-rich nucleolar protein. Neither of these two genes has previously been identified in studies related to TG or lipid metabolism. We also examined coding variants for genes at the chromosome 7 locus using the PROVEAN prediction tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi and Chan, 2015</xref>). A number of genes exhibited missense variants but these tended to be neutral and not likely to cause deleterious effects on protein stability and function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl9">Table 9</xref>).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vernon et al., 2011</xref>). The etiology and pathogenesis of NAFLD are still poorly understood, reflecting the genetic and environmental heterogeneity of the disease. The molecular basis of the metabolic response to dietary fat and its role in NAFLD development remains to be elucidated. Previous studies using inbred mouse strains have shown that genetic background affects lipid accumulation in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hill-Baskin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Millward et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shockley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Montgomery et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we employed over 100 strains of inbred and recombinant inbred mice and demonstrated vast genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in fed with a HF/HS diet. We examined the relationship between NAFLD and insulin resistance, obesity, plasma metabolites, plasma lipoproteins, and gut microbiota. We also carried out global gene expression array analyses on two key metabolically relevant tissues for NAFLD (liver and white adipose tissue) and identified molecular pathways enriched in NAFLD. Finally, we identified genetic loci contributing to NAFLD in common inbred strains of mice and validated the role of a novel gene, <italic>Gde1</italic>, at one of the loci. Our data substantially expand our knowledge of the genetic architecture of NAFLD and provide a rich resource for future biochemical and genetic studies.</p><p>While there is strong evidence that genetic factors contribute significantly to the onset and progression of the disease, only a few genes have been identified by human GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browning et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Romeo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kozlitina et al., 2014</xref>). Because genetic and environmental factors can be strictly controlled in mice, such models are valuable for dissecting the genetic and environmental contributions to complex disease traits. Nevertheless, classical linkage analysis approaches to dissect NAFLD in mice have been relatively unsuccessful. While a number of loci have been identified by quantitative QTL analyses, a major problem has been an inability to carry out fine genetic mapping to identify the responsible genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rangnekar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumazawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Minkina et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we employed an innovative genome-wide association approach using &gt;100 strains of inbred and recombinant inbred strains of mice to finely map genetic loci contributing to the development of steatosis. This approach circumvents the obstacles associated with human studies (namely, environmental heterogeneity) and mouse linkage analyses (namely, poor mapping resolution). Furthermore, by integrating transcriptomic information for the liver and adipose tissue, we identified two high-confidence candidate genes (<italic>Gde1</italic> and <italic>Knop1</italic>) for hepatic steatosis on chromosome 7. We pursued <italic>Gde1</italic> using experimental perturbation based on its known role in lipid metabolism.</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that <italic>Gde1</italic> is a causal gene for hepatic steatosis in the chromosome 7 locus. First, the presence of <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL suggests that <italic>Gde1</italic> expression is regulated locally, associating with the SNP haplotype. Second, hepatic expression of <italic>Gde1</italic> is significantly correlated with the levels of hepatic TG. Third, overexpression of <italic>Gde1</italic> promoted specifically TG accumulation in vivo<italic>,</italic> whereas hepatic cholesterol and phospholipid levels were unaffected. Forth, shRNA knockdown of <italic>Gde1</italic> reduced hepatic TG accumulation.</p><p><italic>Gde1</italic> encodes glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 1 (EC 3.1.4.46), a broadly expressed integral membrane glycoprotein, which catalyzes the degradation of glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Okazaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simon and&amp; Cravatt, 2010</xref>). Two forms of the protein (∼37 kDa and 43 kDa) were detected in Western blots of endogenous and adenoviral overexpressed GDE1, which is likely be due to variable glycosylation as previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). Its role in triglyceride metabolism has not been documented. Expression levels of TG biosynthetic pathways in the livers of <italic>Gde1</italic>-overexpressing mice were down-regulated, indicating that increased de novo lipogenesis due to increased lipogenic gene expression is unlikely the cause of TG accumulation. Increased expression of <italic>Cd36</italic> in <italic>Gde1</italic>-overexpressing livers raises the possibility that <italic>Cd36</italic> acts as a mediator of the effect of <italic>Gde1</italic> through its lipid transport activity. One of the products of the <italic>Gde1</italic> enzymatic reaction is glycerol-3-phosphate, which can be converted to phosphatidate by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and subsequently dephosphorylated by the phosphatidate phosphatase lipin to form diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG can then be acylated by DGAT to form TG. We hypothesize that <italic>Gde1</italic> affects the availability of glycerol-3-phosphate and modulates the flux of TG in the liver. The negative correlation of adipose <italic>Gde1</italic> expression and hepatic TG may be due to a different role of glycerol-3-phosphate in the adipose tissue. Increased glycerol-3-phosphate production (when <italic>Gde1</italic> expression is high) in the adipose tissue would promote FA re-esterification, leading to a decrease in FA release to the circulation. This reduction in FA supply to the liver may result in diminished TG synthesis. The opposite pattern of regulation of <italic>Gde1</italic> implicates tissue-specific regulatory elements. Mouse ENCODE data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yue et al., 2014</xref>) showed that there are differences in DNA hypersensitive sites in the gene region, suggesting that there may be differences in DNA accessibility and transcription factor binding in the liver and adipose tissue.</p><p>The candidate genes under the chromosome 9 locus are likely to affect hepatic TG content via an insulin-dependent manner as the peak of association was diminished by co-mapping with obesity or insulin resistance. Insulin is a key hormone that drives lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis is often accompanied by hepatic insulin resistance. Our data showed that hepatic TG load has a robust association with plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Impaired insulin signaling in the liver leads to the failure of insulin to suppress gluconeogenesis through the FoxO1 pathway, leading to hyperglycemia and ultimately diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haas and Biddinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leavens and&amp; Birnbaum, 2011</xref>). Paradoxically, insulin-stimulated hepatic lipogenesis through SREBP-1c induction is not impaired in steatosis-associated insulin resistant livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Goldstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2010</xref>). This selective insulin resistance leads to increased production of lipids and steatosis. The chromosome 3 signal was not affected by conditioning on percentage body fat or HOMA-IR, suggesting that the causal gene(s) determining hepatic TG content at this locus are unlikely to be mediated by pathways involving body fat or insulin sensitivity.</p><p>Our observed enrichment of mitochondrial genes in steatotic livers suggests that disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics may play a role in NAFLD pathobiology. This is in accordance with finding that chronic consumption of a HF diet-induced NAFLD with reduced mitochondrial oxidation and increased ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mantena et al., 2009</xref>). Obesity-induced steatosis has also been linked to decreased hepatic ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavin et al., 1999</xref>). These findings highlighted the importance of mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Variations in mitochondrial capacity and activity may contribute to the differences in susceptibility to HF/HS diet challenge. Strains with higher mitochondrial capacity would be more resistant to the development of NAFLD due to more efficient oxidation and disposal of surplus nutrients and lower production of ROS as a result of more efficient coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation. Determining the connection between the genetic determinants of mitochondrial bioenergetics and hepatic TG accumulation could provide important insights into the etiology of NAFLD.</p><p>Metabolomics has been used to identify biomarkers for NAFLD (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dumas et al., 2014</xref>). Our analysis showed that hepatic steatosis was associated with low-plasma levels of arginine. The inverse relationship between arginine levels and hepatic TG content may be due to increased arginine degradation in steatotic mice. Previous studies have shown that an arginine-deficient diet-induced hepatic steatosis in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Milner and&amp; Hassan, 1981</xref>). The levels of arginase 1, which catabolizes L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine, were increased in steatotic livers from mice fed a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eccleston et al., 2011</xref>). Exposure to HF diet led to decreased hepatic levels of activated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which converts L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. In our study, gene expression of <italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Nos3</italic> did not show a significant correlation with hepatic TG content, suggesting the effect of HF diet on the activities of these two enzymes acts post-transcriptionally. Arginine plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of cell junctions and in the regulation of the epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marc Rhoads and&amp; Wu, 2009</xref>). It also modulates immune response and is essential for tissue healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Low levels of arginine may lead to increased gut bacterial and endotoxin translocation, which promotes liver inflammation and NAFLD progression. We observed that TMANO was positively correlated (r = 0.18, p = 0.034) with hepatic steatosis; however, the correlation was not significant after correction for multiple testing. Previous results from studies of 129S6 mice, a model of diet-induced fatty liver disease, showed that TMANO was a marker for NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dumas et al., 2006</xref>). Increased TMANO levels may indicate increased conversion of dietary choline into methylamines by microbiota, leading to reduced bioavailability of choline and mimicking the effect of a choline-deficient diet.</p><p>Our study also identified <italic>Coprococcus</italic> and <italic>Oscillospira</italic> as potentially important microbes in lipid homeostasis, as the abundance of these microbes showed significant association with levels of cholesterol and phospholipids. Studies in humans showed a large reduction in abundance of these microbes in obese and NASH subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Little is known about the biochemical activities of these microbes; however, it has been shown that dietary composition could affect their abundance in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Walker et al., 2011</xref>). Studies of diet-induced obesity in mice suggest that abundance of <italic>Oscillospira</italic> may affect gut barrier function in the proximal colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam et al., 2012</xref>). Further analysis of the genomic sequences to identify the specific strains involved could provide new insights into the role of these microbes in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.</p><p>Our study has generated a rich resource for future analyses of NAFLD.

All mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory and bred at University of California, Los Angeles. The experimental design for the diet studies was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parks et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, male mice were maintained on a chow diet (Ralston Purina Company) until 8 weeks of age when they were given a HF/HS diet (Research Diets-D12266B, New Brunswick, NJ) with the following composition: 16.8% kcal protein, 51.4% kcal carbohydrate, 31.8% kcal fat. After 8 weeks on the HF/HS diet, mice were sacrificed after a 4-hr fast. Blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding under isoflurane anesthesia. Plasma and livers were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis. All assays and phenotypes were from the same mice. Mice were housed in rooms with a 14-hr light/10-hr dark cycle (light is on between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.). On the day of experiment, mice were fasted at 6:30 a.m. and sacrificed between 10:30 a.m. and noon.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript from Hui et al. reports on a systems genetics approach to identify genes that influence hepatic lipid content in inbred strains of mice fed a high fat, high sucrose diet for eight weeks. They systematically collect and analyze an impressive array of data, including physiologic/anatomic parameters (e.g., liver TGs, blood glucose), SNP genotype, liver and adipose tissue gene expression, metabolites and gut microbe 16S RNA sequence. The physiologic/anatomic, SNP and gene expression data is integrated to identify candidate genes that affect hepatic lipid content, including <italic>Gde1</italic>. They demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>Gde1</italic> in liver results in increased hepatic triglyceride and alterations in hepatic gene expression that support a causal role in regulation of liver fat content. All three reviewers were enthusiastic about the main findings and their significance. One reviewer commented: 'This is an excellent genetic survey of hepatic steatosis in a collection of recombinant inbred strains that have been used as a gene mapping resource'. A second reviewer commented: 'An important body of work and an excellent manuscript'. The following major concerns need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The main biological finding to emerge from these studies is the identification and validation of <italic>Gde1</italic> as a novel gene that in some way controls hepatic TG content. The synthesis of genome-wide association and eQTL analysis makes a strong case, the validation studies are not yet convincing. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, the expression levels of <italic>Gde1</italic> in liver lie between 8 and 10 on the X axis, which is undefined. Assuming a log2 scale, the variation in expression of <italic>Gde1</italic> is less than 4-fold across the 100+ strains. The Western blot of <italic>Gde1</italic> in Figure 11A shows no detectable <italic>Gde1</italic> in the Adeno-control livers and high levels in the Adeno-Gde1 livers, implying that the differences in expression are much greater and that <italic>Gde1</italic> is being expressed at a supra-physiologic level. The functional validation of <italic>Gde1</italic> therefore needs to be further validated, ideally by a loss of function experiment, e.g., using the same adenoviral system to deliver shRNAs, or use of ASOs, which effectively target the liver. In addition, measurements of glycerol-3-phosphate could be performed in these studies to investigate the proposed mechanism by which <italic>Gde1</italic> influences TG content.</p><p>2) The authors state that they demonstrate vast genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet. This is not the case, however, because the hepatic TG contents (or other values) are not reported under control conditions. This data may be available, but unless results are reported as changes from a control diet, the values observed in the HF/HS diet cannot be considered to be a 'response'. While this does not detract from the results, the point should be clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p>3) The SNPs associated with <italic>Gde1</italic> eQTLs in liver are different than in adipose tissue, and <italic>Gde1</italic> expression in liver is positively correlated with liver TG, while <italic>Gde1</italic> expression in adipose tissue is negative correlated. Although the SNPs in question are unlikely to be causative, do the corresponding regions of the genome exhibit potential regulatory elements in liver and adipose tissue? Given that eQTLs for <italic>Gde1</italic> in adipose are more significant than in liver, can the authors comment further on the extent to which candidate genes identified in these studies might regulate TG content in liver through actions in adipose tissue?</p><p><italic>Minor comments:</italic></p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph. The implication of these statements seems to be that the 2-hit hypothesis is insufficient to explain NAFLD development in all cases, yet in the same paragraph, the “second hit” is referenced again. It is not entirely clear how these statements fit together. An additional sentence explaining the interpretation of the DGAT2 results in light of the 2-hit hypothesis would help to clarify this section.</p><p>2) Introduction, last paragraph. The term “heritable” implies transmission from parents to offspring, yet none of the experiments included multiple generations.</p><p>3) In the subsection headed “Animals”. What was the specific method of blood collection?</p><p>4) In the subsection headed “Measurement of hepatic lipid content”. It's too bad that the study was not conducted for a longer period so that susceptibility to NASH could be assessed NAFLD is a common but benign condition. It is important primarily because a substantial number of cases transition to NASH, but who transitions is currently unpredictable.</p><p>5) In the subsection headed “Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity assay”. ALT as a measure of liver damage—a standard, but sometimes unreliable, marker. Histology should be presented too.</p><p>6) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet” and elsewhere. Significant trait correlations are reported as 'strong'. But although these are often statistically significant, the fraction of phenotypic variation is quite modest. For example, liver TG and phospholipids, r = -0.26, P&lt;10-6, but r2 is &lt;7%. Statements about strong correlations need be tempered in language and interpretation.</p><p>7) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. It would be helpful to list the number of mice analyzed per cohort (or at least the minimum number used).</p><p>8) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. It is not clear if the reported p-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, which needs to be done.</p><p>9) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. The lack of large variation in cholesterol and phospholipid levels among strains despite correlation with hepatic TG content (which does show large variation) makes it seem like the correlations are not very strong.</p><p>10) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. A lack of enrichment of three specific immune cell markers is used as evidence for a lack of hepatic infiltration in steatotic livers, but it is quite possible that other immune cell types are present. Indeed, the subsection headed “Transcriptomic analysis of the liver and adipose tissue” reports that several genes expressed by inflammatory cells are increased in steatotic livers. A more thorough assessment of immune cell marker gene expression should be included.</p><p>11) In the subsection headed “Transcriptomic analysis of the liver and adipose tissue”. Are any of the differentially expressed genes closely linked; could local epigenetic changes lead to local changes in gene expression, raising the possibility that some changes are 'noise'?</p><p>12) In the same subsection. Do strains showing contrasting mRNA levels share haplotypes, e.g. high strains share one haplotype at a particular locus and low strains another haplotype? And are these allelic differences associated with underlying DNA sequence variants?</p><p>13) Still in the same subsection. Is expression variation at a given locus bimodal (allelic effects?) or uniform (perhaps a quantitative trait with multilocus control)?</p><p>14) In the subsection headed “Transcriptomic analysis of the liver and adipose tissue”. In addition to the analysis provided, it may be useful to perform two independent pathway enrichment analyses on genes that are positively or negatively correlated with hepatic TG, respectively.</p><p>15) At the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “Integration of transcriptomic and association mapping data”. It is unclear what is meant by the term “conservative” here. Was an analysis performed to predict the functional consequences of each missense variant?</p><p>16) In the subsection entitled “Adenovirus-mediated expression of <italic>Gde1</italic> increases liver TG accumulation”. What is the justification for using a 7 day HF/HS diet feeding period when the initial experiments used an 8 week period?</p><p>17) In the subsection “Metabolomic profiling of plasma metabolites”. It would be interesting to determine correlations between gene expression and levels of specific metabolites or microbes, as was done for the hepatic phenotypes.</p><p>18) In the subsection headed “Association of gut microbiota with hepatic lipid accumulation”. Were there any correlations with overall diversity of microbial communities?</p><p>19) Discussion. More discussion should be included regarding the potential implications of the correlations that were identified. How do these findings reflect the mechanisms underlying NAFLD development and progression, as well as their differences between strains?</p><p>20) Throughout. Were all of the assays conducted contemporaneously in the same mice? Or were these different cohorts, different times? Were results of some assays reported previously? The authors have a long-term commitment to this important paradigm. They just need to be clear about what was done when, with which cohorts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05607.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The main biological finding to emerge from these studies is the identification and validation of</italic> Gde1 <italic>as a novel gene that in some way controls hepatic TG content.

These data are complimentary to the overexpression studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), showing a positive correlation of hepatic TG levels with <italic>Gde1</italic> expression.</p><p>Since glycerol-3-phosphate is an intermediate in the crossroad of several metabolic pathways, it is unlikely that its steady state level will be elevated due to increased <italic>Gde1</italic> activity. Detailed analysis of the metabolic flux (e.g. using isoprotomer labeling) will be required to delineate the mechanism, and we feel that this is beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on the genetic aspects of NALFD.</p><p><italic>2) The authors state that they demonstrate vast genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet. This is not the case, however, because the hepatic TG contents (or other values) are not reported under control conditions.

Mouse ENCODE data showed that there are differences in DNA hypersensitive sites in the gene region, suggesting that there may be differences in DNA accessibility and transcription factor binding in the liver and adipose tissue.</p><p>The negative correlation of <italic>Gde1</italic> and hepatic TG may be due to a different role of glycerol-3-phosphate in the adipose tissue. Increased glycerol-3-phosphate production (when <italic>Gde1</italic> expression is high) in the adipose tissue could promote fatty acid re-esterification, leading to a decrease in fatty acid release to the circulation. This reduction in fatty acid supply to the liver may result in diminished TG synthesis.

An additional sentence explaining the interpretation of the DGAT2 results in light of the 2-hit hypothesis would help to clarify this section</italic>.</p><p>We have further elaborated the results from the DGAT2 knockdown studies. Their paradoxical findings suggest that TG accumulation per se is not the “first hit” but rather that it is the underlying inability to compensate for increased FA flux which makes the liver prone to subsequent oxidative damage.</p><p><italic>2) Introduction, last paragraph. The term</italic> “<italic>heritable</italic>” <italic>implies transmission from parents to offspring, yet none of the experiments included multiple generations.</italic></p><p>We assume that since the environmental is the same but the phenotypes differ, genetics most account for the differences. Nevertheless, we have now substituted “dependent on genetic background” for “heritable”.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection headed “Animals”. What was the specific method of blood collection?</italic></p><p>Blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding under isoflurane anesthesia. This information has been included in Methods.</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection headed “Measurement of hepatic lipid content”. It's too bad that the study was not conducted for a longer period so that susceptibility to NASH could be assessed NAFLD is a common but benign condition. It is important primarily because a substantial number of cases transition to NASH, but who transitions is currently unpredictable</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment. A longer HF/HS feeding regimen will be considered in future studies.</p><p><italic>5) In the subsection headed “Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity assay”. ALT as a measure of liver damage—a standard, but sometimes unreliable, marker. Histology should be presented too</italic>.</p><p>ALT is an established biochemical and clinical marker for liver damage as this enzyme is released into the circulation when the integrity of the cell membrane of hepatocytes is compromised. However, in advanced liver disease with cirrhosis or necrosis, plasma ALT could be low, giving a false indicator of liver damage. However, in our studies, mice were only on HF/HS diet for 8 weeks and did not show signs of advanced NAFLD. It is unlikely that this confounding factor would significantly affect our conclusion (please see the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in mice fed with HF/HS diet”).</p><p>Liver samples were not fixed at the time of collection. We examined frozen sections of the liver from selected strains having high and low ALT levels. Although the preservation of tissue structure was less than ideal, no apparent difference in general hepatocyte architecture was observed between the two groups. In addition, evidence of advanced NAFLD (fibrosis and necrosis) was not observed in all samples examined.</p><p><italic>6) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet” and elsewhere. Significant trait correlations are reported as 'strong'. But although these are often statistically significant, the fraction of phenotypic variation is quite modest. For example, liver TG and phospholipids, r = -0.26, P&lt;10-6, but r2 is &lt;7%. Statements about strong correlations need be tempered in language and interpretation</italic>.</p><p>We agree. Wordings of “strong” have been deleted or modified accordingly throughout the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. It would be helpful to list the number of mice analyzed per cohort (or at least the minimum number used)</italic>.</p><p>Information on the strain names and number of mice used in this study is now listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl11">Table 11</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. It is not clear if the reported p-values were adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing, which needs to be done</italic>.</p><p>These p-values were not adjusted for multiple testing. These particular correlation analyses were performed based on knowledge of potential association between NAFLD and those clinical traits (e.g. insulin resistance, plasma lipids and adiposity). Nevertheless, the correlations remained significant after Bonferroni correction. This is now discussed at the end of the subsection “Hepatic TG accumulation is highly correlated with plasma cholesterol, insulin resistance and adiposity”.</p><p><italic>9) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. The lack of large variation in cholesterol and phospholipid levels among strains despite correlation with hepatic TG content (which does show large variation) makes it seem like the correlations are not very strong</italic>.</p><p>The correlation between hepatic TG and total cholesterol was 0.35, whereas the correlation with phospholipids was -0.26. These correlations were modest and we have modified the text to reflect this.</p><p><italic>10) In the subsection headed “Large genetic variation in hepatic TG accumulation in response to a HF/HS diet”. A lack of enrichment of three specific immune cell markers is used as evidence for a lack of hepatic infiltration in steatotic livers, but it is quite possible that other immune cell types are present. Indeed, the subsection headed “Transcriptomic analysis of the liver and adipose tissue” reports that several genes expressed by inflammatory cells are increased in steatotic livers. A more thorough assessment of immune cell marker gene expression should be included</italic>.</p><p>In addition to Cd45 and Cd 68 reported in the manuscript, other markers for immune cells (T cells, B cells and leukocytes) did not show significant correlation in hepatic TG contents. These include:</p><p><italic>Cd28, Csf2, Cd4, Ccr5, Gata3 Cxcr4</italic> (T cells)</p><p><italic>Pax5, Cd70, Cd79b</italic> (B cells)</p><p><italic>Cd33, Cd52, Cd53, Cd44, Prg2</italic> (Leukocytes)</p><p>This information has been included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>11) In the subsection headed “Transcriptomic analysis of the liver and adipose tissue”. Are any of the differentially expressed genes closely linked; could local epigenetic changes lead to local changes in gene expression, raising the possibility that some changes are 'noise'?</italic></p><p>We looked at the chromosome locations of these genes and found that none of the genes are in close proximity (&lt;1.5 Mb) to each other on the same chromosome.</p><p><italic>12) In the same subsection. Do strains showing contrasting mRNA levels share haplotypes, e.g. high strains share one haplotype at a particular locus and low strains another haplotype? And are these allelic differences associated with underlying DNA sequence variants?</italic></p><p>The eQTL mapping that we performed addresses the question. Most of the large difference in gene expression are due to local differences and are termed cis-eQTL. We have addressed this in more detail in Orozo et al. (Cell. 2012 151(3):658-70; please see the subsection entitled “Integration of transcriptomic and association mapping data”).</p><p><italic>13) Still in the same subsection. Is expression variation at a given locus bimodal (allelic effects?) or uniform (perhaps a quantitative trait with multilocus control)?</italic></p><p>The expression variation of the three candidate genes (<italic>Gde1</italic>, <italic>Knop1</italic> and <italic>Coq7</italic>) in the chromosome 7 locus showed a continuous spectrum across the strains. The expression pattern indicates that the expression variations are not bimodal (first paragraph of the subsection headed “Integration of transcriptomic and association mapping data”).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05607.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Variation in candidate gene expression among strains.</title><p>The expression level of <italic>Gde1</italic> (A), <italic>Knop1</italic> (B) and <italic>Coq7</italic> (C) among HMDP strains are shown.

In addition to the analysis provided, it may be useful to perform two independent pathway enrichment analyses on genes that are positively or negatively correlated with hepatic TG, respectively</italic>.</p><p>We performed the separate pathway enrichment analyses on positively or negatively correlated genes respectively but did not find any additional enriched pathways that differ from the combined results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>.</p><p><italic>15) At the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “Integration of transcriptomic and association mapping data”. It is unclear what is meant by the term</italic> “<italic>conservative</italic>” <italic>here. Was an analysis performed to predict the functional consequences of each missense variant?</italic></p><p>The term “conservative” has been changed to “neutral” to better describe the amino acid change to be non-deleterious. The effect of amino acid substitution on the biological function of the protein was assessed by PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) prediction tool.</p><p><italic>16) In the subsection entitled “Adenovirus-mediated expression of</italic> Gde1 <italic>increases liver TG accumulation”. What is the justification for using a 7 day HF/HS diet feeding period when the initial experiments used an 8 week period?</italic></p><p>This regimen was chosen because gene expression by adenoviral transduction is only sustained for a short period of time (a few weeks or less). Preliminary studies in mice showed that HF/HS diet induced a 3-fold increase in hepatic TG accumulation in 1 week. A 2-week feeding gave similar results to 1-week feeding. Therefore, the shorter time regimen (1 week) was chosen for this particular study. This is now discussed in the subsection headed “Validation of <italic>Gde1</italic> as a causal gene for hepatic steatosis at the chromosome 7 locus using adenoviral overexpression of <italic>Gde1</italic> and shRNA knockdown”.</p><p><italic>17) In the subsection “Metabolomic profiling of plasma metabolites”. It would be interesting to determine correlations between gene expression and levels of specific metabolites or microbes, as was done for the hepatic phenotypes</italic>.</p><p>This is a good idea and we have considered it. However, because of the problem of multiple comparisons (many genes and microbes), no significant associations were observed.</p><p><italic>18) In the subsection headed “Association of gut microbiota with hepatic lipid accumulation”. Were there any correlations with overall diversity of microbial communities?</italic></p><p>There is no significant correlation between hepatic TG levels and overall microbial diversity (as determined by Shannon diversity index).</p><p><italic>19) Discussion. More discussion should be included regarding the potential implications of the correlations that were identified. How do these findings reflect the mechanisms underlying NAFLD development and progression, as well as their differences between strains?</italic></p><p>We have added discussion on the role of mitochondria in NAFLD pathogenesis.</p><p>In addition, the connection between arginine and gut microbiota linking to NAFLD has also been added.</p><p><italic>20) Throughout. Were all of the assays conducted contemporaneously in the same mice? Or were these different cohorts, different times? Were results of some assays reported previously? The authors have a long-term commitment to this important paradigm. They just need to be clear about what was done when, with which cohorts</italic>.</p><p>All assays and phenotypes were from the same mice. Liver lipid measurements were done in a subset of a larger cohort of mice used in our obesity study described previously in Parks et al. (Cell Metab. 2013 8;17(1):141-52).</p></body></sub-article></article>
