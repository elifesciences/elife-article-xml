number of key physiological and pathological processes in situ, but has not been studied in vivo in awake mice. Using multiple GCaMP6 variants targeted to microglia, we assessed how microglial calcium signaling responds to alterations in neuronal activity across a wide range. We find that only a small subset of microglial somata and processes exhibited spontaneous calcium transients in a chronic window preparation. However, hyperactive shifts in neuronal activity (kainate status epilepticus and CaMKIIa Gq DREADD activation) triggered increased microglial process calcium signaling, often concomitant with process extension. Additionally, hypoactive shifts in neuronal activity (isoflurane anesthesia and CaMKIIa Gi DREADD activation) also increased microglial process calcium signaling. Under hypoactive neuronal conditions, microglia also exhibited process extension and outgrowth with greater calcium signaling. Our work reveals that microglia have highly distinct microdomain signaling, and that processes specifically respond to bi-directional shifts in neuronal activity through increased calcium signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Microglia</kwd><kwd>Calcium</kwd><kwd>DREADD</kwd><kwd>GCaMP</kwd><kwd>status epilepticus</kwd><kwd>Isoflurane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS114040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umpierre</surname><given-names>Anthony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS112144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Worrell</surname><given-names>Gregory</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Long-Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS088627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Long-Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Long-Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Long-Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microglial processes engage calcium signaling in response to hyper- or hypo-active shifts in neuronal activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS, which are specialized to respond to both immunological and neuronal stimuli. Early work in situ suggested that calcium activity was critical for key microglial functions such as motility, cytokine release, and receptor trafficking/diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">FÃ¤rber and Kettenmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Korvers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Toulme and Khakh, 2012</xref>). However, more recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that spontaneous calcium signaling is nearly absent in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brawek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). Such observations downplay the potential utility of calcium signaling for microglial function.</p><p>Over the past two decades of astrocyte calcium research, it has become clear that microdomains (soma, major branches, and minor branches) have exquisitely different calcium signaling properties, with the smallest sub-compartments of the cell having the most abundant calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). Microglial processes are well known to dynamically extend and retract as they survey the brain microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eyo and Wu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wake et al., 2009</xref>). To date, microglial processes have not been extensively evaluated for their calcium activity in vivo, nor has any assessment been performed in the awake animal. Herein, we evaluated microglial soma and process calcium signaling in awake mice using two-photon microscopy.</p><p>One of the key questions in microglial research is the extent to which microglia functionally respond to neuronal activity in the mature brain. Testing a high signal-to-noise GCaMP variant (GCaMP6s) and a membrane-tethered GCaMP variant (Lck-GCaMP6f), we find that microglia have very infrequent calcium activity in their processes under basal conditions. However, microglial process calcium signaling is attuned to neuronal activity changes, with both neuronal hypoactivity and hyperactivity triggering increases in microglial process calcium signals. By contrast, microglial somatic calcium changes may represent a disease signature as somatic calcium changes were only evident in longitudinal epilepsy development. Our work reveals that microglia have highly dynamic process calcium activity during network activity shifts, most closely associated with processes undergoing extension or outgrowth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spontaneous microglial calcium activity in Lck-GCaMP6f and cytosolic GCaMP6s mice</title><p>Microglial calcium activity has been frequently described in situ, with limited studies performed in vivo. We first assessed microglial calcium activity in acute window preparations (24 hr after surgery), testing the utility of two sensors: GCaMP6s and Lck-GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). The GCaMP6s sensor was chosen for its ideal signal-to-noise ratio, while the Lck-GCaMP6f sensor was chosen to detect potential fast calcium transients, or transients highly localized to fine processes, as demonstrated in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). Both sensors were targeted to microglia using the CX3CR1<sup>CreER-IRES-eYFP</sup> mouse line. It is important to note that the low-level, but constitutive eYFP signal from this mouse was detected alongside the dynamic GCaMP6 calcium signal. Spontaneous calcium activity was studied in the awake, head-restrained animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), using two-photon microscopy to assess microglia in layer I and II/III of somatosensory cortex. Microglial calcium activity was present in both the Lck-GCaMP6f mouse and the cytosolic GCaMP6s mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). However, the higher fluorescence amplitude and slower decay kinetics in the GCaMP6s animal made this fluorophore ideal for studying calcium activity in thin microglial processes. On average, GCaMP6s reported calcium transients with a 50% greater amplitude and a 60% increase in signal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For these reasons, we could detect calcium events in a greater percentage of microdomains in the GCaMP6s animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we adopted GCaMP6s mice for our studies of microglial calcium activity. It should be mentioned, however, that Lck-GCaMP6f mice do report unique phenomenon not observed in the GCaMP6s mouse. Specifically, small amplitude, widespread, and temporally coordinated calcium events can be observed in the parenchyma of Lck-GCaMP6f mice using a grid-based analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous microglial calcium activity reported in the Lck-GCaMP6f and cytosolic GCaMP6s mouse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Imaging setup: in vivo two-photon imaging of microglial calcium activity in the awake, head-restrained animal.Â (<bold>B</bold>) Average intensity projection images and microglial âF/F calcium traces reported by Lck-GCaMP6f or cytosolic-GCaMP6s mice with a magnified cell. âF/F traces are from the soma and processes of a representative cell using manual segmentation.

We next assessed whether studying microglial calcium activity soon after surgery in the acute window preparation (&gt;24 hr) resulted in similar calcium activity patterns to a chronic window animal (4 weeks after surgery; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The morphology of cortical microglia was highly similar in acute and chronic window studies (Sholl analysis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Despite the similarities in morphology, microglial process calcium activity was significantly greater in acute window preparations, while somatic calcium activity levels were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâG</xref>). Approximately one-third of microglia somata exhibited calcium activity in layer I (55â75 Âµm depth) and layer II/III (150â170 Âµm depth) in both the acute and chronic window preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In the acute window preparation, most microglia were either completely inactive (24% of cells surveyed) or had spontaneous activity in under half of their processes (40% of cells surveyed; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, one month after surgical recovery, the proportion of active processes dropped further for both layer I microglia (56% to 35%), and layer II/III microglia (54% to 41%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, highly active processes sporadically observed across microglia in the acute window preparation were not maintained in the chronic window animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, in the chronic window animal, baseline recordings from the same region were stable over 3 successive days of recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

We first assessed whether general anesthesia impacts microglial calcium signaling. After recording baseline calcium activity in the awake animal, we introduced isoflurane anesthesia via nose cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, the isoflurane concentration chosen for maintenance (1.5â2% in oxygen) is intended to mimic strong sensory blockade during surgery and is higher than the concentration typically used during anesthetized imaging (0.5â1.5%). Our studies of neuronal activity indicate that 1.5â2% isoflurane maintenance can reduce excitatory calcium signaling by 91 Â± 0.11% in the somatosensory cortex (AAV.CaMKIIa.GCaMP6s.WPRE transfected mice, layer II/III of somatosensory cortex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâD</xref>). In response to strongly reduced neuronal activity, microglia demonstrate an increase in process calcium activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâG</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3âVideo 1</xref>). Increased microglial process calcium activity is first detected 6 min after anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and reaches peak levels approximately 10â20 min after isoflurane induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). At their peak, microglial processes display a 290 Â± 29% increase in average âF/F calcium signal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Despite strong increases in process calcium activity, somatic calcium signaling remained unaffected in microglia under general anesthesia, with no changes in the proportion or signal area of somatic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

Extension was the motility behavior most closely associated with calcium activity and large signal magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K,L</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, we observe that a near-linear range of neuronal activity shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) results in a U-shaped curve of microglial process calcium activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), with the greatest shifts in neuronal activity producing the largest microglial process calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of findings and observed relationship between neuronal activity and microglial calcium signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During âbaselineâ levels of neuronal activity in the awake mouse (middle panel), microglia demonstrate the lowest level of process calcium activity.

In general, microglia are considered to have the lowest levels of spontaneous calcium activity in ârestingâ or âbaselineâ states from reports in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brawek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). We observe that microglial calcium activity is similarly low in awake, chronic window mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). However, pharmacological alterations in neuronal activity can trigger microglial process calcium signaling without impacting somatic calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In general, microglial process calcium signaling follows a U-shaped curve, with greater shifts in neuronal activity (both hypoactive or hyperactive) resulting in stronger process calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Additionally, both shifts in network activity were associated with microglial process extension/outgrowth. Extending processes consistently demonstrated the greatest calcium activity. Our work initially suggests that microglial calcium signaling may be an important component in how microglia address brain state changes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Spontaneous microglial calcium activity and the utility of different GCaMP variants and preparations</title><p>Microglial have low spontaneous calcium activity in the anesthetized animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brawek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>), relative to reports of calcium activity in neurons and astrocytes. We initially wanted to determine if low spontaneous calcium activity in earlier reports was a product of the anesthesia used during imaging. Even in the awake animal, microglia do indeed display very infrequent spontaneous process and somaÂ calcium activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Previous studies also arrive on a key concept that injury, damage, and inflammation all produce increased or altered microglial calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brawek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brawek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). As resident CNS immune cells, microglia have a strong ability to sense inflammation and even low-level injury, which can occur during a craniotomy. By some reports, microglia can maintain a more reactive phenotype for multiple weeks after craniotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). For this reason, it was important that we compare microglial calcium signaling in an acute and chronic window preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found multiple lines of evidence that microglial process calcium signaling, but not somatic signaling, may be artificially inflated in the acute window preparation. In acute window preparations, a higher proportion of processes exhibited calcium signaling, and a subset of processes displayed calcium signals that were orders of magnitude above the average. In chronic window animals, both of these phenomena were attenuated. However, we could still evoke larger or widespread process calcium activity in chronic window animals, but only after introducing local or systemic changes in circuit activity (i.e. kainate). These observations suggest that chronic window preparations may better reflect the occurrence and magnitude of true spontaneous microglial calcium activity. The stability of spontaneous calcium activity in this preparation over multiple days also suggests that it is ideal for longitudinal studies.</p><p>One of the more unique observations made in our initial studies is the low-level, sometimes widespread fluorescent signature reported by the Lck-GCaMP6f animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We initially investigated calcium signaling using the Lck-GCaMP6f animal, because tethering GCaMP to the cell membrane could reveal key calcium signals in fine process structures, as demonstrated for astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesize that the coordinated, low-level signals detected by the Lck-GCaMP6f mouse could reflect neuronal activity changes sensed by surrounding microglial processes. In future studies, we will use bipolar EEG recording inside of the window to determine if the widespread, low-level fluorescent signature reported by Lck-GCaMP6fÂ indicatorÂ is temporally well-aligned with increased cortical activity. If so, this approach could provide the first evidence that microglia can respond to neuronal activity in real time.Â Prior reports have demonstrated real-time calcium responses only in the presence of pathology or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>An interesting question is whether the different GCaMP variants may also be able to report different mechanisms for calcium elevations. Given its cytosolic localization, GCaMP6s may be better suited to detect calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, which is canonically attributed to Gq-coupled GPCR signaling. On the other hand, the membrane localization of Lck-GCaMP6f may be able to detect calcium entry through membrane channels. Microglia express both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors for calcium elevations, particularly in the P2X (e.g. P2X7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eyo et al., 2013</xref>) and P2Y (e.g. P2Y6, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koizumi et al., 2007</xref>) family. Pharmacology experiments in vivo suggest that both routes of calcium entry are potentially viable in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>), but cytosolic calcium levels may be more important in damage responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, our previous work also suggests that extracellular calcium inhibits microglial process convergence, a key response to neuronal hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eyo et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies will investigate the potential signaling mechanism(s) underlying microglial calcium elevations in response to neuronal hyperactivity and hypoactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The relationship between neuronal activity changes, process extension, and process calcium signaling</title><p>Both approaches to increase or decrease neuronal activity resulted in elevated microglial calcium activity after a 6 to 15 min latency. The nature of the latency between neuronal changes and microglial calcium signaling does not suggest that microglia have a real-time response to neuronal activity in these instances. Instead, microglia appear to mobilize calcium signaling some minutes later. Our results suggest that microglial calcium signaling after neuronal activity changes is correlated with process motility, and extension in particular. This could reasonably explain the observed latency between neuronal activity and microglial calcium signaling. Our previous report suggests that isoflurane anesthesia applied to the awake mouse engages maximal process movement after a delay of up to 10 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), and our process area analysis in the current study replicates these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). On a similar timescale to process extension/outgrowth, microglia begin to show elevated process calcium signaling (6 min delay). We posit that the calcium associated with extending processes contributes to the majority of the overall calcium signaling observed. Similarly, we observe elevated microglial process calcium activity after Gq or Gi DREADD activation in CaMKIIa neurons. In these studies, peak microglial calcium activity was delayed by approximately 15 min from the timing of peak of neuronal activity. This longer delay may be attributable to the more gradual alterations in neuronal activity produced by DREADD-based approaches or the lesser overall magnitude of changes observed (30% to 70% change in neuronal calcium activity relative to an immediate 90% decrease under isoflurane). In either case, the timing of microglial process calcium activity follows the time course of motility changes, with extending processes contributing the most to overall calcium increases. This time scale is also on par with other microglial process motility responses, such as laser burn or local ATP, which require 10â20 min for processes to fully extend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davalos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between motility and calcium signaling in microglia, first observed in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Langfelder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nolte et al., 1996</xref>), is complex. Extending processes are not categorically associated with calcium activity in the present study (67â93% of extending processes had calcium activity across experiments). The temporal relationship between extension and calcium activity is also not universal, with approximately 50% of extending processes having a closely timed calcium event when studied after kainate status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). As a ubiquitous secondary messenger, calcium signaling is not expected to perfectly align with any one cellular function, such as motility. Our results suggest that calcium may be an important contributor to extension. Previous studies in vivo have shown that chelating calcium in microglia can reduce process velocity, but not abolish movement entirely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, calcium could be a co-regulator of motility under certain conditions, potentially modulating the P2Y12/Gi-based cAMP pathway or PI3 kinase signaling canonically implicated in process movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Another key future consideration is whether microglial calcium signaling occurs specifically when neuronal activity shifts awayÂ from baselineÂ specifically, or shifts in any manner (such as a shift from hypoactive back to baseline). We would hypothesize that shifts back to baseline may not be accompanied by microglial calcium activity, based upon the types of motility associated with these shifts. Specifically, we posit that process retraction would be most prominently observed during shifts back to baseline, and retracting processes rarely appear to mobilize calcium activity. These experiments will be ideal for testing predictions made from our early observations about the relationship between differentÂ motilityÂ behaviors and calcium signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The importance of microdomains in understanding glial calcium activity</title><p>Our findings clarify the role of neuronal activity on microglial calcium signaling. Previous studies using the GABA antagonist bicuculline to increase neuronal firing have come to different conclusions. In a first study, bicuculline did not alter microglial calcium activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>). However, this earlier study investigated bicuculline effects largely by imaging microglial somatic calcium activity reported through a calcium indicator dye. Our work suggests that it is unlikely that acute changes in neuronal activity, even under seizure conditions, will dramatically impact microglial somatic calcium activity. In a more recent study using the calcium indicator GCaMP5G, microglia exhibited strong calcium wave activity when bicuculline was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). Notably though, changes in neuronal activity were evoked in an inflammatory context, specifically occurring 12â24 hr after LPS application, which suggests a synergy between inflammation and excitation on microglial calcium activity. We hypothesize that this observation is informative for interpreting our longitudinal studies following kainate status epilepticus. The period following a brain insult like status epilepticus alters neuronal network synchronization, but it can also provoke inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van Vliet et al., 2018</xref>). Under these inflammatory and epileptogenic conditions, we similarly observe wave-like calcium activity in approximately 10% of imaging sessions, similar to the frequency described with bicuculline and LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, only under these long-term, pro-inflammatory conditions do we observe clear changes in microglial somatic calcium activity. The profoundly altered calcium signaling properties of microglia following status epilepticus, including whole-cell calcium transients, suggests that calcium may serve as a key secondary messenger system in microglia during disease development.</p><p>An important consideration in our work is the potential impact of the low-level eYFP signal. This signal was consistently detected alongside dynamic changes in GCaMP6 fluorescence, contributing to a higher baseline (F<sub>0</sub>) in âF/F<sub>0</sub> calculations. For these reasons, our work could underestimate the amount of calcium activity in microglia. Additionally, the eYFP signal could mask small, but biologically important calcium signals, like those reported in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Srinivasan et al., 2015</xref>). This could be most prominent in the soma, which exhibits a stronger eYFP signal. However, our results do not suggest such a caveat is likely to influence our major findings, as detected soma events were large in amplitude, prolonged, and exceedingly rare in the absence of pathology. In addition, these conclusions are very similar to other in vivo studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>), which recorded somatic microglial calcium activity in the absence of an eYFP signal. Of interest, our microdomain analysis suggest a similar concept in how both astrocytes and microglia utilize calcium activity. Astrocytes are known to exhibit calcium signaling most often in their fine processes, with somatic elevations being relatively less common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Taheri et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, in both cases, it appears glial cells exhibit more calcium activity in their smaller process domainsâthe regions most likely to interact with synapses, other glia, or vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms regulating microglial calcium signaling have not been clearly identified. ATP/ADP is the most definitive agonist of microglial calcium signaling to date, and purinergic receptors (ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y family) have been clearly implicated in transducing microglial calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">FÃ¤rber and Kettenmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pozner et al., 2015</xref>). While kainate and the Gq DREADD system could reasonably increase the release of purinergic signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Engel et al., 2016</xref>), evoking both process outgrowth (canonically P2Y12-driven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eyo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Swiatkowski et al., 2016</xref>) and process calcium activity (potentially P2Y6-driven, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Koizumi et al., 2007</xref>), it would be illogical for Gi DREADD and isoflurane to increase purinergic signaling. Recent studies suggest that depressing neuronal activity in the awake mouse prevents noradrenergic signaling to microglial Î²2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stowell et al., 2019</xref>). DuringÂ awakeÂ imaging, Î²2 receptorÂ activation in microglia restrains process surveillance, motility, and extension, keeping microglia in a relatively arrested state. The absence of this signaling axis when neuronal activity is reduced allows for extension, as we observed here in isoflurane and Gi DREADD studies. What is unclear, however, is whether Î²2 receptorÂ disinhibition also contributes to microglial calcium signaling during neuronal hypoactivity. In future, it will be critical to determine the mechanisms that govern microglial calcium responses to bidirectional shifts in neuronal activity. It is indeed possible that microglia indirectly respond to neuronal activity shifts, potentially through other cell types, like astrocytes, or even associated vascular changes; however, DREADD-based experiments do suggest that directÂ neuronal activity shifts areÂ upstream of microglial calcium elevations. Overall, we demonstrate that microglia display increases in process calcium signaling following bidirectional shifts in neuronal activity. Our work leaves open the possibility that microglial calcium signaling represents an important component in how microglia address brain state changes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>; male and female)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson labs</td><td>#016962</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>; male and female)</td><td>CX3CR1<sup>CreER-IRES-eYFP</sup></td><td>Jackson labs</td><td>#021160</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>; male and female)</td><td>GCaMP6s (cytosolic)</td><td>Jackson labs</td><td>#024106</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>; male and female)</td><td>Lck-GCaMP6f</td><td>Jackson labs</td><td>#029626</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>pENN.AAV.CaMKII.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Cat #: 105537-AAV9; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_100834">Addgene_100834</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>pAAV.CaMKIIa.hM3D(Gq)-mCherry</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Cat #: 50476-AAV5; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_50476">Addgene_50476</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>pAAV.CaMKIIa.hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Cat #: 50477-AAV5; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_50477">Addgene_50477</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Clozapine N-Oxide</td><td>Cayman</td><td>Cat #: 16882</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Isoflurane</td><td>Terrell</td><td>Cat #: 66794-019-10</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Kainic acid</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat #: 0222</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tamoxifen chow</td><td>Envigo</td><td>Cat #: TD.130856</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Excel</td><td>Microsoft</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>NIH</td><td/><td>Java 1.8.0_172</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism</td><td>GraphPad</td><td/><td>Version 8</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>5.2 mm Headplate</td><td>Neurotar</td><td>Model 2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td valign="top">Closed-loop temperature controller</td><td>Physitemp</td><td>TCAT-2DF</td><td>Used during isofluraneÂ imaging</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>VivoScope Galvo <break/>Multiphoton</td><td>Scientifica</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Mai-Tai DeepSee</td><td>Spectra-Physics</td><td>MAI TAI HP DS</td><td>2-P laser</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Mobile HomeCage</td><td>Neurotar</td><td>Cat #: NTR000289-01</td><td>Air table for in vivo imaging</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>UMP3 Ultra Micro Pump</td><td>WPI</td><td>Cat #: UMP3-4</td><td>Used in AAV delivery</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>GCaMP6s (Rosa26-CAG-LSL-GCaMP6s; 024106), Lck-GCaMP6f (Rosa26-CAG-LSL-Lck-GCaMP6f; 029626), and CX3CR1<sup>CreER-eYFP</sup> (021160) knock-in mouse lines can be obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.

Chronic window mice meeting these inclusion criteria were then re-imaged in the same two locations 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after status epilepticus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Two-photon imaging: chemogenetic studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>)</title><p>To validate the DREADD approach and determine CNO dose responses, we used WT C57BL/6J mice co-injected with AAV9.CaMKII.GCaMP6s and either AAV5.CaMKIIa.Gi-mCherry, or AAV5.CaMKIIa.Gq-mCherry. A cohort of mice injected with AAV9.CaMKII.GCaMP6s alone was employed for a CNO control study. To study the effects of CaMKIIa-DREADD effects on microglial calcium, we injected the Gq or Gi virus into GCaMP6s;Cx3Cr1<sup>CreER</sup> mice. All experiments were performed in chronic window animals (minimum of 4 weeks after window surgery and 7 weeks after virus injection). Somatic changes in neuronal calcium were studied in layer II/III (150â170 Âµm), while microglia were studied in layer I (55â75 Âµm depth). As a positive control for microglial studies, imaging was only performed in a region with high mCherry expression (visualized with a 740 nm excitation wavelength), and this region remained consistent across all trials. A trial consisted of a 15 min acclimation period to head restraint, 15 min baseline imaging session, removal and injection (saline or 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg CNO, i.p.), 15 min re-acclimation period under head restraint, then three 15 min post-injection imaging blocks. Post-injection changes in calcium activity were compared to the daily baseline period. CNO trials were separated by at least 48 hr, with lower doses administered first.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Calcium image processing and ROI selection</title><p>T-series of neuronal and microglial calcium activity were motion corrected in ImageJ using the template matching plugin with subpixel registration. An average intensity image of morphology was then generated for ROI selection. For neuronal somata, ROIs were manually drawn with the circle tool for all neuronal somata detected in layer II/III, which appeared as a light ring with a dark circular nucleus. For microglia, two approaches to ROI selection were used. In both approaches, an average intensity projection was created from the T-series. Notably, the low-intensity but constitutive eYFP signal of microglia is preferentially captured in the average intensity projection, providing an image of cell morphology that is not strongly influenced by overall calcium activity. In the first approach, used to characterize microdomain activity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, somata and processes were manually segmented using the âfreeformâ tool (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> for examples). Based upon their size and intensity, somata could be identified without ambiguity. Process segmentation followed three main rules: 1) the process had to be associated with a soma in the field of view, 2) all visible primary branches were segmented, and 3) any secondary branches emanating from a primary branch was segmented if greater than 15 pixels in length (~10 Âµm). This approach is referred to as âmanual segmentationâ in the text and the resulting process ROIs are termed âprocessesâ in figures. In the second approach, semi-automated microglial process detection was utilized, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, when an intervention was introduced that could result in a hypothesized change in calcium activity. In this approach, termed âthreshold-basedâ ROI selection, the following steps occurred: 1) the unambiguous microglial somata were manually segmented by the freeform tool; 2) after acquiring their intensity values for âF/F calculations, these brighter somata were masked in the average intensity image to better threshold processes; 3) process territories were then identified in a semi-automated fashion using the threshold tool at a user-defined threshold level; 4) any process area larger than 50 pixels was included in the ROI manager; 5) these ROIs were then used to obtain intensity values. The threshold-based ROIs generated through these methods are termed âprocess territoriesâ as they often represent a primary process with multiple secondary and tertiary branches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Calcium activity analysis</title><p>Using the ROIs generated through the above methods, the multi-measure tool was used to obtain mean intensity values, which were converted into âF/F values using Excel. To determine the baseline fluorescence, we created a 100 s moving window average and then found the lower 25<sup>th</sup> quartile value across all frames. In certain cases of high activity, such as seizures during status epilepticus or spreading microglial calcium waves, the baseline was determined by finding the lower 25<sup>th</sup> quartile value in a user-selected, 200-frame period of non-seizure or non-wave activity. A calcium transient was considered to occur at a âF/F threshold over three times greater than the standard deviation of the baseline. The signal area represents the sum of any âF/F value above this threshold across all frames. A soma or process was considered active if it had a signal area ofÂ â¥5 âF/Fâs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Process area and Sholl analyses</title><p>In experiments where motility changes were evaluated in real time (i.e. during the single-day experiments), we determined changes in overall process area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Using average intensity projections of the eYFP signal (full 600 or 900 frames), microglial somata were masked and a uniform threshold was applied to determine the process area. In longitudinal experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), morphological complexity was determined using the Sholl analysis plugin of ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Motility analysis and assessment of extension or retraction</title><p>To determine process motility behavior, an average intensity image was generated from the first and last 100 frames of the T-series. From these images, a two-color overlay image was created (red: first; green: last). This image was used to initially highlight processes that underwent retraction (red color), extension (green color), or remained stable (red/green merge; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> for example). ROIs were manually created around each process then multiple steps were taken before final inclusion. First, all processes selected needed to be a minimum size for inclusion (&gt;9 Âµm<sup>2</sup>). Second, each process was visually inspected in the T-series for extension, retraction, or stability. Finally, processes needed to display at least a 50% area enlargement to be considered an extension (e.g. 10 Âµm<sup>2</sup> to 15 Âµm<sup>2</sup>) or 50% area decrease to be considered a retraction (e.g. 10 Âµm<sup>2</sup> to 5 Âµm<sup>2</sup>). Stable processes had less than a 50% change in area in either direction. After confirmation, these ROIs were also used to generate âF/F calcium traces to determine signal area and associated calcium activity based on each motility characteristic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6K and L</xref>). A process was considered to be associated with calcium activity if it had a signal area ofÂ &gt;5 âF/Fâs.</p><p>To determine temporal correlations between process extension/retraction and calcium events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), processes were selected as previously described using a manual ROI. We determined the start and end time of an extension/retraction event by using the threshold tool to create a frame-by-frame assessment of process area. The start of extension was defined as the first frame in a series of frames where process area became sequentially larger, while the end of extension was defined by a plateau in process area. The start of retraction was defined as the first frame in a series in which the process area began to reduce, while the end of retraction was defined by a plateau at a minimum value. We determined the temporal relationship between this extension/retraction start time and calcium events by determining the closest calcium event before and after the start time (if present, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref> for examples). A calcium event needed to have a peak âF/F value of 0.5 to be considered, and only the nearest event before or after was considered. The latency between the peak of these calcium events relative to the start of extension/retraction was calculated for all extending/retracting processes in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> analysis and then binned by processes with anÂ &lt;30 s,&lt;60 s, orÂ &lt;120 s latency between calcium event and extension/retraction start.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>General statistical analysis</title><p>A pilot study was first performed in acute window animals (NÂ =Â 5) to determine the effect size and variability that isoflurane and acute kainate exposure had on microglial calcium activity. Based upon variability derived from these preliminary data, a power analysis was performed and an appropriately sized cohort was determined at a 0.05 alpha and 0.70 power level.</p><p>Two major effects were biologically replicated across two cohorts. We first observed the effects of kainate and isoflurane on microglial calcium activity in a pilot cohort (NÂ =Â 5) using acute window animals. We then studied these effects in a separate cohort using chronic window animals (chronic window findings are reported in the present study after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The effects of kainate and isoflurane were consistent in both cohorts and contexts. In addition, DREADD-based changes in both neuronal calcium activity and microglial calcium activity were technically replicated in the same respective cohorts after a 1-week delay. These replicates showed similar trends. Findings from the initial test are reported in the present study (not pooled or averaged). No outliers were removed from the data. The only grounds for animal study exclusion were based upon technical guidelines: two acute window animals were excluded due to post-operative cranial bleeding; approximately 30% of cranial window animals did not develop a sufficiently clear chronic window for adequate imaging and were excluded; two GCaMP6s;Cx3Cr1<sup>CreER</sup> mice in DREADD studies (one transfected with Gq virus and one transfected with Gi virus) were excluded due to a rare chronic window bleed or the loss of a headcap, respectively.</p><p>Prism (GraphPad, version 8) was used for group analyses. In most experiments, statistical significance was determined using a one- or two-way ANOVA design with Dunnett post-hoc comparison to the values obtained in the baseline period. Differences in the proportion of active microdomains were assessed using a Fisherâs exact test. All data are expressed as the meanÂ Â±Â SEM.

The studies used a range of pharmacological and genetic methods to induce widespread changes in neuronal activity and correlated these to microglial calcium levels, process dynamics and cell size. The general conclusions are important â that microglia exhibit calcium dynamics that change with a substantial delay after altering neuronal activity, and that both increasing and decreasing neuronal activity leads to an increase in calcium and process extension.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors used CX3CR1-CreER-ires-EYFP mice crossed with cre-dependent GCaMP6s and lck-GCaMP6f calcium indicators, and thus performed simultaneous imaging of EGFP and EYFP. Apparently, there was no attempt to split these signals â due to their spectral overlap, it would be near impossible. As a result, the fluorescence changes reflect a combined GCaMP/EYFP signal. This needs to be clearly stated at the outset. As a result, the GCaMP signal to noise is reduced, so many smaller GCaMP fluctuations may have been missed. In the CX3CR1-CreER-ires-EYFP mice, the EYFP signal tends to be strongest in microglial somas â will this then preferentially impact the ability to detect subtle changes in GFP signal within microglial somas? This issue should be discussed. If the authors have data from animals expressing GCaMP only, it would be helpful to include some of these data for comparison. A second caveat with this approach is that all fluorescence fluctuations are interpreted as changes in intracellular calcium. Given the small size of these processes and their dynamic nature, there is concern that movements could also contribute to the fluctuations observed. This issue also needs to be discussed. Large scale coordination of events such as that shown in Figure 1E (Eii) raise concerns about such potential artefacts.</p><p>2) It is surprising that the authors did not use automated detection algorithms to identify and quantify microglia calcium transients and define microglial movements. A number of such programs have been developed and are readily available. The method of ROI categorization needs to be described more thoroughly and higher magnification images shown to validate the approach. They should show an example image that indicates a typical soma ROI and typical process ROIs with corresponding ÎF/F traces for those ROIs. (Figure 2C shows one cell with arrows but doesn't show the actual ROIs with some kind of outline). Without this information, there is confusion about what the ÎF/F traces represent. In Figures 1 and 2 â are these soma and individual process ROIs from a single representative cell or multiple process ROIs from different cells across one field of view? In Figures 3 and 4 where &quot;process territory&quot; ROIs are used â do the ÎF/F traces represent calcium signals in microglial processes in the entire field of view from different animals? Or process territories from different, individual microglial cells? What is the justification for examining individual process ROIs in Figures 1 and 2 but whole process territory ROIs in Figures 3 and 4? In Figures 5 and 6 the ÎF/F traces are labeled with &quot;Processes&quot; so it's unclear if individual ROIs on distinct regions of processes were used as in Figures 1 and 2 or if process territories were used as in Figures 3 and 4.</p><p>3) In trying to address the question about what are the basic patterns of calcium activity in microglial cells, the authors miss an opportunity to provide additional, useful information using the images they have already acquired. Are the cells that show soma calcium elevations the same group of cells that show process elevations? Or can you sometimes see cells that have only soma calcium elevations or only process calcium elevations? Of the cells that do show calcium elevations, are they scattered throughout the field of view or do they tend to be spatially clustered close to one another? What about these same questions following isoflurane, kainate, or DREADD manipulations? Also â if the mice are being imaged while on the NeuroTar air-lifted platform as described in the Materials and methods, can the authors comment about any relationship between microglial calcium elevations and ambulation or grooming?</p><p>4) One of the most interesting aspects of the work relates to linking process dynamics to changes in intracellular calcium. However, this phenomenon and quantification of this relationship needs to be illustrated better. For example, in Figure 3, the microglia are shown at such low magnification that it is not possible to visualize their processes. Indeed, many of the images are quite small and make it hard to judge how effectively the authors are able to visualize and analyze individual microglial processes (Figure 1B, Ei-iii, Figure 2C, D and G, Figure 5D, Figure 6J)In each such example, the authors need to provide several examples of individual processes and a time series of images showing the fluorescence changes that accompany the morphological changes. In trying to address questions about the relationship between microglial calcium elevations and process motility, the authors should do more to demonstrate how tightly associated (or not) are calcium elevations and process extensions. In Figure 3H, they indicate that 48% of process extensions occur in the absence of detectable calcium elevation. This would seem to indicate that these two processes are somewhat independent of one another. However, is this percentage derived from cells that they are certain express GCaMP because they've seen somatic or other process calcium elevations at some point during imaging? Or does this 48% include process extensions of cells that may not even express GCaMP? This same information (percentage of process extension/retraction/stable events that are associated with calcium elevations) should also be presented in the kainate (Figure 5) and DREADD (Figure 6) experiments. Figure 5F is potentially the most useful in showing whether there is a tight temporal relationship between process extension and calcium elevations. But we don't know if a similar temporal relationship is present in all processes that have both calcium elevations and extension or if there are also examples of processes that show extension and calcium elevations that are not temporally aligned. Can the authors show a similar panel to 5F for the isoflurane and DREADD experiments? For all instances of process extension accompanied by calcium elevations, can they quantify in some way the degree to which process extension and calcium elevations are temporally aligned and present this information?</p><p>5) In trying to address questions about the relationship between microglial calcium elevations and neuronal activity, the authors should similarly provide additional analyses of how closely aligned in time are the two phenomena. In the isofluorane and DREADD experiments (Figure 3 and Figure 6), the 10-15 min long bins used for quantification make it challenging to understand how closely aligned in time are changes neuronal activity and changes in microglial calcium signaling. We appreciate that using smaller time bins may be challenging, but in the absence of more detailed information about the onset of detectable changes in neuronal activity and how this relates to the onset of detectable changes in microglial calcium signals, statements that &quot;microglia are attuned to changes in neuronal network activity&quot; are not well supported. Perhaps microglia are tuned to changes in astrocyte state and this is modified by shifts in neuronal network activity.</p><p>More detailed information about the temporal relationship between changes in neuronal activity and microglial calcium activity could help with speculating about mechanisms involved. Were the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in microglial processes only observed when neuronal activity specifically changed from normal levels to enhanced/silent levels? Or, were Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients observed when neuronal activity changed more generally between different levels, e.g. low to normal, high to normal, high to low? We believe that it would be sufficient to explore this question in an acute brain slice preparation where it might be easier to manipulate neuronal activity by employing receptor/channel reagents. At the very least, this issue should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>The authors investigated the long-term relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in microglia and neuronal activity (Figure 5), but they did not check the neuronal activity in these experiments. For how long does the increase in neuronal activity last after kainate administration? Would this increase in neuronal activity be sustained and constant or more sporadic in nature? Could the change in neuronal activity in fact be more temporary itself but yet still trigger a sustained, long-lasting increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in microglia? To address these questions, it is necessary to monitor neuronal activity throughout the entire time course following kainate administration, e.g. by EEG or neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging etc.</p><p>6) We need some indication about what the recombination efficiency is when giving tamoxifen in the diet as described. Otherwise, when presenting the percentage of microglial somas that exhibit calcium transients, we don't know if this is the percentage of GCaMP+ microglia that show spontaneous calcium elevations or if those cells that are &quot;inactive&quot; include cells that may not even express GCaMP.</p><p>7) The Discussion is quite brief and does not include any comments on either the nature of the delay in microglial responses or the function of the dynamic changes in process extension in relation to the changes in neuronal activity. I recommend that this section be extended. In their discussion of possible mechanisms regulating microglial calcium signaling, can the authors also comment on whether these calcium signals are likely to be solely driven by influx of calcium through plasma membrane receptors versus supplemented or driven by release of calcium from intracellular stores? Can they tease out any difference in the dynamics or magnitude of microglial calcium signaling following network inhibition and network excitation that would support the idea of different mechanisms driving microglial calcium signals in each context?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56502.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors used CX3CR1-CreER-ires-EYFP mice crossed with cre-dependent GCaMP6s and lck-GCaMP6f calcium indicators, and thus performed simultaneous imaging of EGFP and EYFP.

As shown theoretically with a spectral viewing program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and confirmed empirically, splitting the signal significantly attenuates GCaMP detection in the GFP channel (19% of total) and does not prevent spectral overlap (30% of the GCaMP signal collected in the YFP channel). On the other hand, maintaining both signals in one channel without attenuation (520/15 filter) preferentially detected GCaMP emission (estimated 45% of total potential emission, not shown) over eYFP emission (26% of total potential emission, not shown). The filter information has been added to the Materials and methods section. Additionally, we recently recorded laser power at the objective instead of along the laser path and updated those values in text to give a more accurate evaluation of the laser power at the cranial window. We have also added a statement about the combined GCaMP/eYFP signal in the text both immediately in the Results (subsection âSpontaneous microglial calcium activity reported in the Lck-GCaMP6f and cytosolic GCaMP6s mouseâ) and in the Discussion (subsection âThe importance of microdomains in understanding glial calcium activityâ).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Estimated collection efficiency of GCaMP6 and eYFP with a âGFP/YFPâ filter set.</title><p>Our initial approach to split these close spectra resulted in stronger GCaMP fluorescence in the YFP channel than the GFP channel and resulted in significant signal attenuation.

This does leave open the possibility for smaller fluctuations to be missed due to an artificially higher baseline (the F<sub>0</sub> in our DF/F<sub>0</sub>). The potential under-reporting, particularly of smaller events has been discussed in the text (subsection âThe importance of microdomains in understanding glial calcium activityâ). Here we also concede that there is a potential bias for events in the soma to be particularly missed, but these events would need to be rapid and low amplitude. On the other hand, we also draw parallels between our work and other in vivo microglial calcium studies reaching similar conclusions about the rarity of somatic microglial calcium events (Eichhoff et al., 2011; Pozner et al., 2015).</p><p>Unfortunately, our mouse colony has historically kept the CX3CR1-CreER-IRES-eYFP line, not the CX3CR1-CreER line. Therefore, we do not have data from a mouse expressing GCaMP6s in microglia without the eYFP signal. However, we consider this a very important point and will be acquiring other microglia CreER lines soon to evaluate in future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second caveat with this approach is that all fluorescence fluctuations are interpreted as changes in intracellular calcium.

If we understand your question, we might restate it as âany rapid movement in the x/y/z plane could result in a region of fluorescence moving in and out of the ROI, resulting in what erroneously appears as a calcium change.â We took the example of Figure 1E further to analyze this point and suggest the following: If there is a rapid shift in the focal plane in any direction, one would expect both a negative deflection (fluorescence moves out of the ROI, leading to a decrease in intensity reading) followed by a positive deflection (fluorescence moves back into the ROI, increasing the intensity reading). After subpixel registration, we do not see major decreases in fluorescence intensity, only positive increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Further, we utilized the ImageJ registration plugin (Align Slices in Stack) for Figure 1E to tell us how much correction (in pixel distance) occurred from one frame to another. We plotted this pixel displacement as a proxy to quick shifts in the focal plane, presumably due to animal movements. This is plotted against the DF/F traces gathered in Figure 1E. We can see no clear correlation between shifts in the imaging frame and calcium events. The synchronized and coordinated calcium signals are hypothesized to reflect neuronal activity changes sensed by surrounding microglial processes. In the Discussion (subsection âSpontaneous microglial calcium activity and the utility of different GCaMP variants and preparationsâ), we discuss a potential hypothesis and future direction to study this phenomenon.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Exploring movements and potential erroneous calcium detection.</title><p>Adapted from Figure 1E, we do not see that frame-by-frame shifts (black line, pixel displacement detected by registration plugin) correlates with increases in calcium activity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56502-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is surprising that the authors did not use automated detection algorithms to identify and quantify microglia calcium transients and define microglial movements.

Multiple automated programs were tested over the past year for calcium detection.</p><p>1) Inscopix data processing software: We first attempted to use the PCA/ICA package embedded in the Inscopix data processing software to automatically detect microglial process events after masking the soma region across all frames. We found this program often would overestimate or underestimate process size or create redundancies.</p><p>2) Romano et al.âs computational toolbox:We also tried the Romano et al., 2017 program published in PLOS Computational Biology. Multiple processing steps in this toolbox were helpful, but ultimately, the user-guided parameters available for ROI detection were not ideal for detecting the complex shape of microglial processes (Romano et al., 2017).</p><p>3) GECI Quant:Dr. Bal Khakhâs GECI Quant program, an ImageJ-based detection program is ultimately very similar to our overall approach for process territory detection. GECI Quant first conducts frame-by-frame background subtraction, then has the user hand-segment somata, then has the user draw a bounding box around a territory of processes, which are detected at a user-defined threshold level. These steps generate threshold-based ROIs used in DF/F calculations. Our processing steps in finding process territories are very similar: (1) we created an average intensity projection, (2) hand-drew ROIs around somata, (3) used multi-measure to obtain soma intensity values for DF/F calculations, (4) masked these somata to better threshold processes, (5) threshold-selected processes with the analyze particles tool and added them to the ROI manager to create process territory ROIs, then (6) used multi-measure to obtain intensity values for these process territories used in DF/F calculations. We could have used GECI Quant in our analysis, except the data tabulation and program work-through is much slower than the simplified macros we created to preprocess data and obtain intensity values. Ultimately, we would argue that our process territory approach is reasonably similar to other programs that are considered semi-automated ROI detection approaches (Srinivasan et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The method of ROI categorization needs to be described more thoroughly and higher magnification images shown to validate the approach.

We did not feel that this characterization presented strong cause for concern regarding bias, so we wanted to use the best approach we could employ. In Figures 3 and 4, we are testing whether an intervention like isoflurane or kainate alters microglial calcium activity.

We have performed this analysis and added the results as Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B. Microglia with somatic activity are not more likely to have process activity. Our results showed that about 25% of all microglia surveyed have soma and process calcium activity, while approximately 50% of microglia have process calcium activity without somatic calcium activity. Specifically, cells with only somatic calcium elevations are quite rare (&lt;5%).

Here are the additional analysis to address the reviewersâ concerns: For Figure 1B we added a zoomed-in image of a microglial cell with processes for both the Lck-GCaMP6f and cyto-GCaMP6s mouse. For Figure 1E, we did not perform process-based analyses and instead adopted a grid-based approach to describe the diffuse signal that largely originates in more parenchymal spaces. For Figure 2 panels, we created Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 to demonstrate multiple microglia and the creation of manual ROIs to study their motility. For Figure 5D, we added a zoomed-in image of an individual cell. For Figure 6J, we created Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 to highlight microglia processes.</p><p>We initially created time series images of processes (see Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A and B) and attempted to inter-relate these images to expanded DF/F traces. However, we realized that doing this for all the requested figures with multiple examples for extension, retraction, or stable processes would take up a lot of figure space. We would kindly request to instead show such dynamics with videos, such as Figure 5âvideo 2 for the Figure 5 dataset. Additionally, motility and calcium can be viewed in Figure 3âvideo 1 for the isoflurane study and Figure 6âvideo 1 for the DREADD studies. However, we agree that better visualization of these phenomenon would improve the manuscript and we created multiple figure supplements to show a two-color image of extending, retracing, or stable processes and their calcium traces (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1, Figure 5âfigure supplement 2, Figure 6âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In trying to address questions about the relationship between microglial calcium elevations and process motility, the authors should do more to demonstrate how tightly associated (or not) are calcium elevations and process extensions. In Figure 3H, they indicate that 48% of process extensions occur in the absence of detectable calcium elevation. This would seem to indicate that these two processes are somewhat independent of one another. However, is this percentage derived from cells that they are certain express GCaMP because they've seen somatic or other process calcium elevations at some point during imaging? Or does this 48% include process extensions of cells that may not even express GCaMP? This same information (percentage of process extension/retraction/stable events that are associated with calcium elevations) should also be presented in the kainate (Figure 5) and DREADD (Figure 6) experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the great questions. This percentage has been derived from all cells/processes we could detect in the field of view. We did not include/exclude cells based upon whether any part of the cell had GCaMP activity. However, as explained in response to Question 6, we find that recombination is pretty high in our studies (at least 85%), so non-expression of GCaMP would not likely explain the ~50% of process extensions occurring without calcium activity. To address the reviewersâ concerns, we have performed the additional analysis: The percentage of process extension/retraction/stable events associated with calcium elevations has been added for the kainate figure (Figure 5G) in place of the cumulative distribution plot. This has also been added for the Gi and Gq DREADD datasets (Figure 6K and L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5F is potentially the most useful in showing whether there is a tight temporal relationship between process extension and calcium elevations. But we don't know if a similar temporal relationship is present in all processes that have both calcium elevations and extension or if there are also examples of processes that show extension and calcium elevations that are not temporally aligned. Can the authors show a similar panel to 5F for the isoflurane and DREADD experiments? For all instances of process extension accompanied by calcium elevations, can they quantify in some way the degree to which process extension and calcium elevations are temporally aligned and present this information?</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to Figure 5F data, we have found a cleaner way to display this information with less figure space by highlighting the start and stop of extension/retraction overlaid with the DF/F trace (now Figure 5âfigure supplement 2). This visualization approach was used for the isoflurane (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1) and DREADD experiments (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1).</p><p>We performed temporal analysis for the data one day after kainate status epilepticus (Figure 5H and Figure 5âfigure supplement 2). In this dataset, we find that 51% of extending processes have a calcium event occurring within 1 minute of extension start, compared to 18% in retracting processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In trying to address questions about the relationship between microglial calcium elevations and neuronal activity, the authors should similarly provide additional analyses of how closely aligned in time are the two phenomena. In the isofluorane and DREADD experiments (Figure 3 and Figure 6), the 10-15 min long bins used for quantification make it challenging to understand how closely aligned in time are changes neuronal activity and changes in microglial calcium signaling. We appreciate that using smaller time bins may be challenging, but in the absence of more detailed information about the onset of detectable changes in neuronal activity and how this relates to the onset of detectable changes in microglial calcium signals, statements that &quot;microglia are attuned to changes in neuronal network activity&quot; are not well supported. Perhaps microglia are tuned to changes in astrocyte state and this is modified by shifts in neuronal network activity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. For the isoflurane experiments, we created Figure 3H to analyze process territory calcium signal area using one-minute bins. These values were then compared using a one-sample t-test to the average baseline period value to determine when significant changes in calcium signal area are first detected. We find significant process calcium activity above baseline is detected within 6 minutes after isoflurane exposure.</p><p>However, we began this analysis for the DREADD experiments and found it difficult to draw any sounder conclusions. In the isoflurane experiments, we know: (1) that there was a clear start time for neuronal silencing (within 1 minute after induction, Figure 3C); (2) that neuronal activity was consistently silenced across all animals (~90%, Figure 3B-D); (3) that these results should be generalizable between cohorts. On the other hand: (1) DREADD-based effects take time to develop (progressive increase or decrease in activity, Figure 6D), while gas anesthetic action is near instantaneous; (2) variability in the time-of-peak effect exists between animals; (3) DREADD effects in the neuronal study cohort are broadly generalizable to the microglial study cohort, but probably cannot be used to draw firm minute-by-minute conclusions. After performing the minute-by-minute analysis, we still find that microglial calcium activity peaks approximately 15 minutes after the peak change in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Minute-by-Minute relationship between microglial calcium activity and neuronal activity changes.</title><p>An example of breaking down neuronal calcium activity (top) into 3 min bins correlated with changes in microglial calcium activity.

We have dedicated a major section of our Discussion to this consideration (subsection âThe relationship between neuronal activity changes, process extension, and process calcium signalingâ). In addition, we agree that our results do not demonstrate a direct relationship between neuronal activity and microglial process signaling (i.e. real-time neurotransmitter release is the impetus for the observed microglial calcium signals). We have added this key point to the Discussion (subsection âThe importance of microdomains in understanding glial calcium activityâ). However, we also think it is important to consider that in DREADD-based experiments, neuronal activity changes are the start of a biological process that results in microglial calcium signaling increases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More detailed information about the temporal relationship between changes in neuronal activity and microglial calcium activity could help with speculating about mechanisms involved. Were the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in microglial processes only observed when neuronal activity specifically changed from normal levels to enhanced/silent levels? Or, were Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients observed when neuronal activity changed more generally between different levels, e.g. low to normal, high to normal, high to low? We believe that it would be sufficient to explore this question in an acute brain slice preparation where it might be easier to manipulate neuronal activity by employing receptor/channel reagents. At the very least, this issue should be discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful point of consideration. This is indeed a current area of exploration in brain slices, representing a large undertaking to determine the mechanism(s) of microglial calcium signaling. Therefore, we would like to develop future projects that move from slice to an in vivo context exploring identified mechanisms. We discussed the question of state changes in relation to our current model (Discussion, subsection âThe relationship between neuronal activity changes, process extension, and process calcium signalingâ). Based upon our current work, we would hypothesize that state changes back to baseline may not trigger notable calcium elevations in microglia. These state changes are anticipated to involve more retraction than extension as microglia return to a less extended/surveilling state. Our work predicts that state changes engaging process retraction would not result in elevated calcium activity in microglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors investigated the long-term relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in microglia and neuronal activity (Figure 5), but they did not check the neuronal activity in these experiments. For how long does the increase in neuronal activity last after kainate administration? Would this increase in neuronal activity be sustained and constant or more sporadic in nature? Could the change in neuronal activity in fact be more temporary itself but yet still trigger a sustained, long-lasting increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in microglia? To address these questions, it is necessary to monitor neuronal activity throughout the entire time course following kainate administration, e.g. by EEG or neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging etc.</p></disp-quote><p>While we did not perform these experiments using neuronal calcium imaging or EEG, the first author has previously investigated the systemic kainate mouse model extensively using 24/7 video EEG (Umpierre et al., 2018, 2016). In his previously published studies, spectral analysis of cortical EEG from the parietal cortex indicates that neuronal activity broadly falls into three periods:</p><p>In the first 3 days after kainate status epilepticus, neuronal activity remains elevated. This could be considered evidence that more sustained elevations in neuronal activity occur in this period. EEG traces in this period commonly show interictal spiking as well as some sub-clinical (focal-cortical) seizure activity that does not secondarily generalize. These events could be considered more sporadic manifestations of coordinated neuronal activity increases.</p><p>Between 3-7 days after kainate status epilepticus, increased electrographic power begins to decrease and subclinical seizures are no longer observed; however, interictal spiking can persist, but normally at a reduced frequency.</p><p>Between 7-14 days after kainate status epilepticus, electrographic power is not noticeably increased. Interictal spiking is variable: persisting in some animals, gone in others, or manifesting sporadically over 24-72hr periods in others.</p><p>Spontaneous, generalized seizures are rare in the systemic kainate model and are not seen until 14 days after status epilepticus at earliest. Therefore, it is unlikely that spontaneous, epileptic seizures factored into the data. For multiple logistical reasons, it is very difficult to implant an EEG electrode in a mouse with a Neurotar headplate and retain this surgical assembly for many weeks, which is why we did not attempt to perform simultaneous, near-24/7 video EEG alongside longitudinal calcium imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) We need some indication about what the recombination efficiency is when giving tamoxifen in the diet as described. Otherwise, when presenting the percentage of microglial somas that exhibit calcium transients, we don't know if this is the percentage of GCaMP+ microglia that show spontaneous calcium elevations or if those cells that are &quot;inactive&quot; include cells that may not even express GCaMP.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we initially intended to study; however, when we tried to design the experiment, we realized it could be quite difficult. In brief, the sequence similarity between eYFP and GCaMP (a circularly permutated GFP molecule) represented a strong concern for interpreting IHC data if antibodies detect a conserved epitope. If so, we could not tell all CX3CR1+ cells with constitutive eYFP expression from recombined cells with additional GCaMP expression.</p><p>Alternatively, we provide some evidence of recombination efficiency. We looked at the longitudinal study of microglial calcium activity following status epilepticus in chronic window animals (N=5). Our closest proxy to a positive control (similar to ATP application in culture or slice experiments) would be spreading wave calcium activity, where a large event propagates throughout the entire area of imaging (N=3/5 animals), or during the day of highest activity in the absence a wave (N=2/5 animals). To determine if a cell viably expressed GCaMP, we counted whether any part of a microglial cell exhibited calcium activity during these videos across all cells clearly identifiable in the area. After identifying cells with no activity, we also searched longitudinally through the dataset looking at other imaging days to determine if these non-active cells had an event on another day. Using this approach, we found that between 85-100% of microglia had a calcium response somewhere within the cell over multiple days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>; mean Â± SEM: 89 Â± 6%). This is decent evidence from a cohort of male and female mice that our recombination is likely strong.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Longitudinal survey of active microglia in the kainate cohort.</title><p>(Left) The survey method was used to observe any clear calcium event within any part of a cell (green outline) or confirm no observable event in the 15-minute recording (red outline).

I recommend that this section be extended. In their discussion of possible mechanisms regulating microglial calcium signaling, can the authors also comment on whether these calcium signals are likely to be solely driven by influx of calcium through plasma membrane receptors versus supplemented or driven by release of calcium from intracellular stores? Can they tease out any difference in the dynamics or magnitude of microglial calcium signaling following network inhibition and network excitation that would support the idea of different mechanisms driving microglial calcium signals in each context?</p></disp-quote><p>Our manuscript was originally developed as a short report, leading to a shortened Discussion. We have expanded our Discussion to include the following topics: (1) discussion on the eYFP signal and how it impacts the study, (2) the nature of the delay in microglial responses and how it relates to motility and neuronal changes, (3) ionotropic versus metabotropic signaling mechanisms based upon previous in vivo work by others addressing this distinction, and (4) future directions and hypotheses regarding the Lck-GCaMP6f signal. Potential mechanisms are also discussed, which we are currently pursuing in brain slice.</p><p>In the Discussion, we mention other research (Eichhoff et al., 2011; Pozner et al., 2015) showing that both calcium influx pathways and intracellular calcium stores can be activated in vivoin microglia, but intracellular calcium stores appear to be more important for the injury responses studied in prior research. Based on the calcium signature observed in cytosolic-GCaMP6s microglia (including event size, spread, kinetics, and amplitude), we would have to posit that most of what we observe is consistent with intracellular store calcium. However, the calcium activity observed in the Lck-GCaMP6f mouse leaves open the possibility that this very rapid, small amplitude and diffuse calcium signature could potentially be calcium influx. We intend to test selective ionotropic and metabotropic receptor pharmacology in slice to discern the mechanism(s) for calcium elevations in microglia, but cannot give a definitive answer at this time.</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot tease out any difference in the dynamics or magnitude of microglia calcium signaling after network inhibition or excitation. In DREADD-based experiments, approximately equal increases or decreases in neuronal calcium activity (i.e. a 31% decrease versus a 42% increase) results in very similar increases in microglial calcium signaling (64% versus 68% peak calcium signaling elevations) and have similar latencies. Thus, we do not detect major differences in the timing or magnitude of microglial calcium changes in response to reasonably equivalent shifts towards hyperactivity or hypoactivity.</p><p>References:</p><p>Romano SA, PÃ©rez-Schuster V, Jouary A, Candeo A, Boulanger-Weill J, Sumbre G. 2017.
