The involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in this process has been established in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. However, the detailed regulatory cascade remains elusive, and it is also unknown whether the MAPK-dependent mitotic regulation is evolutionarily conserved in the single-cell eukaryotic organisms such as fission yeast (<italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>). Here, we show that two MAPKs in <italic>S. pombe</italic> indeed act in concert to restrain anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activity upon activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). One MAPK, Pmk1, binds to and phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>, the co-activator of APC/C. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> by Pmk1, but not by Cdk1, promotes its subsequent ubiquitylation and degradation. Intriguingly, Pmk1-mediated phosphorylation event is also required to sustain SAC under environmental stress. Thus, our study establishes a new underlying molecular mechanism of negative regulation of APC/C by MAPK upon stress stimuli, and provides a previously unappreciated framework for regulation of anaphase entry in eukaryotic cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome</kwd><kwd>APC/C</kwd><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>SAC</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd><kwd>Slp1/Cdc20</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Quan-wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31671411</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Quan-wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibitory effect on the activation of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) by MAPK Pmk1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The evolutionarily conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways regulate multiple cellular functions in eukaryotic organisms in response to a wide variety of environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plotnikov et al., 2011</xref>). However, different MAPK pathways have been evolved in an organism to integrate diverse signals and fulfill different regulations on various effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ronkina and Gaestel, 2022</xref>). This makes specifying the MAPKs and substrates involved in a specific physiological process rather complex and challenging.</p><p>The fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> has three MAPK-signaling cascades: the pheromone signaling pathway (PSP), the stress-activated pathway (SAP), and the cell integrity pathway (CIP), with Spk1, Sty1, or Pmk1 as the MAPK, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cansado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perez and Cansado, 2010</xref>). So far, the only known cell-cycle control stages linked to MAPKs in fission yeast are at G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>). The p38 MAPK family member Sty1 either arrests or promotes mitotic commitment in unperturbed, stressed, or resumed cell cycles after stress depending on the downstream kinases it associates with. Sty1 can phosphorylate kinase Srk1 or Polo kinase Plo1 to negatively or positively regulate Cdc25 phosphatase and thus the onset of mitosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López-Avilés et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Avilés et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petersen and Hagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petersen and Nurse, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Recent studies have also demonstrated that Sty1 and Pmk1 can pose negative effect on assembly of contractile actomyosin ring and cytokinesis in response to actin cytoskeleton damage or cell wall stress (e.g. treatment with blankophor, caspofungin, and caffeine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez-Gil et al., 2020</xref>), though the detailed mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>pmk1∆</italic> and <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> mutants display spindle checkpoint activation defects, while <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> and <italic>wis1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutants are defective in checkpoint silencing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of core modules of three <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.

Given the essential role of APC/C in triggering chromosome segregation, it is not surprising that APC/C is a key molecular target of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which is an intricate surveillance mechanism that prolongs mitosis until all chromosomes achieve correct bipolar attachments to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McAinsh and Kops, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Musacchio, 2015</xref>).

However, all these studies used either the anti-MAPK antibodies or a small molecule inhibitor UO126 to inhibit MAPK or MAPK-specific phosphatase MKP-1 to antagonize MAPK activity, these reagents could not distinguish the contributions of different MAPKs with high specificity. Thus, those seemingly defined mechanisms might suffer the ambiguity due to potential specificity issues.</p><p>In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, whether MAPKs play key roles in regulation of the APC/C and spindle checkpoint remains largely unexplored. Intriguingly, all genes encoding the major components of three MAPK signaling cascades in fission yeast are non-essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), and this provides the possibility for investigations on their potential functions in a genetic background with deletions of the relevant genes. In this work, we set out to examine directly the requirement of the fission yeast MAPKs in mitotic APC/C activation and anaphase entry. Our results uncovered a previously unappreciated mechanism in which Pmk1, the MAPK of CIP, phosphorylates the APC/C activator Slp1 (the Cdc20 homolog in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) upon SAC activation. Phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> results in its ubiquitylation and degradation and thus subsequently impedes APC/C activation and anaphase entry. This mechanism also operates in response to spindle defects under environmental stress. Therefore, our finding extends cell-cycle control stages linked to MAPKs from previously recognized G<sub>2</sub>/M transition and cytokinesis to anaphase entry and mitotic exit in fission yeast. It will be interesting to address whether this MAPK-mediated Cdc20 regulation exists as a general mechanism for balancing spindle checkpoint activity in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SAP and CIP signaling components are required for spindle checkpoint activity</title><p>As the first step to examine the possible requirement of the fission yeast MAPKs in mitotic progression, we tested the sensitivity of deletion mutants of three fission yeast MAPKs to microtubule-destabilizing drug thiabendazole (TBZ), which has been routinely used as an indicator of defective kinetochore or spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saitoh et al., 1997</xref>).

Because Cdc13 (cyclin B in <italic>S. pombe</italic>) localizes to the spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in early mitosis and is degraded by APC/C to promote metaphase–anaphase transition, accumulation of Cdc13-GFP on SPBs after cold treatment serves as the read-out of the SAC activation, and the disappearance rate of Cdc13-GFP spot under permissive temperature reflects the SAC inactivation efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Thus, we attempted to identify the potential key residues in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> that mediate the Pmk1–Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> interaction. By visual scanning of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> sequence, we noticed five basic-residue patches which are also present in several fungal species and loosely resemble the consensus sequence of the known MAPK-docking sites, and four of them are within the N-terminal portion of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that mutating either of the two most N-terminal basic-residue patches (19-KKR-21 and 47-KR-48) to glutamates (Glu, E) or alanines (Ala, A) in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> resulted in decreased amount of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> pulled down by Pmk1-GST in vitro using the bacterially expressed recombinant proteins, and mutating both patches or mutating only the two arginine residues (R21 and R48) in those patches was sufficient to completely disrupt their interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Very strikingly, insertion of a 15 amino acid sequence of Pmp1 containing the Pmk1-docking sequence (or PDSP for short) right in front of the first basic-residue patch in Slp1(DS-5A) mutant protein restored its interaction with Pmk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>).

Purifications were performed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors to enrich phosphopeptides. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of Thr480 residue at the most C-terminus of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was dependent on the presence of Pmk1, and this modification was present in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> but not in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of Thr480 is very likely triggered by CIP signaling. To prove this, we raised phospho-specific antibodies against pT480, they could recognize Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragment phosphorylated by Pmk1 in vitro, and mutation of Thr480 to alanine (T480A) abolished site-specific phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By using these antibodies, we also confirmed that endogenous Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was indeed phosphorylated at Thr480 in metaphase-arrested <italic>mts3-1</italic> cells, which was enhanced in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant and diminished in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we examined how in vivo Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation at Thr480 is affected by forced targeting of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> to Pmk1. By taking advantage of the high binding affinity of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-binding protein (GBP) to GFP and its variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>), we constructed strains ectopically expressing Slp1<sup>(1–60aa)</sup>-mEGFP-2xNLS-GST-Slp1<sup>(456–488aa)</sup> and Pmk1-GBP-mCherry, in which Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragments would be artificially tethered to Pmk1 inside the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Immunoblot detection of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation at T480 in vivo demonstrated that indeed the presence of Pmk1-GBP-mCherry could increase pThr480 levels of mEGFP fusion of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> fragments, and simultaneously overexpressing Pek1<sup>DD</sup> from <italic>P<sub>adh11</sub>-6xHA-pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> further enhanced the effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Thus, our results established Thr480 of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> as a major Pmk1 phosphorylation site in vivo upon SAC activation.</p><p>In addition to pT480, our mass spectrometry analysis also identified Ser28, Thr31, and Ser59 as Pmk1-independent and Ser76 as Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). All these four residues are located within the N-terminal unstructured region, fitting with the Cdk1 core motif (SP or TP), and they are conserved only in four <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> species and several other fungal species but not in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, they were also proposed as Cdk1 phosphorylation sites based on quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By using the phospho-specific antibodies against both pS28 and pT31, we could detect the phosphorylation of Ser28 and Thr31 in vitro by Cdc13 (cyclin B)-containing Cdk1 complexes purified from metaphase-arrested yeast cells, which was severely diminished when the kinase activity of ATP analog-sensitive Cdk1 [Cdc2-as1(F84G)] was inhibited by 1-NM-PP1 or when Slp1<sup>(S28A;T31A)</sup> was added as the substrate in in vitro kinase reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, we examined whether Ser28 and Thr31 were phosphorylated in vivo. Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> was co-immunoprecipitated with Apc15 from <italic>nda3</italic>-arrested yeast cells and detected with phospho-specific antibodies. We observed phosphorylation of Ser28/Thr31 in wild-type cells, but it disappeared in phosphatase-treated wild-type samples and in 1-NM-PP1-treated <italic>cdc2-as1</italic> cells, or when cells expressing Slp1<sup>(S28A;T31A)</sup> were collected as the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> is also phosphorylated by Cdk1 at least at Ser28 and Thr31 in mitotic cells of the fission yeast.</p><p>We wondered whether Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation by Pmk1 affects its stability and APC/C activation. Indeed, phospho-deficient Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant showed elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in both metaphase-arrested and asynchronously grown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>) and compromised SAC activation compared to wild-type cells, likely due to more efficient APC/C activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Furthermore, Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant also reversed the inhibitory effect of <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> on Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> stability and APC/C activation after release from SAC-mediated arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>).</p><p>Although Ser76 was identified as a Pmk1-dependent phosphorylation residue in our mass spectrometry analysis, it was considered as a Cdk1 targeting site in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swaffer et al., 2018</xref>). It is fairly possible that phosphorylation of Ser76 is promoted by both Cdk1 and Pmk1, which is conceivable as CDKs and MAPKs recognize the same core motif (SP/TP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>), and crosstalk between CDK and MAPK has recently been reported for pheromone signaling in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Repetto et al., 2018</xref>). We tested how the double phosphorylation sites (S76A;T480A) mutant affects Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels or APC/C activity, and observed that the protein levels of the Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> were further elevated compared to that of the Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> mutant while SAC activation efficiency was lowered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). Notably, Slp1<sup>T480A</sup> and Slp1<sup>S76A;T480A</sup> mutant proteins became easily detected in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), which is very different from wild-type Slp1 that normally accumulates exclusively in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamada et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We further tested whether replacement of other identified phospho-serine/threonine residues with alanines affects Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and APC/C activity. We constructed strains carrying combinations of mutations of S28A, T31A, and S59A with S76A, and also with confirmed Pmk1 phosphorylation-deficient T480A, and found that mutations of S28A, T31A, and S59A did not affect Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels, though they could also profoundly compromise SAC activation efficiency similarly as the S76A;T480A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). We noticed that the mutations of S28A, T31A, and S59A also abolished the elevated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels conferred by S76A;T480A mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of S28, T31, and S59 targeted by Cdk1 most likely influences APC/C activation through a distinct mechanism from Pmk1-mediated S76/T480 phosphorylation.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrated that activated Pmk1 phosphorylates Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in vivo, which leads to lowered Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels, delayed SAC inactivation and APC/C activation as we observed in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells.

We tested whether K479 ubiquitylation is involved in regulating Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein stability. In agreement with the mass spectrometry analysis, mutation of K479 to arginine indeed increased the protein levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), even in asynchronously growing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), which is reminiscent of the stabilized Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> in <italic>apc15Δ</italic> mutant cells at interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>).

Previous studies have identified two neighboring lysine residues close to the carboxy terminus of human Cdc20, Lys485 and Lys490, as the ubiquitylation sites in prometaphase cells, and mutating these two lysines to arginines completely prevented Cdc20 ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>).

We also noticed that Slp1<sup>K472R; K479R</sup> rendered more severely compromised viability than either of the single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating blocking Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation could bring about detrimental consequence to the cells.</p><p>Our observation that Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels were lowered in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) suggested that attenuation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels upon constitutive activation of CIP signaling is very likely through facilitating its autoubiquitylation.

As a critical APC/C inhibitor, MCC fulfills its function through the physical binding of BubR1/Mad3 and Mad2 to two molecules of Cdc20/Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> (i.e. Cdc20<sup>MCC</sup> and Cdc20<sup>APC/C</sup>), and this mechanism has been confirmed at least in both humans and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfieri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Izawa and Pines, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamaguchi et al., 2016</xref>).

Therefore, our study has established another critical APC/C-inhibitory mechanism in the spindle checkpoint, though it will be important for future studies to identify the phosphorylation target(s) posed by SAP signaling pathway.

We found that treatment of fission yeast cells with KCl or caspofungin, which provokes a strong osmotic stress or cell wall damage response and quick Pmk1 activation, correlated with attenuated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> protein levels and delayed APC/C activation. Thus, our finding implicates MAPK Pmk1 as an important regulator for anaphase entry in response to adverse extracellular conditions. Intriguingly, one previous study showed that treatment of human cells with the carcinogen cadmium activates MAPK p38 (fission yeast Sty1 homolog) and triggers accelerated ubiquitination and proteolysis of Cdc20, which is essential for prometaphase arrest under SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yen and Yang, 2010</xref>). Therefore, although different MAPKs might be employed to fulfil the task in yeast and higher eukaryotes, it is likely that the mechanisms regulating Cdc20 phosphorylation and protein levels by MAPKs are evolutionarily conserved in response to environmental stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phospho-regulation of Cdc20 by MAPK as a spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent APC/C-inhibitory mechanism</title><p>APC/C activity can be regulated at multiple levels. Cdk1-dependent APC/C phosphorylation is one of the major prerequisites for APC/C activation and anaphase onset, in which Apc3 and Apc1 are key targets for positive phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujimitsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has also been shown that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of APC/C co-activator Cdc20 lessens its interaction with APC/C, thus serves as a negative phospho-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to its phosphorylation by Cdk1, Cdc20 can also be phoshorylated by multiple other kinases, such as Bub1, PKA, MAPK, and Plk1, which have been suggested in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, humans or budding yeast to be inhibitory to APC/C activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2016</xref> and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu, 2007</xref>). Therefore, Cdc20 could serve as a general integrator of multiple intracellular signaling cascades that regulate progression through mitosis.</p><p>Although multiple kinases have been proposed to be directly involved in phosphorylation of Cdc20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu, 2007</xref>), to identify precisely the in vivo phosphorylation sites in Cdc20 has turned out to be challenging, largely due to its protein scarcity and instability. Based on known Cdk1 core consensus (SP/TP), 9 residues in human Cdc20 were originally suggested as putative Cdk1 sites, but among them only Ser41 has been proven to be phosphorylated in vivo by a mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>). However, subsequent mass spectrometry analyses identified Ser41 as one of the Bub1 phosphorylation sites both in vivo and in vitro and Thr106 as one of the Plk1 sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). It is very likely that there are not as many genuine Cdk1 sites in Cdc20 as originally assumed. One supporting evidence is that mutation of only one (Thr32) of the three putative Cdk sites to alanine in N terminus of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDC-20 is sufficient to phenocopy the 3A mutant for accelerated APC/C activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, Thr32 of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CDC-20 is conserved as Thr 59 and Thr68 in human and <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdc20, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Based on two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis, Thr68 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> Cdc20 has been regarded as an MAPK target site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). These studies in diverse organisms raised an issue that whether multiple kinases share the same phosphorylation sites in Cdc20? It would not be surprising if it turns out to be the case, at least for Cdk1 and MAPKs, because both of them recognize the same core motif (SP/TP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pinna and Ruzzene, 1996</xref>).</p><p>By purifying Apc15-aasociated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> proteins from checkpoint-arrested <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> and <italic>pmk1∆</italic> cells, we were able to identify Thr480 and Ser76 as the Pmk1 phosphorylation sites in vivo and three Pmk1-independent phosphorylation sites (S28, T31, and S59) based on mass spectrometry analyses. All these identified sites except Thr480 are located in the N terminal disordered portion of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>. This is similar to the phosphorylation residues identified by biochemical and functional analyses in other organisms, in which the major phosphorylation sites all fall within the N-terminus of Cdc20 homologs. In addition, we provided evidence that S28/T31 and T480 are phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Pmk1, respectively, both in vitro and in vivo. We noticed that there is a tendency for reported phosphorylation residues to be concentrated in the N terminus of Cdc20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu, 2007</xref>). However, due to the lack of clear sequence homology in their N- and C-terminal tails between Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and its homologs in higher eukaryotes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), it is difficult to certainly assign the identified sites from different organisms as homologous sites. But it is possible that multiple kinases modify shared sites in Cdc20, this collaborative effect may be especially helpful under adverse environmental stress. Interestingly, currently all the reported Cdc20 phosphorylation events lead to inhibitory effects on APC/C no matter what kinases are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D’Angiolella et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kramer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yudkovsky et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Coupling of phosphorylation and autoubiquitylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup></title><p>The current model of inhibitory signaling from Cdc20 posits that its phosphorylation either promotes the formation of MCC or inhibits APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> catalytically, both of which are required for proper spindle checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamano, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, our current study suggests Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation by fission yeast MAPK Pmk1 may represent another critical APC/C-inhibitory mechanism in the spindle checkpoint through reducing the protein levels of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> via ubiquitylation-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This mechanism is distinct from that reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and tadpole cells, in which phosphorylation of Cdc20 by MAPK is instead responsible for facilitated Cdc20 binding by MCC to prevent it from activating the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung and Chen, 2003</xref>). Actually, previous studies in fission and budding yeast have underlined the importance of relative abundance between checkpoint proteins and Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>/Cdc20, which sets an important determinant of checkpoint robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan and Chen, 2004</xref>). A benefit of allowing the association of MCC-bound Cdc20 with APC/C is to provide an opportunity for Cdc20 autoubiquitylation by APC/C, a process aided by APC/C subunit Apc15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">May et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sewart and Hauf, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uzunova et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the depletion of <italic>apc15<sup>+</sup></italic> restores Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> levels in <italic>pek1<sup>DD</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with the idea that Pmk1-mediated Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> phosphorylation very likely facilitates its autoubiquitylation. Indeed, our biochemical and functional analyses further establish K479 and K472 in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> as two key residues directly involved in its ubiquitylation, which likely follows its phosphorylation, particularly at adjacent Thr480. Despite K485 and K490 are similarly located at C terminus of human Cdc20 and can be ubiquitylated and responsible for Cdc20 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mansfeld et al., 2011</xref>), there have been no reports on phosphorylation-modified residues in this region. However, although the sequence homology within N- and C-terminal regions between Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and Cdc20 homologs in higher eukaryotes is extremely low, we do notice that there are several lysine-flanking serine or threonine residues within Cdc20 C-terminal tails of higher eukaryotes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), this raises a possibility that this region may be involved in phosphorylation-coupled ubiquitylation. Currently, we do not know how T480 phosphorylation accelerate ubiquitylation of K479 and K472 in Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup>. It is possible that phosphorylation of Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> might alter the mode of Cdc20 binding to APC/C which becomes conducive to catalyze Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> ubiquitylation.</p><p>In summary, our studies revealed a distinct and dual mechanism of MAPK-dependent anaphase onset delay imposed directly on APC/C co-activator Slp1<sup>Cdc20</sup> and an unidentified substrate, which may emerge as an important regulatory layer to fine tune APC/C and MCC activity upon SAC activation. Importantly, although this mechanism of APC/C regulation by two MAPKs has not been examined in other organisms, it is very likely widespread across eukaryotes including humans, given the involvement of MAPKs in general response to wide range of adverse environmental situations and similar regulations of APC/C and SAC in eukaryotes characterized so far. It is also plausible to assume that the MAPK-dependent APC/C inhibition pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. Indeed, Cdc20 upregulation has been demonstrated in several types of cancers, including breast and colon cancer, and it contributes to aggressive tumor progression and poor prognosis in gastric cancer and primary non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chi et al., 2019</xref>). One very recent study conducted in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines revealed that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) led to dephosphorylation of Cdc20 and concomitant loss of APC/C target proteins securin and cyclin B (CCNB1 and CCNB2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klomp et al., 2024</xref>). Because human ERKs are homologs of fission yeast Pmk1, the finding in this study supports a notion that very likely human MAPKs also negatively regulates APC/C through Cdc20 phosphorylation and the altered levels of Cdc20 in cancers are MAPK relevant. Nevertheless, inhibition of APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activity or induction of Cdc20 degradation have already been listed as alternative therapeutic strategies to control cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greil et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, although the detailed molecular mechanisms may vary, further studies on MAPK-mediated APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> inhibition mechanism in human would lead to better understanding of its oncogenic role in tumor progression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fission yeast strains, media, and genetic methods</title><p>Fission yeast cells were grown in either YE (yeast extract) rich medium or EMM (Edinburgh minimal medium) containing the necessary supplements.

(ii) what is the nature of their involvement and what are their molecular targets?</p><p>The authors have extensively used the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant to activate or inactivate SAC employing an arrest-release protocol. Localization of Cdc13 (cyclin B) to the SPBs is used as a readout for the SAC activation or inactivation. The roles of two major MAPK pathways i.e. stress activated pathway (SAP) and cell integrity pathway (CIP), have been explored in this context (with CIP more extensively than SAP). Sty1Δ or pmk1Δ mutants were used to inactivate the SAP or CIP pathways and wis1DD or pek1DD expression was utilized to constitutively activate these pathways, respectively. Lowering of Slp1Cdc20 abundance (by phosphorylation of Slp1-Thr 480) is revealed as the main function of MAPK to augment the robustness of spindle assembly checkpoint.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experiments are generally well-conducted, and the results support the interpretations in various sections. The experimental data clearly support some of the key conclusions:</p><p>(i) while inactivation of SAP and CIP compromises SAC-imposed arrest, their constitutive activation delays the release from the SAC-imposed arrest (ii) CIP signaling, but not SAP signaling, attenuates Slp1Cdc20 levels (iii) Pmk1 and Cdc20 physical interact and Pmk1-docking sequences in Slp1 (PDSS) is identifies and confirmed by mutational/substitution experiments (iv) Thr480 (and also S76) is identified as the residue phosphorylated by Pmk1. S28 and T31 are identified as Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. These are confirmed by mutational and other related analyses (v) Functional aspects of the phosphorylation sites have been elucidated to some extent: (a) Phosphorylation of Slp1-T480 by Pmk1 reduces its abundance thereby augmenting the SAC-induced arrest (b) S28, T31 (also S59) are phosphorylated by Cdk1 (v) K472 and K479 residues are involved in ubiquitylation of Slp1</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(i) Cdc13 localization to SPBs has been used as a readout for SAC activation/inactivation throughout the manuscript. However, the only image showing such localization (Figure 1C) is of poor quality where the Cdc13 localization to SPBs barely visible. This should be replaced by a better image.</p><p>(ii) The overlapping error-bars in Cdc13-localization data in some figures (for instance Figure 3E and 4H) makes the effect of various mutations on SAC activation/inactivation rather marginal. In some of these cases, Western-blotting data support the author's conclusions better.</p><p>(iii) This specific point is not really a weakness but rather a loose end:</p><p>One of the conclusions of this study is that MAPK (PMK1) contributes to the robustness of SAC-induced arrest by lowering the abundance of Slp1Cdc20. The authors have used pmk1Δ or constitutively activating the MAPK pathways (Pek1DD) and documenting their effect on SAC activation/inactivation dynamics. It is not clear if SAC activation also leads to activation of MAPK pathways for them to contribute to the SAC robustness. To tie this loose end, the author could have checked if MAPK pathway is also activated under the conditions when SAC is activated. Unless this is shown, one must assume that the authors are attributing the effect they observe to the basal activity of MAPKs.</p><p>(iv) This is also a loose end:</p><p>The authors show that activation of stress pathways (by addition of KCL instance) causes phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation (Figure 6) under SAC-activating conditions. Does activation of the stress pathway cause phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation under non-SAC-activation conditions or does it occur only under SAC-activating conditions?</p><p>(v) Although the authors have gone to some length to identify S28, T31 (also S59) as phosphorylation sites for Cdk1, their functional significance in the context of MAPK involvement is not yet clear. Perhaps it is outside the scope of this study to dig deeper into this aspect more than the authors have.</p><p>(vi) In its current state, the Discussion section is quite disjointed. The first section &quot;Involvement of MAPKs in cell cycle regulation&quot; should be in the Introduction section (very briefly, if at all). It certainly does not belong to the Discussion section. In any case, the Discussion section should be more organized with better flow of arguments/interpretations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97896.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Sun et al. presents a role for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> MAP kinase Pmk1 in the activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) via controlling the protein levels of APC/C activator Cdc20 (Slp1 in S. pombe).

In particular, the data from time point 0 min can provide important information on the SAC activation efficiency. Generally, we placed those data and graphs in corresponding supplemental figures, such as: Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, Figure 1-figure supplement 2D, Figure 3-figure supplement 3, Figure 4-figure supplement 6B, Figure 5-figure supplement 1, and Figure 6-figure supplement 2.</p><p>In addition, as you have noticed, almost all time course data were backed up by our Western blotting data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This specific point is not really a weakness but rather a loose end:</p><p>One of the conclusions of this study is that MAPK (Pmk1) contributes to the robustness of SAC-induced arrest by lowering the abundance of Slp1Cdc20.

However, the only image showing such localization (Figure 1C) is of poor quality where the Cdc13 localization to SPBs is barely visible. This should be replaced by a better image.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced those pictures with a new set of representative images, which show clear presence or absence of SPB-localized Cdc13-GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) I reiterate the loose ends in this manuscript I have mentioned above. If the authors have already conducted these experiments, they should include the results in the manuscript to tighten the story further. (I am not suggesting that the authors must perform these experiments...if they have not).</p><p>(a) One of conclusions of this study is that MAPK (Pmk1) contributes to the robustness of SAC-induced arrest by lowering the abundance of Slp1Cdc20.

Unless this is shown, one must assume that the authors are attributing the effect they observe to the basal activity of MAPKs.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, our data shown in Figure 6B demonstrated that SAC activation per se cannot trigger activation of MAPK pathway CIP, because we did not observe any elevated Pmk1 phosphorylation (i.e. Pmk1-P detected by anti-phospho p42/44 antibodies) in nda3-arrested cells (Please see “control” samples in Figure 6B).</p><p>To corroborate this observation, we further examined the Pmk1 phosphorylation/activation in Mad2-overexpressing cells, and could not detect elevated Pmk1 phosphorylation. This data again lends support to the notion that SAC activation per se cannot trigger activation of CIP signaling.</p><p>We have added our newly obtained result in Figure 6-figure supplement 1 in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) The authors show that activation of stress pathways (by addition of KCL instance) causes phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation (Figure 6) under the SAC-activating conditions. Does activation of the stress pathway cause phosphorylation-dependent Slp1Cdc20 downregulation under the non-SAC-activation conditions or does it occur only under the SAC-activating condition?</p></disp-quote><p>As you suggested, we have constructed cdc25-22 background strains with pmk1+ deleted or expressing Padh11-pek1DD to remove or constitutively activate CIP signaling, respectively. By immunoblotting, we followed the Slp1Cdc20 levels when cells went through mitosis after being released at 25 °C from G2/M-arrest at high temperature. We found that Slp1Cdc20 levels in pek1DD cells were only marginally reduced compared to wild-type cells, whereas we failed to observe any elevated Slp1Cdc20 levels in pmk1Δ cells. These results suggested that CIP signaling only plays a negligible role in influencing Slp1Cdc20 levels under the non-SAC-activation conditions.</p><p>We have presented our newly obtained result in Figure 2-figure supplement 1 in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) The Discussion section is quite disjointed.

We have reorganized our “Discussion” sections and moved the previous “Involvement of MAPKs in cell cycle regulation” to the section “Introduction” and rewrote the corresponding paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) A minor point in this context:</p><p>In the cold-sensitive β-tubulin mutant, growth at 18C causes loss of kinetochore-microtubule attachments as well as the intra-kinetochore tension. Both perturbations individually can lead to the activation of SAC. This study does not distinguish whether MAPK involvement in SAC dynamics is relevant to one perturbation or another or both. It would be pertinent to briefly mention this point in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>As you suggested, we have added two sentences to briefly mention this point in our “Discussion” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This study by Sun et al. presents a role for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> MAP kinase Pmk1 in the activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) via controlling the protein levels of APC/C activator Cdc20 (Slp1 in S. pombe).

We examined the expression of these <italic>byr1DD</italic> alleles by Western blotting, and tested the TBZ sensitivity of these alleles and also checked whether they affect the efficiency of SAC activation or inactivation. Our results showed that constitutive activation of Spk1 by overexpressing Byr1DD does not cause yeast cells to be TBZ-sensitive or affect the efficiency of SAC activation or inactivation.</p><p>We have added these new data in Figure 1-figure supplement 2 in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The number of analyzed cells (n) should be mentioned in the figure legends in Figure 1D, and all other figure panels should represent similar data in the consequent figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the information on sample size for all experiments involving time course analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should also use another arresting mechanism (e.g. nocodazole treatment) and corroborate the result in Figure 1C to rule out any effects due to the mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1C in our manuscript actually shows our experimental design and not the result. We guess here you asked for alternative strategy to arrest cells at metaphase and confirm our results shown in Figure 1D.</p><p>We need to mention that, as a commonly used inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, Nocodazole is very effective in mammalian and human cells and also in budding yeast cells, but not effective at all in wild-type fission yeast cells. It has been found that Nocodazole is only active in fission yeast α- or β-tubulin mutants (please see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Umesono+K&amp;cauthor_id=6887245">Umesono</ext-link>, K., <italic>et al</italic>., J Mol Biol. 168 (2): 271-284 (1983); PMID: 6887245; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80018-7">10.1016/s0022-2836(83)80018-7</ext-link>.) or multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter mutants (please see Kawashima, SA, <italic>et al.</italic>, Chemistry &amp; Biology 19, 893–901 (2012); PMID: 22840777; doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2012.06.008.). Therefore, this feature of Nocodazole has limited and restricted its routine use as a metaphase arrest or spindle checkpoint activation drug in fission yeast.</p><p>Instead, in order to achieve the spindle checkpoint activation and metaphase arrest, we took advantage of a metaphase-arresting mechanism involving Mad2 overexpression, which has been described and used previously (Please see He, X., <italic>et al</italic>., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 94 (15): 7965-70 (1997); PMID: 9223296; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.94.15.7965">10.1073/pnas.94.15.7965</ext-link>, and May, K.M., <italic>et al</italic>., Current Biology, 27(8):1221-1228 (2017); PMID: 28366744; DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.013">10.1016/j.cub.2017.03.013</ext-link>). With this strategy, we could analyze the metaphase-arresting and SAC-activation efficiency by counting cells with short spindles as judged by GFP-Atb2 signals. We compared the frequencies of cells with short spindles in wild-type, <italic>pmk1Δ</italic>, <italic>sty1-T97A</italic>, and <italic>spk1Δ</italic> backgrounds after Mad2 has been induced to overexpress for 18 hours, and found that SAC-activating efficiency was compromised in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> cells, but not in <italic>spk1Δ</italic> cells. This data indeed corroborated our result shown in Figure 1D and ruled out possible effects due to the <italic>nda3-KM311</italic> mutant.</p><p>We have added this new data in Figure 1-figure supplement 3 in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would also be helpful to assess SAC or APC/C activation with another cellular readout in addition to Cdc13-GFP accumulation on SPBs, at least for initial experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, Cdc13-GFP accumulation on SPBs has been routinely used as a reliable cellular readout for SAC or APC/C activation in the field. It was first developed and used by Kevin Hardwick lab in their paper (Vanoosthuyse V and Hardwick KG. Curr Biol. 2009, 19(14):1176-81. PMID: 19592249; doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.060.). This method was also used in a paper by Meadows JC, et al. (2011) (Dev Cell. 20(6):739-50. PMID: 21664573; doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2011.05.008.).</p><p>In our previous study, we also employed a different strategy to assess SAC inactivation or APC/C activation, in which degradation of nuclear Cut2-GFP was used as a cellular readout (Please see S4 Fig in Bai S, <italic>et al</italic>., PLoS Genet 18(9): e1010397 (2022); PMID: 36108046; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1010397.). Cut2 is the securin homologue in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and therefore also a target of APC/C at anaphase. Our data in the above paper confirmed that the degradation of both nuclear Cut2-GFP and SPB-localized Cdc13-GFP shows similar dynamics when cells are released from metaphase-arrest.</p><p>As we described in our response to your comment #3, we employed short spindles visualized by GFP-Atb2 signals as an alternative readout for metaphase-arrest and SAC-activation in cells overexpressing Mad2. We confirmed that SAC-activation efficiency was compromised in <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> and <italic>sty1-T97A</italic> cells, but not in <italic>spk1Δ</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors have shown a role for Pmk1 in controlling the activation of APC/C and, hence, cell cycle progression through metaphase to anaphase. One crucial experiment would be to check if pmk1Δ cells show an accumulation of chromosomal aberrations or unequal distribution when subjected to genotoxic stressors. That would implicate a direct importance on Pmk1's role in cell cycle arrest and genome maintenance.</p></disp-quote><p>As you suggested, we have constructed <italic>cdc25-22 GFP-atb2+</italic> strains with <italic>pmk1+</italic> present or deleted, and treated cells with 0.6 M KCl or 2 μg/mL caspofungin to activate MAPKs and checked whether the absence of <italic>pmk1</italic> could cause defective chromosome segregation in anaphase cells. Indeed, we found that stressed <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells displayed greatly increased frequency of lagging chromosomes and chromosome mis-segregation at mitotic anaphase compared to similarly treated wild-type cells and also untreated <italic>pmk1Δ</italic> cells. This new data implicated a direct role for Pmk1 in cell cycle arrest and genome maintenance, especially when cells are exposed to adverse environment.</p><p>We have presented this new data as Figure 7 in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typos:</p><p>(1) In line 406, &quot;docking&quot; is misspelled as &quot;docing&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.
