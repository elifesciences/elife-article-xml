response. Increasing the FcγRIIIa/IgG1 interaction improves the immune response and thus represents a strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy. FcγRIIIa is a heavily glycosylated receptor and glycan composition affects antibody-binding affinity. Though our laboratory previously demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cell N-glycan composition affected the potency of one key protective mechanism, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), it was unclear if this effect was due to FcγRIIIa glycosylation. Furthermore, the structural mechanism linking glycan composition to affinity and cellular activation remained undescribed. To define the role of individual amino acid and N-glycan residues, we measured affinity using multiple FcγRIIIa glycoforms. We observed stepwise affinity increases with each glycan truncation step, with the most severely truncated glycoform displaying the highest affinity. Removing the N162 glycan demonstrated its predominant role in regulating antibody-binding affinity, in contrast to four other FcγRIIIa N-glycans. We next evaluated the impact of the N162 glycan on NK cell ADCC. NK cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 allotype exhibited increased ADCC following kifunensine treatment to limit N-glycan processing. Notably, an increase was not observed with cells expressing the FcγRIIIa V158 S164A variant that lacks N162 glycosylation, indicating that the N162 glycan is required for increased NK cell ADCC. To gain structural insight into the mechanisms of N162 regulation, we applied a novel protein isotope labeling approach in combination with solution NMR spectroscopy. FG loop residues proximal to the N162 glycosylation site showed large chemical shift perturbations following glycan truncation. These data support a model for the regulation of FcγRIIIa affinity and NK cell ADCC whereby composition of the N162 glycan stabilizes the FG loop and thus the antibody-binding site.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>ADCC</kwd><kwd>antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>glycobiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AI148114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barb</surname><given-names>Adam W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that a single N-glycan on one receptor influences the strength of a cytotoxic response elicited by natural killer cells following stimulation with an antibody-coated target.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural killer (NK) cells rapidly respond to destroy tissue coated with antibodies. This protective mechanism, termed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), is likewise exploited by many therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing specific epitopes that escape detection by endogenous antibodies. However, NK cell ADCC elicited both by endogenous antibodies and mAbs fails to ameliorate disease in many patients. There is sufficient evidence to expect that increased NK cell ADCC will improve patient responses though few strategies exist to achieve this outcome.</p><p>NK cells require binding of antibodies to only a single receptor type, Fc gamma receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa/CD16a), to elicit ADCC. Multiple lines of evidence support the role of increased antibody-binding affinity in improved NK cell responses. NK cells expressing the higher affinity FcγRIIIa V158 allotype demonstrate greater ADCC than those expressing the weaker-binding F158 allotype (hereafter referred to as V158F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruhns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartron et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng and Levy, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, improving the FcγRIIIa-binding affinity of antibodies, which bind through the Fc region, likewise increases ADCC and therapeutic potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Presta et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mössner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Townsend et al., 2023</xref>). Antibody engineering efforts have been widely explored to improve ADCC by increasing FcγRIIIa engagement; however, substantially less is known about the structural mechanisms that affect FcγRIIIa function.</p><p>Our laboratory identified an unexpected strategy to increase FcγRIIIa affinity. We determined that FcγRIIIa glycosylation affected antibody-binding affinity, with oligomannose-type N-glycans providing higher affinity interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Subedi and Barb, 2018</xref>). Oligomannose N-glycans are minimally remodeled forms that are not expected at high percentages on secreted proteins in contrast to highly remodeled complex-type glycans found on most serum glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>). Among the five FcγRIIIa N-glycosylation sites, the composition of the glycan at N162 is responsible for increased antibody-binding affinity and is located near the interface formed with the antibody Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Subedi and Barb, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sondermann et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, we identified a high degree of glycan compositional heterogeneity at the N162 site on FcγRIIIa purified from NK cells of healthy human donors including both complex-type and oligomannose glycoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). YTS cells, a key cytotoxic human NK cell line used for these studies, express FcγRIIIa with extensive glycan processing, including the N162 site with predominantly hybrid and complex-type glycoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Patel et al., 2021</xref>). The N162 glycan heterogeneity on NK cells is reflected in the presence of both high-affinity and low-affinity FcγRIIIa forms in the periphery of healthy donors, with high-affinity forms more abundant in adult donors compared to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benavente et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>We likewise demonstrated that NK cell N-glycan processing reduced ADCC potency. NK cells with limited N-glycan remodeling capability, following either treatment with kifunensine or knockdown of the bottleneck glycan processing enzyme MGAT1, demonstrated increased ADCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benavente et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rodriguez Benavente et al., 2023</xref>). These studies, however, did not determine that FcγRIIIa N-glycan processing, nor the composition of the N162 glycan, mediated the increased ADCC. It is equally possible that this role is mediated by other NK cell glycans, of which hundreds are expected. Demonstration of the role of the N162 glycan in ADCC is expected to promote improved ADCC responses through efforts to tune glycan composition of endogenous NK cells or infused NK cells. Furthermore, such a demonstration is expected to promote FcγRIIIa engineering to increase ADCC beyond levels available from endogenous NK cells and naturally occurring FcγRIIIa variants.</p><p>Here we investigate the N162 glycan’s role in FcγRIIIa structure, antibody-binding affinity and NK cell ADCC. We performed a mutational screen to identify FcγRIIIa residues that mediate antibody-binding affinity and sensitivity to the N-glycan composition. Introducing a subset of these FcγRIIIa variants, displaying a range of affinities, into cytotoxic NK cells provided insight into the relationship between antibody-binding affinity and ADCC. We then defined the impact of N162 glycan composition on NK cell ADCC and FcγRIIIa structure. As a result, we define a link between the N162 glycan composition and NK cell ADCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FcγRIIIa affinity impacts ADCC</title><p>We generated a library of FcγRIIIa proteins with mutations at the antibody-binding interface to identify key residues. The resulting FcγRIIIa proteins revealed a wide range of affinities between those slightly higher than wildtype (S164A) to a handful with no apparent binding at 2.5 µM to fucosylated IgG1 Fc (Y132S, W90A, W113A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Mapping the impact of these mutations onto a FcγRIIIa structural model identified two key regions consistent with empirically derived structural models of the antibody:receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sondermann et al., 2000</xref>), though our data provide greater detail showing how each residue affects affinity. These two regions center around Y132 and a pair of tryptophan residues (W90 and W113), which overlaps with the contact interface identified by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, although the K161A mutation reduces affinity by tenfold, mutating adjacent residues including S160 showed little direct impact on affinity. It was likewise surprising that the solvent-exposed, large hydrophobic side chains of F153 and I88 minimally impacted affinity (less than twofold). A majority of the mutations only impacted affinity by threefold or less.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FcγRIIIa antibody-binding affinities correlate with antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) potency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Affinities of FcγRIIIa amino acid variants determined by SPR are binned into impact: twofold lower (light blue), between two- and fourfold (blue), or greater than fourfold lower than V158 (dark blue).

A positive correlation between affinity and ADCC would indicate improved NK cell-mediated therapies may result from increasing the FcγRIIIa antibody-binding affinity beyond that of the wildtype. This FcγRIIIa library evaluated above, plus a range of other mutations proximal to this interface, provides a wide range of FcγRIIIa affinities (the complete binding affinities of all FcγRIIIa variants are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We next evaluated the impact of FcγRIIIa mutations on ADCC potency. We transduced cytotoxic YTS NK cells to express a subset of FcγRIIIa variants from our affinity screen, encompassing a broad affinity range, using lentivirus to establish stable cytotoxic NK cell lines. Each YTS cell line displayed comparable FcγRIIIa expression, however, at levels somewhat reduced from the original YTS-FcγRIIIa cell line provided by Dr. Mace (Columbia U., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A comparison of the original YTS-FcγRIIIa (V158) cells and our transduced YTS cell line expressing the same wildtype receptor showed greater expression and greater ADCC from the original YTS-FcγRIIIa cell line likely resulting from our cell isolation strategy that selected only for GFP+ cells rather than FcγRIIIa expression. Within our library, YTS cells expressing the FcγRIIIa S164A variant displayed the highest average ADCC and the tryptophan mutants showed no detectable ADCC, indicating higher affinity leads to higher ADCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A plot of the affinity for each variant versus the ADCC potency demonstrated a trend linking high affinity and greater ADCC. These results indicate that greater FcγRIIIa antibody-binding affinity on NK cells increases ADCC and FcγRIIIa engineering represents an unexplored avenue to improve NK cell-mediated immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The FcγRIIIa N162-glycan is required for high-affinity interactions with afucosylated IgG</title><p>Because affinity is a key determinant of ADCC potency, we further explored FcγRIIIa changes that affect affinity and to identify variants with altered sensitivity to IgG1 Fc glycan composition. Shields et al. previously showed that antibody fucosylation reduces affinity for FcγRIIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shields et al., 2002</xref>), and it is known that the N162 glycan mediates the response to fucose, though the underlying mechanism remains disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferrara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakae et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Falconer et al., 2018</xref>). We identified FcγRIIIa residues within the contact distance of the N162 glycan to explore the impact of proximal residues to antibody fucosylation. We next evaluated mutations at each contact site using both the wildtype and S164A variant that prevents N162 glycosylation. These variants largely exhibited decreased affinity compared with the wildtype FcγRIIIa when evaluated against fucosylated IgG1 Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, each variant displayed reduced sensitivity to fucose when the N162 glycan was absent. The impact of fucose reduced from a 2.2-fold average effect when the N162 glycan was present to a 1.3-fold change when the N162 glycan was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Most variants bound afucosylated IgG1 Fc with weaker affinity. The F153S and R155S variants lacking the N162 glycan are notable outliers in that both bind antibody glycoforms with higher affinity than the wildtype. These data also are consistent with the hypothesis that intermolecular glycan-glycan contacts provide minimal stability to the antibody/receptor complex because higher affinity was achieved by removing the N162 glycan.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The FcγRIIIa N162 glycan regulates affinity toward fucosylated and afucosylated IgG1 Fc.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FcγRIIIa variants demonstrate higher affinity toward without IgG1 Fc core-fucosylation (open circles) than with this modification (red circles).

It is tempting to conclude from the preceding study that higher affinity interactions can be achieved by removing the N162 glycan entirely; however, our previous work showed that truncating the glycan to a single (1)GlcNAc residue provides superior affinity though it was unclear if these changes mapped to the N162 site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kremer and Barb, 2022</xref>).

To identify which N-glycan residues affected affinity, we treated recombinant FcγRIIIa with a series of glycosidases to sequentially remove terminal sugars from the nonreducing end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed a step-wise increase in affinity following the removal of each type of terminal sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Removing the core α-linked mannose or sialic acid residues showed the greatest change for a single removal step, increasing affinity by fivefold or twofold respectively. Overall, glycan truncation was observed to decrease <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> by 12-fold. To evaluate the individual impact of the N162 glycan, we next truncated glycans of the S164A variant that lacks N162 glycosylation but retains four other N-glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). While the S164A affinities followed the same trend as the wildtype, the changes were substantially smaller in magnitude with only a fourfold overall change. The removal of the core α-linked mannose residues increased affinity by less than 1.5-fold, in contrast to the fivefold increase observed for the wildtype. These results demonstrate the primary contribution of the N162 glycan composition to antibody-binding affinity, with smaller contributions from N-glycans at the remaining four sites. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the negative impact of adding additional residues throughout the processing pathway, further indicating that N-glycan processing inhibits antibody-binding affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The FcγRIIIa N162 glycan is required for increased ADCC potency following kifunensine treatment</title><p>The data above demonstrate the impact of FcγRIIIa N162 glycan composition on antibody-binding affinity.

However, these studies did not determine that composition of the FcγRIIIa N162 glycan affected ADCC potency.

Notably, the wildtype, V158F and T167Y variants all contain the N162 glycan but only S164A does not; thus, the N162 glycan is required for increased ADCC potency following kifunensine treatment.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The FcγRIIIa N162 glycan regulates natural killer (NK) cell antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).</title><p>The ADCC of NK cells increases significantly following 20 µM kifunensine for YTS cells expressing FcγRIIIa that retains the N162 glycan (wildtype, V158F, T167Y).

We probed the effect of N-glycan composition using solution NMR spectroscopy, a technique that evaluates FcγRIIIa structure in dilute solutions and can identify the impact of highly mobile elements including disordered loops, N and C termini, and glycans. First, individual peaks in the NMR spectra must be assigned to unique atoms in the protein to evaluate structural changes with atomic resolution. N-glycoproteins, including FcγRIIIa, represent a significant challenge for NMR spectroscopy due to exceptional line broadening and thus signal loss resulting from the presence of extended N-glycans that slow molecular tumbling. As a result of these physical limitations, N-glycoproteins are seldom investigated by NMR despite their prevalence in the human proteome (22% of the human proteome enters the secretory pathway and contains an N-glycosylation site). Broad spectral lines dramatically limit the quality of multidimensional spectra required for the standard resonance assignment strategies, preventing the collection of CB frequencies that provide a high degree of amino acid discrimination.</p><p>To surmount these limitations, we first increased tumbling and thus spectral quality by mutating three of the five N-glycosylation sites, retaining N-glycans at N45 and N162 that stabilize antibody binding and solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Subedi and Barb, 2018</xref>). The spectrum of the FcγRIIIa N38Q/N74Q/N169Q variant with two N-glycans improved and peak positions proved highly comparable to those from FcγRIIIa with five N-glycans. Next, we simplified the assignment problem by defining the amino acid type for many peaks in the spectrum through specific amino acid labeling. Our strategy supplements the HEK293F growth medium with individual [<sup>15</sup>N]-labeled amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Subedi et al., 2024</xref>) and provided residue information for 13 types (C,F,G,H,I,K,N,R,S,T,V,W,Y; an example spectrum is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These residue-type assignments guided the definition of residue connections, and thus the backbone assignment, in three-dimensional HNCA and HN(CO)CA spectra. Carbonyl carbon resonances were then assigned using an HNCO experiment. As a result, we assigned a high percentage of the backbone resonances (87% N, 90% HN, 86% CO, 86% CA) and almost all the peaks in the 2D HSQC-TROSY spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This resonance assignment is suitable for interpreting structural changes associated with changing the N-glycan composition and represents a significant triumph due to the challenges associated with glycoprotein NMR. To our knowledge, this is the only NMR resonance assignment of a glycoprotein with two N-glycans attached. A small handful of assignments exist for proteins with one N-glycan, notably CD2 and the Fc region of IgG1 (a thermostable dimer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wyss et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yagi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Backbone resonance assignment of FcγRIIIa with N-glycans at N45 and N162.</title><p>Amino acid position within the sequence of 175 residues and the residue type are shown.

Features associated with the (1)GlcNAc spectra represent conformations that promote higher affinity interactions as this glycoform binds antibody with the greatest affinity of those evaluated.

In this recent structure of glycosylated FcγRIIIa, the FG loop is free from contacts with the Fc ligand or with the crystal lattice, revealing a conformation that is sterically prohibited in the complex with antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To bind, the N162 glycan and the FG loop must reorient to avoid steric clashes with IgG1 Fc. The backbone conformation of the supporting beta strands shows minimal displacement, though larger backbone deviations are observed for the L157, K161 and S164 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of these distinct conformations is supported by the NMR spectra showing two peaks, including V158 and K161 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We investigated conformational sampling further with 1 µs all-atom MD simulations and found the presence of both conformations identified by X-ray crystallography in trajectories of FcγRIIIa with complex-type or Man5 N-glycans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These simulations were initialized with a starting structure representing the bound state conformation but sampled both conformations throughout the experiment. One notable detail from these simulations was the formation of non-covalent interactions between the aliphatic portion of the R155 sidechain with the hydrophobic surface of the (1)GlcNAc residue in the ligand-bound conformation that were absent in the unliganded conformation. To evaluate the importance of this interaction, we measured the binding affinity of the truncated FcγRIIIa (1)GlcNAc glycoform lacking the R155 sidechain.

This result is likewise consistent with prior binding affinity measurements defining a role for N162 glycan composition as a factor in antibody-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Subedi and Barb, 2018</xref>). The binding affinity differences due to glycan composition are supported through studies of both human FcγRIIIa and macaque FcγRIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hayes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Coillie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tolbert et al., 2022</xref>). The simple observation that the N162 glycan alone accounts for the sensitivity of differences in NK cell ADCC due to N-glycan processing is belied by the potentially enormous number of alternative hypotheses that ADCC is influenced by any other N-glycan on the NK cell surface. However, a distinction can be made between these explanations because of the simple difference of a single S164A mutation that eliminated the N162 glycosylation site. The specificity of this result defines a role for N162 glycan composition in NK cell ADCC.</p><p>We propose that the N162 glycan regulates NK cell ADCC, representing a previously undescribed regulatory element. The appearance of endogenous heterogeneity of the N162-glycan supports the assertion. The N162 glycan composition isolated from peripheral NK cells is notably heterogeneous, in contrast to the four remaining FcγRIIIa N-glycans that show remarkable similarity between different donors and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the FcγRIIIa N162 glycan composition is variable on endogenous NK cells, likely providing a range of ADCC potency. It remains unclear how cells produce variability restricted to the N162 N-glycan, with a high degree of similarity at the remaining four sites on the same protein despite the physical linkage that exposes these glycans to comparable conditions during secretion. Identifying this mechanism that affects N162 glycan processing has the potential to impact cellular immunotherapies if endogenous processing can be tuned in vivo. Furthermore, the advent of infused NK cell-based therapies provides a mechanism to deploy FcγRIIIa engineered with greater affinity or altered sensitivity to glycan composition of the expressing cell of the antibody ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Page et al., 2024</xref>). Removing the N162 glycan with the S164A mutation removes variability related to NK cell glycan processing, a potential confounding but unexplored factor in NK cell culture. Removing this glycan likewise reduces the impact of afucosylated antibodies on ADCC, which may be preferable if pathogenic afucosylated antibodies are present or enhanced ADCC is not desirable. Afucosylated antibodies have been reported at high titers during various autoimmune or viral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larsen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship between FcγRIIIa affinity and ADCC</title><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate ADCC responses improve with antibodies engineered to engage FcγRIIIa with improved affinity; however, much less information is available on how improved FcγRIIIa antibody-binding affinity affects ADCC. This information is important to predict how future affinity improvements will impact ADCC. It is not obvious that increased antibody-binding affinity would promote greater ADCC considering the highly multivalent nature of the NK cell interaction with an opsonized target cell. Here we quantified ADCC using NK cells expressing a range of FcγRIIIa affinities outside the range defined by the natural V158 and V158F allotypes. Affinities lower than 300 nM showed little, if any, ADCC. Though donor NK cells displaying the V158F allotype exhibit measurable ADCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hatjiharissi et al., 2007</xref>), our reduced ADCC is likely due to the lowered FcγRIIIa expression, as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Affinities greater than 300 nM showed substantial cytotoxicity with a sharp increase at greater affinities indicating that greater FcγRIIIa antibody-binding affinity is expected to further increase ADCC. Notably, the ADCC potency for those high-affinity variants does not fall cleanly on a line, indicating that other factors affect our observations, which may include organization at the cell surface, changes to glycan composition, or receptor trafficking. Thus, these data define a positive relationship between FcγRIIIa affinity and ADCC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A structural mechanism linking N162 composition to increased affinity</title><p>Analysis of unliganded and Fc-bound FcγRIIIa reveals structural differences proximal to N162 that are supported by the appearance of multiple conformations in NMR spectra and MD simulations. Both the FG loop and its attached N162 glycan move from a position in the unliganded state that allows maximum flexibility to a restricted state to accommodate Fc binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the sequential truncation of glycan residues provides increasingly greater affinity that is due largely to the N162 glycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We believe this result is best explained by a conformational entropy penalty introduced upon complex formation by shifting the N162 glycan to a restricted space between surfaces formed by the Fc and FcγRIIIa polypeptide. An alternative hypothesis, analogous to IgG1 Fc with intramolecular interactions stabilizing the N-glycan to increase affinity, appears to be less suitable for the FcγRIIIa data presented here largely because FcγRIIIa affinity increases following glycan truncation unlike IgG1 Fc N-glycan truncation that decrease affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Subedi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Subedi and Barb, 2015</xref>).

This value likely overestimates the penalty, being based on sampling only one N-glycan conformation in the Fc-bound state and notably excludes solvent entropy. Prior ITC analyses of these interactions revealed enthalpy/entropy compensation that precluded a clear definition of the contribution from conformational entropy from those data alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Falconer et al., 2018</xref>). The entropic penalty is likely also alleviated by stabilizing interactions between the (1)GlcNAc residue and the R155 sidechain, explaining why the truncated glycoform displays a greater affinity than the S164A variant that lacks the N162 glycan.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>FcγRIIIa hotspots at the antibody-binding interface</title><p>Though high-resolution structural models for the antibody-binding interface are available, the impact of individual residues on binding affinities is not always trivial to predict and thus it is often unclear which residue to target in protein engineering efforts to tune affinity.

Although I88 was not detected in our amino acid selective NMR experiments, nearby V86 and L91 show large perturbations indicating conformational sampling of the interdomain interface, potentially reflecting domain flexibility. In the other hotspot, Y132 is one of many FcγRIIIa residues along the D and E beta strands that interacts with Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sondermann et al., 2000</xref>). We further probed this region testing Y132, H119, H134, K120, K131, and T122. The Y132S mutation eliminated binding, likely due to removing numerous stabilizing interactions. The IgG1 Fc D265 residue is critical and thought to stabilize the N297 glycan, in which mutation abolishes FcγRIIIa binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudino et al., 2008</xref>). FcγRIIIa K120 is within distance to interact with D265, possibly playing an important role in Fc binding. We found the K120A mutation reduced binding by fivefold. Other mutations in this region revealed a comparatively minor impact compared to Y132, suggesting Y132 is the critical residue for binding one Fc domain. In addition, the FG loop plays a critical role in Fc binding. While mutation of residues L157 and S160 did not change affinity, K161A lowered affinity by tenfold. The impact of the K161 mutation is interesting because K161 is not predicted to make direct contact with Fc, although it may contribute to loop stabilization or may transiently contact the IgG1 Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sondermann et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results indicate FcγRIIIa engineering through substitutions aimed at stabilizing the Fc-bound conformation in the absence of ligand is expected to promote affinity and ADCC. Affinity gains are possible beyond that provided by the tighter-binding V158 allotype, and we demonstrate that relatively small affinity improvements have a substantial impact on ADCC. Finally, we revealed new structural insights into FcγRIIIa that may lead to NK cells engineered to bind antibody through FcγRIIIa with high affinity as a novel strategy to improve immunotherapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>All materials were purchased from MilliporeSigma unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>SPR</title><p>Affinity measurements were performed using the amine coupling strategy with a Biacore T200 (GE Life Sciences) as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kremer and Barb, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Protein expression</title><p>Plasmid construction, protein expression, and purification were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kremer and Barb, 2022</xref>).

We restructured the Results section to highlight that a primary outcome of the experiment referenced was to map the contribution of interface residues to antibody binding affinity. These data were not previously available, highlighting hotspots at the interface. Figure 1A and B report these results.</p><p>We then used a subset of mutations from this experiment, as well as a subset of mutations from an additional library containing mutations proximal to the interface, to build a small library for evaluation using ADCC. The complete binding data for all variants, binding to two different IgG1 Fc glycoforms, is presented in Supplemental Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>T167Y in particular needs to be shown, as it is one of few mutants that fall between what seems to be ADCC+ and ADCC- lines. Also, that mutant seems to have a stronger affinity compared to wt (judged by panel D), yet less ADCC than wt. This would imply that the relationship between affinity and activity is not as clean as stated, though it is clearly important. Comments about this would strengthen the overall manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this particular insight. We agree that the lack of a clean correlation between ADCC potency and affinity implies additional factors that could have affected these experimental results. We added the following sentence to the discussion.</p><p>“Notably, the ADCC potency for those high-affinity variants does not fall cleanly on a line, indicating that other factors affect our observations, which may include organization at the cell surface, changes to glycan composition, or receptor trafficking.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This statement feels out of place: &quot;In summary, this result demonstrates that the sensitivity to antibody fucosylation may be eliminated through FcγRIIIa engineering while preserving antibody-binding affinity.&quot; In Figure 2, the authors do indeed show that mutations in FcgRIIIa can alter the impact of IgG core fucosylation, but implying that receptor engineering is somehow translatable or as impactful therapeutically as engineering the antibody itself deflates the real basic science/biochemical impact of understanding these interactions in molecular detail. Not everything has to be immediately translatable to be important.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and removed the highlighted sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The findings reported in Figure 2, panel C are exciting. Controls for the quality of digestion at each step should be shown (perhaps in supplementary data).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We added an example of the digestions as Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3 is confusing (mislabeled?) and does not show what is described in the Results. First, there is a F158V variant in the graph but a V158F variant in the text.</p><p>Please correct this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this typo. We corrected Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, this variant (V158F/F158V) does not show the 2-fold increase in ADCC with kifunesine as stated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing our attention to this rounding error. We revised the text to report a statistically significant 1.4-fold increase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, there are no statistical evaluations between the groups (+/- kif; +/- fucose).</p></disp-quote><p>We provide the p values for +/-fuc and +/- Kifunensine for each YTS cell line in the figure. We did not provide a global comparison of p values that included all cell lines due to some cell lines experiencing a significant change and others not. However, we added the raw data as Supplemental Table 2 should readers wish to perform these analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences stated are not clearly statistically significant given the wide spread of the data. This is true even for the wt variant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are points that overlap in this figure between the different treatments. However, our use of the students T-test (two tailed) using three experiments collected on three different days (each with three technical replicates) provides enough resolution to determine the significance of difference of the means for the different treatments. This is, by our estimation, a highly rigorous manner to collect and analyze the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The kifunensine impact is somewhat confusing. They report a major change in ADCC, yet similar large changes with trimming only occur once most of the glycan is nearly gone (Figure 2). Kifunensine will tend to generate high mannose and possibly a few hybrid glycans. It is difficult to understand what glycoforms are truly important outside of stating that multi-branched complex-type N-glycans decrease affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that Figure 2 does not evaluate the kifunensine-treated glycan, which is mostly Man8 and Man9 structures. In our previous work, these structures likewise provide increased binding affinity (see pubmed ID 30016589). We believe the most important message is that composition of the N162 glycan (removed with the S164A mutation) regulates NK cell ADCC. On cells, we are not able to modulate N162 glycan composition without affecting potentially every other N-glycan on the surface, so we do not have an ADCC experiments that is directly comparable to Figure 2. Thus, this increased ADCC resulting from kifunensine treatment is consistent with previously observed increases in binding affinity measurement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) This is outside of the immediate scope, but I feel that the impact would be increased if differences in NK cell (and thus FcgRIIIA) glycosylation are known to occur during disease, inflammation, age, or some other factor - and then to demonstrate those specific changes impact ADCC activity via this mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely. As mentioned in the Introduction, we know that N162 glycan composition varies substantially from donor to donor based on previous work from our lab. Curiously, little variability appeared between donors at the other four Nglycosylation sites. Thus, there is the potential that different NK cell N162 glycan compositions are coincident with different indications. This is an area we are quite interested in pursuing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
