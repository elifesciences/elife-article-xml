However, we poorly understand how such contiguous three-dimensional superstructures are formed in plants. Here, we show that correct establishment of the plant Casparian Strip (CS) network relies on local neighbor communication. We show that positioning of Casparian Strip membrane domains (CSDs) is tightly coordinated between neighbors in wild-type and that restriction of domain formation involves the putative extracellular protease LOTR1. Impaired domain restriction in <italic>lotr1</italic> leads to fully functional CSDs at ectopic positions, forming ‘half strips’. LOTR1 action in the endodermis requires its expression in the stele. LOTR1 endodermal expression cannot complement, while cortex expression causes a dominant-negative phenotype. Our findings establish <italic>LOTR1</italic> as a crucial player in CSD positioning acting in a directional, non-cell-autonomous manner to restrict and coordinate CS positioning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>endodermis</kwd><kwd>casparian strip</kwd><kwd>microdomains</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>neprosin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_156261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geldner</surname><given-names>Niko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_176399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geldner</surname><given-names>Niko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012623</institution-id><institution>Federation of European Biochemical Societies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marhavý</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Localized lignin impregnations, forming a pan-endodermal net-like diffusion barrier strongly relies on stabilizing signals from neighbors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants mine the surrounding soil for water and dissolved minerals to sustain their growth and to complete their life cycle. Likened to inverted guts, roots evolved crucial epithelial functions — selective uptake and diffusion barriers — in order to generate and sustain body homeostasis in variable and harsh environments. In gut epithelial cells, the required separation of outside lumen and inside tissues is achieved through the formation of tight junctions. These specialized membrane domains form ring-like domains between the apical (gut lumen) and basal (blood stream) sides. Close adhesion of both adjacent plasma membranes is achieved by tight interaction of occludins, claudins, and cadherins, organized into tight and adherens junctions, forming impermeable and mechanically-resistant barriers. In plants, a functionally similar diffusion block is achieved by Casparian strips (CS), highly localized impregnations of the cell wall, the plant’s extracellular matrix, in root endodermal cells.</p><p>Similar to tight/adherence junctions, a specialized membrane domain (Casparian Strip membrane Domain, CSD) forms a precise ring in transversal and anticlinal membranes of elongated endodermal cells. This domain acts as a molecular fence that separates the endodermal plasma membranes into peripheral (outer) and central (inner) domains, as highlighted by the polar distribution of nutrient transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alassimone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Winter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2007</xref>). CASPARIAN STRIP DOMAIN PROTEINs (CASPs) are specifically targeted to this domain and form a stable matrix for the subsequent lignification machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roppolo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalmbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa et al., 2019</xref>). Lignification of the primary cell wall of CSs extends through the entire apoplast including cross-linkage to the middle lamella. This is illustrated in cell wall digestions leaving only the resistant lignified tissues of CSs and xylem visible as a fishnet-like matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Enstone et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The CS and tight/adherens junctions must form a contiguous network in order to fulfill their role as functional diffusion barriers. However, we still poorly understand how such a supracellular structure is coordinated within the endodermal cell layer. Although we are ignorant of the mechanism, the precisely opposing localization of CSDs evidences that endodermal cells coordinate the positioning of their membrane domains across the cell wall space. In epithelial cells, adherens junctions are first initiated by cell-to-cell contact mediated by nectins and cadherins and kept in place by firm attachment to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rajasekaran et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itoh and Bissell, 2003</xref>). In plant cells, their cell wall matrices separate neighboring cell by at least 100–200 nm, which prevents such a direct interaction of membrane-bound proteins. Thus, a more complex positioning mechanism that requires local signals from directly adjacent neighbors could ensure coordination of CSDs between neighbors.</p><p>Many components necessary for correct CS formation have been identified in recent years, but few show impacts on CS positioning per se. Mutation of components in the recently discovered barrier surveillance mechanism causes interrupted, but correctly localized CSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pfister et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doblas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alassimone et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of the endodermal differentiation transcription factor MYB36 abolishes the formation of the entire CSD while disruption of CS cell wall localised ESB1 causes unstable, but still correctly localised domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamiya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liberman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>). The recently published <italic>lotr2</italic> mutant revealed the importance of a member of the exocyst complex, <italic>EXO70A1</italic>, in mediating targeted secretion of CASP proteins to the pre-established CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalmbach et al., 2017</xref>). However, the fragmented domains visible in this mutant are non-functional and unstable. Thus, based on current data, it is unclear whether formation of functional CSDs at ectopic positions is even possible.</p><p>Here, we report that the recently discovered <italic>lotr1</italic> mutant forms fully functional CSDs outside the endodermal-endodermal cell interface in. We establish that neighboring endodermal cells are absolutely required to form stable and continuous CSDs, and we highlight close coordination of CSD microdomains during the early stages of domain formation. In addition, we demonstrate that <italic>LOTR1</italic> is crucial for restriction of the CSD and that it acts independently of any known pathway for CSD formation. We show that this new type of putative cell wall protease is expressed in the stele, represents a novel, non-cell-autonomous and directional signaling component that controls CSD stability in the endodermis. Thus, we demonstrate that signaling, both within and between cell layers is crucial for coordinating CS positioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopic CASP deposits in Lotr1 are fully functional CSDs</title><p>During their initial characterization of the <italic>lotr1</italic> mutant, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2017</xref> reported a novel ‘patchy’ phenotype, where large patches of the Casparian strip membrane domain marker CASP1::CASP1-GFP occurred outside of the regular median CS position. Further analysis revealed an apoplastic delay phenotype attributed to large gaps that could be observed in the CS upon lignin stain. We performed a more detailed analysis of the domain marker CASP1::CASP1-GFP in this mutant background to search for disruptions in the CSD that could explain these gaps in lignification. Confirming the earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2017</xref>), we found large patches of CASP1-GFP occurring in endodermal membranes that were never observed in wildtype plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Whereas previously reported to occur only facing pericycle cells, we found similar patches to also occur towards the outer cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), although quantification revealed a clear preference for the endodermal-pericycle interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition to these patches, we found disruptions of the central CSD which occurred primarily at cell corners with nearby ectopic CASP deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), coherent with the reported gaps in CS lignin. The overall correctly positioned and largely continuous central CSD in <italic>lotr1</italic> suggests that the core-localization mechanism for the CSD is still functional. We speculate that the change in cell shape and cell walls at junctions might favor patch formation in <italic>lotr1</italic>. If patch formation starts simultaneously with initial focalization of CASPs into micro-domains (known as the string-of-pearls stage), nearby ectopic CASP deposits might inhibit the growth of the central domain leading to the observed large discontinuities. In order to better understand the nature and origin of these patches, we followed CASP deposition throughout endodermal differentiation. In both wildtype and <italic>lotr1</italic>, CASP1-GFP aggregated into aligned micro-domains in the cell’s median (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). During this initial focalization step, we observed occurrence of ectopic CASP islands in <italic>lotr1</italic>, indicating a role of LOTR1 during this early step of defining the CS location. Ectopic CASP deposits grew over time and were able to fuse into larger patches, similarly to the central micro-domains combining into a continuous ring. We did not observe degradation of these patches nor formation of new patches once the central domain was fused, confirming that these patches are stable once formed and their establishment is restricted to the short developmental window in which the cells determine their CS location. Consequently, LOTR1 likely acts in this early phase as an inhibitor of ectopic domain formation. We then investigated whether these patches represent fully functional domains, that is whether they are able to guide lignification enzymes to these sites. Deposition of lignin can be easily identified in electron microscopy, where CSs are visible as a clearly defined, homogenous stretch of cell wall spanning the entire apoplastic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roppolo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Ultra-structure analysis of <italic>lotr1</italic> revealed similar cell wall modifications in pericycle-facing endodermal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To our surprise, and in contrast to regular CSs, this ectopic lignin patch was restricted to the endodermal part of the cell wall, stopping precisely at the middle lamella, effectively creating half of a Casparian Strip. Such a strict spatial confinement of lignification on a nanometer scale is quite surprising since monolignols and ROS, both essential for lignin polymerization, are thought to be mobile in cell walls and lignin polymerization itself not to be under direct enzymatic control. To our knowledge, such a strictly restricted lignification encompassing only half of a thin primary has not been observed previously. Our finding therefore suggests a very local and directed lignin polymerization in the CS, where each endodermal cell is responsible for lignifying their part of the cell wall to build a functional CS barrier. A functional CSD is also characterized by a tight attachment of the underlying membrane, which is revealed in EM by the mild plasmolysis of the plasma membrane introduced through sample preparation, and which is absent at the CSD. Perfectly matching the cell autonomous nature of the ectopic patches, tight attachment of the endodermal plasma membrane, but not the pericycle plasma membrane was observed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ectopic domain formation in <italic>lotr1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of endodermal maturation with stages of Casparian Strip (CS) development (green).

Depositing electron dense material by reaction with lignin sidechains, KMnO<sub>4</sub> highlights lignin presence as darkening of cell walls in Casparian strips and protoxylem vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>). Ectopic patches in <italic>lotr1</italic> displayed KMnO4 staining on the endodermal side of the half-strips, while the opposite pericycle cell walls were unstained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This correlated with CS-typical cell wall appearance (more homogenous, less electron-dense, slightly thickened) observed in unstained consecutive cuts, confirming lignin presence at these ectopic domains. Notably, several samples displayed CS-type cell wall morphology with accompanying membrane attachment and lignification throughout the entire endodermal cell corner, stretching from the median endodermal-cell interface all the way to the endodermal-pericycle cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although ectopic lignification is a hallmark of many Casparian Strip mutants, this was not described for <italic>lotr1</italic>. Furthermore, enhanced lignification itself does not result in firm membrane attachment outside the regular CS. Consequently, this points to a drastically enlarged CSD indicative of an impaired ability to restrict CSD growth in <italic>lotr1,</italic> agreeing with a presumed role of LOTR1 as inhibitor of domain formation.</p><p>The regular CSD recruits a multitude of enzymes required for restricted monolignol polymerization to form the CS. The tightly restricted lignin accumulation at ectopic <italic>lotr1</italic> patches suggested similar recruitment of these enzymes. We therefore co-expressed the CSD marker CASP1-GFP together with typical members of this lignin machinery in <italic>lotr1</italic> to confirm their recruitment to ectopic CSDs. Endodermis specific PEROXIDASE 64 (PRX64) and LACCASE 3 (LAC3) displayed a clear co-labeling in both central and ectopic domains while NADPH oxidase RbohF - the main generator of ROS for monolignol polymerization - was also found to be present, although it did not specifically accumulate at the CSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the localization of dirigent-domain protein ESB1 in <italic>lotr1</italic>. Although it was previously reported to be absent from ectopic deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We found ESB1 to accumulate at the sites of ectopic CASP1-deposition when expressed as ESB1-mCherry under its native promoter together with CASP1-GFP. Dirigent-domain proteins are thought to be a key component in restricting and directing lignin polymerization in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hosmani et al., 2013</xref>). Our results of ESB1 localization therefore agree with PER64 and LAC3 labeling, as well as the tight restriction of lignin at these patches, proving these ectopic formations to be fully functional, but ectopically formed CSDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Focalization of CASPs is coordinated between cells</title><p>The fact that an ectopic CSD patch towards a non-endodermal neighbor can only induce formation of a half-strip suggested that two neighboring endodermal cells absolutely need to align their respective CSDs in order to lignify the entire CS cell wall space. To ensure this, a mechanism would need to be in place that promotes formation of a CSD at places where a neighboring cell is forming one and/or inhibits CSD formation in the absence of a neighboring CSD. We therefore investigated the initial focalization of CASP proteins at high resolution. When properly aligned along the z-axis, we were able to identify two distinct membrane signals present between two neighboring endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Strikingly, at the string-of-pearls stage, CASP1-GFP intensity along the length of both signals already showed a strong positive correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.535, p = 1.612 e-9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating coordination of CSD formation across the cell wall already at this stage. To validate our assumption that these paired signals represent the signals of neighboring cell membrane domains, we checked the position of CS cell wall protein ESB1 and cell wall tracer Propidium Iodide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In contrast to CASP1-GFP, ESB1-mCherry localized in a single line in between the observed CASP-labeled membranes in both early and late CSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To further confirm that these GFP signals truly represented separate membranes, we decided to employ cell-specific laser ablation to destroy one of the cells, arguing that this should remove only one half of the paired signal. Indeed, upon ablation, GFP signal was specifically lost in the ablated cell, whereas the adjacent signal of the intact neighboring cell was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, our data demonstrate the observed double signals to be adjacent CSDs of neighboring endodermal cells, whose initial formation is tightly coordinated between cells. We then investigated whether currently known mutants such as <italic>sgn1</italic>, <italic>sgn3,</italic> and <italic>esb1</italic> would display defects in CASP microdomain coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, all these mutants showed wildtype like coordination between adjacent CSDs. Interestingly, <italic>lotr1</italic> also showed well-coordinated deposition of micro-domains at the Casparian strip position. Therefore, while LOTR1 appears to be necessary to restrict, unpaired, ectopic domain establishment, its loss-of function does not seem to affect the process of coordination at the correct central position where the future CS between neighboring cells is forming. This is corroborated by the lack of CS half-strips at the regular median position between endodermal cells in <italic>lotr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CASP deposition is coordinated between neighboring endodermal cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Double membrane phenotype visible with CASP1::CASP1-GFP during string-of-pearls stage of CS development, scale bars depict 10 µm.

Such a mechanism would immediately guide CSD formation towards endodermis-endodermis surfaces. In order to test this model, we ablated individual endodermal cells in the elongation zone, prior to their transition to differentiation. This enabled us to compare CSD establishment with and without a functional neighbor in the same cell. Initially, we observed CASP deposition in a string-of-pearls-typical pattern in membranes facing living and dead cells alike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>). However, only membranes facing intact neighbors were able to form a continuous strip, whereas domains towards ablated cells did not progress past the string-of-pearls stage. When we ablated all adjacent cells, the single intact cell was still able to express and focalize CASPs but was unable to establish any continuous domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also noticed a strong difference in signal intensity between membranes facing living and dead cells, where GFP signal increased rapidly in CSDs towards intact neighbors, but not ablated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This discrepancy is likely a result of an inability to recruit additional CASP proteins to the initially formed micro-domains. This suggested a control point during CSD establishment where a neighboring signal is required to progress from the string-of-pearls stage and commit to formation of a CS. We had to exclude that isolating endodermal cells from their neighbors by ablation might cause stresses that influence overall endodermal differentiation and not just a destabilization of CASP recruitment to the membrane. We therefore used a CASP1 transcriptional reporter, driving a nuclear fluorescent protein. Upon ablation of all surrounding endodermal cells a similar CASP promoter activity compared to non-affected cells was observed, indicating that progress of differentiation per se was not halted in the isolated cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To rule out possible general effects on secretion or localization of plasma membrane proteins, we then ablated cells in double marker lines expressing CASP1-GFP and the generic SYP122-3xmCherry plasma membrane marker, both under the control of the CASP1 promoter. Again, this clearly established that isolated cells still express from the CASP1 promoter. Moreover, they accumulate SYP122 on all cell sides, in contrast to CASP1, which accumulates only at plasma membrane domains facing a living neighbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Endodermal neighbors are required for proper CSD establishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endodermal cell ablation leads to instability of the CSD in membranes facing dead cells.

Using very low level of inducer, we generated sporadic MYB36 activation to enable some, but not all cells to start differentiation and initiate CS formation. Expectedly, we observed a sporadic, patchy expression pattern of CSD domain marker CASP1-GFP upon induction, with some samples displaying expression in isolated, single cells, while others showed cell groups with a near complete CSD network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Confirming our ablation results, we found that isolated cells were able to deposit CASP1-GFP in typical micro-domains but were incapable of forming a stable and continuous CSD, similar to what was observed using cell ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left). If two adjacent cells started to deposit CASPs, we observed an increase in GFP signal only in the domain between these cells, followed by fusion of the initial micro-domains into a continuous strip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). The domains not facing a CASP1 expressing neighbor did not progress beyond a string-of-pearls stage and eventually lost the CASP1-GFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We conclude that wildtype plants appear to require signals from neighbors to form stable microdomains and commit to a CS. <italic>lotr1</italic> is currently the only known mutant that can form functional microdomains in the absence of neighbors.

Presence of KMnO<sub>4</sub>-stained lignin throughout the endodermal cell corners found in some samples during our ultra-structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) resembled SGN3-induced ectopic lignification. To unambiguously demonstrate ectopic lignin deposition outside the CASP-labeled domain, we employed a novel clearing protocol that enables co-observation of fluorescent markers, for example CASP1-GFP, and lignin-specific stains, such as Basic Fuchsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ursache et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Exogenous application of CIF2 peptide further demonstrated that the SGN3-pathway is functional in <italic>lotr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We therefore placed a nuclear-localized tdTomato under the control of a 3 kb LOTR1 promoter fragment. We observed strong promoter activity in the root meristem in nearly all tissue layers and cells, including QC and columella, with the highest expression found in the stele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Very low expression was found in the epidermis and ground cell lineage, with promoter activity visible in cortex/endodermal initials and their endodermis daughter cells, but not in the cortex daughter.

Expression of a full-length LOTR1 version with putative active-site residues C255 and C260 mutated to alanine showed apoplastic localization similar to unmutated LOTR1, but was unable to complement the <italic>lotr1</italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests an important functional role for these amino acids in LOTR1 and supports a protease function for this enzyme class in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Tissue-specific complementation indicates non-cell autonomous LOTR1 action</title><p>The strong expression pattern of LOTR1 suggests a function in the inner stele tissues and a non-autonomous action of LOTR1 on endodermal differentiation. With a potential protease function, an action on the equally stele-expressed CIF peptides was conceivable, but inconsistent with our genetic analysis. In order to establish the site of LOTR1 action, we generated LOTR1 fusion proteins and were able to complement the loss-of-function phenotype with LOTR1 N-terminal (behind the signal peptide), but not C-terminal fusion proteins, indicating that a free C-terminus is important for its functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>lotr1-8</italic> allele, where a late STOP-codon truncated the protein by just 16 aa leads to a knock-out phenotype, further suggesting an important role of the c-terminal extremity. In agreement with the promoter activity, fluorescence of the fusion construct was mainly visible in the apoplastic space between stele cells, with outer tissues showing very low levels of accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the very low expression observed in the endodermis is nonetheless responsible for LOTR1 function, we generated lines driving LOTR1 expression from stele-, endodermal-, or cortex-specific promoters in the <italic>lotr1</italic> mutant background. We found continuous CSDs and lack of patches only when expressed from the stele specific SHORTROOT (SHR) and CIF2 promoters, but not from endodermal SCR, CASP1, and ELTP, nor cortex specific C1 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Covering early, intermediate, and late endodermal development, the lack of complementation by endodermal promoters demonstrated that LOTR1 was not acting in the endodermis to fulfil its role in CSD formation. Peculiarly, expression of the same construct under the ubiquitous 35 S CaMV promoter did also not seem to complement the underlying <italic>lotr1</italic> phenotype. Several scenarios could explain this finding: LOTR1 function could require exclusive expression in the stele, although its native promoter showed some weak outer-tissue activity. Alternatively, over- or misexpression of the construct might lead to the same patchy <italic>lotr1</italic> phenotype, but through dominant interference. We therefore analysed the expression levels of the via qRT-PCR. We observed high transgene expression levels in lines expressing <italic>LOTR1</italic> from endodermal/cortical promoter ELTP and stele-specific CIF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Expression strength of <italic>LOTR1</italic> expressed from 35 S and C1 promoters were comparable to the native promoter. Thus, overexpression does not explain the seeming absence of complementation in the 35 S lines, leaving mis-expression in outer tissues as the probable cause for the observed phenotype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Stele-specific LOTR1 restricts CSD establishment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mis-expression of LOTR1 in cortical cells causes dominant loss-of-function phenotypes.

We outcrossed all generated lines to wildtype CASP1-GFP plants to test for genetic dominance of the transformed constructs. Previously complementing constructs LOTR1::LOTR1, SHR::LOTR1, and CIF2::LOTR1 continued to display a wild-type CSDs and no occurrence of <italic>lotr1</italic> typical patches in the F1 generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Expectedly, wild-type phenotypes were also observed for the non-complementing, endodermis-specific SCR and CASP1 driven lines. Yet, remarkably, not only expression driven by 35 S, but also from cortex-specific C1 and endodermal/cortex-expressing ELTP promoters caused ectopic CASP1-GFP patches like those observed in uncomplemented <italic>lotr1</italic> in the F1 progeny. We confirmed this dominant phenotype in the following segregating F2 generations, where all plants harboring ELTP, C1, or 35 S constructs showed patch formation. Only 7/37 (ELTP), 9/42 (C1), and 8/45 (35S) plants displayed wildtype like continuous CSDs and no patches in the respective F2 populations. Since the dominant phenotype was not easily distinguishable from the normal <italic>lotr1</italic> loss-of-function phenotype, our observed ratios (18.9%, 21.4%, 17.7 %) matched the expected 3/16 (18.75%) Mendelian segregation ratio for a wildtype phenotype (non <italic>lotr1-</italic>homozygous, plus absence of dominant transgene). Apoplastic barrier functionality tests in these lines confirmed our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, we ensured by qRT-PCR that expression from the native locus was largely unchanged in all transgenic lines excluding transgene-induced silencing as a possible explanation for the observed, dominant-negative effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Establishment of a functional apoplastic barrier relies on the correctly localized deposition of lignin at the median position between endodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Naseer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geldner, 2013</xref>). Although many components involved in this process have been identified in the last decade, we still poorly understand the mechanism by which these cells achieve the precise formation of Casparian Strips in such a way that a single, thin, continuous ring of lignin is formed in between endodermal cells. In our current work, we provide new insights into this mechanism by demonstrating strict coordination of CASP deposition in membranes of adjacent endodermal cells. Independent of any known CS mutant, this coordination pathway appears to allow a local initial pairing of forming CASP micro-domains, across the cell wall of neighboring endodermal cells, which promotes their stabilization and eventual fusion. This results in the necessity for having a functional, differentiating endodermal cell neighbors in order to form a continuous CS. Without a neighboring cell in the same developmental state, wild-type endodermal cells abort CS development after the initial formation of CASP microdomains, which eventually disappear. In our current understanding, CASPs are initially secreted in a non-localized fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roppolo et al., 2011</xref>), yet rapidly form aligned CASP micro domains. This is initiated by a specific exocyst complex, defined by subunit EXO70A1, whose accumulation at the site of the future CS precedes CASP accumulation and is necessary for their targeted secretion to this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kalmbach et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, <italic>exo70a1</italic> mutants display a high number of non-localized and non-functional, unstable CASP microdomains. What mechanism could account for the selective stabilization of CASPs in domains facing intact neighbors of the same differentiation state, but not toward dead, undifferentiated cells or cells of a different cellular identity? One explanation would postulate the existence of a stabilizing short-range signal, produced by CASPs domain that can only act in trans, not in cis. However, such an exclusive in trans action is difficult to conceive with small, released molecules able to diffuse across the cell wall space. It would be much easier to conceive with filaments, reaching across the cell walls between domains, but there is no evidence for the existence of such filament-like structures. Alternatively, a cumulative threshold for a short-range, stabilizing signal produced by the microdomains can be postulated, that could only be reached when both cells produce it. However, such a model would require a very fine-tuned thresholding. Although a promising candidate for a factor involved in this coordination process, our detailed analysis of the <italic>lotr1</italic> mutant demonstrates that it does not affect the coordination of the properly localized micro-domains between cells, nor does it allow for their formation without neighbors. Nevertheless, absence of LOTR1 activity clearly allows for formation of non-paired, stable, and fully functional microdomains, oriented towards non-endodermal neighbors. Therefore, it is most likely responsible for inhibiting sporadic micro-domain formation throughout the endodermal membrane when CASPs are starting to focalize from their ubiquitous distribution in the plasma membrane into aligned micro-domains. The peculiar formation of Casparian half-strips in <italic>lotr1</italic>, further indicates that lignin deposition into the CS cell wall is separately performed by both contributing cells, which would make a tight coordination of neighboring CASP domains all the more critical for achieving a fully sealed cell wall space. Restricted mostly to the stele in mature regions of the root, we provide evidence that this putative cell wall protease might act on a target originating outside of its own expression domain. <italic>lotr1</italic> could only be complemented using stele-specific promoters and neither endodermal, cortex nor ubiquitous expression leads to complementation. Importantly, we discovered that wildtype plants displayed a dominant <italic>lotr1</italic>-like phenotype with ectopic patches, disrupted CSDs, and a corresponding delay in PI block when LOTR1 was mis-expressed in the cortex. How could ectopic expression of a putative cell wall protease in the cortex interfere with the action of the same protease in its wild-type expression domain in the stele? The most parsimonious, albeit speculative, explanation we can conceive is that a LOTR1 substrate is produced in the outer cortical tissues and has to diffuse into the stele for activation by stele-expressed LOTR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Expression of LOTR1 in the cortex would lead to a premature activation of its substrate in the cortex and not allow it to reach the stele. It would thus deplete the endogenous LOTR1 of its substrate and cause the observed dominant loss-of-function phenotype. This explanation thus draws a ‘reverse’ SGN3/CIF pathway model where a cortex-specific substrate passes across the endodermal cell layer to be activated by a stele-specific enzyme complex, destabilizing CASPs and preventing domain formation at ectopic positions.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Speculative model of LOTR1 function.</title><p>The following model for LOTR1 function is simply one scenario that can plausibly integrate the data on LOTR1’s predicted activity, expression, subcellular localization, as well as phenotypes by loss-of-function and dominant-interference by misexpression. <bold>Wild-type:</bold> LOTR1 is a predicted protease (<italic>scissors</italic>), experimentally determined to be expressed in the stele and to localize in the cell wall.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Yvon Jallais (Reviewer #2); Marc Somssich (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given the importance of Figure 5 to demonstrate non-cell autonomous function, we request that you:</p><p>1) Support the dominant loss-of-function effect, evidence of LOTR1 expression in wt and lotr1 in pELTP, pC1 and p35S constructs (presented in panel C and D) using qrt-PCR for example. Alternatively, if Figure 5 C legend is right, and the LOTR1 fusion was used indeed in panel C, please provide evidence of LOTR1 -mScarlet expression domain when expressed under the different promoters. Is the protein/RNA or an upstream regulator non-cell autonomous/mobile? Alternatively, if non of these are possible please moderate the claims made and revise the figure/paper.</p><p>2) Verify LOTR1 expression in WT, lotr1, and lotr1/LOTR1xve::LOTR1 (before and after induction) by qRT-PCR.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper combines excellent cell biology with genetics approaches. The claims of the paper that LOTR1 is a crucial player in a novel mechanism that control CS positioning are well supported by mutant studies, ablation experiments and expression domain analysis. A weakness is the lack of detail on the molecular mechanism that LOTR1 uses to function or signal CS positioning, which defines the non-cell autonomy aspect of the work.</p><p>There is excellent work here on the cell biology and progress in dissecting the role of LOTR1 but there is no understanding of the mechanism involving this protease in the control of the casparian strip. Some of the statements need to be reconsidered or moderated to allow for multiple mechanisms/possibilities. The whole non-cell autonomy effect is based on promoter expression analysis but these results are confounded with a dominant phenotype observed with endodermal promoter. Moreover, since LOTR1 does not appear to move from the stele (do the author have any evidence that it does from results presented in Figure 5??), it is assumed that their non-cell autonomous function is through a downstream yet unknown factor. This uncertainty weakens the conclusions. few recommendations below:</p><p>1 – Line 419 and beyond: please describe the nature of lotr1 mutation, which domain of the protein are affected? Line 446 indicate that 8 alleles were identified, are these different mutations? Are these mutations all display similar/ different phenotypes that could help dissecting LOTR function?</p><p>2 – Line 455: 'artificially truncated versions of LOTR1 resulted in extensive intracellular labelling and absence of complementation', this evidence do not specifically indicate that ' LOTR1 does not undergo post-processing' but that the post-processed version is not the active form.</p><p>3 – line 493: and Figure 5, this section is essential to demonstrate non-cell autonomous function for LOTR1 but promoter expression/activity in lotr1 need to be provided to evaluate complementation results. If complementation depends on LOTR1 dosage, as suggested, then expression levels of the LOTR1 when expressed under the different promoters should be determined.</p><p>4 – Expression of LOTR1 with the estradiol promoter is also required. It is difficult to distinguish between the need for LOTR1 to be expressed in the stele alone and the dominant loss-of-function effect observed in wildtype and lotr1 with cortical expressing constructs.</p><p>5 – The legend of the figure 5 need to explain what the different colours mean? the title should be moderated as, so far, there is no evidence of the presumible cortex-expressed, mobile target and that figure do not demonstrate the there is one. The legend also need to mention the identity of the different construct and how the activity of the used promoters graph (shown between panel C and D) was determined.</p><p>6 – The authors indicate that construct in panel A was the same as used in panel C but in A the LOTR1 was with mSCarlet in magenta and CASP1 in green whereas in section C, CASP1 appear in magenta and LOTR1 is not fused to a reporter?</p><p>More importantly, if Figure 5 C legend is right, is it possible to see the expression domain of LOTR1-mScarlet when expressed under the different promoters? Is it restricted to promoter activity domains or there is evidence of out of place protein accumulation/expression?</p><p>7 – In relation to the same figure, it is confusing that panels are not presented as described in the text, where panel B (inducible construct) is described after panel C.</p><p>8 – Regarding LOTR1 function, as protease activity is not demonstrated neither target of this protease or the localisation of this target in cell walls, authors need to understate their claims and consider alternative (if unlikely) mechanisms. Model presented is highly speculative and it should be clear what aspects of the model are substantiated by the data and which aspects are just hypothetical, ideally by presenting alternative models or reference to the figure in the legend. for example there is no requirement for the target in the steele/endodermis being the same one as in the cortex or is there evidence?</p><p>9 – In the vein of LOTR1 non-cell autonomous function, have the authors verified if LOTR1 is mobile, either by diffusing in membranes/ apoplast toward the steele/endodermis face or via plasmodesmata?</p><p>Another idea to dissect LOTR1 function could be characterising cell wall composition using for example immunoprobes.</p><p>Answering these last questions are not required for an excellent publication but are food for thought for future research.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Here the authors investigate how cells of the root endodermis precisely position their Casparian Strip domains (CSD) to form a continuous superstructure. They start with a phenotypic analysis of the lotr1 mutant, which shows ectopic CSD formation, notably at the endodermis/pericycle interface. LOTR1 restricts the formation of CSD independently of other known pathways (Shengen pathway, ESB1). A unique feature of the lotr1 mutant is that the ectopic CSDs are functional (i.e. able to guide lignification). However, lignin is polymerized only close to the CSDs (endodermal cells) and not throughout the apoplast (i.e. not all the way to the PM of the pericycle). This is significant in several ways. First, it shows that lignin polymerization is highly local, while it was anticipated that the ROS and monolignols necessary for lignin polymerization were able to diffuse in cell walls, at least to a certain degree. Second, the production of &quot;half&quot; a Casparian strip in the lotr1 mutant shows that each endodermal cell is responsible for lignifying its part of the cell wall, suggesting tight coordination between neighboring endodermal cells. Live imaging of CASP1-GFP shows that this coordination happens very early (at the string-of-pearls stage). Furthermore, local ablation or conditional mosaic expression shows that neighboring endodermal cells are required for forming a continuous and stable Casparian strip (but not to initially form CSD). The nature of the signal between neighboring endodermal cells is unknown and is independent of LOTR1. Finally, the authors analyzed LOTR1 expression and localization. Using complementation assays with a functionally tagged LOTR1 protein (and some mutated forms), they confirm that it is a secreted apoplastic full-length protein with likely protease activity. In addition, LOTR1 is mostly expressed in the stele, not in the endodermis, pointing to a possible non-cell-autonomous action of LOTR1 to restrict CSD positioning. Using cell-type-specific expression of LOTR1, the authors show that (1) LOTR1 is indeed active in the stele, not in the endodermis, and (2) that it has a dominant-negative effect (mimic a lotr1 loss-of-function phenotype in a wild-type background) when expressed in the cortex.</p><p>I find this paper outstanding at several levels. First, the findings that it is possible to form a &quot;half&quot; Casparian strip with only half of the cell wall lignified are fascinating. They imply highly restricted lignin polymerization and will urge plant biologists to reconsider preconceived ideas about apoplastic ROS and monolignol diffusion. The corresponding TEM images supporting this finding are breathtaking (although it took me quite some time to understand them). Second, the level of coordination between neighboring endodermal cells is also astonishing, notably the fact that coordination appears to be almost immediate upon CASP1 expression. The cell ablation and mosaic expression of MYB36 are very elegant (and non-trivial) experiments and unambiguously demonstrate the importance of endodermal neighbors in the formation of a continuous Casparian strip. Last but not least, the findings that LOTR1 action is non-cell-autonomous and induces a dominant-negative effect when expressed in the cortex are not only fully supported by the data but also highly intriguing. Indeed, they suggest that LOTR1 in the stele can cleave and activate a mobile signal produced in the cortex. Although still speculative (because the signal remains unknown and LOTR1 protease activity has not been formally demonstrated), this would suggest that there are signals that pass through the endodermal domain in both directions (cortex to stele for the LOTR1-activated signal and stele to endodermis in the case of the CIF/Shengen pathway). Conceptually, the notion that multiple apoplastic signals regulate their very own diffusion by building up and positioning a diffusion barrier is certainly of broad interest and is very likely transposable to many other biological interphases.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The formation and correct positioning of the Casparian strip (CS) requires the coordinated activity of several precisely localized proteins, as well as communication between the different cells. There has been quite some progress in recent years on how this precise localization is achieved. The focus of this paper is the establishment of the Casparian strip membrane domains (CSDs), which are the precursors to the CS and define where the CSs are formed. These CSDs are initiated at several locations along the endodermal cells, but are initially instable, unless in the very precise location of the future CS. In this study, the authors investigate the contribution of LOTR1 to this instability of the CSDs outside the CS domain. Endodermal cells of lotr1 mutants form ectopic, stable, lignified CSDs, which furthermore appear to be one-sided (endodermal-sided), if they occur between an endodermal cell and a non-endodermal cell. It therefore appears that LOTR1, a putative protease, is required to restrict CSD formation to the central CS-domain. Curiously, LOTR1 is expressed in the stele, acts in the endodermis, and ectopic expression in the cortex results in dominant-negative effects. The authors come up with a speculative model, in which a mobile protein is expressed in the cortex, diffuses past the endodermis, and is then cleaved/activated by LOTR1 at the endodermis/cortex interface, where this activated protein then acts to destabilize the temporary CSDs at the cell-sides facing the pericycle.</p><p>I believe that the main findings from this paper are that (1) CSDs are indeed only stable between two living endodermis cells, indicating that there is communication between these two cells. And (2), that LOTR1 is required to prevent any one-sided CSDs being formed at endodermis to non-endodermis cell-cell interfaces, thereby contributing to the instability of these initial CSDs. For this, LOTR1 acts non-cell autonomously, being expressed only in the stele. The first of these two findings is nicely and elegantly demonstrated using a combination of cell-ablation experiments, and induced endodermal differentiation in some cells, with or without endodermal neighbors. Regarding the function of LOTR1, the authors perform an exhaustive expression analysis with different promoters and genetic backgrounds. The amount of work to establish these two main points is impressive.</p><p>It is then a little bit disappointing that the story seems to be a bit open-ended, as the author's final model still is speculative. However, it is also logically supported by the results presented here, and certainly provides a useful working hypothesis for further work.</p><p>It would be great to further validate the model of the authors, but at this stage I do not see any obvious experiments that would help to easily solidify or disprove the model with a reasonable amount of work and time required.</p><p>The only observation that does not seem to be explained by the results presented here or the model, is the occurrence of ectopic CASP-deposits in lotr1 mutants at the endodermis-cortex side, which the authors also observed, albeit a rare event (lines 136-139).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69602.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The paper combines excellent cell biology with genetics approaches. The claims of the paper that LOTR1 is a crucial player in a novel mechanism that control CS positioning are well supported by mutant studies, ablation experiments and expression domain analysis. A weakness is the lack of detail on the molecular mechanism that LOTR1 uses to function or signal CS positioning, which defines the non-cell autonomy aspect of the work.</p><p>There is excellent work here on the cell biology and progress in dissecting the role of LOTR1 but there is no understanding of the mechanism involving this protease in the control of the casparian strip. Some of the statements need to be reconsidered or moderated to allow for multiple mechanisms/possibilities. The whole non-cell autonomy effect is based on promoter expression analysis but these results are confounded with a dominant phenotype observed with endodermal promoter. Moreover, since LOTR1 does not appear to move from the stele (do the author have any evidence that it does from results presented in Figure 5??), it is assumed that their non-cell autonomous function is through a downstream yet unknown factor. This uncertainty weakens the conclusions. few recommendations below:</p><p>1 – Line 419 and beyond: please describe the nature of lotr1 mutation, which domain of the protein are affected? Line 446 indicate that 8 alleles were identified, are these different mutations? Are these mutations all display similar/ different phenotypes that could help dissecting LOTR function?</p></disp-quote><p>The mutations were originally described in Li et al., Current Biology, 2017. They are indicated in Figure S4B and now mentioned in the text. In addition to a SALK insertion line, the alleles are typical EMS alleles, with a number of STOP mutations along the ORF, as well as several point mutations within the Neprosin domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – Line 455: 'artificially truncated versions of LOTR1 resulted in extensive intracellular labelling and absence of complementation', this evidence do not specifically indicate that ' LOTR1 does not undergo post-processing' but that the post-processed version is not the active form.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct, we now changed this statement into: “LOTR1 does not undergo post-processing for activation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – line 493: and Figure 5, this section is essential to demonstrate non-cell autonomous function for LOTR1 but promoter expression/activity in lotr1 need to be provided to evaluate complementation results. If complementation depends on LOTR1 dosage, as suggested, then expression levels of the LOTR1 when expressed under the different promoters should be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply to the editor’s comments, point (1). We have now determined transgene and endogenous expression level for all lines by qPCR and discussed that the data shows that the phenotypes do clearly not correlate with expression strength, but expression pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – Expression of LOTR1 with the estradiol promoter is also required. It is difficult to distinguish between the need for LOTR1 to be expressed in the stele alone and the dominant loss-of-function effect observed in wildtype and lotr1 with cortical expressing constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply to the editor, point (2) We have taken out the estradiol promoter data, because of inconsistent results, but we hope that Reviewer 1 agrees that the cell-type specific promoter line data (and the additional expression quantification we provide) does obviate the need for inducible lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – The legend of the figure 5 need to explain what the different colours mean? the title should be moderated as, so far, there is no evidence of the presumible cortex-expressed, mobile target and that figure do not demonstrate the there is one. The legend also need to mention the identity of the different construct and how the activity of the used promoters graph (shown between panel C and D) was determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the presence of a mobile signal, is no more than a speculation consistent with the presented data. The title is indeed an overstatement and has been changed. The promoter names were added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – The authors indicate that construct in panel A was the same as used in panel C but in A the LOTR1 was with mSCarlet in magenta and CASP1 in green whereas in section C, CASP1 appear in magenta and LOTR1 is not fused to a reporter?</p><p>More importantly, if Figure 5 C legend is right, is it possible to see the expression domain of LOTR1-mScarlet when expressed under the different promoters?</p></disp-quote><p>The legend is correct, the constructs are indeed mScarlet fusions. However, expression from the different promoters does not lead to very strong signals of LOTR1 and localization of LOTR1 in the cell wall makes straightforward imaging for tissue-specific expression rather challenging and difficult to show in single, comparable pictures. Additionally, some promoters, such as <italic>SCR</italic> or <italic>C1</italic>, only lead to detectable LOTR1 signals early on, but nonetheless affect CASP1 localisation at the later stages shown in Figure 5. We therefore decided not to present this data here. We have, however, ascertained expression of all lines by qPCR (Figure 5) and shown that endogenous LOTR1 expression remains unaffected (Figure S5). Moreover, we have only used well-characterised promoters and based our conclusions (-complementation necessitates expression in stele, -endodermis expression does not rescue, -cortical expression had dominant-negative effects) always on results from at least two independent promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it restricted to promoter activity domains or there is evidence of out of place protein accumulation/expression?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in our reply to the editors’ comments, we think that the comparison of our transcriptional, as well as complementing, translational fusions of LOTR1, suggests that there is no RNA or protein movement of LOTR1. Although LOTR1 is broadly expressed under its own promoter, it shows a sharp drop in expression between stele and cortex in differentiated roots. Here, we do not see any indication that the LOTR1 protein would be detected in a more extended domain than the transcriptional reporter. Rather, protein accumulation follows closely the transcriptional profile.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7 – In relation to the same figure, it is confusing that panels are not presented as described in the text, where panel B (inducible construct) is described after panel C.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this. We have now taken out the inducible construct panel and changed the order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8 – Regarding LOTR1 function, as protease activity is not demonstrated neither target of this protease or the localisation of this target in cell walls, authors need to understate their claims and consider alternative (if unlikely) mechanisms. Model presented is highly speculative and it should be clear what aspects of the model are substantiated by the data and which aspects are just hypothetical, ideally by presenting alternative models or reference to the figure in the legend. for example there is no requirement for the target in the steele/endodermis being the same one as in the cortex or is there evidence?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our model is still speculative and indicated this in the title. We have now added an additional “disclaimer” in the legend to Figure 6. It reads:</p><p>“The following model for LOTR1 function is simply one scenario that can plausibly integrate the data on LOTR1’s predicted activity, expression, subcellular localization, as well as phenotypes by loss-of-function and dominant-interference by misexpression.”</p><p>We would like to point out, however, that it is not trivial to come up with alternative, equally plausible scenarios. It is really very hard to explain how LOTR1 activity in cortical cell layers can interfere with the wt LOTR1 activity in the stele. LOTR1 in the cortex must do something that interferes with the ability of LOTR1 in the stele to act. Competition for the same substrate is by far the most simple hypothesis we could come up with.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9 – In the vein of LOTR1 non-cell autonomous function, have the authors verified if LOTR1 is mobile, either by diffusing in membranes/ apoplast toward the steele/endodermis face or via plasmodesmata?</p><p>Another idea to dissect LOTR1 function could be characterising cell wall composition using for example immunoprobes.</p></disp-quote><p>First, our data indicates that LOTR1 is efficiently secreted (Figure 4F) and therefore should not travel through plasmodesmata, which would require cytoplasmic localization. Second, the non-processed form of LOTR1 that appears to accumulate is rather big (Figure S4C) and, from what is known of cell wall size exclusion numbers, should not be able to move through the apoplast as the smaller plant signaling peptides can. This is another reason why we postulate that the agent that acts on CASP1 localisation in the endodermis is a smaller LOTR1 substrate and not LOTR1 itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>It would be great to further validate the model of the authors, but at this stage I do not see any obvious experiments that would help to easily solidify or disprove the model with a reasonable amount of work and time required.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this assessment. We continue to work on the project, but we feel that we will need to invest significantly more time and effort until we can further support or disprove the our current model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only observation that does not seem to be explained by the results presented here or the model, is the occurrence of ectopic CASP-deposits in lotr1 mutants at the endodermis-cortex side, which the authors also observed, albeit a rare event (lines 136-139).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our model does not easily account for the ectopic patches at the cortical side, maybe the LOTR1 substrate can diffuse back towards the cortical side of the endodermis and has a minor role in repressing ectopic patches there? But other, currently unknown factors are more important to repress ectopic patch formation at the endodermis-cortex interfaces?</p></body></sub-article></article>
