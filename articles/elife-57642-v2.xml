explanted ventral involuting marginal zone (IMZ) of <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulae (Keller and Danilchik, 1988). Here, we show that CT is expressed in <italic>all</italic> sectors of the <italic>pre-involution</italic> IMZ, which transitions to expressing convergent extension (CE) <italic>after</italic> involution. CT occurs without CE and drives symmetric blastopore closure in ventralized embryos. Assays of tissue affinity and tissue surface tension measurements suggest CT is driven by increased interfacial tension between the deep IMZ and the overlying epithelium. The resulting minimization of deep IMZ surface area drives a tendency to shorten the mediolateral (circumblastoporal) aspect of the IMZ, thereby generating tensile force contributing to blastopore closure (Shook et al., 2018). These results establish CT as an independent force-generating process of evolutionary significance and provide the first clear example of an oriented, tensile force generated by an isotropic, Holtfreterian/Steinbergian tissue affinity change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>blastopore closure</kwd><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>convergent thickening</kwd><kwd>tissue surface tension</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NICHD R37 HD025594 MERIT award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Ray E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH RO1 GM099108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skoglund</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH RO1 GM094793</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeSimone</surname><given-names>Douglas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM131865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeSimone</surname><given-names>Douglas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIHR MOP-53075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winklbauer</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Xenopus embryos use tissue surface tension to generate hoop-stress around the blastopore to help close it during gastrulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogenesis is driven by force-generating, local cell behaviors, integrated to form that shape tissues. We understand much about the regulation of embryonic patterning and have made progress in understanding how patterning regulates specific morphogenic machines. But understanding the Mechanome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lang, 2008</xref>), the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these machines, how they generate tissue level mechanical properties and forces, and how these forces interact in the global biomechanical context to drive embryonic shape changes, is the challenge ahead. We explore these issues in gastrulation of an amphibian, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>.</p><p>Gastrulation involves movement of the cells of presumptive internal tissues from the outside surface through the blastopore to the inside of the embryo, thereby establishing the fundamental structure of the three-layered adult body plan. One category of movements involves the ‘convergence’ or decrease in circumference of the involuting marginal zone (IMZ), a ring of tissue around the vegetal endoderm (VE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, St 10-; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>*, top). The cells within the IMZ actively converge to generate a constricting force around the VE, which rolls the IMZ forward and inside (Involution; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, red arrows) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keller and Sutherland, 2020</xref>). After involuting, the early-involuting tissues originating from the lower (vegetal) region of the IMZ migrate across the blastocoel roof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, St 10 + and 11–11.5; brown cells, blue arrows) whereas the later-involuting tissues, the presumptive somitic and notochordal mesoderm, originating from the upper (animal) region of the IMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, purple and red cells) show narrowing (convergence) in the mediolateral axis and a commensurate lengthening (extension) in the orthogonal anterior-posterior axis (CE)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, St 11–11.5, green and light blue arrows). CE of these tissues, along with a roughly congruent CE of the overlying posterior neural plate (dark blue cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, St 11–11.5), which lies within the ring of tissue above the IMZ, the non-involuting marginal zone (NIMZ), elongate the body axis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Morphogenic movements in the embryo and explants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The behavior of the involuting marginal zone (IMZ) in blastopore closure is shown in the pre-gastrula embryo (St 10-) and at subsequent stages of gastrulation (St. 10+, 11–11.5) in mid-sagittal cut-aways rotated 45°, within the context of the whole embryo and the other morphogenic movements. This includes the animal and vegetal poles (AP, VP), the involuting marginal zone (IMZ), the vegetal endoderm (VE), and the morphogenic movements convergent thickening (CT, white arrows), epiboly (E, black arrows within epidermis), vegetal rotation (VR, gray arrows/black arrows within VE), mesendoderm migration (purple arrows), involution (red arrows), and convergent extension (CE, green (<bold>C</bold>) and blue (<bold>E</bold>) arrows within neural and mesodermal tissues). See legend of tissue colors, acronyms and movements at the bottom of the figure. The IMZ is a ring of several layers of deep cells, plus a superficial epithelium, that lies above and around the VE prior to gastrulation (St 10-). Deep IMZ cells are presumptive mesoderm whereas the superficial cells are primarily presumptive endoderm, with some presumptive mesoderm dorsally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Shook et al., 2004</xref>). After involution, the early involuting tissues originating from the lower (vegetal) region of the IMZ, including the presumptive head, heart, and lateroventral mesoderm (orange), migrate across the blastocoel roof (St 10+, 11–11.5, purple arrows), whereas tissues originating from the upper (animal) region of the IMZ, the presumptive notochordal (magenta) and somitic (red) mesoderm engage in CE (green and blue arrows), as does the overlying neural tissue (dark blue). Only the most recently involuted notochordal and somitic tissue, lying just around the inside of the blastopore directly generate convergence forces closing the blastopore by CE. The <italic>non-involuting marginal zone</italic> (NIMZ) is the ring of tissue above the IMZ that bounds the blastopore at the end of gastrulation, with its vegetal edge being the ‘Limit of Involution’ (LI; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The dorsal and dorsolateral sectors of the NIMZ contains the posterior neural tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> St 11–11.5, darker blue cells), which will undergo CE in parallel to the underlying somitic and notochordal mesoderm, driven by an intercalation behavior similar to MIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Keller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elul et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elul and Keller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ezin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ezin et al., 2006</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) A vegetal view of the early gastrula shown without the superficial, epithelial layer over the IMZ reveals the underlying deep presumptive mesoderm (<bold>B1</bold>). Sandwich explants of the dorsal quadrant of the Marginal Zone (IMZ plus NIMZ, <bold>B2</bold>), including tissues of presumptive notochordal (magenta), somitic (red), and neural (blue) fates undergo CE (green and blue symbols)(for detailed anatomy of explants, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, explants of the ventral quadrant (<bold>B3</bold>) develop only ventrolateral mesoderm (orange) when separated from the organizer (‘dorsal’) side of the embryo, round up and show a thickening of the mesodermal tissues, a movement called Convergent Thickening (CT, white symbols). Together, CE on the dorsal side and CT on the ventral side of the IMZ were previously thought to provide the convergence forces that close the blastopore in the intact embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>) (<bold>B1</bold>). (<bold>C</bold>) In the current work, a more detailed analysis of ‘giant’ sandwich explants of the entire Marginal Zone, and variants thereof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), reveals a revised view of the pattern of CT expression, wherein the entire IMZ uniformly expresses CT during early gastrulation (white symbols, St 10). At the midgastrula stage, expression of CT begins to transition into a progressive expression of CE (green and blue arrows, St 10.5), a post-involution progression from anterior to posterior, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shih and Keller, 1992a</xref>), while CT continues in the pre-involution IMZ; CE also begins in the posterior neural tissue (St 10.5–12+). (<bold>D</bold>) Lastly, ventralized embryos, which lack the presumptive tissues of notochordal and somitic mesoderm and contain only presumptive ventrolateral tissues, involute their marginal zone (red arrows) and close their blastopore symmetrically (green arrows), using CT alone (white symbols), and giant explants of ventralized embryos (<bold>E</bold>), consisting entirely of ventral tissues, undergo uniform CT.

Lateral view of the pre-gastrulation embryo (<bold>B</bold>) (Stage 10-) with animal pole (AP) at the top and vegetal pole (VP) at the bottom, showing presumptive tissues and the ranges of the AC, NIMZ, IMZ, and VE regions (colored bar). AC and NIMZ are ectodermal, the deep layers of the IMZ are mesodermal, whereas the superficial layer is either mesodermal (dorsally) or endodermal (laterally and ventrally); see below for details. Upper and lower regions of the IMZ are indicated (solid vs. broken red). The Limit of Involution (LI) lies at the boundary between the NIMZ and the IMZ and divides the mesodermal and endodermal tissues that will be internalized (below the LI) from the ectodermal tissues that will remain outside (above the LI). Images of whole embryos showing tissue fates are shown in lateral (<bold>B</bold>) and in vegetal view, with the epithelial tissues removed to show the underlying deep tissues in the left half (<bold>C</bold>) and with the epithelial tissues left intact (<bold>D</bold>). Presumptive tissue fates in the superficial (epithelial) layer: Light blue = epidermis (Epid), darker blues = neurectoderm (Forebrain (FB), hindbrain-spinal cord (HbSc)); magenta = notochord (<bold>N</bold>), gray = hypochord (<bold>H</bold>), red = adaxial somitic mesoderm (AM); yellow = supra-blastoporal endoderm (SE), bright green = presumptive bottle cells (BC, also SE); pale green is vegetal endoderm (VE) or ‘sub-blastoporal’ endoderm. Presumptive fates in the deep layer of the Marginal Zone are shown in the left half of C and A1, and in the entire IMZ in A6,7: light orange = leading edge mesoderm (LEM, migratory mesoderm); light red = somitic mesoderm (SM); light magenta = notochordal mesoderm. Standard ”Giant” sandwich explants (<bold>A1</bold>) were made of the entire Marginal Zone with bottle cells and some vegetal endoderm included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Shook et al., 2004</xref>), the ‘standard’ version for this work. Embryos were first cut ventrally (pointer in C), then AC and VE tissue removed as indicated (above and below pointers and lines in B) and VE was removed from the inner face of the IMZ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, St 10-). Two such explants were then pressed under cover glass to make a sandwich, inner face to inner face, to allow the epithelium to heal together around the edges. To make Giants without bottle cells (<bold>A2</bold>), all VE and some or all of the bottle cells were additionally removed from the explants prior to sandwiching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Poznanski et al., 1997</xref>). Ventrally centered giant sandwich explants (<bold>A4</bold>) were made as for standard giants, but initially cutting along the dorsal (pointer in D), rather than ventral midline. Dorsal 180° (D180) (<bold>A3</bold>), and Ventral 180° (V180) (<bold>A5</bold>) explants are made as standard or ventrally centered giants, with the ventral or dorsal 180°, respectively, of the marginal zone cut off. Ventralized (<bold>A6</bold>) or dorsoanteriorized (<bold>A7</bold>) giant explants were made from ventralized or dorsoanteriorized embryos, cut without reference to ‘dorsal’, as these embryos are symmetrical about the blastopore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Scharf and Gerhart, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kao and Elinson, 1988</xref>). Double ventral or dorsal, IMZ or NIMZ only sandwich explants (<bold>A8</bold>) were made by first constructing V180 explants with most of the presumptive bottle cells removed, allowing them to heal together at least 15 min, then cutting out the NIMZ and IMZ regions, avoiding the LI, and recombining two NIMZ- or two IMZ-only pieces with their newly cut posterior edges (those closest to the LI) juxtaposed and pressed together by two cover glass bits against the outer, anterior surfaces of the individual pieces. The epithelia at the cut edges heal together rapidly, preventing artifacts resulting from extended healing of the epithelium over the cut face. The doubled explants were allowed to heal for 30 min to 1 hr before being moved onto a cover glass platform in front of a 45° mirror in the culture dish, with the lateral edge of the explant facing the mirror, such that we could image both convergence (from above) and thickening (from the side). Convergence is reported from the point at which cover glass is lifted from the initial sandwiches, prior to cutting apart the IMZ and NIMZ portions of the explants. Thickness is reported from the time the two IMZ or NIMZ regions heal together. As a consequence of the explant construction process, our measures do not capture the initial ~25% convergence of the IMZ with respect to its initial mediolateral extent in the embryo or the initial ~50% thickening of the IMZ with respect to its initial thickness in the embryo. NIMZ explants show little or no change in thickness over the course of explant construction.

In addition to displaying CE in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Vogt, 1929</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Keller, 1976</xref>), movements of these tissues in explants of the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ, = IMZ + NIMZ) mimic those in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Schechtman, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Dorsal quadrant, blue and green arrows).</p><p>In contrast, CT was initially described as a tendency for explants of the ventral sector of the early gastrula to converge and thicken and eventually form a mini-gastroid lacking both dorsal tissues and CE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Ventral Quadrant, white arrows) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>). This led to the incorrect assumption that CE was a property of the dorsal sector of the IMZ and that CT was a property of the ventral IMZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>).</p><p>However, several observations suggest that CT is an independent morphogenic process that begins before CE and is initially expressed throughout the IMZ. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Scharf and Gerhart, 1980</xref> showed that <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos ventralized by UV irradiation of the vegetal side before first cleavage closed their blastopores, albeit symmetrically, despite lacking dorsal tissues expressing CE. This suggested that the ‘CT’ expressed in ventral explants of the normal gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>) might be an independent morphogenic process acting alone to close the blastopores of ventralized embryos. Second, ventralization rescued blastopore closure in myosin heavy chain IIB morphant embryos, suggesting that the mechanism of this symmetrical blastopore closure in ventralized embryos differs from that driving CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rolo, 2007</xref>). Third, recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>) confirmed that ventralized embryos close their blastopores isotropically (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>*, bottom), showed that ‘giant’ sandwich explants from ventralized embryos express CT throughout the IMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; white arrows), and showed that they generate 2 μN of convergence force during gastrulation. Moreover, giant sandwich explants made early from normal embryos (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) generate tensile convergence forces of 0.3 μN or more during the two hours <italic>prior to the onset</italic> of CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>), at Stage 10.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lane and Keller, 1997</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that CT is a force generating process independent of CE and suggest that it is initially expressed by the entire IMZ. Lastly, convergence around the blastopore or within giant sandwich explants prior to the onset of CE movements in other amphibians (Shook, unpublished observations) and delayed expression of CE until near the end of blastopore closure in some anurans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benítez and Del Pino, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Del Pino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Pino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Moya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Venegas-Ferrín et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elinson and del Pino, 2012</xref>) suggest that CT may be a general mechanism that functions throughout the amphibians. In the case of <italic>Gastrotheca riobambae</italic>, CE is delayed until after blastopore closure and gene markers for tissues known to undergo CE are not expressed until neurulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Pino and Elinson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">del Pino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benítez and Del Pino, 2002</xref>). These observations suggest that such embryos rely primarily on CT for blastopore closure (Shook, personal observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Pino and Elinson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">del Pino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benítez and Del Pino, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Keller and Shook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Pino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elinson and del Pino, 2012</xref>), that CT is a widely used convergence machine independent of CE, and that CT warrants further investigation as an independent movement.</p><p>Here, we show that CT is driven by forces resulting from increased interfacial tissue surface tension between the deep mesoderm and its overlying superficial epithelium, a mechanism fundamentally different from that driving CE. We confirm that CT begins uniformly throughout the IMZ from the onset of gastrulation and continues to operate in the pre-involution IMZ throughout gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). We show that presumptive notochordal and somitic tissues expressing CT undergo an anterior-to-posteriorly progressive transition from expression of CT to CE as they involute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). Thus we demonstrate that CT acts outside the blastopore, in parallel with CE acting inside the blastopore, to generate forces driving blastopore closure and the internalization of the presumptive mesodermal and endodermal tissues. We show that the underlying mechanism driving CT is distinct from that driving CE. Lastly, we summarize a working model for the mechanism of CT and its integration with CE and other morphogenic movements in <italic>Xenopus</italic>.</p><p>CT represents a novel but likely common mechanism of using isotropic change in IFT to generate tensile force, which within the geometric context of the tissue, results in oriented tension, producing polarized, anisotropic tissue movements.

This is due to the mechanical linkage of laggard NIMZ with the more rapidly converging IMZ. Second, the superficial epithelial layer that initially covers the deep regions of double IMZs retracts to a small area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, pointers; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>*), which leaves most of the deep region uncovered, a behavior associated with CT of the IMZ (see below) but one that does not occur in the double NIMZs.

A slower convergence phase followed, which correlated with the continuing, slower thickening of the Double IMZ explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, G + 3 h onward). In contrast, Double NIMZ explants showed only slow mediolateral convergence, and did not thicken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), but it did slowly elongate orthogonally within the horizontal plane, that is along the initially shorter animal-vegetal axis, making the explant more circular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). We interpret this gradual circularization of the NIMZ as the general tendency for isolated tissue to round up, coupled with the cell behaviors underlying epiboly causing the tissue to remain thin. Neither the Double IMZ nor NIMZ explants showed apparent differences in convergence or thickening in the animal vs. vegetal edges within the tissue, illustrating that CT does not show the patterned anterior-to-posterior progression characteristic of CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lane and Keller, 1997</xref>).

We use ‘affinity’ here in the broader, Holtfreterian sense of dynamic, regulated cell-cell contact behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holtfreter, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Townes and Holtfreter, 1955</xref>), rather than in the Steinbergian sense of adhesive competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Steinberg, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Steinberg, 1970</xref>). As a measure of deep-superficial tissue affinity, we assayed the spreading ability of the epithelial layer by culturing it on explants of contiguous deep IMZ and NIMZ beginning at Stage 8.5–9 (G-3 to –2h) embryos, on a fibronectin (FN) substrate, whiandch stabilizes the explant. A strip of epithelial tissue was placed medially, deep side down, across the entire animal-vegetal extent of the explant, spanning the IMZ-NIMZ boundary, and covered with a cover-glass to promote attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). After attachment, the cover-glass was removed, and the behavior of the strip over the lower (vegetal) IMZ, the upper (animal) IMZ, and the NIMZ regions was recorded over time (regions indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Beginning around Stage 10-, the epithelial tissue lying over the lower deep IMZ began to retract and/or self-adhere (basal to basal; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Luu et al., 2011</xref>), reducing its contact area, whereas the epithelium over the deep AC-NIMZ region remained stable or spread further over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>*). High resolution movies suggest that epithelium over the upper deep IMZ also reduces its area (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>*), but in most cases there is so much movement of the adjacent, visible deep cells, it is difficult to reliably determine exactly where the interface between the deep upper IMZ and NIMZ regions lies, so these results were not included in our analysis. FN attachment stabilizes the explant such that it does not roll over once the cover glass is removed. Although FN could alter the character of the opposite, assay side of the deep tissues and generate artifacts, the same results were obtained when we cultured explants on Poly-D-lysine coated substrates (data not shown). Notably, transplanted epithelium over deep ectoderm does not spread until Stage 10- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>); the same is true of endogenous epithelium adjacent to naked deep ectoderm (DRS, personal observations).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Epithelial affinity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Explants of deep IMZ plus NIMZ tissue were made prior to the onset of gastrulation and stabilized by adhering them to fibronectin-coated cover glass below the explant; strips of AC epithelium large enough to span the entire animal-vegetal extent of the deep tissue were subsequently grafted onto its surface and kept in place with cover glass above the explant. (<bold>B</bold>) In the examples shown (lower IMZ below magenta dashed line, upper IMZ between magenta and green, NIMZ &amp; AC above green dashed line; boundaries between the three regions identified by cell, motility, size and gray cast), the movie (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>*, where these events can be most easily seen) begins 10 min prior to the onset of gastrulation (G-10m). The epithelium adhered and spread over all regions (G + 20 m), after which the upper cover glass was removed. Immediately afterward, epithelium over both NIMZ and IMZ regions contracted slightly, then that over the NIMZ re-spread, while that over the IMZ contracted more strongly and continuously, often to the point of becoming detached from the deep tissue, and in many cases retracted from the lower (vegetal) edge of the deep tissue (G + 2 h). Tissue over the IMZ remained contracted, while that over the NIMZ tended to spread (G + 4.5 h). (<bold>C</bold>) The relative area of spreading or contraction of the epithelial tissue over different deep tissue regions over time was quantitated, beginning after cover glass removal (each time point based on measures from 2 to 8 explants at sequential time points; error bars = SEM). (<bold>D</bold>) In a variation on this assay, explants of deep ventral IMZ plus NIMZ tissue were cultured on BSA coated cover glass (below) and patches of epithelium were lapped across the NIMZ/IMZ boundary and held apposed to the deep tissue with an agarose coated cover glass (above) throughout the experiment. In the example (<bold>E</bold>), the epithelium initially over the deep IMZ (below green line) first contracts animally (G + 2 h), eventually retracting across the boundary (G + 4 h), then respreads on the deep NIMZ (G + 6 h) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>*, where these events can be most easily seen). During this time, upper deep IMZ cells (mesoderm) spread over deep NIMZ cells (ectoderm), such that the NIMZ/IMZ boundary on the surface of the deep tissue is shifted from its original position (dashed orange line). The deep NIMZ/IMZ boundary is based on differential cell size and motility, which are evident in the movie.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig4sdata1"><label>Figure 4—source data 1.</label><caption><title><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> source data: area of epithelia ove IMZ and NIMZ vs. time.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57642-fig4-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57642-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><media id="video11" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57642-video11.mp4"><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>Epithelial spreading/contraction assay.</title><p>Movie from which <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> was made.

To prevent the explant from rolling and to hold the epithelium against the deep tissue, while allowing the cells on the upper surface of the explant to rearrange, a thin layer of agarose and a coverslip were lightly pressed against the explant throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Under these conditions, the epithelium contracted and retreated from the surface of the deep IMZ onto the surface of the deep NIMZ, where it re-spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>); note that the deep cells of the IMZ spread upward and over the deep NIMZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), such that they appear to follow or push the epithelium as it retreats animally, a behavior more easily appreciated in the time lapse recording (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>*). Comparing the G + 1 h to the G + 6 h stills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), you can see that the epithelium has actually moved significantly with respect to the initial boundary, which it overlapped. Looked at another way, the deep mesodermal cells compete with the epithelial cells for adhesion to the deep ectoderm. One notable difference between the two variants of this experiment is that the uncovered epithelium is free to self-adhere basally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), whereas when under glass, the basal surface remains pressed against the deep tissue, thus allowing for re-spreading on the NIMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>).</p><media id="video12" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57642-video12.mp4"><label>Video 12.</label><caption><title>Epithelial retreat and respreading.</title><p>Movie from which <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> was made.

The changes in spreading or contraction behavior occur regardless of the region of the embryo from which the epithelium was taken (e.g. AC/NIMZ vs. IMZ superficial epithelium), which strongly suggests that it is the deep IMZ tissue that lowers its affinity for the overlying epithelium around the beginning of gastrulation (Stage 10, G0), rather than the epithelium changing its affinity for the deep IMZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Interfacial tension and tissue surface tension in the IMZ increase during CT</title><p>Tissues, like other types of soft matter, can be characterized by material properties such as tissue surface tension (TST), which is a measure of the cohesion of liquid-like tissues. In physical terms, TST is represented by a surface energy per unit area, which acts to minimize the tissue–medium interface. A classic example of TST is demonstrated when tissue explants with initially irregular shapes ‘round-up’ over time until they are transformed into spherical aggregates. Similarly, the interfacial tension (IFT) acts to minimize the interface area between two non-intermixing tissues. Our results show that in contrast to the NIMZ, the IMZ develops an increasing tendency to round up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and a reduced affinity for superficial epithelial layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This supports the hypothesis that CT is the result of an increase in the IFT between the deep IMZ and its overlying epithelium, associated with the decrease in affinity between the two. Such an increased IFT could drive the observed convergence and thickening of tissue explants and force generation along the long (mediolateral) axis as the deep and superficial layers tend to minimize their interfacial surface area (see Discussion).</p><p>To test the idea that IFT increases around G0 we used a parallel plate compression device (the MicroSquisher; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, Materials and methods for details). We first tested a range of compressive strains on explants of deep mesodermal or ectodermal tissue wrapped in large pieces of superficial epithelium. The final configuration of such explants resembled a ‘wonton’ (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and were thus called wonton explants (see Materials and methods). An excess of epithelium ensured that pseudo-elastic stretching of this layer did not contribute to tensions at the wonton surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Luu et al., 2011</xref>), such that only the IFT of the deep tissue affects the overall shape of the wonton. Sandwiches of AC tissue (superficial and deep presumptive ectoderm) behave indistinguishably from wonton explants containing deep AC tissue and are much easier to make at the desired stage, so were also used to test IFT; the epithelial surface of the AC sandwich explants completely healed over the deep tissue by Stage 10. Strains of 10–30% gave consistent results at a given strain, but we found that for explants of AC tissue, IFT increased suddenly above a strain of 22%, and a similar increase was seen for IMZ explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), suggesting solid-like behavior at high strains. Strains of 18–22% were therefore used in our experiments. We saw increasing IFT of IMZ wonton explants beginning between Stages 9.5 and 10 (G-1h to G0), nearly doubling by G + 1.5 h, but no increase in AC sandwich or wonton explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tissue surface tension and interfacial tension rise in association with the onset of CT.</title><p>Aggregates of deep tissue wrapped in excess superficial epithelium (‘wontons’), (<bold>A</bold>), were used to measure the IFT between DIMZ (Mesoderm) or AC (Ectoderm) deep tissue and epithelium (<bold>C</bold>), assayed by parallel plate compression (using a MicroSquisher; see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We tested the first possibility and found that the TST of mesodermal deep tissue aggregates (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, left) remained low until after Stage 10, when it increased more than twofold, while the TST of ectodermal deep tissue aggregates remained low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, the simplest explanation consistent with our data is that the self-affinity of the deep IMZ cells, and hence TST, increases, which in the absence of other changes results in an increased IFT and a decreased spreading of the epithelial layer, whereas the low IFT of the deep ectoderm with respect to the epithelium allows epithelial spreading.</p><p>We also measured the TST and IFT of IMZ explants using a modified ‘Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis’ (ADSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Luu et al., 2011</xref>). The drop-shape of a cell aggregate at equilibrium (the degree to which it is flattened) represents a balance of forces between TST or IFT and gravity (1 g). Because the specific density of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> gastrula tissue is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2009</xref>), surface tension can be calculated by the Young–Laplace equation using the radii of aggregate curvature, which reflect the pressure difference over an interface between two fluids (See Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">David et al., 2009</xref>). The higher the surface tension, the ‘rounder’ a drop-shaped cell aggregate will appear at equilibrium. To use this approach to measure the IFT between deep IMZ and its epithelial layer, we made wontons with deep IMZ tissue aggregates from fluorescently labeled embryos and wrapped them in unlabeled superficial epithelium. Wonton explants were allowed to come to equilibrium for a minimum of two hours at 1 g (e.g. <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>), fixed at specific times, bisected across the longer axis, and images parallel to the cut-face were collected using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) of the two halves, thereby revealing the ‘drop shape’ of the deep tissue filling within its epithelial wrapper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As in the parallel plate compression tests, control wonton explants, filled with ectodermal (animal cap, AC) deep tissue, did not increase their IFT with respect to the epithelium during gastrulation, whereas wontons filled with deep DIMZ increased their IFT from levels similar to those seen in AC controls prior to the onset of gastrulation, to roughly fourfold higher than the AC controls over the first two hours of gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). We also measured TST from time lapse movies of deep cell aggregates of dorsal and ventral IMZ (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Video 14</xref>) using ADSA; these showed little change in TST until about Stage 10 (G0), at which point both began to increase through Stage 10.5 (G + 2 h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), when the DIMZ tissue plateaued, consistent with the onset of a transition to CE.</p><media id="video13" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57642-video13.mp4"><label>Video 13.</label><caption><title>Wontons rounding up, viewed from the side, parallel to their long axis; out of focus top-down view below.</title><p>Wontons contain DMZ deep tissue on the left, AC deep tissue on the right.

We therefore consider our parallel plate compression TST and IFT measurements to better reflect the state of these tissues in the embryo. A possible explanation for differences in our ADSA measures with prior measures is that our culture media (DFA) was different than used in previous studies (MBS). DFA has a higher specific gravity than MBS, by about 0.7% and has about a 9% higher osmolarity than MBS, which could affect TST measurements of deep cell aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Krens et al., 2017</xref>), and possibly IFT measurements of wontons, although the epithelium heals around them to form a barrier against diffusion such that their interstitial environment should reflect in vivo conditions, but neither of these differences in media appear to be large enough to account for the observed difference in surface tension measures. Notably, however, both our parallel plate and ADSA measurements showed similar increases in IFT and TST of mesodermal tissues around the onset of gastrulation.</p><p>Together, these results indicate an increase in the TST of deep IMZ tissue during CT, consistent with increased cell–cell affinity within the deep mesoderm. Importantly, the increase in IFT between the deep and superficial epithelial tissues in the IMZ was not seen in the IFT between the deep and superficial tissues of the ectoderm (i.e. animal cap). Moreover, the fact that ectodermal epithelium did not spread over deep ectoderm of the NIMZ prior to G-1h, but did by G0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; Shook, unpublished observations), suggests that affinity between these tissues increases between these times. The increase of IFT between deep and epithelial IMZ would be expected to cause an annular (ring-shaped) IMZ to decrease its surface area, that is to converge and thicken.</p><p>The rounding and decrease in deep IMZ tissue surface area in explants, and its decreased support for epithelial spreading, predict that the epithelium might also decrease its basal surface area of interaction with the deep region. With constant cell volume, this decrease in the basal surface area of initially rectangular epithelial cells should translate to an increase in cell height, as previously shown when epithelium is allowed to relax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Luu et al., 2011</xref>), and change the overall shape of cells to that of a cuboidal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To test this, we measured the heights of IMZ epithelial cells in whole embryos as a control, and in sandwich explants between the onset of gastrulation and the onset of CE. Explant epithelial cell heights were initially not significantly different from those in intact embryos (<italic>P</italic> = 0.18, for both dorsal and ventral, n = 3 or 4), confirming that the explant procedure did not alter cell height. However, explant epithelial cells subsequently thinned by 5–10%, rather than thickening, while whole embryo epithelial cells thinned by 25–30%, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggest that the expected epithelial ‘slack’ in explants is taken up by some other mechanism. Possible explanations are that the apically contracting bottle cells (which we did not measure) are anchored to the vegetal endoderm and stretch the IMZ epithelium vegetally as they contract in vivo (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardin and Keller, 1988</xref>) and/or that epithelial spreading (wound healing) around the uncovered animal and lateral edges may exert tension on the rest of the epithelium, preventing it from thickening in explants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CT generates thickening force</title><p>The convergence force of CT measured previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>) should be accompanied by a thickening force of the same magnitude. Therefore, sandwich explants and wontons of IMZ, NIMZ, and AC were tested in the MicroSquisher for thickening forces (see Materials and methods) immediately after release from the compression applied during healing. We initially applied a light compressive force (0.2–0.3μN) to ensure good contact between the platen and the top of the explant, then measured probe tip displacement without changing the position of the probe base. As the tissue undergoes rounding and thickening (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref>), force is exerted on the platen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

In most cases, explants showed stress-relaxation as expected of a visco-elastic material, then plateaued for some time before pushing back with increasing force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). On average, this began at G-41m (G-0.7h, Stage 10-; n = 7, SEM = 1.1 min). In one exceptional case, the explant pushed back almost immediately but then increased its rate of force increase at G-0.7h. The average increase in force from the initial, applied force, or from the force at the onset of increased <italic>rate</italic> of increase at g-0.7h in the exceptional case, was 0.48 μN (n = 5, SEM = 0.11). AC sandwiches instead began to <italic>decrease</italic> the push-back force at G-0.7h (n = 4) (data not shown), perhaps associated with the onset of rapid radial intercalation driving epiboly around this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Keller, 1980</xref>), during which deep ectodermal cells actively migrate toward the superficial epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Szabó et al., 2016</xref>), causing the deep tissue to spread and thin. Note that epiboly as whole begins well before stage 10-; the mechanism driving early epiboly is unknown. The increase in the IFT between deep mesoderm and its overlying epithelium in the IMZ, the corresponding increase in thickening force by the mesoderm, the lack of increase in the IFT between deep ectoderm and its epithelium in the NIMZ and AC regions and the decrease in thickening force by ectoderm at Stage 10- are additional characteristics associated with the onset of CT (see Discussion).</p><p>The convergence and thickening force that the measured IFT could theoretically generate is in close agreement with our previously measured convergence forces (here and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>) and the thickening forces measured here.

Thus, the IFT could be responsible for generating the measured convergence forces during CT.</p><p>Our analysis of force generation in terms of surface tension and contour length raises the question of the affinity between deep mesoderm and the adjacent deep ectoderm at the Limit of Involution (LI). In both normal and ventralized whole embryos, this interface was reduced progressively as the circumference of the LI decreased to that of the closed blastopore, whereas in sandwich explants, the interface began to become obviously more constricted by the onset of CE (e.g. Stage 10.5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), or by G + 3.5 h in ventralized giants (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>*, ~ 1/3 of the way through). In the case of normal explants, this result can be explained by the CE of both neural and mesodermal tissues. In ventralized explants, these results suggest that the self-affinity of ectodermal and mesodermal tissues exceeds that for each other, with an IFT high enough to drive their separation. However, in explants of deep ventral IMZ +NIMZ (VMZ) under cover glass (Materials and methods), cells from the deep IMZ engulf the deep NIMZ tissue, migrating around the sides of it, and to a lesser extent, over its face, throughout gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>, VMZ; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Video 16</xref>*, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Video 17</xref>*). This would be expected if deep mesoderm had a lower TST than deep ectoderm, but our data indicate this is not the case. Apparently, other mechanisms modulate the interaction of these two tissues. One possibility is that at the LI the affinity of the IMZ for the NIMZ is held in check by the attached epithelium.</p><media id="video16" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57642-video16.mp4"><label>Video 16.</label><caption><title>Naked ventral IMZ showing engulfment.</title><p>Stages 10.25 through 14 (G + 1h to 7.25h).

However, immunohistochemistry showed that C-cadherin and actin expression were similar across all types of cell junctions (deep-deep, superficial-superficial, deep-superficial) at both Stage 9–9.5 and Stage 10; pMLC expression was more mosaic, but, on average, also similar across all junctions at both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-D</xref>).

Our result that the rate of convergence of the IMZ in unconstrained giant sandwich explants remains constant before and after Stage 10- supports the idea that it is the affinity between superficial and deep, rather than any change in deep cell motility, at least with respect to other deep cells, that is responsible for the increased force production by the IMZ.

This classic paper was the intellectual and experimental inspiration for the present study. Here we characterize CT as the isotropic, symmetrically acting, force-generating morphogenic machine that can close the blastopore without CE. Our findings here establish CT as a bona fide morphogenic movement, distinct from CE, that functions in blastopore closure.

Prior to the onset of gastrulation (top row), vegetal rotation (VR) (Sagittal Sections, gray arrows) has not yet occurred and the IMZ annulus (3rd column) remains stable, as does the IMZ explant (4<sup>th</sup> column), due to a stable deep-epithelial cell affinity (far right). With the onset of gastrulation and CT (2<sup>nd</sup> row), apical constriction of the lower IMZ epithelium (bottle cell formation – Sagittal Sections, dark green), VR, involution and invagination begin (Sagittal Sections, black arrows). Co-incident with bottle cell formation, the deep mesodermal tissue begins to lose its affinity with the overlying epithelium. During early gastrulation both tissue surface tension of the IMZ as a whole and its interfacial tension with an epithelium increase, resulting in a tendency for the IMZ to minimize its surface area by converging and thickening (2<sup>nd</sup> row, far right). This loss of affinity at the interface of deep and epithelial tissue (2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> rows, shown by white spaces between epithelial and deep, at black arrowhead pointers) increases the IFT between deep and superficial layers, resulting in both convergence and thickening of the IMZ of the explants (CT, second row, bulge in DMZ explant). Increased IFT would have a <italic>tendency</italic> to thicken and decrease the circumference of the IMZ annulus in embryos (3<sup>rd</sup> column, 2<sup>nd</sup> row) were it not resisted by adjacent tissue, so instead generates a pre-involution tensile force around the blastopore and converges, but does not thicken (not shown). In explants, the weak affinity of the IMZ epithelium to the underlying deep region results in its retraction, initially from the leading edge mesoderm (not shown), whereas in the intact embryo, the IMZ epithelium is tightly attached at its vegetal edge to the forming bottle cells, which in turn are tightly attached to the adjacent vegetal endodermal tissues. Thus the IMZ epithelium is pulled along with the bottle cells as they move inside the blastopore (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> column). During early involution, as the lower edge of the IMZ involutes, it transitions from expressing CT to expressing directed migration (2<sup>nd</sup> column, 2<sup>nd</sup> row), and during later involution, the upper IMZ transitions to expressing CE (2<sup>nd</sup> column, 3<sup>rd</sup> row). In the case of CE, this transition is accompanied by regaining a high deep-epithelial affinity (loss of white space, on involution, 2<sup>nd</sup> column, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> rows). In explants, the later transition from CT to CE first occurs in tissue laying dorsally at the vegetal edge of the upper IMZ, and continues in an anterior to posterior progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shih and Keller, 1992a</xref>). The snout of tissue extending from the thickened collar of mesoderm in the explant reflects the onset of CE and is coincident with the progressive return of the affinity between the deep cells and the bottle cell epithelium (3<sup>rd</sup> row, 4<sup>th</sup> column). In the meantime, VR (black arrows, 1<sup>st</sup> column, 2<sup>nd</sup> row) has moved the vegetal endoderm inward at the onset of gastrulation such that convergence force generated by CT cooperates with VR to move the IMZ vegetally and push the vegetal endoderm inside (compare to 1<sup>st</sup> column, 1<sup>st</sup> row). VR, CT and CE also cooperate to stretch the ectodermal (NIMZ-AC) region by pulling it vegetally (1<sup>st</sup> column, 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> rows). When CE begins at Stage 10.5, it has been positioned by the actions of CT and VR such that it further moves the IMZ vegetally and pushes the vegetal endoderm inside (4<sup>th</sup> row, right, red arrow), in contrast to converging in its initially more equatorial position, where it would tend to push the vegetal endoderm out, rather than in (4<sup>th</sup> row, left, red arrow).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57642-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our key observations are that the ‘convergent thickening’ initially described as a slight thickening dorsally prior to radial intercalation and a thickening associated with involution ventrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>) is, in fact, a major, independent morphogenic movement: (1) it begins earlier and thickens more than previously observed, and occurs uniformly throughout the entire pre-involution IMZ, throughout gastrulation (See <italic>Onset of CT</italic> section, below), until progressively transitioning to other cell behaviors during involution (See <italic>Transition from CT to CE</italic> section, below); (2) it acts only prior to involution and in parallel with CE, which acts only post-involution (see <italic>Model</italic> section, below); (3) it can act independently of CE to close the blastopore (See <italic>Onset of CT</italic>, <italic>Transition from CT to CE</italic> and <italic>Evolutionary conservation of CT</italic> sections, below); (4) it is driven by forces resulting from increased interfacial tissue surface tension (see <italic>Tissue surface and interfacial tensions as force generating mechanisms</italic> section, below); (5) it depends on different molecular mechanisms than those required for CE (see <italic>Transition from CT to CE</italic> section, below).</p><p>Our characterization of CT also raises issues about the systems mechanics of the multiple morphogenic machines that contribute to blastopore closure.

TST is generated by the tendency in a cell aggregate to minimize the free energy by maximizing the adhesive interactions of its cells, thereby minimizing the surface area of the tissue and compacting it into a sphere, and by the tendency among cells with different affinities to form adhesive interactions with similar cells, and so self-segregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Holtfreter, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Townes and Holtfreter, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Steinberg, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Steinberg and Poole, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Steinberg and Takeichi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Forgacs et al., 1998</xref>). In this sense, tissues mimic the behavior of fluids, with a few important differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris, 1976</xref>). In particular, tissue fluidity requires active cell motility in order for cells to rearrange themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong, 1989</xref>). Moreover, TST is also determined by cellular cortical tension, in addition to the kind and number of adhesion proteins cells express (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodland, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Manning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amack and Manning, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Maitre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Winklbauer, 2015</xref>), and by Eph/ephrin regulation of cell contact affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rohani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canty et al., 2017</xref>). These concepts successfully explain the observed segregation of unlike cells, aggregation of like cells, and the rounding up of irregularly shaped cell aggregates in vitro.</p><p>The question is whether these concepts can also be meaningfully applied to the morphogenesis of tissues with more complex shapes in the developing embryo. Morphogenic movements are often produced by polarized, anisotropic cellular processes, which notably evolved in the context of tissue affinity and the resultant TSTs and IFTs that may work against them (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Winklbauer and Parent, 2017</xref>). In contrast, the significance of our findings lies in the fact that changing the IFT within the context of a particular geometry, an annulus (the IMZ) laying below the equator of a sphere in the intact embryo, results in tissues within the IMZ minimizing the contact area between them, an intrinsically isotropic process that generates oriented, directional forces to a morphogenic movement. In this case, the surface minimization of the deep IMZ generates a circumferential convergence force squeezing the annulus closed, and being below the equator, pushing itself toward the bottom of the sphere, thereby pulling the attached ectodermal tissue down over the sphere (see <italic>Model</italic> section, below).</p><p>Our measurements show that the IFT of IMZ tissue increases from the onset of gastrulation while that of NIMZ tissue remains low. The observed decrease in affinity between epithelia and deep IMZ are also consistent with an increase in IFT in the IMZ, but not in the NIMZ, and with the hypothesis that CT is driven by increased IFT in the IMZ, starting at Stage 10-. In the annular IMZ of the whole embryo, increased IMZ IFT would shorten the circumferential dimension of the IMZ, generating a tensile preload force until balanced by the reaction force of adjacent tissues (see <italic>Model</italic> section, below). Forces from other sources, such as adhesion to extracellular matrix or active cell movement may also counteract IFT or modify its effect. The simplest explanation for the increase of IFT consistent with our data is that the deep mesoderm increases its TST, while that of the epithelium’s inner surface does not adapt accordingly (see also <italic>Onset of CT</italic> section, below).</p><p>Our results support the idea that changes in tissue surface tension can generate enough morphogenic force to drive the movements observed in the embryo. This does not rule out the possibility that some other mechanism may be involved in generating a portion of the observed convergence force during the first two hours of gastrulation. One possibility is that the deep cells are engaged in a different, or additional type of motility, associated with the convergence required for involution (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Evren et al., 2014</xref>). Additional sources of tension generation could come from the epithelium, for example by its contraction. Although polarized behaviors cannot be eliminated, they would have to be relatively insensitive to PCP perturbation. Additionally, live time-lapse imaging of deep cells prior to the onset of MIB shows no polarized activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shih and Keller, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pfister et al., 2016</xref>). Our results emphasize the importance of mechanical context in morphogenic function. They suggest that unoriented, unpolarized processes, perhaps arising from changes in general properties such as tissue affinity and tissue surface or interfacial tensions, expressed in specific geometries and mechanical contexts, may result in directional and polarized morphogenetic forces more commonly than has been appreciated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Onset of CT</title><p>Tissue movements, biomechanical properties and force generation related to CT that we can measure with good temporal resolution appear to begin at Stage 10- (G-0.7h) and others are consistent with this timing. Prior to Stage 10-, both IMZ and NIMZ regions of sandwich explants converge at about the same rate; thereafter the NIMZ slows its convergence. Prior to Stage 10-, endogenous or transplanted epithelium remain relatively static on both IMZ and NIMZ regions; after Stage 10-, epithelium covering the IMZ begins to contract, while that covering the NIMZ spreads. These changes in the IMZ are correlated with an increase in IFT between its deep and superficial layers at Stage 10-, although the observed increase in TST is somewhat delayed. Force generation by IMZ tissue, as assayed by the ability to exert an increase in thickening force, also consistently begins at Stage 10-, whereas this force begins to decline in NIMZ tissue. Together with earlier observations that dorsal bottle cell formation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hardin and Keller, 1988</xref>), dorsal leading edge mesoderm internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nieuwkoop and Florshutz, 1950</xref>) and the rapid, active radial intercalation associated with epiboly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Szabó et al., 2016</xref>) each begin at or around Stage 10-, our results suggest that that a common developmental switch is triggered at Stage 10-. Thus, although many of these changes, clearly expressed in explants, remain largely cryptic in intact embryos, Stage 10- (G-0.7h) marks the true onset of behaviors associated with gastrulation movements. We envision this ‘switch’ as a single signal or a set of related signals, but these changes could result from unrelated signals with a common timing mechanism.</p><p>The onset of CT at Stage 10- appears linked to the activation of the basal mesodermal program by maternal VegT and subsequent Nodal signaling, via phospho-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kofron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kavka and Green, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Xanthos et al., 2002</xref>), since it does not occur in embryos treated with the small molecule inhibitor sb-505124 (Shook, personal observation) and the inhibition of Nodal expression by pharmacological or genetic means blocks both blastopore formation and all subsequent gastrulation movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Horb and Thomsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kofron et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Luxardi et al., 2010</xref>). CT is independent of Spemann’s Organizer and the downstream dorsal patterning pathways responsible for turning on CE, since it still occurs in ventralized embryos. From its expression in the IMZ and role in mesoderm specification, Brachyury is an obvious candidate for regulation of CT and repressing its transcriptional targets causes an apparent delay in blastopore closure by Stage 10.5, but does not block blastopore closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conlon et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that other transcription factors are also likely to play a role (e.g. zygotic VegT /antipodean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Stennard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Stennard et al., 1999</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kavka and Green, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fukuda et al., 2010</xref>], derriere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Sun et al., 1999</xref>]; eomesodermin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>]). Our results suggest that the most obvious way to screen for candidate genes involved in CT would be to screen them by looking for failed or delayed blastopore closure in ventralized embryos.</p><p>CT is a force producing morphogenic movement that alone accounts for the early forces produced by the marginal zone prior to the onset of CE at Stage 10.5, and can act alone, without CE, to produce the forces within the IMZ that close the blastopore in ventralized embryos. Convergence forces measure up to 2 μN in ventralized giant explants, similar to those measured in standard giants during normal gastrulation that result from the combined expression of CT and CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>), although the latter may reflect the limitations of the measurement. CT is a pre-involution process, consistent with the largely isotropic convergence movements of the pre-involution IMZ throughout gastrulation in the embryo, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>), and is observed throughout the portion of the IMZ in explants that has not yet transitioned to CE movements, and throughout the pre-involution IMZ of ventralized explants for several hours after the onset of gastrulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Whereas CT thickens the IMZ in explants, this does not occur in the intact embryo (See <italic>Model</italic> section).</p><p>Our results show that force generation by CT results from increased IFT between the deep and superficial epithelial layers of the IMZ as a result of the decreased affinity between them but the mechanism underlying the decrease in affinity is not yet clear. Loss of affinity in tissue recombination assays between mesodermal deep cells and epithelia occurs regardless of epithelial origin (animal cap, NIMZ or IMZ), suggesting that the change in affinity is a change on the part of the IMZ deep cells with respect to the superficial epithelium. Deep IMZ cells begin to gain a basal level of motility once the cell cycle is extended at the mid-blastula transition (MBT; Stage 8.5, G-3h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Satoh et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kimelman et al., 1987</xref>). We were unable to discern any changes between Stages 9 and 10 in cell motility, and prior time-lapse imaging of explants shows only similarly un-polarized cell behavior in the IMZ until the onset of CE and its characteristic, polarized cell behavior, MIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shih and Keller, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wallingford et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kim and Davidson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Pfister et al., 2016</xref>). Together with the equal convergence of the IMZ that we observed in unconstrained giant sandwich explants before and after Stage 10-, these results suggest that a change in deep cell motility with respect to other deep cells does not explain the increase in IFT between superficial and deep.</p><p>We also saw no change in C-cadherin, cortical actin or pMLC expression levels at the deep cell-superficial cell interface or elsewhere within the IMZ, suggesting that changes in expression levels of these molecules are likewise not responsible for the changing affinity and that some other mechanism regulating superficial-deep cell affinity must be in play. Cell affinity may be dependent on cadherin activity level at the cell surface, which can be modulated in a number of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gumbiner, 2005</xref>) including the rate of endocytic turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ogata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Wirtz-Peitz and Zallen, 2009</xref>). Cell affinity can also be controlled by Eph receptor-ephrin ligand signaling, for example during tissue boundary formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fagotto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Winklbauer and Parent, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fagotto, 2020</xref>). The decrease of EphB1 and increase of ephrinB2 and B3 around the early gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Rohani et al., 2014</xref>) could be well suited to modulate epithelial-deep cell attachment.</p><p>Eph receptor-ephrin ligand signaling generally controls cell interactions at interfaces and could in principle also be responsible for minimizing the interface between IMZ and NIMZ, which dramatically decreases during gastrulation. It is not clear whether increased IFT between deep mesodermal and ectodermal tissues plays a role here, or why un-involuted deep mesoderm migrates over deep ectoderm in explants (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Videos 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">17</xref>) but does not in intact embryos. One possibility is that the deep ectoderm simply out competes the deep mesoderm for attachment to the ectodermal epithelium, as a result of active migration of the deep ectoderm toward the superficial layer associated with epiboly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Szabó et al., 2016</xref>). Fibrillar FN basal to the deep ectodermal tissue also plays a role in active radial intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Marsden and DeSimone, 2001</xref>). Deep pre-involution mesodermal tissue does not share this tendency to actively migrate toward the epithelium, and apparently does not interpret cues from basal FN in the same way that ectoderm does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kwan and Kirschner, 2003</xref>), as illustrated in our giant sandwich explants by the thickened collar region of the pre-involution IMZ abutted to the much thinner posterior NIMZ.</p><p>Our conclusions apply most generally to the upper (animal) end of the IMZ containing the presumptive chordal and parachordal (paraxial) mesoderm, tissues that undergo a transition to CE after CT. We only poorly understand the role of the more vegetal, leading edge mesoderm (presumptive head, heart, ventrolateral mesoderm) in CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A1,B,C</xref>). The leading edge mesoderm transitions from CT to expressing directed, collective migration after involution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Winklbauer and Nagel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Weber et al., 2012</xref>). This transition occurs early dorsally, beginning at Stage 10- with the onset of internal involution of the leading edge mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nieuwkoop and Florshutz, 1950</xref>) and with the onset of bottle cell formation within the epithelium that initially over-lies this mesoderm and the apparent loss of affinity between the two. By Stage 10 the leading edge mesodermal cells have involuted in association with VR movements, coming into apposition with the blastocoel roof by Stage 10+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Winklbauer and Schurfeld, 1999</xref>), by which time they are able to begin migrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lee et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Ramos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidson et al., 2002</xref>). These movements and the transition occur progressively later laterally and ventrally. Because the leading edge mesoderm is more challenging to work within the context of our experiments, we did not test it as extensively and it was largely removed from explants used for TST and IFT measurements. However, the leading edge mesoderm shows a clear early drop in affinity with the bottle cell-forming epithelium, suggesting that it generates force by CT.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transition from CT to CE</title><p>The timing and geometry of CT force generation and movements <italic>in explants</italic> shows that the cell behavior driving CT in the pre-involution region of the IMZ transitions into post-involution behaviors with the same timing and pattern with which involution occurs <italic>in embryos</italic> (<italic>CT to CE transition</italic> in Results section). CE of the notochordal and somitic mesoderm is a highly anisotropic <italic>post-involution</italic> process in embryos and occurs with the same distinctive anisotropy directly out of the dorsal-vegetal (presumptive anterior) edge of the collar in explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Keller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Keller and Sutherland, 2020</xref>).</p><p>During involution, the cells previously participating in CT transition into mesendodermal migration, if they involute early, and into MIB (driving CE) if later. Although CT begins uniformly and continues isotropically around the entire <italic>pre-involution</italic> IMZ, the onset of mesendoderm migration and MIB are progressive from origins at the dorsal, vegetal (presumptive anterior) edge of the IMZ toward the ventral, vegetal (presumptive posterior) regions of the IMZ, and from these origins, toward the LI. Thus, the population of cells expressing CT progressively declines throughout gastrulation until involution is complete, around G + 7–8 h (Stage 14).</p><p>Note that although we show that CT occurs around their entire circumference of the pre-involution IMZ, the original interpretation of CT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref>) was that CT was primarily a ‘ventral’ morphogenic machine, since it occurred in sandwich explants the ventral quadrant whereas CE primarily occurred in explants of the dorsal quadrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since then however, it has become clearer that the presumptive somitic tissue, a dorsal tissue expressing CE, wraps all the way around the IMZ of the early gastrula (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) (see revised fate map’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Keller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wilson and Keller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Shih and Keller, 1992b</xref>), as do presumptive ventral tissues, such that presumptive dorsal and ventral tissues do not lie exclusively in the so-called ‘dorsal’ (organizer) and ‘ventral’ (opposite) sides of the embryo. This point was made most clearly in direct cell tracing and mapping studies by Connie Lane and associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lane and Smith, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lane and Sheets, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constance Lane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lane and Sheets, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lane and Sheets, 2006</xref>). Thus, to be clear, all presumptive dorsal tissues originating in the upper IMZ first express CT, then transition to CE as they involute. However, if the non-organizer, ventral half of the embryo is explanted at the onset of gastrulation, it never receives the signals from the organizer that pattern the presumptive dorsal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Robertis and Kuroda, 2004</xref>), explaining the result obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keller and Danilchik, 1988</xref> and the ensuing misconception.</p><p>CT is patterned independently of CE and does not depend on the subsequent expression of CE to close the blastopore, as shown by the fact that ventralized embryos express only CT and successfully close their blastopores, albeit in an abnormal (isotropic) way. That blocking the <italic>execution</italic> of CE by knocking down MHC IIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Rolo, 2007</xref>) or interfering with the PCP pathway (our data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ewald et al., 2004</xref>) will block blastopore closure in normal embryos, but not in ventralized embryos, emphasizes the independence of CT. Put another way, although blocking the upstream ‘dorsalization’ signal ultimately leads to failure of <italic>patterning expression</italic> of CE in ventralized embryos, it does not affect the ability of CT to close the blastopore because cells expressing CT never attempt to transition to CE and are left free to close the blastopore by an independent process. However, blocking molecules directly involved in the performance or execution of CE (PCP elements or MHC IIB, for example), but <italic>not</italic> its patterning, will block blastopore closure in normal embryos because cells expressing CT will transition to expressing CE; the cells no longer express CT and although CE is correctly patterned, the cells can not execute the motility required to drive CE.</p><p>It is important to understand that cells that undergo the transition from CT to CE can no longer express CT, regardless of whether or not CE is impaired. The transition associated with involution in normal embryos involves many changes in differentiated state, some of which must or are likely to preclude CT. CT requires a loss of affinity between deep and superficial tissues, raising their IFT and promoting a decrease in surface-to-volume ratio area of the deep tissue, but CE requires a decrease in IFT between superficial and deep tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ninomiya and Winklbauer, 2008</xref>), as CE tends to increase the surface area of the deep tissue. Thus CE and CT differ fundamentally with regard to their dependence on the IFT between deep and superficial layers. Other examples of this transition from one differentiated state to another include the loss of Brachyury expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Smith et al., 1991</xref>), which allows cell adhesion to FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kwan and Kirschner, 2003</xref>), also required for CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2006</xref>), as well as the increased endocytosis of C-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ogata et al., 2007</xref>), possibly facilitating a reduction in cadherin activity and thus deep mesodermal TST; reduced cadherin activity is also suggested to be important for effective CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zhong et al., 1999</xref>). Increased FN adhesion and reduced cadherin activity are both likely to interfere with CT. These changes in Brachyury expression and C-cadherin endocytosis are both independent of the PCP pathway.</p><p>On the other hand, PCP disruption may have some effect on CT, although evidently not enough to affect blastopore closure. In addition to its role in regulating MIB, the PCP pathway regulates another important transition in differentiated state, the acquisition of tissue separation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wacker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Medina et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Winklbauer and Luu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Luu et al., 2015</xref>). There is also evidence that at least in some tissues, the PCP pathway promotes cell-cell adhesion and increases TST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dzamba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Luu et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Model for CT and its integration with other morphogenic machines in <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation</title><p>Here we show how CT functions in gastrulation, and how it is integrated with other active morphogenic machines that facilitate, contribute to, or are essential for gastrulation (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> legend for details).</p><p>Prior to the onset of CT at Stage 10- (G-0.7h) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> row), the annulus of deep mesoderm in the IMZ has a stable, strong affinity for its overlying epithelium. At the onset of CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> row), the affinity of the deep tissue for the epithelium decreases, resulting in a zone of high IFT between them. The result is a tendency to constrict and thicken the collar of mesoderm, resulting in a convergence force around the embryo; in an isolated explant, where there is minimal resistance to convergence, it results in rapid CT forming the characteristic thickened ‘collar’ region, initially throughout the IMZ. The collar does not appear in vivo, however, because the mass of vegetal endoderm resists and slows convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, compare 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns to 3<sup>rd</sup> column) to a rate compatible with the transitions to post-involution behaviors that remove cells from the thickening IMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> columns) (see model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>) and with the continuing VR that aids in shrinking the vegetal aspect of the endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> column, compare 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> row). Thus, rather than thickening the IMZ in the embryo, CT instead continuously generates a tensile preloading force, ensuring that the IMZ converges as other tissues move out of the way.</p><p>CT works with at least four other morphogenic machines involved in blastopore closure, each of which play a role in setting up a ‘stable dynamic’ of balanced forces within the spherical geometry of the embryo that results in the IMZ moving down over the bottom the sphere, allowing it to reduce its circumference and converge over the VE while the ectoderm spreads over the vegetal hemisphere behind it. First, VR involves the active, autonomous upwelling of the central VE toward the blastocoel floor and contraction of its exterior surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Winklbauer and Schurfeld, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ibrahim and Winklbauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Wen and Winklbauer, 2017</xref>). This a) reduces the vegetal aspect of the VE, decreasing resistance to the convergence of the IMZ over it, b) draws the IMZ downward and c) positions more of the VE higher within the sphere of the embryo and with respect to the converging ring of the IMZ, such that IMZ convergence tends to push the VE further inward. Second, CE acts in parallel with CT, with CE generating hoop-stress around the inside of the blastopore while CT generates hoop-stress around the outside; the resulting convergence of the IMZ also draws the IMZ lower as it converges over the VE. Third, mesendoderm migration continues the movements begun by VR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huang and Winklbauer, 2018</xref>) and leader cells actively pull the leading edge mesoderm and vegetal endoderm up across the roof of the blastocoel, exerting tension on more distal mesodermal and endodermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Sonavane et al., 2017</xref>). This helps to move these tissues up into the embryo and away from the blastopore, and may explain why interfering with mesoderm migration can delay blastopore closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Klymkowsky et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Nagel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Weber et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, epiboly, a morphogenic movement that involves the thinning and spreading of the ectodermal animal cap region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Keller, 1980</xref>), also reduces resistance to movement of the IMZ vegetally and thus facilitates its convergence. Failure of epiboly can delay or block blastopore closure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rozario et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eagleson et al., 2015</xref>), whereas microsurgical removal of the animal cap region temporarily accelerates it, after which it returns to its normal rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Keller and Jansa, 1992</xref>); removal of the cap can also rescue blastopore closure blocked by failure of epiboly (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Rozario et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eagleson et al., 2015</xref>). Epiboly in turn appears to depend, either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beloussov et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chien et al., 2015</xref>) or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dzamba et al., 2009</xref>) on tension applied to the animal cap by the IMZ as it moves vegetally and by VR as it shrinks the vegetal aspect of the VE; this tension on the animal cap facilitates the active radial intercalation of the ectodermal deep cells toward (but not into) the superficial epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Keller, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Marsden and DeSimone, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Szabó et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Because CT is a preloading force exerting continuous compression on the large mass of vegetal endoderm, in the absence of the rotational effect of VR moving the relative position of the IMZ and the endoderm, CT would form a hoop of constriction too far animally and squeeze the vegetal endoderm outward (exogastrulation) rather than pushing it inward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, 4<sup>th</sup> row). Likewise, without CT, CE would begin too far animally, with similar results. Failure of CE, as opposed to the mere absence of dorsal tissues, can also result in a delay or failure of blastopore closure, as discussed above (Transition to CE). Thus, the integrated operation of VR, CT, CE and epiboly are required for blastopore closure to proceed normally. VR, CT and CE also all play a role in involution, which in turn is important for internalizing the supra-blastoporal endoderm and the presumptive mesoderm and moving it out of the way of the closing blastopore, but the mechanics involved are less well understood.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evolutionary conservation of CT and TST-based morphogenic machines</title><p>That CT alone can close the BP in ventralized embryos, coupled with evidence from other amphibians, suggests that the CT/CE partnership seen in <italic>Xenopus</italic> during gastrulation and neurulation may be found throughout the anurans, with CT as a conserved feature of anuran gastrulation and variation in timing of the transition from CT to CE (Shook, personal observations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Pino and Elinson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">del Pino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benítez and Del Pino, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Keller and Shook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Pino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elinson and del Pino, 2012</xref>). Because it is a simple mechanism based on physical properties, some variation of an annular, TST-based morphogenic machine may be a conserved mechanism among animals with a blastopore. In the best-studied case among amphibians, gastrulation in <italic>Gastrotheca rhiobambae</italic> involves symmetrical closure of the blastopore without any CE. Indeed, the development of a Spemann Organizer, dorsal tissues of notochordal and somitic mesoderm, and their CE are all delayed until after blastopore closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Pino and Elinson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elinson and del Pino, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">del Pino, 1996</xref>). More extensive analysis suggests that the mechanism of this closure is, in fact, CT (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Keller and Shook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Pino et al., 2007</xref>). Preliminary work on <italic>Eleutherodactylus coqui</italic>, (Shook – unpublished results), a direct developing anuran, as well as a number of other frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benítez and Del Pino, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Del Pino et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Pino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Moya et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Venegas-Ferrín et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elinson and del Pino, 2012</xref>) likewise suggest that several species within the superfamily Hyloidea delay the expression of CE until late gastrulation or early neurulation, relying on CT as the primary source of force within the IMZ driving blastopore closure. One consistent feature of species with a greater reliance on CT movements is that they take much longer to gastrulate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Keller and Shook, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Pino et al., 2007</xref>); in conjunction with our finding that ventralized embryos show a pronounced delay in involution, this suggests that CE my serve to accelerate gastrulation, by hastening involution. The variable use of CE in combination with CT during gastrulation among anuran species may reflect the great variation in reproductive strategy emblematic of this taxon and the consequent variation in selective pressures on their developmental strategies and egg architecture.</p><p>Although urodele (tailed) amphibians show convergence prior to the onset of subduction or convergent extension movements (Shook, unpublished observations and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Shook et al., 2002</xref>) it is not clear whether they have a mechanism comparable to the CT of anurans. Most urodeles have a largely single layered marginal zone, and thus if CT occurs, it would involve a single layer of epithelial cells. A model of how a sheet of epithelial cells could columnarize, and thereby ‘converge and thicken’ was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gustafson and Wolpert, 1967</xref>. In this model, lateral contact between cells would be promoted by increase in lateral affinity of the cells for one another and/or a loss of affinity for the basal substrate, for example fibronectin, and thereby lead to columnarization. Indeed, degradation of the basement membrane is an important step in EMT of primitive streak cells in Chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Nakaya and Sheng, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Nakaya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nakaya et al., 2013</xref>), and a similar mechanism may operate during ingression through the bilateral primitive streak of Urodeles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Shook et al., 2002</xref>). Embryonic superficial epithelia in <italic>Xenopus</italic> are generally under strain, as a result of both strain by external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chien et al., 2015</xref>) and their tendency to spread on the underlying deep cells; releasing this strain allows the epithelial cells to columnarize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Luu et al., 2011</xref>). A mechanism such as this, whereby the epithelium is released from external strain or it’s basal end is released from attachment to the underlying extracellular matrix, could be broadly applicable in driving morphogenesis via the convergence of epithelial sheets, for example by converging the single layered epithelium lying around the blastopore of an invertebrate to help close it, or converging cells within the epiblast of an amniote toward the primitive streak as a prelude to ingression through it. Alternatively, the autonomous tendency of the epithelial cells to columnarize could be increased. Understanding CT, and how versions of it may be used in other amphibians, and in other metazoans generally, is therefore likely to be important for understanding the evolution of gastrulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>That morphogenesis involves movements should have made it obvious from the beginning that evolution would harness physical mechanisms to drive these movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Newman and Comper, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Thompson and Bonner, 1992</xref>) a principle that inspired us to understand the mechanics of morphogenesis. TST is a mechanism that must be at work in all metazoan embryos, since their defining feature is cell-cell affinity, although where it acts as morphogenic machine and where it is a feature that must be overcome by some other morphogenic mechanism is another question, one that we look forward to learning the answer to.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pMLC 2 (Ser19)(Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #3,671RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_330248">AB_330248</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6B6(recognizes C-cadherin)(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://antibodyregistry.org/AB_528113">AB_528113</ext-link>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_528113">AB_528113</ext-link></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:300)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">phalloidin-Alexa 555</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Acti-stain, Cytoskelton.com)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8,953</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Derivatized fluorescent dextran (1:100 at 4 C, 12–36 hours)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MHC IIB morpholino</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Skoglund et al., 2008</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Morpholino5’CTTCCTGCCCTGGTCTCTGTGACAT3’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Xdd1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sokol, 1996</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">dnWnt11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Tada and Smith, 2000</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NIH Image 1.6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health;

A graphical illustration of sandwich explant construction and composition is provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with details in the legend. Sandwich explants are so-called because two of the regions shown, which include both deep and superficial epithelial layers, are sandwiched deep side to deep side, such that the superficial epithelium heals across the cut edges, making an epithelial seal around the entire explant, thereby avoiding healing artifacts in subsequent assays. Explants were in general held in place by placing a fragment of cover glass cut to size, with silicon grease on either end, over the explant and pressing gently such that the explant was stained to roughly +10–20% of its apparent area. In most cases, the cover glass was removed after healing.</p><p>Naked dorsal or ventral IMZ + NIMZ explants were made by peeling the superficial epithelium off the dorsal or ventral-most ~90° of the embryo at Stage 9–10, cutting the peeled sector out of the embryo, trimming away vegetal endoderm and some leading edge mesoderm from the vegetal edge of the IMZ, and pressing the remaining tissue under cover glass, allowing observation of the lateral engulfment behavior. In some cases, the explant was covered with a thin sheet of agarose in between the surface being imaged and the glass, to reducing sticking and observe more native cell motility.</p><p>For epithelial spreading assays, the inner face of the explant was briefly pressed against FN-coated glass to which it rapidly adhered, and a strip of superficial epithelium was laid along the animal to vegetal extent of the explant. The epithelium was held in place with cover glass to prevent it from curling up on itself and to promote adhesion with the deep tissue; after about 30 min, the glass was removed. Attachment to FN prevented explant rolling, which otherwise frequently obscured the epithelial patch. In other cases, the deep tissue was placed on a BSA-coated substrate and a patch of epithelium was laid across the NIMZ/IMZ boundary and held in place with cover glass.</p><p>To make deep tissue aggregates, superficial epithelium was removed from AC, dorsal or ventral IMZ regions at Stage 8.5–9.5, and the exposed deep tissue cut out and trimmed down to make sure it included no other tissue type. Clumps of deep tissue were then placed in agarose wells to promote aggregation and rounding for 30–60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To make wontons, such aggregates were wrapped in excess superficial epithelium and pressed under cover glass, such that the edges of the epithelium healed together all around the deep tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Animal cap sandwiches were made by combining rectangles of ectoderm from the animal-most 30° of the embryo. For surface tensions measures (below), the glass was removed after healing and wontons or sandwich explants were allowed to equilibrate on a flat surface for at least 1 hr.</p><p>During explant construction involving the IMZ, explants converge rapidly to about 75% of their mediolateral (circumferential) extent in the intact embryo over the 2.5–3 min it takes to cut out and make the explant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Shook et al., 2018</xref>), as expected from prior work showing that the IMZ is under strain in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beloussov et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chien et al., 2015</xref>). Further convergence slows or halts when the two halves of the sandwich are pressed together under a fragment of cover glass to allow healing.

They return to roughly their initial thickness in the embryo when the sandwich is pressed together under a cover glass. During the course of lifting the cover glass, cutting out the boundary regions and healing together the newly cut edges, the explants re-thickened by about 50%.

For RDA-labeled wontons, two to six confocal slices at 10 μm intervals were projected using max intensity to generate an aggregate outline of the labeled deep tissue.</p><p>The curvature outline was identified using an edge detection algorithm (Canny) in MATLAB. All processed images were inspected prior to measurements to ensure that Canny detections generated accurate depictions of the tissue aggregate. ADSA is a program written for MATLAB that numerically integrates the Laplace equation to generate theoretical drop-shapes for hypothetical surface tensions, which are optimally fitted onto experimental profiles obtained from tissue aggregates. The drop-shape that best fits the aggregate is used to derive the specific tissue surface tension for that particular aggregate.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lilianna Solnica-Krezel as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ed Munro (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Shook and collaborators extend their recent work published in <italic>eLife</italic> demonstrating that blastopore closure in the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> depends on the forces generated by cicrumblastoporal convergence of the marginal zone. The current manuscript addresses the tissue mechanics and cellular mechanisms underlying the convergent thickening (CT) of the involuting marginal zone (IMZ), a process that precedes mesoderm internalization. The work combines direct observations and physical measurements/manipulations on explanted tissues to characterize more fully the spatiotemporal expression and cellular basis of CT. The main findings are that CT is an isotropic convergence process, expressed uniformly around the entire pre-involution marginal zone. Moreover, CT shows little dependence on planar cell polarity and Myosin heavy chain IIB, and that CT is driven by an increase in &quot;tissue surface tension&quot; within the deep IMZ cells which, by driving thickening and shortening of a continuous circumblastopore IMZ ring, could explain the tensile convergence force.</p><p>There was consensus among the three reviewers that the core message of the paper is important and suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. The experiments have the unique Keller quality, with clear input from other experts in the field of morphogenesis, and are comprehensive in nature. Generally, the data provide strong support for the author's conclusions. However, the reviewers thought that some conclusions will require additional experimental support. In addition the reviewers thought that the presentation of the data as well as their discussion are not facilitating understanding of the presented results or conveying well the concepts. Therefore, we would like to invite a resubmission of your manuscript, when the following concerns are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As currently written, the paper very hard to read. The observations and data that most strongly support the paper's central conclusions are embedded within a larger body of additional observations that bear on how CT is coordinated with other morphogenetic behaviors (e.g. MIB) within the larger process of tissue involution and blastopore closure. The collective significance of these observations can only be appreciated by presenting them in the context of an even larger body of previous work, which the authors have attempted to do. It would be particularly beneficial to restructure the main text so that it is clear how the current study builds on the previous published work (Shook et al., 2018). In addition, the authors need to streamline the presentation of the results to first emphasize those that support a view of CT as a force-producing morphogenetic engine, and that elucidate the core underlying cellular mechanisms (increased TST in the deep IMZ cells). Additional results concerning the relative timing, transitions between, and coordination of CT and MIB, plus differences in the underlying molecular regulation, could be separately streamlined and presented as a body at the end of the paper.</p><p>2. It would be very helpful if the authors could provide a more thorough introduction to the terms TST and IFT, and the relationship between them. Throughout this part of the manuscript, the authors move back and forth between TST and IFT, often in the same sentence, in a way that is inherently confusing.</p><p>3. It was difficult to see &quot;The retraction of the epithelium from the underlying deep IMZ&quot; in Figure 4C or 5A. This is an important observation in support of the thesis that there is a decreased affinity between deep and superficial IMZ tissues during CT&quot;. This needs to be documented in a more compelling way, even if &quot;affinity&quot; is used in the broader, Holtfreterian sense.</p><p>4. The authors focus on the role of contact with the superficial epithelium in determining the overall CT force produced by the deep IMZ tissue, but clearly, attachment to the NIMZ will also limit the force produced by deep IMZ cells. Couldn't this also be measured in a parallel plate assay?</p><p>5. Whereas the experiments presented in Figure 6A, B can be interpreted that the epithelium has lower affinity to the anterior and posterior IMZ compared to NIMZ, those presented in Figure C are less convincing: the amount of epithelium below the green line is small to start with, and therefore its proposed retraction is not compelling. And how the green line was drawn in the course of the time lapse?</p><p>6. The measurements of TST and IFT using ADSA and parallel plate compression yield results that differ by more than an order of magnitude, even though the qualitative trends over time or between tissue types are the same in both assays. The authors present both results in Figure 6, and make no attempts to explain this discrepancy, although they acknowledge that parallel plate measurements agree much better with their previous measurements (Shook et al., 2018) of tensile convergent forces produced by CT. Is there a way to resolve this discrepancy? If not, does it make sense to lead with a set of results that the authors believe least?</p><p>7. The resistance of the superficial epithelium to deformation of the deep IMZ will depend both on the deformability of the epithelium, and the strength of attachment between them, which limits shear across this interface. Do compression measurements sample the relative contributions of attachment and deformability differently in wonton explants vs sandwich explants?</p><p>8. It would be interesting to see what drives the increase of tissue surface tension at the cellular and subcellular levels. For example, quantitative characterization of cellular dynamics on explants during convergent thickening would help understanding the increase of the tissue surface tension increase between stages 10 and 10.5.</p><p>9. Similarly, it would be interesting to see the changes at the level of cytoskeletal proteins during convergent thickening and the possible impact of cytoskeleton perturbation on the process. Currently, the authors provide characterization of the convergent thickening at the tissue level, yet it is clear that convergent thickening depends on the cellular behaviors. Partially, authors addressed the importance of cellular morphodynamics by perturbing Myosin IIB and planar cell polarity regulators but again there is no clear explanation of what is happening at the cellular level when it comes to these perturbations.</p><p>10. Thinking about potential molecular mechanisms that could underlie the increased TST of the IMZ, consistent with increased cell-cell affinity within deep mesoderm, are there any candidate emerging from numerous gene expression profiling, including scRNA-seq, experiments carried out during frog gastrulation? This should be at least discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57642.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In particular, Shook et al., 2018 showed 1) ventral or ventralized IMZ tissue generates convergence force and 2) the entire IMZ generates convergence force prior to the onset of CE, which together show that CT is a morphogenic machine independent of CE. Further, Shook et al., 2018 also suggested that CT occurred throughout the pre-involution IMZ but did not demonstrate this, and made the argument that CT transitions to CE at involution, all points that we confirm here.</p><p>The results have also been reorganized to present concisely our data showing that CT is associated with a loss of superficial – deep affinity (Figures3 and 4), leading to an increase in IFT, which leads to a thickening force (Figure 5), both corresponding to the onset of CT (points made throughout, summarized in Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

It was difficult to see &quot;The retraction of the epithelium from the underlying deep IMZ&quot; in Figure 4C or 5A. This is an important observation in support of the thesis that there is a decreased affinity between deep and superficial IMZ tissues during CT&quot;. This needs to be documented in a more compelling way, even if &quot;affinity&quot; is used in the broader, Holtfreterian sense.</p></disp-quote><p>The retraction of the epithelium seen in Figure 4C of the previous submission (now Figure 3A; former Figure 5A has been dropped) can be seen far more clearly in the video from which the stills in the figure are taken (Video 9). Our videos are not mere “supplementary data” but in many cases the most compelling illustration of our results, a point we now make at the beginning of the Results section. Arrow heads have been added to current Figure 3A to indicate the edge of the epithelium before and after retraction. The wholesale and abrupt wrinkling up of the superficial tissue and the reduction in area of contact between deep and superficial tissues is pretty strong evidence that the deep IMZ cells are not a good substrate for epithelial spreading.</p><p>Additionally, we consider the contraction of the exogenous epithelia over the IMZ shown in current Figure 4B and the retraction of the exogenous epithelium away from the IMZ shown in Figure 4E, in contrast to the spreading of the epithelia over the NIMZ in either case, to be the most compelling evidence for the loss of affinity, a point that is readily apparent in the videos that the figures are based on (Videos 11, 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors focus on the role of contact with the superficial epithelium in determining the overall CT force produced by the deep IMZ tissue, but clearly, attachment to the NIMZ will also limit the force produced by deep IMZ cells. Couldn't this also be measured in a parallel plate assay?</p></disp-quote><p>The edge-wise interface between the deep IMZ and the NIMZ in the sandwich explants is a mystery. The dorsal NIMZ is presumptive neural tissue, with a very, very wide and short presumptive spinal cord next to the IMZ, and that region undergoes a very rapid and vigorous CE, so great that the number of cells intercalating in from far lateral regions into the midline push many of the original midline inhabitants far forward into the hindbrain to the point that original midline cells may be rare in the midline of the extended neural axis As neural CE narrows and extends the NIMZ away from the IMZ, the contact between them is greatly reduced, as neural CE occurs much faster than the CT mediated convergence of the posterior IMZ bounding it. During early neurulation, as the last of the thickened CT region transitions to CE of the posterior notochordal and somitic tissue, rapid intercalation also occurs at the mesodermal (IMZ) side of the interface with the neural tissue, further reducing their contact in sandwich explants.</p><p>In the intact embryo, however, the deep IMZ and deep NIMZ cells would be converging and extending in parallel, with the latter above the former, and they are kept separate by Tissue Separation Behavior, a complex process involving Eph-Ephrin regulation of contact behavior, worked out by Rudi Winklbauer and associates. In the sandwich explant, which lack involution, the deep cells of NIMZ and IMZ have edgewise, “on end” contact at the tissue level, and stay separated, but if an explant is bent in any direction at that juncture, the lateral surfaces of these two tissues, bent toward one another, “discover” one another, and rapidly anneal within the epithelium to form what approximates their intended, normal relationship! It is beyond our knowledge to speculate on the dynamic properties of these tissues and how attachment of the IMZ to NIMZ would limit or enhance force produced by the IMZ. It is also not clear how we could measure this in a parallel plate compression test. It is the increase in interfacial tension between deep and superficial IMZ that allows for the generation of tensile forces by the deep tissue.</p><p>The situation at the interface between deep IMZ and NIMZ in the intact embryo (at the “Limit of Involution”) is somewhat complicated. This interface is minimized during gastrulation to the circumference of the closed blastopore at end of gastrulation, driven at least in part by the CE of both posterior mesodermal and neural tissue adjacent to the interface, as noted above for explants. Explants of dorsal deep IMZ and NIMZ begin to separate at Stage 10.5, but explants of ventral deep do not (Figure 5-supplementary figure 2F). However, the interface between deep IMZ and NIMZ is also minimized during gastrulation in ventralized embryos, suggesting the hypothesis that the affinity between deep NIMZ and the epithelial layer outcompetes the affinity between deep IMZ and deep NIMZ. These points are explored in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Whereas the experiments presented in Figure 6A, B can be interpreted that the epithelium has lower affinity to the anterior and posterior IMZ compared to NIMZ, those presented in Figure C are less convincing: the amount of epithelium below the green line is small to start with, and therefore its proposed retraction is not compelling. And how the green line was drawn in the course of the time lapse?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, the video that the figure (now Figure 4E) is based on (Video 12) is more compelling. The green line represents the upper limits of the deep mesodermal tissue, which is migrating toward the top of the explant as the epithelium retracts. The line is based on differential cell size and motility, which are evident in the video. The initial position of the green line within the field of view in subsequent frames is indicated by the open orange line. Comparing the G+1h to the G+6h stills, you can see that the epithelium has actually moved significantly with respect to the initial boundary, which it initially overlapped. These points are now made within the text and figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The measurements of TST and IFT using ADSA and parallel plate compression yield results that differ by more than an order of magnitude, even though the qualitative trends over time or between tissue types are the same in both assays. The authors present both results in Figure 6, and make no attempts to explain this discrepancy, although they acknowledge that parallel plate measurements agree much better with their previous measurements (Shook et al., 2018) of tensile convergent forces produced by CT. Is there a way to resolve this discrepancy? If not, does it make sense to lead with a set of results that the authors believe least?</p></disp-quote><p>Differences in the media used could explain part of the discrepancy, but not all of it; this is now noted within the results. We now present the parallel plate measurements first, but still include the ADSA results because they do show the same trend. Another potential explanation is that the explants are under greater strain in the parallel plate compression test than in the ADSA test, and while this shouldn’t matter for a non-living, homogenous substance, it might matter for a living tissue. However, we consider this possibility too speculative to discuss in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The resistance of the superficial epithelium to deformation of the deep IMZ will depend both on the deformability of the epithelium, and the strength of attachment between them, which limits shear across this interface. Do compression measurements sample the relative contributions of attachment and deformability differently in wonton explants vs sandwich explants?</p></disp-quote><p>Sandwich explants have only the endogenous epithelium, initially leaving the edges exposed. In the case of animal cap/ ectoderm deep tissue, the epithelium will begin to heal together starting at Stage 10-, whereas in the case of deep mesoderm, the epithelium will retract. Thus, mesodermal sandwiches are unusable whereas in ectodermal sandwiches, the epithelium undergoes a small amount of strain, which might affect results. However, we saw no differences between ectodermal sandwiches and wontons (which are much more challenging to make, especially at early stages).</p><p>Wonton’s have excess epithelium, which we expected would minimize any resistance to deformation, as any strain could be relieved by recruiting more epithelium from the excess. Conceivably, the lower affinity of mesoderm vs. ectoderm to epithelium could influence the ease of recruitment. However, the epithelium normally undergoes roughly 100% strain during the course of gastrulation, so may not offer much resistance to deformation in any case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It would be interesting to see what drives the increase of tissue surface tension at the cellular and subcellular levels. For example, quantitative characterization of cellular dynamics on explants during convergent thickening would help understanding the increase of the tissue surface tension increase between stages 10 and 10.5.</p></disp-quote><p>We asked the reviewers for clarification on this question via the editors, but received none. We looked at cell motility of deep cells at three scales but could see no changes in metrics of cell motility at the level of whole cell displacement, protrusive activity or cell division around the time when other changes associated with the onset of CT occur. This probably means that the basis of CT has to do with changes in the relationship between deep and superficial cells, but we have not yet worked out methods that allow us to look at cell motility at this interface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Similarly, it would be interesting to see the changes at the level of cytoskeletal proteins during convergent thickening and the possible impact of cytoskeleton perturbation on the process. Currently, the authors provide characterization of the convergent thickening at the tissue level, yet it is clear that convergent thickening depends on the cellular behaviors. Partially, authors addressed the importance of cellular morphodynamics by perturbing Myosin IIB and planar cell polarity regulators but again there is no clear explanation of what is happening at the cellular level when it comes to these perturbations.</p></disp-quote><p>We looked for changes in actin, cadherin and phospho-myosin light chain localization at the interface between deep and superficial cells, or in comparison to interfaces between deep cells or between superficial cells, but again saw no changes around the onset of CT. Nor do we see differences by cell shape analysis that would indicate a change in the cortical tensions at the interface between deep and superficial. Simply perturbing actin or myosin would decrease or block cell motility and would certainly affect CT, but is unlikely to tell us anything specific about the regulation of interfacial tension.</p><p>More sophisticated approaches may reveal the regulatory mechanisms driving increased interfacial tension but are beyond the scope of this revised manuscript. They will probably require differentially treating deep and superficial populations and then recombining them in explants. Preliminary experiments using such an approach show that they are technically challenging, as many such treatments render the epithelium very difficult to work with.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Thinking about potential molecular mechanisms that could underlie the increased TST of the IMZ, consistent with increased cell-cell affinity within deep mesoderm, are there any candidate emerging from numerous gene expression profiling, including scRNA-seq, experiments carried out during frog gastrulation? This should be at least discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>There are no examples of general gene expression profiling experiments that look specifically at deep or superficial tissues and of the few characterized examples of genes that are expressed specifically in the deep or superficial layer (e.g. Xnr3), they are not expressed in the right pattern at the right time. We have discussed potential mechanisms, namely ephrin/Eph-receptor interactions and other mechanisms of modulating cadherin activity levels without changing cadherin localization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
