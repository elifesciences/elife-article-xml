cognate binding sites in the region. However, the role of multiple binding sites for the same TFs and their specific spatial arrangement in determining the overall competency of the enhancer has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized the MS2-MCP live imaging technique to quantitatively analyze the regulatory logic of the <italic>snail</italic> distal enhancer in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Through systematic modulation of Dorsal and Twist binding motifs in this enhancer, we found that a mutation in any one of these binding sites causes a drastic reduction in transcriptional amplitude, resulting in a reduction in mRNA production of the target gene. We provide evidence of synergy, such that multiple binding sites with moderate affinities cooperatively recruit more TFs to drive stronger transcriptional activity than a single site. Moreover, a Hidden Markov-based stochastic model of transcription reveals that embryos with mutated binding sites have a higher probability of returning to the inactive promoter state. We propose that TF-DNA binding regulates spatial and temporal gene expression and drives robust pattern formation by modulating transcriptional kinetics and tuning bursting rates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription kinetics</kwd><kwd>live imaging</kwd><kwd>MS2-MCP</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>transcription bursting</kwd><kwd>hidden-markov model</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>Sahla</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Bomyi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TF-DNA binding regulates spatial and temporal gene expression and drives robust pattern formation by modulating transcriptional kinetics via cooperative interactions among weak TF binding sites and tuning bursting rates by reducing the time spent in the ON state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is a highly precise and coordinated process, occurring with little variability despite intrinsic and extrinsic noise and perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias and Hayward, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002</xref>). Proper levels of essential genes and correct positioning of expression patterns are regulated by short non-coding DNA sequences known as enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerji et al., 1981</xref>). Enhancers tightly control their target gene expression both in space and time via transcription factor (TF) recruitment. Complex patterning and cell fates are established through TFs recognizing and binding to specific short DNA sequences within enhancers with varying degrees of affinity at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reiter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</xref>). Concerted action of TFs with other transcriptional machinery has been found to reposition nucleosomes, initiate chromatin remodeling, recruit additional activating co-factors, and generate distinct transcriptional outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). However, it remains to be understood how these brief, yet frequent, interactions between TFs and regulatory DNAs facilitate efficient and specific transcription on the timescale of minutes. Although we know that TFs influence various facets of transcription such as timing or probability of activation, we have yet to determine their role in orchestrating an enhancer’s transcriptional competency at a mechanistic level. For example, does the spatial arrangement of the binding sites influence transcriptional capability? How does each TF binding site shape transcriptional dynamics of individual nuclei and contribute to overall pattern formation?</p><p>Recently, it was shown that the genomic context of an enhancer provides an optimal environment for driving normal expression patterns and preventing misregulation upon induced perturbations. Mutating a single Giant (Gt) repressor binding site in the minimal <italic>even-skipped</italic> stripe 2 enhancer region caused misexpression of the target gene, whereas those effects were buffered in an extended enhancer containing more TF binding sites and expression levels were comparable to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Rivera et al., 2020</xref>). However, the role of multiple TF binding sites with varying affinities within the enhancer in regulating transcription has yet to be established. Recent studies have explored the role of low-affinity binding sites in producing specific expression patterns and found that enhancers containing optimal TF motifs may lead to overexpression and result in developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). Previous work has shown that modulating the strength of a single TF binding site was sufficient to disrupt transcriptional activity, such that a mutation of an activator Dorsal (Dl) site in the <italic>t48</italic> enhancer delayed activation and almost completely abolished transcriptional activity, while optimization of the site to a consensus motif induced ectopic transcriptional activity with a broader gene expression domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2020</xref>). However, systematic removal of binding sites of varying affinities for another activator, Bicoid, seems to affect its target gene, <italic>hunchback</italic>, expression to a similar degree, indicating that each site has a nearly equal contribution to the overall expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eck et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, since many studies have relied on fixed tissue experiments to derive the role of TFs in transcriptional regulation, the changes in real-time transcription kinetics that drive the observed misexpression are often overlooked. Dynamic interplay among TFs, cofactors, and DNA occurs on the order of seconds, a time resolution that cannot be resolved solely through RNAi and single molecule in situ hybridization experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mir et al., 2017</xref>). Since TF binding events affect the expression of regulatory genes both spatially and temporally, incorporation of both live imaging techniques and predictive modeling is crucial to correlate transient TF-DNA binding to downstream transcriptional activity in single-cell resolution.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the effects of perturbing TF-DNA binding strength on the transcriptional dynamics of <italic>snail</italic> (<italic>sna</italic>) in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. <italic>sna</italic> is a well-characterized, key patterning gene that encodes a zinc finger protein and is responsible for the differentiation of the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rembold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leptin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ip et al., 1992</xref>). Sna represses the expression of genes responsible for neuroectoderm formation and establishes the mesoderm-neuroectoderm boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosman et al., 1991</xref>). Embryos lacking <italic>sna</italic> fail to undergo gastrulation, resulting in embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hemavathy et al., 2004</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>sna</italic> expression is controlled by a proximal enhancer and a distal (shadow) enhancer located directly upstream and ~7kb upstream of the promoter, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2010</xref>). The distal enhancer is necessary for proper <italic>sna</italic> expression and the viability of the developing embryo, especially under genetic and environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunipace et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>sna</italic> is a target gene of the Dl morphogen, and the nuclear gradient of maternally deposited Dl protein controls the sharp boundaries of <italic>sna</italic> expression, such that only nuclei with high concentrations of nuclear Dl express <italic>sna</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). Through binding assays like EMSA and ChIP-seq, it was determined that the distal <italic>sna</italic> enhancer contains multiple, low-affinity binding sites for Dl, Twist (Twi), and the pioneer factor Zelda (Zld) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferraro et al., 2016</xref>).

Using MS2-MS2 coat protein (MCP)-based live imaging, we visualized transcription dynamics driven by the wildtype minimal <italic>sna</italic> distal enhancer in the cases of with and without various TF binding site mutations. We find that mutating a single TF (Dl or Twi) binding site in the enhancer significantly reduces mRNA production of the target gene, mainly through lowering transcriptional amplitude by reducing RNA polymerase (Pol) II loading rate, without significantly delaying the timing of initiation or affecting the probability of activation. Surprisingly, modulating the same TF binding site in the context of the full <italic>sna</italic> distal enhancer results in a similar reduction in expression levels, underscoring that additional TF binding sites in the full enhancer are not sufficient to rescue transcriptional activity. Using a thermodynamic equilibrium binding model, we show that the TF binding sites interact cooperatively to establish the correct spatial pattern of <italic>sna</italic>. Our model demonstrates that a combination of weak affinity and cooperative interactions among binding sites may be an evolutionary molecular mechanism to ensure the correct pattern and levels of target genes. Moreover, a two-state stochastic model of transcription indicates that TF binding site mutations affect transcriptional bursting, specifically by increasing the probability of the promoter switching out of the ON state, k<sub>off</sub>, and reducing burst durations. Together, our data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which TF binding sites regulate transcriptional kinetics and spatial patterning during embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single TF binding site mutation greatly diminishes the transcriptional capability of the distal <italic>sna</italic> enhancer</title><p>The 519 bp <italic>sna</italic> minimal enhancer is located within the full <italic>sna</italic> distal enhancer (1.6 kb) and has been shown to recapitulate proper <italic>sna</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferraro et al., 2016</xref>). We focus on the analysis of the minimal enhancer since it contains fewer TF binding sites than the full distal enhancer, which allows systematic perturbation in a sensitized background to gain a functional understanding of the role of TF binding site arrangements in gene regulation. The minimal enhancer contains binding sites for many TFs, including Dl, Twi, and Zld, and our study focuses on the sites with the strongest binding affinities, three Dl sites and one Twi site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Specifically, 10x repeat sequences of MS2 are integrated into the 5’ UTR of the <italic>yellow</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon transcription, each MS2 sequence forms a stem loop which is detected by maternally deposited MCP tagged with fluorescent proteins. To visualize nascent transcription dynamics in nuclear cycle (NC) 14, females carrying His2Av-mRFP (nucleus marker) and MCP-GFP were crossed with males carrying the desired MS2 construct, resulting in progeny expressing distinct fluorescent puncta in active transcription loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). <italic>sna</italic> distal enhancer drives gene expression in the endogenous <italic>sna</italic> domain, where the nuclear Dl level is the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The fluorescence intensity trajectory for each nucleus is extracted for subsequent analysis and correlated to its instantaneous transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).

We do note that this does not provide an absolute number of mRNA molecules. However, through this estimation of mRNA production measured under the same laser setting, we can compare the relative mRNA production among constructs with different TF binding site mutations.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-85997-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Live imaging of wildtype embryo expressing snamin &gt; MS2-yellow during NC14.</title><p>MS2 signal is shown in yellow.

Furthermore, we found that in both the minimal and full distal <italic>sna</italic> enhancers, the mutant embryos have shallower gradients and less sharp boundaries, highlighting the importance of proper TF-DNA interactions in regulating the sharpness of the expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Shallower expression of <italic>sna</italic> may lead to higher uncertainty in germ layer formation between mesoderm and neuroectoderm. It is interesting to note that the introduction of the mutations in the larger genomic context (i.e., full distal enhancer) did not lessen their effect on transcriptional activity and pattern formation. Here, it is evident that additional TF sites are not able to rescue normal <italic>sna</italic> transcriptional activity and that each site within the minimal enhancer region plays a critical role in ensuring robust expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mutations cause lower mRNA production, mainly due to reduced transcriptional amplitude and lower Pol II loading</title><p>After establishing the dramatic reduction in transcriptional activity, we delved into the underlying causes of the low mRNA production in both a single nucleus and across the entire <italic>sna</italic> expression domain. We hypothesized that the reduced mRNA production may occur through multiple different modes. The mutations may alter the time of transcriptional activation or reduce the transcriptional window, thereby effectively lowering the mRNA production compared to a wildtype embryo. The mutations may reduce the enhancer’s ability to transcribe and effectively load Pol II, resulting in decreased instantaneous transcriptional amplitude. Or, the mutant embryos may have fewer transcriptionally active nuclei within the expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that the differences in the time for half the nuclei to begin transcription as well as the transcription initiation time per nucleus were not sufficient to explain the low mRNA output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, the total number of nuclei showing active transcription was comparable among wildtypes and binding site mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although the window of active transcription is slightly shortened in embryos containing the induced mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the main cause of the low mRNA output was the average transcriptional amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Here, we observed a significant decrease in transcriptional intensity, leading us to conclude that the mutations mainly modulate transcription by lowering Pol II loading rate. At single-cell resolution, we find that the mutants with two deleted binding sites have a slightly bigger impact on transcriptional activity than those with one site removed, but the differences are small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutations cause lower mRNA production, mainly due to lower transcriptional amplitude.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic comparing wildtype and mutants.

Interestingly, we observed that the Dl1 mutation induced earlier transcriptional activation than wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>). Since the Dl1 and Dl2 binding sites are less than 10 bp apart, mutating the Dl1 site may create a more favorable steric conformation, allowing Dl to bind to the single site more efficiently. However, the earlier activation time is not sufficient to buffer against the severe reduction in transcriptional amplitude and causes the Dl1 mutant to exhibit similarly reduced mRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in addition to modulating the average transcriptional intensity, the mutations in the full distal enhancer affect the time to activation and the transcription window as well.

This suggests that enhancers of the genes activated by lower concentration of Dl should contain strong binding sites to maintain transcriptional activity at normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). It will be of further interest to quantitate how the induced mutations affect <italic>sna</italic> activity in the presence of reduced maternally deposited Dl levels.</p><p>Next, we utilized our model to test the effects of strengthening or weakening one binding site on transcriptional output. Further weakening Dl1 binding affinity renders it an almost non-affinity site and results in overall reduced mRNA production, while strengthening Dl1 affinity leads to an ectopically wider expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). Relying on a single strong site may yield ‘too high’ and ectopic expression, and its removal can drastically disrupt expression, a result that was also observed upon removal of a single Dl site in the <italic>t48</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data provides evidence that TF binding sites should coordinate with one another to some degree to recreate the correct pattern and levels of <italic>sna</italic>. We propose that cooperativity allows TF binding sites with moderate or weak affinities to recruit more TFs to the enhancer, generate sharp transcriptional responses, and drive strong and robust expression in the narrow <italic>sna</italic> expression domain (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A two-state model of transcription reveals differences in k<sub>off</sub> rates and burst duration</title><p>Previous studies have shown that transcription occurs discontinuously in distinct, stochastic bursts of activity punctuated by quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corrigan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senecal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donovan et al., 2019</xref>). Bursting has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism for driving heterogeneity in gene expression, giving rise to cell-to-cell variability and overall diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodriguez and Larson, 2020</xref>). Bursting parameters, such as burst frequency, burst duration, and promoter switching rates provide a glimpse into the underlying mechanisms of dynamic transcription regulation, such as kinetic rates and promoter states. We find that the wildtype and mutant embryos show comparable numbers of actively transcribing nuclei at the beginning of the NC14. However, at later times, most wildtype nuclei in the <italic>sna</italic> expression domain are active in a given frame while nuclei from mutant embryos exhibit stochastic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>).

They are extensively used to recover rates of promoter switching and other bursting parameters from transcriptional trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lammers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoppe et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we utilize an HMM to infer the promoter state based on the observed fluorescence intensity curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Based on previous studies, burst separation and burst duration can be correlated to bursting parameters, k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoppe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zoller et al., 2018</xref>). Using our modeling approach, we extracted the kinetic rates of the promoter returning to an active state from an inactive state (k<sub>on</sub>) and vice versa (k<sub>off</sub>). Previously, we demonstrated that the mutations affect mRNA production through transcriptional amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This could be because either the mutations hinder Pol II loading rate or reduce the time the promoter is in the ON state. Our results reveal that k<sub>on</sub> is only slightly affected by the induced mutations, while k<sub>off</sub> is significantly increased in mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Furthermore, all of the perturbations do not change the normal distribution trend of k<sub>on</sub> rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, we observe heterogeneity and high variability in the distribution of k<sub>off</sub> rates as well as shorter burst durations in the mutated embryos, explaining the bursty and noisy transcriptional activity we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and G</xref>). This leads us to conclude that the mutations affect the ability of the promoter to remain in the active state, causing it to become more unstable and more likely to revert to the inactive state, supporting the observation of lower mRNA production. In addition, we find that the Pol II loading rate is significantly reduced in the mutant embryos compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This confirms that the lower transcriptional amplitude mainly results from the promoter’s inability to effectively load Pol II, along with an additional contribution from the reduced time the promoter spends in the ON state. In the full distal enhancer, we observe similar stochastic transcriptional activation, where the number of actively transcribing nuclei is about 50% less in the mutants than in the wildtype at any given time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also see a similar increase in the rate of k<sub>off</sub> and burst durations in the full distal enhancer, with minimal effect on k<sub>on</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). The trend in the distributions of the promoter switching rates remains the same as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that TF-DNA binding modulates mRNA production by increasing the rate of promoter inactivation (k<sub>off</sub>), along with the decrease in Pol II loading rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Organisms have evolved to contain enhancers with multiple binding sites for the same TF, not only for robustness under varying biological conditions, but as a molecular regulatory mechanism. Here, we studied transcriptional dynamics driven by different degrees of TF-DNA interactions through inducing mutations in the <italic>sna</italic> regulatory module. By utilizing quantitative live imaging, we dissected the effects of modulation of TF binding sites and determined that mRNA production of the target gene is drastically reduced when a single binding site is mutated. This reduction is mainly due to the decreased transcriptional amplitude, driven by a lower rate of Pol II loading, but is also slightly affected by shorter window of transcription, delayed transcriptional activation, and lower probability of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Although a previous study demonstrated that an extended enhancer with additional binding sites could buffer against the effects of mutating a single Gt binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Rivera et al., 2020</xref>), we find that the same effect in the minimal enhancer is also observed in the full distal enhancer. This could be due to Dl and Twi’s roles as activators, whereas the aforementioned study investigated Gt’s role as a repressor. It is interesting to note that despite the presence of additional TF binding sites, modulating a single site can catastrophically reduce gene expression levels. We confirm that the minimal enhancer is the core region that is needed to recapitulate normal <italic>sna</italic> levels and that TFs in that region employ distinct mechanisms to regulate transcription in response to genetic perturbations.</p><p>Moreover, we determined that the TF binding sites in the <italic>sna</italic> enhancer work synergistically to drive the proper pattern and levels of the target gene expression. Cooperativity is a necessary mechanism by which a hub of weaker sites can coordinate to synergistically generate the correct expression pattern and levels in a developing embryo. In the context of <italic>sna</italic>, the <italic>sna</italic> enhancer only contains weak Dl binding sites, repressing <italic>short gastrulation</italic> (<italic>sog</italic>) expression in the region and preventing those cells from developing into neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2008</xref>). Our thermodynamic model showed that increasing the binding affinity leads to ectopic expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Hence, it is crucial that the <italic>sna</italic> enhancer contains only weak Dl binding sites to drive expression exclusively in the region with high Dl concentration (i.e. mesoderm). Previous works have shown that other enhancers also utilize weak, sub-optimal binding sites to drive specific target gene expression. It was determined that despite the <italic>shavenbaby</italic> enhancers containing low-affinity binding sites, a microenvironment of high concentrations of Ubx and other cofactors can mediate efficient and specific transcription of the target locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, a single optimized Dl binding site in the <italic>t48</italic> enhancer resulted in earlier activity and ectopic expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2020</xref>). Suboptimization of enhancers was shown to be an important characteristic of gene regulation to drive restricted expression, whereas optimizing TF motifs resulted in the loss of specificity and an increase in aberrant transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Probing the thermodynamic model further reveals the importance of cooperativity in regulating expression. When all binding affinities in the <italic>sna</italic> enhancer are weakened, threefold higher cooperativity values are needed to maintain normal expression levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, in a <italic>sna</italic> enhancer with increased affinity binding sites, optimal cooperativity values to maintain normal expression levels and domains are ten-fold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Here, it is evident that concerted interaction among weaker affinity binding sites with high levels of cooperativity may be a mechanism to maintain a specific expression domain and level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Such higher-degree of cooperativity among TFs has also been shown in a recent study, where cooperativity among Runt, Bcd, and Pol II are needed to drive normal gene expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Future experiments involving binding site modulations of enhancers with stronger binding sites, such as those in the <italic>sog</italic> enhancer, can be performed to confirm the model results.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the TF binding site mutations affect the rate of the promoter switching OFF. The heterogeneity in k<sub>off</sub> rates confirms that the mutations abolish the ability of the embryo to develop robustly by causing promoter instability and shorter transcription windows, leading to overall lower mRNA production. As a result of higher k<sub>off</sub> rates, the mutant embryos have fewer actively transcribing nuclei within the domain at any given time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and G</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). However, we note that the HMM only provides some explanation for the reduction in transcriptional activity since the changes in k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> are less drastic than the changes in transcriptional output. Since the amount of time the promoter spends in the ON state is not affected by the mutations, the lower transcriptional amplitude can be mainly attributed to the promoter’s inability to effectively load Pol II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and H</xref>). Furthermore, the shallower gradient of the expression pattern highlights the role of TFs in controlling the sharpness of the expression gradient, potentially affecting the robustness in germ layer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and K</xref>). In sum, we believe that multiple TF binding sites are imperative not only for pattern formation but also for eliminating extrinsic and intrinsic variabilities that may occur during development.</p><p>We illustrate that the minimal enhancer is a feasible model system to quantitatively and systematically study transcription kinetics and regulation. We note that although it may not always be possible to generalize the effects of mutations from a reporter construct to the endogenous setting, we can still gain valuable insights and broaden our understanding of transcription regulation. Since <italic>sna</italic> is responsible for mesoderm formation as well as for the repression of other patterning genes like <italic>sog</italic> that specify neuroectoderm, it will be interesting to characterize the phenotypic effects of these mutations. Specifically, if the mutation causes 65% reduction in <italic>sna</italic> activity endogenously, would the developing embryo undergo proper gastrulation and remain viable? However<italic>,</italic> since <italic>sna</italic> has at least two well-characterized enhancers (proximal and distal) that compensate for each other, investigating the phenotypic effects of endogenously modulating TF binding sites remains challenging. In order to correlate transcriptional dynamics with downstream development it will be critical to carefully design experiments that will disentangle the contributions of the individual enhancers and the role of specific TF binding sites.</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate that TFs can regulate transcriptional dynamics by tuning bursting parameters and modulating transcriptional activity in response to genetic perturbations. Using quantitative live imaging and thermodynamic modeling, we find that low-affinity TF binding sites can create an environment of increased transcriptional activity to drive localized, specific, and sharp expression patterns. The evidence of a dual modality of regulation and synergy highlights the importance of moving beyond fixed tissue studies and focusing on experiments that can tease apart subtle kinetic changes that occur during development. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into enhancer-mediated transcriptional dynamics and expand our understanding of enhancer-TF binding through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Motif scanning</title><p>TF binding sites were found through the FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurrences) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>) tool using motifs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2020</xref> and JASPAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castro-Mondragon et al., 2022</xref>).

C<sub>i</sub> is the concentration of a TF, K<sub>i</sub> is the dissociation constant, and ω<sub>i</sub> is the cooperativity factor. To find the minimum of the nonlinear multivariable functions in the previous equation, we utilized a nonlinear programming solver, <italic>fmincon</italic> (MATLAB). The solver returns a vector of cooperativity values that minimize the objective function. The objective function uses the root mean square error between the wildtype and mutant conditions to determine the cooperativity terms that would satisfy the constraints (i.e., mutant condition must have 65% reduction in expression level compared to the wildtype). A stable solution was defined once the solution converged and the solver returned cooperativities that satisfied the objective function and constraints within a step tolerance of 1e-10. Using these evaluated cooperativities, curves were generated to predict mRNA production. In the case of no cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), all cooperativity values were set to 1 and the results were plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-state model</title><p>Two-state model fitting is similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keller et al., 2020</xref>. Transcriptional trajectories were smoothened using local regression (LOESS) method. Each trajectory from a given nucleus was converted into a binary plot indicating promoter ON (1) and promoter OFF (0) states as described below. The slope between two consecutive time-points of active transcription was obtained to define promoter ON and OFF states. Time points with positive slope were considered as ON promoter states (1), while those with a negative slope were assumed as OFF promoter states (0). This binary data was used as the input for the Baum-Welch based HMM. Initial transition probabilities were assumed to be equal (i.e., 0.5). These probabilities were adjusted in each iteration to individual burst traces until they converged. The Viterbi algorithm was used to determine the most likely sequence of (ON/OFF) promoter states (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Burst separation and burst duration were correlated to k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-85997-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The scripts used in the paper are freely available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/limlab-upenn/TF-binding">GitHub</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Limlab-upenn, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the Lim lab for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Eisen as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The MWC model should be more extensively explored, including a more complete parameter sweep and better evaluation of what the values of the cooperativity parameters are.</p><p>2) The discussion needs to be expanded to include placing the work in a more general context: are the result relevant for other enhancers, in other organisms?</p><p>The reviewers make several suggestions to further strengthen the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, I thought this paper was nicely written with clear figures.

As suggested by the reviewer, in order to connect transcriptional amplitude and Pol II loading rate, we measured the initiation rate by calculating the slope of the MS2 traces and correlated it to the Pol II loading rate. As expected, the initiation rate in wildtype is higher than in mutant embryos. This additional analysis suggests that the drastic reduction in transcriptional amplitude is due to the reduced Pol II loading rate, not k<sub>on</sub>, and corroborates the previously shown results and conclusions (Bothma et al., <italic>PNAS</italic> 2014, PMID: 24994903; Garcia et al., <italic>Curr.

The cooperativity of Dl1/Dl2 (ω<sub>1</sub>) is 28, Dl3/Twi2 (ω<sub>6</sub>) is 55, and Dl1/Dl2/Dl3/Twi2 (ω<sub>11</sub>) is 1.6e5, suggesting that cooperativity of all binding sites is necessary to match experimental observations. Through a sensitivity analysis, we find that the model is robust to changes in parameters with moderate cooperativity values (ω<sub>1</sub> and ω<sub>6</sub>), such that varying the cooperativity by an order of magnitude higher or lower did not result in significant changes. However, the model is somewhat sensitive to changes in the parameter with the highest cooperativity (ω<sub>11</sub>), the term representing interactions among all the TFs. Reduced cooperativity results in much smaller differences in expression levels between wildtype and mutants, whereas higher cooperativity causes ectopic expression in a wider expression domain (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have added these results in the manuscript (Page 11):</p><p>“We found that Dl1/Dl2 (⍵1), Dl3/Twi2 (⍵6), and Dl1/Dl2/Dl3/Twi2 (⍵11) cooperativities were the key parameters with a value above 1 to reach a stable solution, confirming the role of cooperativity among weak binding sites as a mechanism for precise gene control (Table 2). We performed sensitivity analysis on these three cooperativity terms to test the robustness of the model. Transcriptional output was not significantly affected upon modulating a moderate cooperativity ⍵1 and ⍵6 values by an order of magnitude (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). However, the model was more sensitive to changes in the highest cooperativity term ⍵11, which represents the interactions among all TFs (Table 2). Decreasing the cooperativity value of ⍵11 results in a smaller difference between wildtype and mutant transcriptional activities, while increasing cooperativity results in ectopic expression in a wider expression domain (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). This underscores the importance of the concerted interaction among all the TFs in regulating and maintaining proper gene expression pattern and levels (Figure 3D).”</p><p>We do see a slight effect in the double binding site deletion (see Figure 2C-E and Figure 3C), but we think that this moderate difference is due to the fact that the enhancer has other low affinity binding sites that can buffer the predicted effect. The model only contains 4 binding sites, so removing two sites in the model would cause a more dramatic reduction than observed experimentally. We observe the same trend when all the binding sites are either strengthened or weakened (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B).</p><p>We note this difference in the revised manuscript (Page 10):</p><p>“We do note that the model predicts that the Dl1/2 double mutant exhibits lower mRNA output than the other single binding site mutants, which is not as prominent in experimental results (Figure 2C-E and Figure 3C). We believe this may be due to some degree of buffering from additional TF binding sites present in the sna enhancer that cannot be captured in our four binding site model. We observe the same trend of a lower mRNA output for the double binding site deletion regardless of the changes in binding site affinity (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I would enjoy reading a discussion that explores just a bit further how general the observations from this work might be. Do you suspect that cooperativity might be more important in enhancers that need to have weak binding sites for specificity reasons (maybe somewhat testable from your MWC model)?

Do you think the reason that the extended enhancer shows the same effects as the minimal enhancer has to do with Dl/Twi's roles as activators (in contrast to Gt's role as a repressor in eve stripe 2)?</p></disp-quote><p>While each binding site within the <italic>snail</italic> enhancer has varying affinities, they are all considered weak Dl and Twi binding sites compared to other known high affinity sites in other enhancers (i.e., the sequence doesn’t match the consensus site). Hence, we do not see significant differences in expression levels when removing a “weaker” Dl2 versus “stronger” Dl1 site experimentally (Figure 1G). To further explore the role of binding affinity strength on transcription, we utilized our model to strengthen or weaken one binding site and examined the changes in the predicted output. When we increase the binding affinity of one site (Dl1), removing the other weaker sites does not significantly affect the expression level. However, increasing Dl1 affinity results in a wider expression domain of <italic>sna</italic> and removal of that strong site (Dl1) results in a 70% reduction in transcription output (Figure 3—figure supplement 2F), an even larger reduction than the original experimental and model results. We hypothesize that the stronger site plays a more dominant role in controlling expression levels and driving ectopic expression. This may explain why the enhancer utilizes cooperativity among weaker sites rather than one strong site to regulate the target gene. Since Dl1 is already a weak site, weakening it even further causes it to effectively become almost a non-affinity site and leads to a reduction in overall mRNA production, and even further reductions upon binding site mutations (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E).</p><p>We have added the following in the Results (Page 12):</p><p>“Next, we utilized our model to test the effects of strengthening or weakening one binding site on transcriptional output. Further weakening Dl1 binding affinity renders it an almost non-affinity site and results in overall reduced mRNA production, while strengthening Dl1 affinity leads to an ectopically wider expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 2E-F). Relying on a single strong site may yield “too high” and ectopic expression, and its removal can drastically disrupt expression, a result that was also observed upon removal of a single Dl site in the t48 enhancer (Figure 3F) (Keller et al. 2020).”</p><p>The model predicts that cooperativity is indeed more important when the enhancer contains weak binding sites. We found that the cooperativity parameters needed to fit the experimental observations are about ten-fold higher when the enhancer contains binding sites that have all been weakened by a factor of 1.5 (Table 2). When binding affinity is increased by a factor of 2, we find that only ⍵<sub>11</sub>, the cooperativity term for interactions among all TFs, is significantly greater than 1, indicating that less cooperativity is needed for strong binding sites (Table 2). High gene expression level is observed only in the presence of strong cooperativity factors for enhancers with low affinity binding sites, emphasizing the need for cooperativity (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and Table 2).</p><p>We have added the following in the Discussion (Page 16):</p><p>“Probing the thermodynamic model further reveals the importance of cooperativity in regulating expression. When all binding affinities in the sna enhancer are weakened, three-fold higher cooperativity values are needed to maintain normal expression levels (Table 2). Similarly, in a sna enhancer with increased affinity binding sites, optimal cooperativity values to maintain normal expression levels and domains are ten-fold lower (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B and Table 2). Here, it is evident that concerted interaction among weaker affinity binding sites with high levels of cooperativity may be a mechanism to maintain a specific expression domain and level (Figure 3D). Such higher degree of cooperativity among TFs has also been shown in a recent study, where cooperativity among Runt, Bcd, and Pol II are needed to drive normal gene expression level (Kim et al. 2022). Future experiments involving binding site modulations of enhancers with stronger binding sites, such as those in the sog enhancer, can be performed to confirm the model results.”</p><p>Interestingly, we find that the model is sensitive to Dl concentrations as the binding site affinity is decreased. In the presence of low Dl concentrations, enhancers with weak affinity binding sites will not interact with TFs as frequently, resulting in very low transcription (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). Doubling Dl concentrations offsets the effects of low affinity sites and allows for normal expression levels. In the presence of high binding affinity sites, the effects of Dl concentration is less drastic, with only slightly wider expression domain upon increasing Dl concentrations (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D).</p><p>We have added these results in the Results (Page 11):</p><p>“We sought to obtain comprehensive insights into the mechanism of binding site interactions by systematically modulating model parameters. The sna enhancer contains all relatively weak Dl binding sites and activates expression only in the presence of high Dl concentration. To dissect the role of weak versus strong sites in enhancers regulating expression under different morphogen concentrations, we varied nuclear Dl levels. Decreasing Dl concentrations in the presence of low affinity binding sites results in a very low transcriptional activity, perhaps because the TF-DNA interactions are limited both by low TF concentration and low TF-DNA affinity (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). In order to obtain high transcriptional activity under a low Dl concentration background, the affinity of the TF binding sites must be increased by a factor of 2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D). This suggests that enhancers of the genes activated by lower concentration of Dl must contain strong binding sites to maintain transcriptional activity at normal levels (Figure 3E) (Hong et al. 2008). It will be of further interest to quantitate how the induced mutations affect sna activity in the presence of reduced maternally deposited Dl levels.”</p><p>Lastly, we agree with the reviewer’s comment that the extended enhancer shows the same effects as the minimal enhancer, due to Dl/Twi’s roles as activators. These core 4 binding sites we tested seem to be sufficient to drive strong <italic>sna</italic> expression such that adding additional binding sites does not significantly alter the expression level.</p><p>We have included this in the Discussion (Page 15):</p><p>“This could be due to Dl and Twi’s roles as activators, whereas the aforementioned study investigated Gt’s role as a repressor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The equilibrium binding model is an important addition, yet is underdeveloped in the text and figures.
