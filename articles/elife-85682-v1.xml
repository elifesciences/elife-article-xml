In the past decade, the addition of routine human papillomavirus (HPV) testing to screening programs has allowed safe extension of screening intervals through greater reassurance against subsequent cancer development among patients with negative results, and also led to more precise management of patients with abnormal results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schiffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schiffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castle et al., 2018</xref>). However, longer screening intervals may lead to underscreening if patients are not recalled on schedule, and patients with high-risk medical conditions or prior abnormal screening histories need more frequent testing. The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted the ability to perform routine cancer screenings, which may threaten progress made to date at reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wentzensen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>At the onset of the pandemic, cancer screenings decreased substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poljak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith and Perkins, 2022</xref>). Nationwide, cervical cancer screening rates fell rapidly in 2020 compared with previous years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mayo et al., 2021</xref>). Limited evidence also suggests that colposcopy procedures were impacted during this time, though US data are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Istrate-Ofițeru et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masson, 2021</xref>). As the pandemic has progressed, cancer screening rates have begun to rebound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McBain et al., 2021</xref>), but considerable challenges are still present. Initially patient fear and closed clinics affected ability to perform cervical cancer screening and colposcopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Massad, 2022</xref>). Currently, lower screening rates continue due to high turnover and medical staff shortages, as well as longer wait times for scheduling appointments due to backlogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wentzensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith and Perkins, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Massad, 2022</xref>). Few studies have explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinician perceptions of cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Price et al., 2022</xref>) and colposcopy rates compared with prior to the pandemic. This paper examines the quantitative association of clinician characteristics with perceived changes in screening and colposcopy during the pandemic period. Additionally, through qualitative interviews, we explored how clinicians experienced pandemic-related changes in screening and colposcopy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Participant recruitment is detailed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vadaparampil et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, clinicians were eligible to participate if they were: (1) a physician or advanced practice provider (APP) (nurse practitioner [NP], physician assistant, or certified nurse midwife) practicing in internal medicine, family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), or women’s health; and (2) performed cervical cancer screening. Data were collected between March-August 2021 (surveys) and June-December 2021 (interviews). For context, the COVID-19 vaccine became available to healthcare providers in the US in early 2021. The US general public had widespread access to vaccination beginning in the summer of 2021. By the fall of 2021, the pandemic appeared to be less acute in the US, with healthcare organizations attempting to resume normal operations through the end of the year. Masking, social distancing and reduced capacities indoors, and enhanced cleaning procedures were public health practices in place with varying levels of intensity across the US at this time. Between March and August 2021, we recruited clinicians from: the National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women’s Health (NPWH) email listserv, a healthcare physician panel representing a variety of specialties via Dynata (an online market research firm), and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) mailing list. NPs were recruited via email blasts to NPWH listserv members (~N = 2500; ~20% response rate). ASCCP members were recruited via an external mail house using a protocol based on Dillman’s Total Design Method (N=1000; 21.8% response rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dillman, 1978</xref>). An additional ~250 OB/GYNs and ~250 Internal Medicine and Family Medicine physicians were recruited using Dynata (response rate not available). All participants were compensated. Study participants from all three sources who completed the quantitative survey were asked if they would be willing to participate in phase two of the study that included a qualitative interview. A random sample of those who indicated willingness were later contacted for participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Survey content and study variables</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vadaparampil et al., 2023</xref>), survey questions were based on Cabana’s Guideline Based Practice Improvement Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabana et al., 1999</xref>) and previous research by study co-investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perkins et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Malo et al., 2016</xref>). An expert panel (n=10), including physicians and APPs from multiple specialties reviewed the survey, and the survey was refined based on their feedback. Finally, the survey was piloted with target clinicians (N=27), revised, finalized, and distributed between March and August 2021. The survey covered several areas related to cervical cancer screening practices and management of abnormal screening results, including presentation of vignettes focused on screening intervals, management or treatment, and screening exit or continuation in relation to 2019 ASCCP risk-based management guidelines adoption, as well as a subset of items for clinicians who perform colposcopy. There were also items related to HPV self-sampling, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening and follow-up (which is the focus of the present manuscript).</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Clinician and practice characteristics</title><p>Age was measured in years and grouped into four categories. Gender identity was assessed as male, female, transgender, and other. Race was categorized as (1) Asian, (2) Black/African American, (3) White, and (4) mixed race, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, other. Ethnicity was identified as Hispanic/Latinx or non-Hispanic/Latinx. For all variables that allowed write-in/free responses, we individually examined responses to determine if they could be accurately re-classified within the pre-determined categories for each variable.</p><p>Medical training was assessed as physician (MD, DO) or APP. Medical specialties were OB/GYN, family medicine, and internal medicine for physicians, and women’s health for APPs only. We combined training and specialty variables to create one clinician type variable with four groups: OB/GYN physicians, family medicine physicians, internal medicine physicians, and APPs. Practice type included: (1) academic medical center, (2) hospital-based practice (including hospitals and military, post-operative care, and long-term care facilities), (3) private practice/group practice, (4) community health/safety net setting (included federally qualified or community health centers, planned parenthoods, public health departments, and college health centers). Geographic location included four US regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West); 9% of respondents who did not provide state or zip code were classified as non-responders.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>COVID-19 and pandemic-related behaviors and practice patterns</title><p>The survey item used for our primary outcome assessed perceptions of how the pandemic affected cervical cancer screening practices (doing fewer; the same number; or more HPV screens than before the pandemic). Participants were also asked to indicate whether they performed colposcopy (yes/no). Those who performed colposcopy then answered questions on how the pandemic affected their practices for (1) colposcopy (doing fewer; the same number; or more colposcopies than before the pandemic); and (2) loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) (provided LEEP on site before the pandemic and still doing so at same capacity; provided LEEP on site before the pandemic and still doing but at reduced capacity; provided LEEP on site before the pandemic and now are referring to another facility; have always referred to another facility for LEEP and continue to do so).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Qualitative interview development, content, and interview processes</title><p>The qualitative interview guide was developed based on Cabana’s Guideline Based Practice Improvement Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabana et al., 1999</xref>). The draft interview guide was reviewed by an expert panel (n=7) including clinicians from multiple primary care specialties. The interview guide was then refined based on expert feedback, pilot tested in a mock interview, further revised, and finalized. The final interview guide included in-depth exploration of cervical cancer screening and management items explored in the quantitative survey. We more deeply explored screening practices (barriers and facilitators to screening for each clinician’s patient panel), adherence to 2019 ASCCP guidelines (how clinicians assess if patients are due for screening, type of screening test used, screening interval used and reasoning) barriers to adoption of ASCCP guidelines, HPV self-sampling (benefits and concerns), and the impact of the pandemic on screening and management practices. Additionally, there was a subset of questions for colposcopists (on colposcopy training, LEEP self-performance versus referral, biopsy location). This manuscript focuses on qualitative findings relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on screening and abnormal results follow-up (pause and resumption of screening or follow-ups during pandemic, catching up on missed screenings). Pandemic-related items focused on how the pandemic changed cervical cancer screening practices, pauses to screening or abnormal follow-up (colposcopy or treatment services) approaches for patients who missed screening or follow-up appointments during the pandemic, including strategies for re-engagement. Three co-authors (HF, RBP, AM) trained in qualitative methodology and with expertise in cervical cancer screening conducted qualitative interviews via video conference between June and December 2021. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p><p>This study was approved by Moffitt Cancer Center’s Scientific Review Committee and was reviewed by an Institutional Review Board. The study was given exempt determination by Moffitt’s IRB, Advarra (MCC #20048), and Boston University’s IRB (BMC IRB# H-41533). All study participants viewed (for surveys) or were read (for interviews) an information sheet in lieu of reading and signing an informed consent form.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analytic plan</title><sec id="s2-4-1"><title>Quantitative analyses</title><p>We assessed descriptive statistics of clinician and practice characteristics and behaviors. We conducted separate binomial logistic regressions examining the associations of clinician and practice characteristics with responses to items assessing the impact of the pandemic on reported number of cervical cancer screening and on colposcopies (doing the same or more versus fewer than before the pandemic). Age, race, ethnicity, gender, region, clinician type, and practice type were included in the full model for each outcome, as clinician characteristics have previously been associated with cervical cancer screening practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becerra-Culqui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haas et al., 2021</xref>). For all logistic regression models, we used manual backward selection to individually remove variables exceeding a p-value of 0.10 from each model, but determined a priori that clinician type, practice type, and region would be retained in all models regardless of the corresponding p-values based on the importance of these factors in determining screening and colposcopy practices during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becerra-Culqui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horner et al., 2011</xref>). Given the few studies that have explored factors associated with clinician perspectives of changes in cervical cancer screenings and colposcopies during the pandemic, we selected a value for inclusion and significance of 0.10. This strikes a balance between the commonly accepted method of using the AIC (Akaike’s information criterion, which implicitly assumes a significance level of 0.157), and the often-used significance level of 0.05. Quantitative analyses were conducted in SPSS Version 26.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-2"><title>Qualitative analyses</title><p>Pandemic-related qualitative interview items were coded using thematic content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Elo and Kyngäs, 2008</xref>). A priori codes were developed based on the questions in the initial interview guide and a codebook was developed to operationalize and define each code. The qualitative analysis team independently reviewed the data twice. In the first coding pass, the team hand-coded the data with the initial codes and made notes on possible new codes. After the first round of coding, they discussed notes on possible new codes. After reaching consensus, the codes were revised and they again independently reviewed the transcripts and updated code categories from the first coding pass. The second coding pass serves to ‘clean up’ codes unanticipated in the first coding pass and identify emergent themes not identified in the initial coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krueger, 1998</xref>). All transcripts were coded by at least two coders. Coding discrepancies were resolved by discussion in weekly group meetings to achieve consensus. Coding was conducted in a shared data sheet for ease of completing coding in a centralized database across varying institutions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Quantitative findings</title><p>Potential participants (N=1373) viewed the study information sheet and completed screening items; 103 were ineligible due to not performing cervical cancer screening or having an ineligible training/specialty (e.g., pharmacy).

In the final model, older age, non-White race, family or internal medicine physician specialty, and practicing in a community health/safety net setting were significantly associated with the likelihood of reporting reductions in cervical cancer screenings in 2021 compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. Older age was associated with reported reductions in cervical cancer screening (p&lt;0.001). Compared with clinicians over age 60, younger age groups were significantly less likely to report reduced cervical cancer screenings (&lt;40 [aOR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33–0.66, p=0.000], 40–59 [aOR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46–0.90, p=0.009], 50–59 [aOR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.97, p=0.029]). Race was marginally associated with reported reduced cervical cancer screening (p=0.085). Compared with White clinicians, Black (aOR 1.65, 95% CI: 0.96–2.84, p=0.070) and mixed race/other clinicians (aOR = 1.69, 95% CI<italic>:</italic> 0.99–2.88, p=0.055) more frequently reported reduced screenings. Clinician type was significantly associated with odds of reporting reduced screening during the pandemic (p&lt;0.001). Compared with OB/GYN physicians, reduced screening was more frequently reported by internal medicine (aOR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.62–4.13, p&lt;0.001) and family medicine physicians (aOR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.14–2.36, p=0.008). Practice type was significantly associated with odds of reporting reduced screening during the pandemic (p=0.014). Compared with those in private practice, those practicing in community health/safety net settings more often reported reduced screening (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.17–2.23, p=0.003).

Themes included reductions in screening, rebound to pre-pandemic levels, and tracking systems for patient follow-up. Nearly all clinicians described reductions in screening early in the pandemic. Sub-themes included closures of primary care services, prioritization of acute problems over well visits, prioritization of abnormal Pap test results over routine screening, patient fears of contracting COVID-19 if they visited a medical setting, and the shift to telehealth limiting in person services. One clinician stated: “My clinic was stopping…annual wellness exams for a 6-month time period. So, there were a lot of patients that were kind of put off during that time period” (APP, practice not specified). Another described prioritization of colposcopy visits based on the severity of the Pap result: “As soon as we were able to provide those services, we prioritized the visit based on the Pap result. So, high-grade had a high priority to come in for the colpo[scopy] before the low grade” (APP, private practice). Another described both the impact of telemedicine and prioritization of illness over wellness care: “At the beginning of the pandemic, we were exclusively telemedicine for a few months and then as we were opening up office visits, cervical cancer screening was not the highest priority. It was more so our chronic care patients” (MD/DO family medicine, safety net setting). Participants also described patient concerns: “They don’t wanna come into the health department because they think we’re full of COVID germs or something” (APP, safety net setting). Others noted that patient volumes had not recovered: “It is still a little less.

With COVID, they weren't coming. I think people are catching up now. This year, we’re seeing more volume. More patients coming for their annuals and their Pap smears; I think we are back up to the pre COVID volume” (MD/DO family medicine, private practice). Some described feeling inundated with cervical cancer screening: “I’m just the non-stop Pap clinic” (APP, safety net setting). Some clinicians noted that patients were less fearful of attending medical care after widespread vaccination.</p><p>When asked what prompted patients to return for screening, clinicians reported a range of practices related to patient outreach and tracking systems. Some clinicians reported using the electronic medical record to outreach to patients, though more reported using a combination of patient lists and outreach via staff phone calls: “We still maintained our rescreen list and our no-show list, and we recalled those patients” (APP, safety net setting). Concerningly, several clinicians did not believe they had a reliable system for tracking patients who had missed screenings: “Once they cancel or don’t show up, they do lose the follow up” (MD/DO OB/Gyn, private practice), or were unaware of what system their staff might be using to track missed screenings. Some indicated that patients were responsible for making and rescheduling appointments: “We just sent people notices saying ‘she’s [the doctor’s] back in the office. Hook up if you need to’” (APP, private practice).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined quantitative and qualitative data related to the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cervical cancer screening and abnormal follow-ups in a large, national sample of clinicians who provide these services. Over 1 year into the pandemic, almost half of clinicians still reported a reduction in cervical cancer screenings (47%) and colposcopies (44%) as compared to the time preceding the pandemic. These findings are salient because at the time of our study most lockdown restrictions had been lifted and healthcare institutions had returned to near pre-pandemic level of operations, albeit with masking and social distancing in place. Qualitative themes indicated that some clinicians’ patient screening volumes were similar to or exceeding pre-pandemic levels as they caught up on backlogs, while others were slower to return to pre-pandemic cervical cancer screening and management. Many faced challenges associated with follow-up and tracking systems for overdue patients.</p><p>Clinician age, clinician type, and practice setting were significantly associated with reports of performing fewer cervical cancer screenings during the pandemic, with similar but marginal associations with race. Clinicians over age 60 more often reported fewer screenings than younger clinicians. This could indicate that older clinicians were more cautious in returning to in-person care such as cervical cancer screenings, perhaps due to their own health concerns over age-related susceptibility to severe COVID-19 complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dessie and Zewotir, 2021</xref>). Internal and family medicine physicians more often reported reduced cervical cancer screening compared with OB/GYN physicians. The need for internal and family medicine physicians to care for COVID-19 patients and other acute health issues may have impacted their ability to provide preventive or well care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Turner et al., 2022</xref>), including cervical cancer screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). We also found that clinicians in safety net settings like community health centers and health departments more often reported reduced screenings <italic>and</italic> colposcopies during the pandemic. Concerningly, this may indicate worsening disparities in cancer prevention care in settings that serve patients with the highest cervical cancer rates: lower resourced and historically marginalized communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moss et al., 2022</xref>). These findings are supported by recent literature indicating that federally qualified health center settings suffered staffing losses and other challenges during the pandemic which led to reductions in cancer screenings due to postponement of preventive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher-Borne et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we found that mixed race/other and Black clinicians had a marginally associated, but higher likelihood of reporting reduced cervical cancer screenings compared to White clinicians, independent of other factors such as age, gender, region, medical specialty, and practice setting. There is a paucity of literature on differences in screening practices by clinician race/ethnicity, and additional research would be helpful to further explore these findings.</p><p>When focusing only on clinicians who perform colposcopy, we found that internal medicine physicians more often reported reduced colposcopies compared to other specialties. The need for internal medicine physicians to address more acute patient issues may have contributed to reported reductions in both screening and colposcopy. We also found a marginal association indicating that male clinicians more often reported reduced colposcopy than female clinicians. Some practices and/or states have varying guidelines around chaperone requirements during pelvic exams and procedures, which may have impacted the ability to perform colposcopy. This finding warrants further exploration. Our data also indicated reductions in providing office-based treatment for cervical precancer (e.g., LEEP). In some offices the extra staffing and cleaning associated with performing a LEEP may have led to reduced availability or a need to refer out to another facility during the pandemic. Together these findings highlight perceived reductions in cervical cancer preventive care overall, but were more prevalent among certain specialties and practice settings. Further research is needed to confirm and explore these findings.</p><p>Qualitative interview findings provide insight into factors that contributed to screening reductions, as well as the trajectory of care in different phases of the pandemic. Participants highlighted strategies used to mitigate the impact of clinic closures or reduced capacity during the pandemic, including prioritization of seeing patients with high-grade abnormal results during periods when care was restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wentzensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masson, 2021</xref>). As COVID-19-related restrictions were lifted, clinicians described implementing extended weekday hours or weekend screening only clinics as they caught up on screenings and compensated for social distancing/reduced capacity restrictions. The introduction or expansion of telehealth during the pandemic was described as helpful with addressing acute concerns while minimizing infection risk. Consistent with prior literature, however, clinicians reported that telemedicine hindered cervical cancer screening because patients were not physically attending clinic where opportunistic screening could occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Price et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Return to screening and the ability to recall overdue patients varied greatly. Some clinicians described an overabundance of patients returning to clinical care, while others described challenges with reaching patients who were overdue for screening or follow-up care for abnormal results. Several described staffing shortages that impacted screening, consistent with rapid turnover and a reduction in the healthcare workforce since the beginning of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Massad, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falatah, 2021</xref>). While some clinicians reported having a formal tracking system to determine which patients need screening and follow-up, others emphasized limitations of tracking and outreach, such as electronic medical record limitations and the time-intensive burden of outreach for staff. Several clinicians were unaware of whether they had a tracking system for overdue screenings, or how patient recall was implemented.</p><p>Together these findings highlight perceived reductions in cervical cancer preventive care throughout the cancer prevention continuum of screening, diagnosis via colposcopy, and treatment via LEEP. If not addressed, reductions in cancer prevention services could lead to increased cancer incidence in the future. It is well known that cancer screenings in the US decreased dramatically at the height of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poljak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith and Perkins, 2022</xref>), with cervical cancer screening rates dropping in 2020 compared with previous years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mayo et al., 2021</xref>). As the pandemic progressed, cancer screening rates started to rebound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McBain et al., 2021</xref>), but our findings highlight challenges that still exist for cervical cancer screening and colposcopy. Interestingly, similar challenges in getting back to screening and treatment have been observed in low- and middle-income countries, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Villain et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, reductions in screening and follow-up were reported overall, but were more prevalent among internal medicine physicians and community health/safety net settings of care. Because current cervical cancer screening requires an in-person exam and sometimes a chaperone, it is relatively labor-intensive process for primary care clinicians compared to other screenings that require only laboratory orders or referrals. The ability for patients to self-collect vaginal specimens for HPV testing could be one method of reducing workforce burden and increasing access to cervical cancer screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuzzell et al., 2021</xref>). Some countries currently use self-sampling within larger population-based screening programs to reach individuals who have barriers to screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbyn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Serrano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inturrisi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>This study has several inherent strengths and weaknesses. As noted in our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vadaparampil et al., 2023</xref>), this sample includes both primary care and OB/GYN physicians, and APPs who conduct cervical cancer screening across various practice settings and regions of the US. We worked with both ASCCP and NPWH in order to ensure sufficient samples of both physicians who perform colposcopy and APPs, who are often overlooked in clinician surveys. Survey data were supplemented with more in-depth exploration via qualitative interviews; the large sample of survey respondents coupled with a relatively large qualitative sample eliciting rich responses are core strengths of this study. Although not originally targeted at assessing changes in screening and colposcopy during the pandemic, we included items to assess provider perceptions of these impacts because of early literature suggesting a drop in screenings with slow rebound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McBain et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, to our knowledge, this is the first US report detailing changes in colposcopy practices during the pandemic, a unique addition to the literature. These strengths are tempered by some limitations. The majority of the sample were White and non-Hispanic, although these characteristics reflect characteristics of healthcare providers in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">United States Census Bureau, 2022</xref>). Next, 9% of the full sample did not respond to geographic location items, thus this gap in data may have limited our ability to detect differences surrounding region- and pandemic-related differences in screening and colposcopy. Finally, self-report surveys have inherent biases and may not be actual representations of screening and colposcopy practices that could be ascertained via medical record or claims databases.</p><p>These findings highlight that nearly half of clinicians reported performing fewer cervical cancer screenings and colposcopies compared to before the pandemic. This is particularly concerning as this survey occurred more than 1 year into the pandemic, after lockdowns had been lifted and when widespread vaccination was available. Persistent reductions in screening and colposcopy could lead to increases in cervical cancer incidence in the near future. Additional research should track whether cervical cancer screening services have continued to recover, and whether inequities in recovery exist that could worsen cervical cancer disparities.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was approved by Moffitt Cancer Center's Scientific Review Committee and was reviewed by an Institutional Review Board.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Shellenberger (Reviewer #2); Patricia Villain (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more detailed description of the &quot;parent&quot; survey questionnaire instrument and its purpose would be warranted.</p><p>2) Nuance results regarding race as a significant predictor as confidence intervals overlap with the null hypothesis.</p><p>3) Discuss potential biases in using a survey to gather this data.</p><p>4) Provide more context for an international audience regarding the impact and public health measures of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA during the study period.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be helpful if the survey and interview instruments were provided.</p><p>A general description of the &quot;parent&quot; survey questionnaire instrument and its purpose would be helpful.</p><p>Comments specific to quantitative analysis (association between clinician characteristics and perceived changes in screening and colposcopy):</p><p>– A figure of participant enrollment and selection of the analytic sample is provided but not referred to in the manuscript text.</p><p>– Table 1 is a descriptive table of the three related study populations, as colposcopists and interviewed clinicians each constitute a subgroup of the total sample. However, the authors compared their characteristics, instead of comparing the characteristics of colposcopists to non-colposcopists for example. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>– I agree with the authors' decision to force clinician type, practice type, and geographic region into the stepwise logistic regression models, but for the other variables (such as age, race, and ethnicity) the rationale for considering these as important determinants of screening and colposcopy practices during the pandemic is not presented.</p><p>– A simple graphical presentation of the three questions (impact on cervical cancer screening practice, colposcopy practice, ability to provide LEEP) by the more relevant variables (clinician type, practice type, and geographic region) would have been informative.</p><p>– Tables 3 (reduced screenings) and 4 (reduced colposcopies) could be combined, keeping only the odds ratios and confidence intervals columns (removing the other redundant columns).</p><p>Comments specific to qualitative analysis (how clinicians experienced pandemic-related changes in screening and colposcopy):</p><p>– Similar to the survey, the included qualitative interview items are part of a larger interview guide, of which details are lacking both on the overall and included interview items.</p><p>– How much overlap was there in the quantitative and qualitative components of the study?

I am very impressed with the magnitude of this survey and the amount of demographic data acquired.</p><p>I would recommend nuancing the finding of Black and Asian providers as having statistically significant reductions in cervical cancer screening since the confidence intervals cross one in both instances for these. OR I would also add in some discussion about the inherent weaknesses in a survey study as well as potential biases which may exist. I would also take out the comment about regional differences in the way the pandemic was handled in different geographic regions in the US unless you have a statistic to support this statement. I understand your passion, but this statement shows some biases by the authors which may be not well received in certain areas and take away from the importance of your work.</p><p>Thank you for this well-done survey study. Your diligence and attention to detail in the statistical analysis are noteworthy. This is truly valuable public health information and a significant contribution to the field of cancer screening.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Because the study was conducted in 2021, some questions/points should be addressed to increase the overall impact of the work:</p><p>1) Highlight the context of the study: what was the situation in terms of the pandemic in the US when the study was conducted? This should be put in front in the introduction and results should be discussed regarding this context;</p><p>2) Results should be discussed in the light of what is already known/foreseen in terms of covid impact on cervical cancer screening and on cervical cancer;</p><p>3) It would be interesting to discuss these results i.e. obtained from a high-income country, compared to what was reported from low- and medium-income countries e.g. in terms of disruption of services, active follow-up of patients (https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.33500);</p><p>4) Would results gained from this study be beneficial to improve cervical cancer screening or/and to health system responses to the pandemic?</p><p>5) Results of the survey suggest that inequality of cervical cancer screening access might have increased due to covid pandemic; do the authors have any comment on it?</p><p>The discussion should be revised to address the points listed above.

In addition to the full quantitative study population, we conducted interviews with a sub-sample of participants who completed surveys, and asked a sub-set of questions to colposcopists around their experience with colposcopy and LEEP procedures during the pandemic. Thus, we include descriptive statistics of each population or sub-population of interest, to correspond to the components of the study on which we report. We did not elect to report descriptive statistics on their counterparts, because these were not sub-groups of interest. (For example, we did not think it would be useful to present statistics on the portion of the sample who completed the quantitative survey, but not the qualitative survey.)
