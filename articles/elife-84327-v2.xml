Phase variation mechanisms can overcome this difficulty by altering genomic architecture in a subset of individuals, creating a phenotypically heterogeneous population with subpopulations optimized to persist when conditions change, or are encountered, suddenly. We have identified a phase variation system in <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> that generates a genotypically and phenotypically heterogeneous population. Genetic analyses revealed that RecA-mediated homologous recombination between a pair of insertion sequence (IS) <italic>2</italic>-like elements duplicates a 208.6 kb region of DNA that contains 157 coding sequences. RecA-mediated homologous recombination also resolves merodiploids, and hence copy number of the region is varied and dynamic within populations. We showed that the presence of two or more copies of the region is advantageous for growth in a biofilm, and a single copy is advantageous during planktonic growth. While IS elements are well known to contribute to evolution through gene inactivation, polar effects on downstream genes, and altering genomic architecture, we believe that this system represents a rare example of IS element-mediated evolution in which the IS elements provide homologous sequences for amplification of a chromosomal region that provides a selective advantage under specific growth conditions, thereby expanding the lifestyle repertoire of the species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacterial populations are often diverse, even when originating from a single cell. This diversity helps microbes survive in fluctuating environmental conditions by increasing the odds of population survival. For example, if environmental conditions change such that only a subpopulation with unique abilities survives, the entire population will be saved.</p><p>Genomes are naturally dynamic. For example, mobile sections of DNA, called transposable elements, can change their position within a genome. If a transposable element jumps into a gene, it can harm the cell. But if it moves into a different site, it may provide an organism with new features that can help it survive.</p><p>Most organisms contain multiple copies of transposable elements in their DNA. For example, a subtype of the soil bacterium <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>, strain E264, has two identical transposable elements that book-end a region of DNA that contains 157 genes. Lowrey et al. studied this bacterial strain in different environmental conditions to find out more. The experiments revealed that in growing populations of E264, some bacteria had one copy of the region, while others had two or three. In a rich environment, most bacteria had just one copy of the region. However, when grown in challenging conditions, most bacteria contained two or three copies of the region.</p><p>Moreover, bacteria required at least two copies to form dense communities known as biofilms, which are advantageous for bacterial survival in challenging conditions. Bacteria with only one copy, however, were better adapted to a free-swimming lifestyle.</p><p>Lowrey et al. further showed that the DNA repair system was required for duplicating the region. Usually, this system finds and recombines identical DNA sequences to repair broken DNA. However, if two identical DNA sequences (a pair of transposable elements) are present, the repair system can recombine them during DNA replication, resulting in the duplication of the DNA between the identical sequences. The same system also reduces the copy number of the region from three or two to just one.</p><p>Since the repair system is constantly working and DNA recombination is always occurring at a low level, <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> E264 maintains a genetically diverse population with bacteria containing different copy numbers of the region. This diversity ensures that the strain survives in fluctuating environmental conditions.</p><p>Transposable elements are hotspots of evolution. They are known to interrupt genes and shrink genomes. Lowrey et al. showed that transposable elements also influence evolution by providing DNA sequences that the DNA repair system can use to duplicate DNA. This process of duplicating genes is more frequent than random genetic mutations, expediting adaptation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic></kwd><kwd>bet hedging</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>phenotypic heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>phase variation</kwd><kwd>genetic heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotter</surname><given-names>Peggy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM121110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotter</surname><given-names>Peggy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Some <italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> strains have evolved a bet-hedging strategy by acquiring insertion sequences positioned such that RecA-dependent homologous recombination between them results in duplication of intervening sequences, which promotes biofilm formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbes often exist in complex communities wherein productivity and resilience rely on population diversity. This diversity commonly appears as mixed-species populations. However, diversity can also exist within otherwise clonal populations through genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can increase the fitness of a population by contributing to the division of labor, or it can serve as a bet-hedging strategy to increase the odds of population survival when alteration of environmental conditions, such as nutrient availability, host response, or antimicrobial concentrations, occur quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Magdanova and Golyasnaya, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A common facilitator of phenotypic heterogeneity is phase variation, in which reversible genetic alterations occur that function as âON/OFFâ switches that control specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Woude, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van der Woude and BÃ¤umler, 2004</xref>). These genetic alterations typically occur at frequencies that are orders of magnitude greater than spontaneous mutations. One common generator of phenotypic heterogeneity is recombinase-mediated, site-specific recombination, such as invertible switches and transposable elements, which can influence the expression of coding sequences by altering the orientation of promoters or introducing new regulatory sequences, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Trzilova and Tamayo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schneider and Lenski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darmon and Leach, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Phenotypic heterogeneity within a population can also be achieved by recombination between homologous sequences at different genomic loci, a phenomenon referred to as unequal or non-allelic recombination. Unlike site-specific recombination, which relies on a specific recombinase catalyzing strand exchange between specific target sequences, any homologous sequences greater than 50 bp can act as substrates for unequal homologous recombination. These homologous sequence substrates are often ribosomal RNA operons or transposable elements, which are commonly found in multiple copies per genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Raeside et al., 2014</xref>). The DNA repair and maintenance recombinase, RecA, identifies homologous sequences and catalyzes strand exchange which, when unequal homologous sequences are recombined, leads to modifications in genomic architecture through sequence inversions, deletions, or duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darmon and Leach, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourque et al., 2018</xref>). These adjustments to genome architecture can similarly influence the orientation of promoters through sequence inversion, but also change copy number of genes by deleting and duplicating intervening sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vandecraen et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in gene copy number can impact protein production, and thus cell phenotypes â a phenomenon referred to as gene dosage effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in a wide range of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> species. The bioterrorism agent <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic> displays at least seven distinct morphologies when propagated on Ashdownâs agar, and virulence-associated phenotypes, such as intracellular survival, colonization ability, and antigen presentation, differ between the various morphotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chantratita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tandhavanant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wikraiphat et al., 2015</xref>). The cystic fibrosis-associated opportunistic pathogen <italic>B. cenocepacia</italic> similarly exhibits phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity during growth in the lab as well as during growth in the cystic fibrosis lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">HÃ¤ussler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Springman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> strain E264 (<italic>Bt</italic>E264) displays distinct phenotypes, including aggregation, biofilm formation, Congo Red binding, and the production of a gold-brown âpigmentâ, that were attributed initially to the activity of the <italic>bcpAIOB</italic>-encoded contact-dependent inhibition system and hence we named them contact-dependent signaling phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent analyses, however, showed that these phenotypes occur when a 208.6 kb region on chromosome I that contains 157 predicted coding sequences plus one of the flanking IS<italic>2</italic>-like elements (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is present in two or more copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ocasio and Cotter, 2019</xref>), so we will now refer to those phenotypes as duplication-dependent phenotypes. Our previous data suggested that amplification of the 208.6 kb region required BcpAIOB activity and the IS<italic>2</italic>-like element at the 5â² end (ISÎ²), and that the region amplified as extrachromosomal, circular DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ocasio and Cotter, 2019</xref>). Our investigations into the mechanism underlying the amplification, however, caused us to completely re-evaluate our previous conclusions. Here, we present data indicating that <italic>Bt</italic>E264 possesses a homologous recombination-mediated phase variation mechanism that facilitates rapid adaptation to disparate growth conditions by altering the copy number of the 208.6 kb region on chromosome I in a manner that is independent of both ISÎ² and BcpAIOB activity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic> E264 from ATCC is a genotypically heterogeneous population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of the 208.6 kb duplicating region bounded by homologous IS<italic>2</italic>-like elements referred to as ISÎ² (LO74_RS09425) and ISÎ± (LO74_RS28540).

To assess the potential heterogeneity of our stock, we conducted PCR analyses on individual colonies after plating an aliquot of the stock on LSLB agar. To detect the presence of multiple copies of the 208.6 kb region, we use outward-facing primers that anneal near the ends of the 208.6 kb region, but not within the IS elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Junc1 and Junc2). PCR with these primers yields a 2.2 kb DNA product containing one IS element flanked by the 5â² and 3â² ends of the region if two or more copies of the region are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ocasio and Cotter, 2019</xref>). While a product of the expected 1 kb size was amplified from all colonies when control primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Ctrl 1 and Ctrl 2) were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the 2.2-kb âjunction PCRâ product was obtained from only approximately 50% of the colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that our <italic>Bt</italic>E264 stock from ATCC is a genotypically heterogeneous population with approximately half of the bacteria containing a single copy of the 208.6 kb region and half containing two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region.</p><p>To determine if this genotypic heterogeneity is unique to our stock of <italic>Bt</italic>E264, we conducted PCR analyses on colonies of <italic>Bt</italic>E264 that we obtained from three separate laboratories. Junction PCR products of the expected 2.2 kb size were obtained for 0/12, 6/12, and 6/12 colonies from <italic>Bt</italic>E264 obtained from the Mougous, Chandler, and Manoil laboratories, respectively, while all colonies yielded 1 kb PCR products when the control primers were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>). We suspect that the difference in stocks between laboratories can be explained by how the laboratories prepared their wild-type frozen stocks. Each laboratory had obtained its sample of <italic>Bt</italic>E264 from ATCC, suggesting that the ATCC stock of <italic>Bt</italic>E264 is a genotypically heterogeneous population composed of bacteria with either a single (âjunction PCR negativeâ) or multiple (âjunction PCR positiveâ) copies of the 208.6 kb region.</p><p>A small number of other <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> strains for which genome sequence is available also possess an IS-bounded region similar to that in <italic>Bt</italic>E264. Two of these strains, 2002721643 and 2002721723, have genomic synteny of 99.0% and 98.9% and region synteny of 96.2% and 96.3% compared to <italic>Bt</italic>E264, respectively. We conducted PCR analyses on colonies from 2002721643 and 2002721723.

For example, the brownish-gold coloration developed after 28 days in colony biofilms established by bacteria from raised (junction PCR positive) colonies, but not in colony biofilms established by bacteria from flat (junction PCR negative) colonies, while colony biofilms established by bacteria taken directly from our frozen stock developed the brownish-gold coloration in the center and in alternating areas radiating outward from the original spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When grown in M63 medium on a roller, bacteria from raised colonies, but not flat colonies, aggregated and adhered to the walls of the test tube at the airâliquid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Aggregation was apparent in the culture initiated with bacteria from our stock of <italic>Bt</italic>E264, but it was substantially less than that of the culture from raised colonies. These data further demonstrate the heterogeneity of our stock of <italic>Bt</italic>E264 and confirm previous observations that specific phenotypes correlate with the presence of two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The 208.6 kb region is present as directly oriented, tandem repeats in the chromosome of junction PCR positive bacteria</title><p>We previously concluded that the 208.6 kb region amplified as extrachromosomal, circular, DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ocasio and Cotter, 2019</xref>). However, subsequent genetic experiments investigating the requirements for the formation of the extrachromosomal circle led us to question that conclusion. To distinguish between extrachromosomal circles and tandem duplications in the chromosome (both of which would generate the same junction and hence yield the same junction PCR product), we engineered strains with unique I-<italic>Sce</italic>I restriction endonuclease sites located approximately 50 kb outside the boundaries of the 208.6 kb region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Agarose plugs of cultures from flat, raised rough, and raised smooth colonies containing the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I sites were digested with I-<italic>Sce</italic>I, then the DNA was separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A single band of ~310 kb was present in I-<italic>Sce</italic>I-digested DNA from flat colonies, indicating the presence of one copy of the 208.6 kb region in the chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). I-<italic>Sce</italic>I digestion of DNA from raised rough colonies resulted in a prominent band of ~520 kb, and faint bands of ~310 and ~730 kb. This result indicates that a majority of the bacteria in the raised rough colony contain two tandem copies of the 208.6 kb region, and minor populations in the colony contain either a single copy (~310 kb band) of the region or three tandem copies (~730 kb band) of the region. DNA from the raised smooth colonies yielded a prominent ~730 kb band, with faint bands corresponding to ~520, ~310, and ~970 kb, indicating that a majority of the bacteria in raised smooth colonies contain three copies of the 208.6 kb region. No bands of ~210 kb, the size expected for an extrachromosomal circle, were detected in any sample. While junction PCR suggests that tandem repeats are oriented in a direct orientation, we wanted to further verify the directionality of the duplications. Plugs from flat, raised rough, and raised smooth colonies were digested with <italic>Spe</italic>I which is native to a locus ~143 kb within the duplicating region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Directionality of the duplication will lead to differently sized fragments (~208 kb for a direct orientation and ~132 kb for an inverted orientation). We observed ~208 kb fragments indicating that the region amplifies as directly oriented copies. Our data demonstrate that the 208.6 kb region is present in directly oriented tandem copies in the chromosome and not extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules. These results suggest that amplification and resolution of the 208.6 kb region within a growing population of bacteria is dynamic. For simplicity, we will henceforth refer to junction PCR positive bacteria (which contain two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region) as Dup<sup>+</sup> and junction PCR negative bacteria (which contain a single copy of the region) as Dup<sup>â</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The duplication is present as a directly oriented tandem repeat of the 208.6 kb region in the chromosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of <italic>Bt</italic>E264 with engineered unique I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut sites ~50 kb outside of the 208.6 kb duplicating region creating differently sized fragments depending on the form of the duplication.

To test this hypothesis, we constructed a reporter strain in which we inserted <italic>gusA</italic> adjacent to the unique junction in a Dup<sup>+</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The product of <italic>gusA</italic> hydrolyzes X-Gluc, releasing chloro-bromindigo and resulting in the formation of blue colonies.

Homologous recombination can occur during DNA replication, through either unequal crossing over or during the repair of a collapsed replication fork to create DNA duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bzymek and Lovett, 2001</xref>). While replication fork repair leads to a deletion or duplication of the DNA region between the homologous sequences, unequal crossing over will generate one daughter chromosome with a duplication and one daughter chromosome with a deletion of those sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hastings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bzymek and Lovett, 2001</xref>). If at least one essential gene is present within the region, the daughter cell containing the chromosome with the deletion will be non-viable. To further evaluate if RecA-dependent recombination is duplicating the region, we developed a âfragmented reporter systemâ. We replaced ISÎ² with a 5â² portion of <italic>nptII</italic> and ISÎ± with a 3â² portion of <italic>nptII</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The amount of overlap (in the center of <italic>nptII</italic>) in the strains varied between 500 and 0 bp. Recombination between the overlapping homologous sequences will result in the formation of an intact <italic>nptII</italic> gene, which will confer resistance to kanamycin (Km<sup>R</sup>). The Km<sup>R</sup> cfu and total cfu were obtained after overnight growth in LSLB and the proportion of Km<sup>R</sup> colonies was calculated (Km<sup>R</sup> cfu/total cfu = proportion Km<sup>R</sup> colonies) as 10<sup>â4</sup>, 10<sup>â6</sup>, and 10<sup>â7</sup> for the strains with 500, 150, and 50 bp of homology, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The strain lacking homology produced no Km<sup>R</sup> colonies. These data indicate that duplication of the region occurs by RecA-dependent recombination between homologous sequences, independent of the specific sequence. Thus, the inverted repeats of ISÎ± and ISÎ² are not required for duplication of the region, unless they are the only source of DNA sequence homology.

Resolution of tandem copies to a single copy also occurs by RecA-mediated homologous recombination.

This phenomenon, therefore, represents a bet-hedging strategy to improve population survival in fluctuating environments.

Because biofilms can contribute to human disease and can cause environmental harm, it is important to understand mechanisms underlying their formation and maintenance. Our data indicate that the presence of two or more copies of the 208.6 kb region promotes biofilm formation, suggesting that the responsible gene(s) act as an insufficient haplotype when the region is present in single copy. The 157 genes within the region are functionally diverse: they include gene, or gene clusters, predicted to encode defense systems, antimicrobial resistance, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid biosynthesis, transport, and metabolism pathways, and transcription regulators. Determining which gene(s), when present in two or more copies, facilitates biofilm formation will be our next goal. Genes encoding regulatory factors, such as predicted transcription regulators <italic>lysR</italic> and <italic>luxR</italic>, are likely candidates as alteration in copy number can push signaling pathways over a threshold, leading to large changes in gene expression for all genes within the regulon. Other candidate genes include those predicted to encode fimbria or a polysaccharide transport system, which may be directly involved in biofilm formation, but whether two or three copies of these genes is sufficient for biofilm formation seems unlikely, although we cannot rule it out. While biofilm-associated growth is a single condition benefited by duplication of the 208.6 kb region, we anticipate that duplications may benefit cells in other conditions. For example, we do not know the nature or function of the molecule(s) causing the gold-brown coloration that correlates with the presence of multiple copies of the region, but we speculate that it may be advantageous for the bacteria under conditions other than, or in addition to, biofilm formation and maintenance. The diversity of predicted gene functions within the duplicating region suggests that amplification has potential to benefit <italic>Bt</italic>E264 in multiple environments.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84327-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the absence of a functional phase variation system (i.e., the Dup<sup>â</sup>-locked strain), <italic>Bt</italic>E264 was still able to form a biofilm in the dynamic, test tube format, but it did so at a much slower rate compared to Dup<sup>â</sup> bacteria. The delay is consistent with these bacteria acquiring spontaneous mutations, which occur at much lower frequencies than homologous recombination. Also consistent with these bacteria possessing spontaneous, biofilm-promoting mutations, the colonies recovered from those biofilms appeared mucoid, and preliminary data indicate they form biofilms at least as fast as Dup<sup>+</sup> bacteria. Identifying the genetic alterations in these biofilm-forming, Dup<sup>â</sup>-locked strains will shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying biofilm formation and will help us determine why duplication of the region positively influences biofilm formation.</p><p>Copy number dynamics differed within populations growing in static versus dynamic biofilms. In dynamic (culture tube-associated) biofilms, duplication of the region provided a strong selective advantage; bacteria that lost the duplication were not maintained in the biofilm and dispersed into the planktonic population. By contrast, in static (submerged coverslip) biofilms, the selective advantage was not as apparent, even though Dup<sup>+</sup> bacteria clearly formed more robust biofilms and did so more quickly than Dup<sup>â</sup> bacteria. In static biofilms initiated with Dup<sup>+</sup> bacteria, Dup<sup>â</sup> bacteria arose and were maintained for at least for 3 days. Moreover, static biofilms initiated with Dup<sup>â</sup> cells did not contain an appreciable number of Dup<sup>+</sup> cells over the course of the experiment.

Although we were previously unable to definitively determine the form of the 206.8 kb duplication, we concluded that the extra copies likely existed as extrachromosomal circular DNA molecules based on the fact that IS<italic>2</italic> elements transpose using a copy-out-paste-in mechanism and the observation that the region mobilized to a locus in chromosome II when we attempted to delete the 206.8 kb region from chromosome I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ocasio and Cotter, 2019</xref>). Our PFGE data prove that the region is present as tandem, directly oriented copies in the chromosome in Dup<sup>+</sup> bacteria, and we have also now shown that the transposases encoded by ISÎ± and ISÎ² are not required for amplification of the region. Extrachromosomal, circular copies of the region will occur, however, when homologous recombination resolves merodiploids (tandem duplications) to a single copy, and these circular DNA molecules can integrate into the chromosome by homologous recombination between the IS element in the circular molecule and any of the four or two IS<italic>2</italic>-like elements in chromosome I or II, respectively. Although such an event would be rare, our attempt to delete essential genes within the 206.8 kb region apparently provided the necessary selective pressure, explaining how the region moved to chromosome II in our previous study.</p><p>Our previous conclusion that BcpA activity is required for amplification of the 208.6 kb region was based on the fact that strains with mutations that inactivate BcpA (e.g., deletion of the <italic>bcpAIOB</italic> locus or replacement of codons in <italic>bcpA</italic> required for BcpA catalytic activity) were junction PCR negative and did not display duplication-dependent phenotypes, and strains in which <italic>bcpAIOB</italic> was driven by the S12 promoter were strongly junction PCR positive and did display duplication-dependent phenotypes. It is now clear that when we constructed the BcpA-inactivating mutants (by either two-step allelic exchange or natural transformation and double homologous recombination) we chose Dup<sup>â</sup> strains when we confirmed that the mutants contained the intended mutations and not the wild-type sequences. When we introduced the S12 promoter 5â² to <italic>bcpAIOB</italic> through natural transformation<italic>,</italic> however<italic>,</italic> we confirmed that the S12 promoter was present at the intended location, but had no knowledge at the time that there could be another copy of the locus in the chromosome, so, by chance, had chosen a Dup<sup>+</sup> strain. Our data now clearly show that duplication-dependent phenotypes are due to the duplication of the region and not BcpAIOB activity.</p><p>Bacterial populations are often more genotypically heterogeneous than presumed. It is estimated that 10% of cells in a growing culture carry a duplication of some region of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roth et al., 1996</xref>). Unfortunately, standard alignment techniques call out SNPs, deletions, and inversions, but not duplications. Identifying duplications requires close attention to sequencing read abundance or long-read sequencing, and hence they are often missed, even when their existence is considered a possibility. Because duplications have the potential to alter a wide variety of phenotypes, they can lead to flawed conclusions when cells with and without DNA duplications are unknowingly compared. Discovering the 208.6 kb DNA duplication in <italic>Bt</italic>E264 allowed us to correct some of our previous conclusions, and also sheds light on other perplexing results. For example, a transposon screen of <italic>Bt</italic>E264 yielded strains with transposon insertions in the gene (<italic>bcpI</italic>) encoding the immunity protein for the BcpAIOB contact-dependent inhibition system, which should have been fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>). Such a mutation could be tolerated, however, if a second copy of the <italic>bcpI</italic> gene is present, and hence the Tn insertion into <italic>bcpI</italic> may have selected for Dup<sup>+</sup> cells. Our data suggest that duplications should always be considered when mutants are obtained that contain mutations in genes predicted or suspected to be essential.</p><p>Transposable elements are facilitators of evolution. In the short term, insertion into coding sequences can impact gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darmon and Leach, 2014</xref>). In the long term, homologous transposable elements can act as substrates for DNA recombination that can alter genome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vandecraen et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, recombination between transposable elements facilitates genome reduction in host-evolved bacteria, which has been observed, for example, in the evolution of the equine-infecting <italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic> from the broader host range pathogen <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Losada et al., 2010</xref>). We hypothesize that acquisition of ISÎ± and ISÎ² at their current locations in <italic>Bt</italic>E264 represents an evolutionary step for <italic>Bt</italic>E264 â creating a bet-hedging phase variation system that allows for population survival when conditions oscillate between favoring planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Here, we show that acquisition of a pair of transposable elements has constructed a phase variation system that allows <italic>Bt</italic>E264 to rapidly adapt to environments favoring planktonic or biofilm growth. Bioinformatic analysis of other <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> strains revealed that nearly all other related strains lack both ISÎ± and ISÎ². One exception that contains ISÎ± but not ISÎ² and some adjacent sequences is a <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> strain that is unusually pathogenic called BPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that BPM represents an ancestral strain that has not acquired ISÎ² and the adjacent genes, although it may also represent a descendent that lost ISÎ² and the adjacent genes coincident with gaining virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Duplicating region</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCA_000012365.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LO74_RS28540âLO74_RS09425</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>recA</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCA_000012365.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LO74_RS12520</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E264</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">700388</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCA_000012365.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2002721643</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USAMRIID</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCA_000959425.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (Burkholderia thailandensis)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2002721723</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USAMRIID</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">GCA_000567925.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DH5Î±</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GoldBio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CC-101-5x50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Electrocompetent cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RHO3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AddGene</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">124700</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Electrocompetent cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT with I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut sites 50 kb outside duplicating region</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Inserted I-<italic>Sce</italic>I recognition sites between LO74_RS08325 and LO74_RS08330 and LO74_RS09660 and LO74_RS09665.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT with <italic>gusA</italic> insertion</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>gusA</italic> inserted between LO74_RS09420 and LO74_RS31810 near junction sequence.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Burkholderia thailandensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ÎrecA</italic> with <italic>gusA</italic> insertion</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>gusA</italic> inserted between LO74_RS09420 and LO74_RS31810 near junction sequence.

duplications and rearrangements that confer advantages in certain growth conditions. The work is of fundamental importance for understanding the role of genetic and biological variation in bacteria. The experimental work is exceptionally strong and convincing. The paper will be of interest to a broad audience including bacteriologists, geneticists and evolutionary biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84327.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Casadevall</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Laub</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/042nb2s44</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.09.515809">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.09.515809v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael T Laub (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see below all three reviewers were unanimous that this is an outstanding paper. It is nice to see such consensus among reviewers. I hope you enjoy and appreciate the thoughtful comments from all three reviewers. Congratulations on great work! We look forward to seeing the revised manuscript and I anticipate that it will be accepted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Data in Figure 6B are alluded to (lines 354-5) but are not described in detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I commend the authors for a beautiful and thorough study. The manuscript is already robust and the authors have done so much to study this intriguing system. I am therefore limiting my thoughts about additional investigation to just two points.</p><p>1) A major question that remains is whether the different types of cells have differential impacts during in vivo infection. Which cell type predominates during in vivo infection? For example, if mice were infected with cells from flat, rough, or smooth colonies, are there changes in the ratio of the different cell types after in vivo infection? These results could speak to the functional relevance of this phenomenon beyond in vitro biofilm formation.</p><p>2) Flat cells did not transition into rough or smooth cells in the restreaking experiment (Figure 2B). It is likely that flat colonies can yield the other colony types after restreaking but at a lower rate. It would further strengthen the manuscript if the authors can define the rate at which flat cells do transition to rough or smooth cells, or to prove that this does not happen.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found very little to criticize and think the paper can be published almost exactly as it reads right now.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84327.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Data in Figure 6B are alluded to (lines 354-5) but are not described in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.

However, to our knowledge, there is no evidence that <italic>B. thailandensis</italic> naturally infects animals. Strain BPM that we refer to in the discussion is an unusually pathogenic strain with some similarity to <italic>B. pseudomallei</italic>. In the study describing BPM (Reference 28), BPM and E264 were compared in a mouse infection and E264 was shown to be avirulent. In the interest of limiting the use of animals, therefore, we prefer to not conduct infection experiments with E264.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Flat cells did not transition into rough or smooth cells in the restreaking experiment (Figure 2B).

As shown in Figure 7D, the rate of duplication for a strain containing 500 bp of homology was between 10<sup>-4</sup> and 10<sup>-5</sup> in an overnight culture. Since the IS elements provide ~1.3 kb of homology, we expect the rate would be slightly higher. However, we would likely need to screen at least 10,000 colonies to observe a rough or smooth daughter colony.</p></body></sub-article></article>
