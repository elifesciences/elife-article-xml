Using a Gli1 reporter line, we found that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to the development of meniscus horns from 2 weeks of age. In adult mice, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells resided at the superficial layer of meniscus and expressed known mesenchymal progenitor markers. In culture, meniscal Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells possessed high progenitor activities under the control of Hh signal. Meniscus injury at the anterior horn induced a quick expansion of <italic>Gli1-lineage</italic> cells. Normally, meniscal tissue healed slowly, leading to cartilage degeneration. Ablation of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells further hindered this repair process. Strikingly, intra-articular injection of Gli1<sup>+</sup> meniscal cells or an Hh agonist right after injury accelerated the bridging of the interrupted ends and attenuated signs of osteoarthritis. Taken together, our work identified a novel progenitor population in meniscus and proposes a new treatment for repairing injured meniscus and preventing osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Gli1</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal progenitor</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd><kwd>meniscus injury</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG067698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30AR069619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI-1751898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Meniscal Gli1+ cells are mesenchymal progenitors that contribute to the development and injury repair of meniscus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meniscal tears, with all the morbidity and disability they cause, are among the most common injuries of the knee affecting both the young and aged; and the procedures to address them are among the most commonly performed surgeries in the orthopedics field. Beyond the short-term pain, disability, time from desired activities including work, meniscal injuries are important early events in the initiation and later propagation of osteoarthritis (OA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohmander et al., 2007</xref>). From a clinical therapeutic point of view, surgical treatments, including the maximally preserving partial meniscectomy, while improving immediate symptoms, do not delay the natural history progression of OA or may actually accelerate it. As the adult meniscus is predominantly avascular, true biologic healing with surgical repair remains a viable treatment for only a small portion of individuals typically with tears contained within the red vascular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Makris et al., 2011</xref>). For the majority of the injuries, a restorative biologic therapy does not currently exist in practice.</p><p>Mesenchymal progenitors play a critical role in tissue regeneration. Therefore, identifying and characterizing residential mesenchymal progenitors in meniscus are important for developing novel and effective strategies to treat meniscus injury. Using enzymatic digestion and clonal expansion methods, previous studies have demonstrated that human and rabbit meniscus contain mesenchymal progenitors with multi-differentiation abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Segawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the superficial layer of meniscus was proposed to harbor the progenitors. By collecting cells growing out of mouse meniscus explant, Gamer et al. showed that these cells exhibit stem cell-like characteristics and are located in the superficial zone in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gamer et al., 2017a</xref>). During injury, it has been observed that progenitors on the meniscus surface migrate from vascularized red zone to non-vascularized white zone for repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seol et al., 2017</xref>). While these cells in culture express several common mesenchymal progenitor markers, such as CD44, Sca1, and CD90, their in vivo properties and regulatory signaling pathways are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seol et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. It is one of few fundamental pathways that maintain adult stem and progenitor cells in various organs, such as brain, skin, bladder, teeth, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petrova and Joyner, 2014</xref>). Following injury, Hh signaling can trigger stem and other resident cells to participate in repair, and therefore, Hh upregulation is viewed not only as a natural response to injury but also as a way to stimulate tissue repair by activating stem cells. Gli1, an integral effector protein of Hh pathway, was recently recognized as a marker for bone marrow, periosteal, and periarticular mesenchymal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that Hh signaling is also functional in the skeleton for maintaining tissue-specific stem and progenitors.</p><p>In this study, we constructed a Gli1 reporter line and found that Gli1-labeled Td<sup>+</sup> cells are exclusively located in the horns of adolescent meniscus. These cells contribute to meniscus development and possess mesenchymal progenitor properties. In adult mice, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells mostly reside at the superficial layer of meniscus and they rarely become cells in the center of meniscus. Interestingly, meniscus injury induced a rapid expansion of Gli1-lineage cells and elimination of these cells mitigated repair. Using sorted Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells and an Hh signaling agonist, we demonstrated that activating Hh signaling could be an effective way to promote meniscus repair and prevent OA progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The expression patterns of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells and their descendants in mouse meniscus</title><p>We performed lineage tracing with <italic>Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> Rosa26 <sup>lsl-tdTomato</sup></italic> (Gli1ER/Td) mice at various ages to identify Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells and their descendants in the meniscus following a 6 week chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Joints were cut in either sagittal or coronal planes to visualize different parts of meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In line with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tong et al., 2019</xref>), at 1 week of age, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells were only observed in the periarticular layer of articular cartilage, but not in the meniscus and other joint tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ca-c</xref>). Long term tracing also did not detect any Td signal in the meniscus, confirming that neonatal meniscus does not harbor Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Cd</xref>). At 2 weeks of age, most cells in the anterior horn of the meniscus, both medially and laterally, were Td<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ce-g</xref>). Six weeks of tracing confirmed that the entire anterior horn, but not the posterior horn, is labeled by Td (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ch</xref>). At 4 weeks of age, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells were concentrated in the superficial layer of the anterior horn; 6 weeks later, most cells in both superficial and central portions of the anterior horn were labeled by Td (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ci–l</xref>). Within the posterior horn, very few cells in the center of meniscus were initially labeled but then gave rise to the majority of internal cells 6 weeks later. Quantification along the length of the meniscus over the time indicated that 1–8 weeks of age represents the rapid growing phase for the meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, our data suggested that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells represent progenitors for meniscus cells of the horn regions at adolescence stage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gli1 labels mesenchymal progenitors in mouse meniscus during development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic graph of the study protocol.

Similar to the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model of OA, our meniscus injury model caused cartilage degeneration, such as partially loss of proteoglycan, surface fibrillation, and reduction in uncalcified cartilage thickness at 2 months post injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Meanwhile, the calcified cartilage layer was not eroded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting a moderate OA with a Mankin Score of 6.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Strikingly, injections of either Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells or PMA greatly reduced cartilage degeneration by retaining proteoglycan content, cartilage surface smoothness, and the structure of uncalcified cartilage. These treatments led to a reduction in Mankin Score by 35% and 53%, respectively. Von Frey assay is commonly used in OA study as a pain outcome by evaluating mechanical allodynia. Using this assay, we observed that OA knees show reduced paw withdraw threshold compared to sham knees. However, this OA-related pain was mostly attenuated in Gli1<sup>+</sup> cell- or PMA-treated knees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Meniscus repair by enhancing Hh/Gli1 signaling delays OA progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative safranin O/fast green staining of sagittal sections of vehicle-, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cell- and PMA-treated mouse knee joints at 8 weeks after sham or meniscus injury.

To exclude the possibility that activating Hh signaling directly affects OA progress, we performed DMM surgery in 3-month-old male <italic>WT</italic> mice and injected PMA into their knee joints right after surgery. Two months later, we observed a similar level of cartilage degeneration in control and treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>), suggesting that the effect of Hh signaling on OA development is mediated through meniscus repair but not through directly acting on cartilage. It is worthwhile noting that different from our transient activation approaches, the previous conclusion about the catabolic action of Hh signaling on cartilage is derived from constant modulation of this signaling by genetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have identified the existence of mesenchymal progenitors in meniscus based on their clonogenic and multilineage differentiation activities in culture. However, their in vivo properties and regulatory signals are largely unknown. In this work, by using a lineage tracing mouse line, cell culture, and a meniscus injury model, we demonstrated that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells are a major subset of meniscal mesenchymal progenitors and that those Hh-responsive cells are critical for meniscus development and injury response. Moreover, aging reduces this Gli1<sup>+</sup> progenitor population in healthy meniscus as well as their expansion after injury, which is consistent with attenuated healing in old mice. On the therapeutic side, the activation of Hh/Gli1 signaling in adult meniscus leads to accelerated meniscus healing process and the delay of OA changes, indicating a protective role of Hh signaling on meniscus against degeneration.</p><p>Hh signaling plays a key role during embryonic development and tissue patterning. Meniscus is somewhat similar to periodontal ligament (PDL) and enthesis in skeleton. Prior studies have shown that Gli1<sup>+ </sup>PDL cells contribute to the formation of periodontal tissues and can regenerate alveolar bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hosoya et al., 2020</xref>). Many studies also demonstrated the importance of Gli1 lineage cells as the progenitors in the development and regeneration of enthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dyment et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwartz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Felsenthal et al., 2018</xref>). In long bones, embryonic Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells give rise to multiple cell types associated with the skeleton and are a major source of osteoblasts in both fetal and postnatal life of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). We also discovered that Gli1<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal progenitors from neonatal periarticular surfaces are capable of generating mesenchymal lineage cells, including osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes in the secondary ossification center of long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tong et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells do not contribute to the early development of meniscus. They start to appear from 2 weeks of age first in the anterior horn and later in the posterior horn. The different Gli1-labeling patterns in the two horns may reflect the distinct cellular composition of anterior and posterior horns reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gamer et al., 2017b</xref>). Since menisci undergo rapid growth postnatally and Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells are absent from the meniscus body, our data indicated that there must be other distinct progenitor population(s) contributing to meniscus development. Indeed, we found that Gli1<sup>-</sup> meniscus cells are also able to proliferate and differentiate in vitro albeit with less activities compared to Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>At the adult stage, we found that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells are mainly located at the superficial layer of meniscal horns. They rarely contribute to the inner cells of meniscus probably due to the low turnover of meniscus tissue. However, similar to their counterparts in the periosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) and tendon enthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schwartz et al., 2015</xref>), they play an important role in tissue regeneration. In our study, we established a meniscus injury model by transection of the anterior horn. A previously reported mouse meniscus injury model (meniscectomy of the anterior horn) revealed almost complete regeneration of meniscus and only subtle cartilage degeneration at 6 weeks post surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hiyama et al., 2017</xref>). Compared to that, meniscus repair in our injury model is slow and inefficient with disconnected collagen fibers remaining at the injured site at 3 months post surgery. This prolonged injury causes damage to articular cartilage, leading to moderate OA. Hence, our model is suitable to study the beneficial effects of Hh signaling on meniscus repair and meniscus damage-related OA progression.</p><p>Notably, we also observed a quick expansion of synovium enriched with Gli1-lineage cells at the early stage of repair. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that synovial Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells also contribute to meniscus regeneration. That being said, our data showed that Gli1<sup>+</sup> primary meniscus cells injected into knee joints incorporate into meniscus tissue and accelerate repair, indicating that the endogenous Gli1<sup>+</sup> meniscus cells are likely responsible for the repair. Our studies found that Ihh is the most up-regulated Hh ligand during development and that Dhh is the one upregulated after injury. We have not investigated the cell source of Hh ligand in meniscus. Since Ihh from the prehypertrophic chondrocytes is known for regulating long bone development through endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>), it is possible that fibrochondrocytes in the deep layer of meniscus produce the Hh signals.</p><p>Our lineage tracing and injury studies are based on mouse models. However, rodents are different from human by having bony ossicles in the meniscus horns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shaw and Martin, 1962</xref>). To show the clinical relevance of our research, we first demonstrated that porcine meniscus has similar anatomic distribution of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells, suggesting a conservation of this patterning between species. While we did not detect Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells in healthy human meniscus, likely due to the sample being collected from the body rather than the horns, we found similar expansion of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells in cell clusters of diseased meniscus, suggesting the translatability of our findings. Our studies, therefore, have uncovered a critical role of Hh/Gli1 signaling in knee meniscus development and regeneration and provide evidence for targeting this pathway as a novel meniscus injury therapy and potentially for preventing OA development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

To perform the surgery, the joint capsule was opened immediately after anesthesia and the anteriomedial horn of meniscus was cut into two parts using microsurgical scissors. The joint capsule and the subcutaneous layer were then closed with suture followed by skin closure with tissue adhesive. In sham surgery, meniscus was visualized but not transected.

Samples were processed for either cryosections after 1 week of decalcification or paraffin sections after 4 weeks of decalcification. For healthy knee joints, a series of 6-μm-thick sections were cut across the entire compartment of the joint at the coronal or sagittal plane followed by fluorescent imaging (cryosections) or safranin O/fast green staining for brightfield imaging (paraffin sections).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

Prior work in this field has suggest that there are undifferentiated progenitor cells residing in the meniscus and it has been hypothesized that these cells could be harnessed to aid in meniscal healing after injury. The authors provide evidence that Hedgehog activation promotes meniscal healing and identify population of cells that are positive for Gli1, an effector protein in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Using a combination of approaches, including lineage tracing, in vitro cell culture approaches and cell transplantation experiments, they show that this Gli1 populations contains putative meniscal progenitors involved in meniscus development and healing. Overall, the reviewers found this paper to have high potential and were particularly enthusiastic about the therapeutic potential of Purmorphamine to promote meniscal healing. However, all reviewers felt that the conclusions (and title) of this paper overstated the utility of Gli1 as a marker of de facto meniscal progenitor cells. It is specifically requested that the title of this manuscript be reworded in light of the previous work showing that Gli1 can be found in a number of cell types. In several places, additional work was requested to support the conclusions made in this manuscript. Please see the detailed comments below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors describe many of their results as &quot;novel&quot;. Gli1 reporter mice have been used extensively in other tissues to non-specifically describe progenitor cells (bone marrow, periosteum, peri-vascular spaces and others). Further, the role of Gli1+ cells in enthesis and periodontal ligament (PDL) formation and healing has been previously explored. Gli proteins, which have a half-life of minutes-to-hours, may be a relatively unstable foundation for defining cellular identity. While the value of Gli1 as a general Hh reporter is clear, its utility as a putative stem cell marker (Title) does not seem adequately substantiated. The authors must temper their statements on novelty, exclusivity and utility of Gli1. The title of this paper also should be reworded.</p><p>2. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling manipulation conducted is rather straightforward and some overlapping studies have been performed in murine joints. Many of the experimental results could have been predicted. Other elements that contribute to the superficial nature of the studies are that Gli1 reporter activity is the only marker of Hh signaling examined (for example Gli2/Gli3 are not), and that the abundance and cellular source of an Hh ligand during development or repair is never entertained. Of note, these reporters for Ihh and Shh are available.</p><p>3. It is a stretch to say that Gli1;tdTom labels meniscus progenitor cells (Lines 268-271). There is relative enrichment of Sca1/CD90/CD200/PDGFRa in Gli1+ cells (Figure 2B), yet the vast majority of cells positive for those markers are Gli1-negative (Figure S5). Positive outcomes during in vitro differentiation and scratch assays may primarily result from increased Hh-mediated proliferation. This logic extends all the way through the in vivo experiments (which are quite promising, translationally).</p><p>4. The spatial profile of Gli1-expressing cells in the meniscus is beautifully described, however an interpretation for the superficially restricted zonation of Gli1 reporter activity is not given. Do these superficial cells have more or less cartilage antigen expression? Is there something clearly physiologically different in the Gli1-rich superficial layers that could be determined? Line 401 cites an osteoblast paper to set up the relevance of Gli1+ cells in development of musculoskeletal tissues. However, the meniscus is much more similar to the enthesis and the PDL. The authors should therefore lead with that literature. The PDL literature in particular is not cited and should be added. Also missing are recent enthesis development/regeneration papers (PMID: 30504126, 26141957, and 28219952).</p><p>5. The characterization of Gli1+ and Gli1- FAC sorted cells could be expanded on a bit.</p><p>6. CFU-F images should be provide in addition to quantification. The differentiation studies in Figure 2E are non-quantitative and not convincing. Further, it is a little contradictory that under certain contexts Gli1+ cells form more cartilage (2E), but under other culture conditions they have reduced cartilage markers (2F). These points need to be clarified.</p><p>7. In Figure 5, changes in distribution or survival of Gli1+/- cells may underlie the difference, but survival nor Gli1- cell distribution were not assessed.</p><p>8. Cartilage differentiation within the meniscus appears to be promoted with Gli1+ cell therapy and Purmorphamine. This could be assessed. Similarly, Hh signaling is known to induce osteogenesis. Osteoblastic antigens and/or presence of osteophytes should be assessed for in purmorphamine treated joints.</p><p>9. One topic that is not covered in the paper is the role of Hh signaling in chondrocyte mineralization. This has been well studied in the growth plate (esp. related to PTHrP / IHH feedback loop) and may have relevance to the meniscus as well. The healing studies should consider this carefully, as ectopic mineralization is a possible negative side effect of Hh treatment.</p><p>10. There are a number of places in the results where it is unclear if the authors are talking about Gli+ cells or Gli1-lineage cells. This should be clarified throughout, perhaps with specific nomenclature that defines &quot;Gli1+&quot; as cells that are positive for Gli and &quot;Gli1-lineage&quot; for cells that are descendants of Gli+ cells. Supplemental Figure 1A should be in the main document. Similar schematics in other figures are very useful for understanding the experiment.</p><p>11. What are the temporal expression patterns of Gli1 and other Hh related genes during development and healing? It would be informative to see localized expression (e.g., in situ hybridization) or qPCR expression for healing tissues.</p><p>12. The authors should clarify a number of things with meniscal cell isolation: (a) There are clearly differences in cell phenotype between superficial and deep areas and between attachment and midsection; was this considered for cell isolation? (b) I assume TAM injections were performed and then cells were isolated a few days later via FACS; please clarify details to show that Gli1+ (not Gli1-lineage) cells were characterized. (c) Figure 2: 3-month old mice were used, but again, Gli+ vs. Gli1-lineage cells is not indicated.</p><p>13. The mechanisms by which Gli1+ and Hh treatments work is not explored. Some of the results are counter-intuitive. For example, why would Hh stimulate proliferation if Gli1+ cells if these are thought to be slow turnover resident stem cells? Furthermore, why would Hh stimulation lead to proliferation rather than differentiation, (in contrast to what is know in growth plate biology)?</p><p>14. The assessment of healing is qualitative/semi-quantitative (histomorphometry). The authors should perform a more rigorous assessment of healing to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gli1+ cell and Hh therapies. This should include quantitative outcome(s) such as qPCR, mechanics, etc.</p><p>15. The Gli1+ cell therapy histologic results are impressive. This is surprising because the delivery method was relatively simple. How much cell engraftment was there? Can the authors comment further (or add experiments to elucidate) on how long the cells were present and what their direct involvement was in healing?</p><p>16. The authors show that native Gli1+ cells expand after injury. If this is the case, what is the rationale for adding more Gli1+ cells? Is the idea that the tissue has the capacity to heal but there aren't enough native Gli1+ cells to do the job?</p><p>17. Figures and text jump between methodologies, making interpretation of results difficult. Figure 1 shows that superficial cells of the meniscus generally have active Hh signaling 24-hours prior to a variety of postnatal-to-adult timepoints (A, B, E, F), and postnatal Hh signaling drives proliferation of early meniscus cells (C, D). It does not appear to report any long-term pulse/chase lineage tracing experiment as suggested in the text (Lines 223+). If this interpretation is incorrect, perhaps this could be addressed by increased clarity of figures and text (Methods, Results, Figure organization and captions)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62917.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors describe many of their results as &quot;novel&quot;. Gli1 reporter mice have been used extensively in other tissues to non-specifically describe progenitor cells (bone marrow, periosteum, peri-vascular spaces and others). Further, the role of Gli1+ cells in enthesis and periodontal ligament (PDL) formation and healing has been previously explored. Gli proteins, which have a half-life of minutes-to-hours, may be a relatively unstable foundation for defining cellular identity. While the value of Gli1 as a general Hh reporter is clear, its utility as a putative stem cell marker (Title) does not seem adequately substantiated. The authors must temper their statements on novelty, exclusivity and utility of Gli1. The title of this paper also should be reworded.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion. The new title is “The critical role of Hedgehog-responsive mesenchymal progenitors in meniscus development and injury repair”. We also revised our manuscript to accurately reflect the novelty, exclusivity, and utility of Gli1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling manipulation conducted is rather straightforward and some overlapping studies have been performed in murine joints. Many of the experimental results could have been predicted. Other elements that contribute to the superficial nature of the studies are that Gli1 reporter activity is the only marker of Hh signaling examined (for example Gli2/Gli3 are not), and that the abundance and cellular source of an Hh ligand during development or repair is never entertained. Of note, these reporters for Ihh and Shh are available.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we analyzed the expression of Hh signaling components in mouse meniscus. qRT-PCR analyses of meniscus from mice at 1, 4, and 8 weeks of age and mice at 1 and 2 weeks post meniscal injury demonstrated that Hh signaling components are increased in adolescent mice and during early injury repair. Interesting, Hh ligands play distinct roles in the development and injury repair. While Ihh was the most up-regulated ligand during development, Dhh was the one up-regulated after injury. We did not detect Shh mRNA in our assays. Among Gli transcription factors, Gli1 was the most up-regulated one during development and after injury. Gli2 shared the similar expression pattern but its fold changes were much less than Gli1. We did not detect an increase of Gli3 expression at these time points. These data are now included as Figure 1E and 4F. In the future, we will acquire <italic>Shh-CreGFP, Ptch1-lacZ, Gli1-lacZ</italic>, and <italic>Gli2-lacZ</italic> mice from Jax Laboratory for further study. Unfortunately, Dr. Benjamin Humphreys replied that he discontinued his <italic>Ihh-LacZ</italic> mouse line <sup>(1)</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is a stretch to say that Gli1;tdTom labels meniscus progenitor cells (Lines 268-271). There is relative enrichment of Sca1/CD90/CD200/PDGFRa in Gli1+ cells (Figure 2B), yet the vast majority of cells positive for those markers are Gli1-negative (Figure S5). Positive outcomes during in vitro differentiation and scratch assays may primarily result from increased Hh-mediated proliferation. This logic extends all the way through the in vivo experiments (which are quite promising, translationally).</p></disp-quote><p>Our data demonstrated that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells possess the properties of mesenchymal progenitors: self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. Since CFU-Fs formed from digested <italic>Gli1ER/Td</italic> meniscus cells were 73% Td<sup>+</sup> and 27% Td<sup>-</sup>, we believe that the major portion of meniscal mesenchymal progenitors are Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells. Sca1, CD90, CD200, and PDGFR were selected as mesenchymal progenitor markers according to studies performed in other tissues, such as bone marrow. No thorough investigation of these markers has been previously conducted in the meniscus tissue. Our data showed that Sca1<sup>+</sup>, CD90<sup>+</sup>, CD200<sup>+</sup>, and PDGFR<sup>+</sup> cells are 25, 11, 41, and 19% of digested meniscus cells, respectively. Considering CFU-F frequency of digested meniscal cells is ~1%, these markers must label non-progenitors as well. To be more precise, we changed the title of Results subsection to “Gli1-expressing meniscus cells are a major subset of mesenchymal progenitors”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The spatial profile of Gli1-expressing cells in the meniscus is beautifully described, however an interpretation for the superficially restricted zonation of Gli1 reporter activity is not given. Do these superficial cells have more or less cartilage antigen expression? Is there something clearly physiologically different in the Gli1-rich superficial layers that could be determined? Line 401 cites an osteoblast paper to set up the relevance of Gli1+ cells in development of musculoskeletal tissues. However, the meniscus is much more similar to the enthesis and the PDL. The authors should therefore lead with that literature. The PDL literature in particular is not cited and should be added. Also missing are recent enthesis development/regeneration papers (PMID: 30504126, 26141957, and 28219952).</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 2A, meniscal superficial layer is labeled by Prg4, a lubricant protein. We found that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells are also Prg4<sup>+</sup>. The Rosen group previously characterized the zones of mouse meniscus <sup>(2)</sup>. At 2 weeks of age, outer region ﬁbroblast-like cells are type I collagen positive, while inner region ﬁbro-chondrocytes express type II collagen and surround an area of larger, round cells that resemble hypertrophic chondrocytes and transiently express type X collagen. At 8 weeks of age, Safranin O proteoglycan staining is concentrated in the superﬁcial zone surrounding the ﬁbro-chondrocytes. Our study showed a similar staining pattern (Figure 4). We thank the reviewers for the reference suggestions. We added them to our discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The characterization of Gli1+ and Gli1- FAC sorted cells could be expanded on a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>Characterization of freshly sorted Gli1<sup>+</sup> and Gli1<sup>-</sup> cells is technically challenging. Due to low abundance of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells and small size of mouse meniscus, at least 15 mice are required for collecting 10,000 Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells for qRT-PCR analysis. Thus, we decided to expand cells in culture first and then performed proliferation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), migration, and multi-lineage differentiation assays (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. CFU-F images should be provide in addition to quantification. The differentiation studies in Figure 2E are non-quantitative and not convincing. Further, it is a little contradictory that under certain contexts Gli1+ cells form more cartilage (2E), but under other culture conditions they have reduced cartilage markers (2F). These points need to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We seeded total digested cells for CFU-F assay and counted Td<sup>+</sup> and Td<sup>-</sup> CFU-Fs within the same dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, we do not think it is necessary to show the dish or CFU-F colony images. We performed qRT-PCR analysis of lineage specific markers in Gli1<sup>+</sup> and Gli1<sup>-</sup> cells after multi-lineage differentiation. Quantification confirms that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells have better differentiation ability than Gli1<sup>-</sup> cells. These data are now included in Figure 2.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CFU-F assay of total digested meniscus cells.</title><p>(A) Crystal-violet staining of CFU-F colonies in a dish.

Cartilage differentiation within the meniscus appears to be promoted with Gli1+ cell therapy and Purmorphamine. This could be assessed. Similarly, Hh signaling is known to induce osteogenesis. Osteoblastic antigens and/or presence of osteophytes should be assessed for in purmorphamine treated joints.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Gli1<sup>+</sup> cell therapy and Purmorphamine (PMA) treatment appear to increase the Safranin O staining in meniscus after injury (Figure 5). These results are consistent with our data that Gli1<sup>+</sup> meniscus cells differentiate into chondrocytes better than Gli1<sup>-</sup> meniscus cells (Figure 2) and reports from other groups that Hh signaling activation promotes chondrogenic differentiation in bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors <sup>(5,6)</sup>. However, since this increase of staining is relatively subtle, we are unable to further assess it by qRT-PCR, which, due to technical difficulties, analyzes the entire meniscus instead of the injury site.</p><p>To address the issue whether PMA stimulates ectopic ossification, we used microCT to analyze joint calcification at 3 months post meniscal injury with or without PMA treatment. We detected no change in the calcified meniscus volume and a trend of decrease in osteophyte volume in PMA-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated mice. Thus, our data, now included as Figure 5—figure supplement 1, suggest that Hh agonist does not affect overall joint calcification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. One topic that is not covered in the paper is the role of Hh signaling in chondrocyte mineralization. This has been well studied in the growth plate (esp. related to PTHrP / IHH feedback loop) and may have relevance to the meniscus as well. The healing studies should consider this carefully, as ectopic mineralization is a possible negative side effect of Hh treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a valid concern for stimulating the Hh pathway in the joint. As explained in our answer to the previous comment, we did not observe obvious changes in cartilage differentiation and tissue mineralization after PMA treatment. Our PMA treatment regimen is only a single injection, which likely mitigates effects that could arise from prolonged over-expression of the pathway, as seen in other genetic models <sup>(7)</sup>. Although we do not see evidence supporting this in our mouse model, we will keep this potential side effect in mind when we proceed to large animal models for future translational studies. We thank the reviewers for raising this clinically important question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. There are a number of places in the results where it is unclear if the authors are talking about Gli+ cells or Gli1-lineage cells. This should be clarified throughout, perhaps with specific nomenclature that defines &quot;Gli1+&quot; as cells that are positive for Gli and &quot;Gli1-lineage&quot; for cells that are descendants of Gli+ cells. Supplemental Figure 1A should be in the main document. Similar schematics in other figures are very useful for understanding the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewers for this suggestion that greatly improves the accuracy of our manuscript. We now use Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells for Td<sup>+</sup> cells right after Tamoxifen induction and Gli1 lineage cells for Td<sup>+</sup> cells in lineage tracing experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. What are the temporal expression patterns of Gli1 and other Hh related genes during development and healing? It would be informative to see localized expression (e.g., in situ hybridization) or qPCR expression for healing tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to comment #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors should clarify a number of things with meniscal cell isolation: (a) There are clearly differences in cell phenotype between superficial and deep areas and between attachment and midsection; was this considered for cell isolation? (b) I assume TAM injections were performed and then cells were isolated a few days later via FACS; please clarify details to show that Gli1+ (not Gli1-lineage) cells were characterized. (c) Figure 2: 3-month old mice were used, but again, Gli+ vs. Gli1-lineage cells is not indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not stating these details in the first submission. For Figure 2, we injected 3-month-old <italic>Gli1ER/Td</italic> mice with Tam for 5 consecutive days and euthanized them 2 days after the last injection for immunostaining and cell isolation experiments. We isolated the meniscus cells from the entire meniscus tissue. It is quite difficult, if not impossible, to cleanly dissect different regions of meniscus even under dissection microscopy. Since we analyze Td<sup>+</sup> cells right after Tam induction, those cells are Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells not Gli1-lineage cells. We now add those details to Methods and Results. In the future, we will harvest meniscus cells from different regions of porcine or bovine meniscus to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The mechanisms by which Gli1+ and Hh treatments work is not explored. Some of the results are counter-intuitive. For example, why would Hh stimulate proliferation if Gli1+ cells if these are thought to be slow turnover resident stem cells? Furthermore, why would Hh stimulation lead to proliferation rather than differentiation, (in contrast to what is know in growth plate biology)?</p></disp-quote><p>Slow cycling cells, also called label-retaining cells (LRCs), are considered tissue stem cells. Those cells might change their cycling frequency depending on the environment (niches) and tissue status (development, homeostasis, or injury) <sup>(8)</sup>. Hh signaling is known to regulate proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells in musculoskeletal tissues. For example, during endochondral ossification and growth plate development, Hh signaling stimulates chondrocyte proliferation and inhibit chondrocyte hypertrophy indirectly via regulating PthrP <sup>(9)</sup>. In bone, Hh signaling stimulates both proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors <sup>(10)</sup>. In enthesis, Hh signaling maintains Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells and regulates Gli1<sup>+</sup> progenitor proliferation and differentiation <sup>(11-14)</sup>. In our studies, we observed that in vivo PMA treatment increases Gli1-lineage cells after injury (Figure 5H) and that in vitro PMA treatment stimulates proliferation and migration of meniscal mesenchymal progenitors (Figure 3). We do not know whether PMA treatment directly stimulates meniscus differentiation due to a lack of meniscus specific markers. Thus, here we focus more on proliferation, rather than differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The assessment of healing is qualitative/semi-quantitative (histomorphometry). The authors should perform a more rigorous assessment of healing to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gli1+ cell and Hh therapies. This should include quantitative outcome(s) such as qPCR, mechanics, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>The healing was mostly evaluated by histological observation of bridging at the injury site. To our knowledge, no genes have been commonly agreed upon to represent healed meniscus. Thus, we are unable to perform qRT-PCR analysis. However, since meniscus injury causes osteoarthritis and joint pain is commonly used as a functional outcome of osteoarthritis, we used Mankin Score (for cartilage degeneration) and von Frey assay (for joint pain) to indirectly quantify the healing outcomes (Figure 6).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the biomechanical properties of healing meniscus are an important parameter of healing. In the past, we have applied AFM-nanoindentation to quantify the mechanical properties of healthy, adult meniscus central region <sup>(15)</sup>. However, limited by the small size and irregular shape of murine meniscus, there is no available method for directly assessing the biomechanical properties of the healing meniscus site at the horn region. Our technique is not readily applicable for this study yet. Further tuning in sample embedding, preparation/sectioning, and healing site identification are needed to apply the AFM method, which are not trivial. In the future, we will definitely develop a suitable approach to measure the biomechanical properties of healing mouse meniscus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15.

We believe that injected Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells contribute to the healing process in multiple ways. First, they directly differentiate into meniscal cells. Second, they indirectly secrete factors regulating endogenous cells to accelerate healing. Third, their high migration ability facilitates the bridging of injury site. Indeed, the mechanisms by which MSCs contribute to tissue regeneration has been extensively studied for many years but still remain largely unclear <sup>(16)</sup>. Therefore, to investigate the detailed mechanism is very interesting but beyond the scope of our current research.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Representative confocal images of <italic>WT</italic> mouse knee joints at 1, 4, and 8 weeks after meniscus injury and injection of Gli1<sup>+</sup> cells derived from <italic>Gli1ER/Td</italic> meniscus.</title><p>Boxed areas in the top panel are shown at high magnification at the bottom.

Therefore, addition stimulation is required to accelerate healing. This seems to be a common theme in degenerative diseases. Another project in our group studies whether EGFR pathway can be targeted for OA treatment <sup>(17)</sup>. We and others have shown that articular cartilage expresses EGFR and its ligands. While EGFR activity decreases at early OA stage, it reappears during middle OA stage. However, the endogenous EGFR activity is apparently not enough to protect cartilage from OA damage.
