During Drosophila embryonic development, neural stem cells (neuroblasts) sequentially express transcription factors that generate neuronal diversity; regulation of the embryonic temporal transcription factor cascade is lineage-intrinsic. In contrast, larval neuroblasts generate longer ~50 division lineages, and currently only one mid-larval molecular transition is known: Chinmo/Imp/Lin-28+ neuroblasts transition to Syncrip+ neuroblasts. Here we show that the hormone ecdysone is required to down-regulate Chinmo/Imp and activate Syncrip, plus two late neuroblast factors, Broad and E93. We show that Seven-up triggers Chinmo/Imp to Syncrip/Broad/E93 transition by inducing expression of the Ecdysone receptor in mid-larval neuroblasts, rendering them competent to respond to the systemic hormone ecdysone. Importantly, late temporal gene expression is essential for proper neuronal and glial cell type specification. This is the first example of hormonal regulation of temporal factor expression in Drosophila embryonic or larval neural progenitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26287.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26287.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>hormone</kwd><kwd>temporal identity</kwd><kwd>neural progenitor</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GD27056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>Mubarak Hussain</given-names></name><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>Mubarak Hussain</given-names></name><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Developmental Biology Training grant T32HD007348-26</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A steroid hormone acts directly on brain neural progenitors to coordinately alter gene expression and specify neuronal and glial cell types.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>From Drosophila to humans, the brain contains a vast array of morphologically and functionally distinct neurons and glia that arise from a much smaller pool of neural progenitors. How neural stem cells generate neural diversity is a fundamental question that is relevant to many areas of biology. For example, understanding normal neurodevelopmental programs may help design reprogramming protocols to replace specific neurons in clinical trials; may help elucidate principles of connectivity based on shared developmental features; and may help reveal how proliferative neural progenitors avoid tumor formation without differentiating. Drosophila has been a pioneering model system for the study of neural progenitor specification by spatial cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skeath and Thor, 2003</xref>), neural progenitor self-renewal versus differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doe, 2008</xref>), stem cell derived tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caussinus and Hirth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Homem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang and Reichert, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maurange and Gould, 2005</xref>), and more recently the identification of temporal factors that are sequentially expressed during neural progenitor lineages to increase neural diversity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohwi and Doe [2013]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maurange and Gould [2005]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rossi et al. [2017]</xref>). In most of the examples cited above, Drosophila studies have revealed conserved mechanisms and/or molecules used in mammals. Here we use Drosophila larval neural progenitors (neuroblasts) to investigate temporal patterning mechanisms that generate neuronal diversity.</p><p>There are three types of neuroblasts based on division mode: type 0 neuroblasts make a single neuron with each division; type I neuroblasts make a ganglion mother cell (GMC) with each division, and the GMC typically makes two neurons; and type II neuroblasts make an intermediate neural progenitor (INP) with each division, and each INP undergoes a short lineage to produce ~6 GMCs and thus ~12 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunnar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Embryonic type I neuroblasts have short lineages averaging five neuroblast divisions, and they sequentially express five temporal transcription factors: Hunchback, Krüppel, Pdm (the co-expressed Nubbin and Pdm2 proteins), Castor (Cas), and Grainy head (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohwi and Doe [2013]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maurange and Gould [2005]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rossi et al. [2017]</xref>). In addition, the orphan nuclear hormone receptor Seven-up (Svp) acts as a ‘switching factor’ required for a timely Hunchback-Krüppel transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mettler et al., 2006</xref>). Most of these temporal transcription factors are necessary and sufficient to specify the identity of neurons born during their neuroblast expression window, although the Cas window can be subdivided further by expression of sub-temporal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stratmann et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, larval optic lobe neuroblasts sequentially express six temporal transcription factors that are necessary to generate neuronal diversity in the adult visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). Lastly, INPs sequentially express three temporal transcription factors, two of which are known to specify neural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>). Thus, neuroblasts and INPs with short lineages have well-characterized temporal transcription factor cascades that change approximately every cell division, and act to increase neuronal diversity.</p><p>In contrast, the central brain type I or II neuroblasts undergo longer lineages of ~50 divisions to generate hundreds of neural progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Clonal analysis reveals different levels of morphological diversity among neurons within a single neuroblast lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) with some neuroblasts making only four cell types (mushroom body neuroblasts) and other neuroblasts making over 40 different cell types (AD or ALad1 neuroblast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kao et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work has provided evidence that central brain neuroblasts change their gene expression profile over time. Our lab and others have shown that larvae express Cas and Svp in type I or type II neuroblasts prior to 48 hr (timing is relative to larval hatching at 0 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the transcription factor Chinmo and RNA-binding proteins Imp and Lin-28 are detected in young type I neuroblasts prior to 60 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narbonne-Reveau et al., 2016</xref>). Moving even later, the RNA-binding protein Syncrip and transcription factor Broad have been reported to be expressed in old type I neuroblasts or neurons, respectively from ~60–120 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Lastly, the steroid hormone ecdysone and the secreted protein Hedgehog are required to terminate neuroblast proliferation after pupariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Homem et al., 2014</xref>). Regulation of these temporal gene expression transitions has remained mostly mysterious, but the early factor Svp is required to induce down-regulation of the early Chinmo/Imp/Lin-28 factors at mid-larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narbonne-Reveau et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite the recent progress, many important questions remain. First, do larval neuroblasts express additional factors that may be used to generate neuronal diversity? Identifying additional candidate temporal transcription factors would be a major step forward in understanding how neuronal diversity in the adult brain is generated. Second, the role of Svp in regulating larval neuroblast gene expression transitions is poorly understood. Does Svp down-regulate early factors only, or does it activate late factor expression as well, and what are its effector genes? Determining how Chinmo/Imp/Lin-28 are down-regulated is likely to provide insight into how neuronal diversity is generated.</p><p>Here we answer each of these questions. We identify candidate temporal transcription factors expressed in neuroblasts that increase the number of molecularly distinct neuroblast temporal profiles; we show that the steroid hormone ecdysone, made outside the CNS, is required for the down-regulation of Chinmo/Imp and activation of Syncrip/Broad/E93 in mid-larval neuroblasts; we show that Svp activates expression of the Ecdysone receptor isoform B1 at mid-larval stages, rendering the neuroblasts competent to respond to the hormone ecdysone; and we show that EcR is required for proper neuronal and glial cell fate specification. Our results are the first example of hormonal regulation of temporal gene expression in neural progenitors, and the first to show that the conserved switching factor Svp can induce neural progenitor competence to respond to an extrinsic hormonal cue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Larval brain neuroblasts undergo an early Chinmo/Imp/Lin-28 to late Broad/Syncrip/E93 transition in gene expression</title><p>To determine if larval neuroblasts change their gene expression profile over time, we focused initially on the eight individually identifiable type II neuroblasts (subsequently analyzing all central brain neuroblasts, see below). We took two approaches: we assayed genes known to be expressed in early larval or late larval stages for temporal expression in neuroblasts, and we performed an unbiased transcriptional profiling using the TU-tagging method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). The TU-tagging method confirmed our findings on the known genes, and identified additional temporally-regulated genes not previously known to be expressed in neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here we focus on expression of Cas, Svp, Chinmo, Imp, Lin-28, and Syncrip, which are all known to be temporally expressed in larval neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). In addition we show that the Ecdysone receptor (EcR), Broad and E93 (Flybase: Eip93F) are also temporally expressed in late larval type II neuroblasts.</p><p>The Cas and Svp temporal factors are restricted to the earliest stages of larval type II neuroblast lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Interestingly, we detected Svp in variable subsets of type II neuroblasts in each brain lobe, consistent with transient, asynchronous expression in all type II neuroblasts. We confirmed that Svp was transiently expressed in all type II neuroblasts by visualizing the more stable <italic>svp-lacZ</italic> reporter in nearly all type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Three other early factors (Chinmo, Imp, and Lin-28) are expressed in all type II neuroblasts from larval hatching to ~48 hr, becoming undetectable by 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–K</xref>). Conversely, the Broad/Syncrip/E93 factors are detected in older type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–Q</xref>). There are four known isoforms of Broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), and we found that Broad-Z1 but not Broad-Z3 was expressed in type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Each late factor showed slightly different kinetics of expression: Syncrip was detectable earliest, in all type II neuroblasts by 60 hr, co-expressed with Imp at this stage. Broad was detected in most type II neuroblasts at 60 hr and staying at high levels before declining at 120 hr, and E93 showed gradually increasing expression beginning at 72 hr and remaining at high levels at 120 hr. Thus, these temporal factors can generate seven different molecular profiles during type II neuroblast lineages (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>); whether all of these molecular differences are functionally important remains to be determined (see Discussion). We conclude that type II neuroblasts change molecular profile over the course of their 120 hr long larval cell lineage, with a striking early-to-late transition from Chinmo/Imp/Lin-28 to Broad/Syncrip/E93 at ~60 hr, midway through their lineage.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26287.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of temporally expressed proteins in larval type II neuroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Cas and Svp are expressed from 24–36 hr (<bold>A</bold>,<bold>C</bold>,<bold>E</bold>) but not at 48 hr (<bold>B</bold>,<bold>D</bold>,<bold>E</bold>).

To test this hypothesis, we isolated larval brains and cultured them in vitro from 48–72 hr (across the early-to-late transition) with or without the bioactive form of ecdysone (20-hydroxy-ecdysone; 20HE). We used live imaging to measure cell cycle times, as well as assayed for expression of representative early or late factors. Larval brains cultured with added ecdysone are similar to wild type in down-regulating the early factor Chinmo and expressing the late factor Broad by the end of the culture period at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; quantified in H; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). In contrast, larval brains cultured without ecdysone showed persistent Chinmo expression and failed to express Broad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; quantified in H; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Importantly, the cell cycle times of type II neuroblasts are indistinguishable with or without ecdysone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>, quantified in G; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>), and similar to published type II neuroblast cell cycle times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homem et al., 2013</xref>). Taking these results together with our in vivo ecdysone experiments, we conclude that the steroid hormone ecdysone induces the early-to-late Chinmo/Imp to Broad/Syncrip/E93 gene expression transition in type II neuroblasts.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26287-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26287.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Explanted larval brain cultured in vitro from 48–72 hr with added 20-hydroxy-ecdysone.</title><p>Two type II neuroblasts are shown expressing <italic>wor-gal4 ase-gal80 UAS-myr:GFP</italic> (see Materials and methods).

Ecdysone is present at all larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kozlova and Thummel, 2000</xref>), suggesting the latter mechanism. Ecdysone signaling is quite direct, requiring the Ecdysone receptor (EcR-A, -B1, or -B2 isoforms) and the ubiquitous co-receptor Ultraspiracle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). We found that EcR-B1 was strongly detected in the nuclei of type II neuroblasts from 56 hr to at least 120 hr; prior to 56 hr neuroblasts did not express any EcR isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if EcR-B1 expression was induced by ecdysone signaling (e.g. via a different EcR receptor isoform) we assayed <italic>ecd<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutants at non-permissive temperature and assayed for EcR-B1 expression; we also assayed for EcR-B1 expression in brain explants cultured with or without exogenous ecdysone. In both experiments, we found that expression of EcR-B1 was not dependent on ecdysone signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>). Note that normal EcR expression during the culture window provides evidence that there is no general developmental delay in brains lacking ecdysone signaling, despite failure to undergo the Chinmo/Imp to Broad/Syncrip/E93 transition. We conclude that an ecdysone-independent pathway activates EcR-B1 expression at 56 hr, the time of the Chinmo/Imp to Broad/Syncrip/E93 gene expression transition (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>).</p><p>To determine if EcR was required for the Chinmo/Imp to Broad/Syncrip/E93 gene expression transition, we used <italic>wor-gal4 ase-gal80</italic> to drive expression of a dominant-negative Ecdysone receptor (<italic>EcR-B1<sup>W650A</sup></italic>; subsequently <italic>EcR<sup>DN</sup></italic>) specifically in type II neuroblasts, and assayed representative early and late factors.

Surprisingly, the late factor Broad was normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; quantified in 4L; see Discussion), again suggesting no general developmental delay.

In contrast, <italic>ecd<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutant larvae placed at restrictive temperature to block ecdysone signaling showed persistent expression of the early factor Chinmo and failure to activate the late factors Broad and E93 at 96 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>; quantified in G). Notably, we find that Syncrip is expressed in a small number of type I neuroblasts (~10) prior to widespread EcR expression at 56 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is likely that these neuroblasts use an EcR-B1-independent mechanism for activating Syncrip expression. We conclude that most central brain neuroblasts undergo an ecdysone-dependent early-to-late Chinmo/Imp to Syncrip/Broad/E93 gene expression transition.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26287.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ecdysone is required for early to late temporal factor transition in type I neuroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Control brains (<italic>ecd-ts</italic>/<italic>deficiency</italic> at 18°C) at the indicated timepoint.

Furthermore, we show that Svp activates expression of EcR-B1 in larval neuroblasts, which gives them competence to respond to ecdysone signaling, thereby triggering this gene expression transition. Although a global reduction of ecdysone levels is likely to have pleiotropic effects on larval development, we have performed multiple experiments to show that the absence or delay in late temporal factor expression following reduced ecdysone signaling is not due to general developmental delay. First, the EcR gene itself is expressed at the normal time (~56 hr) in the whole organism <italic>ecdysoneless<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, arguing strongly against a general developmental delay. Second, a type II neuroblast <italic>seven-up</italic> mutant clone shows a complete failure to express EcR and other late factors, in the background of an entirely wild type larvae; this is perhaps the strongest evidence that the phenotypes we describe are not due to a general developmental delay. Third, lineage-specific expression of EcR dominant negative leads to loss of Syncrip and E93 expression without affecting Broad expression; the normal Broad expression argues against a general developmental delay. Fourth, we used live imaging to directly measure cell cycle times and found that lack of ecdysone did not slow neuroblast cell cycle times. Taken together, these data support our conclusion that ecdysone signaling acts directly on larval neuroblasts to promote an early-to-late gene expression transition.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ecdysone is the first neuroblast-extrinsic cue known to regulate temporal gene expression</title><p>The role of ecdysone in regulating developmental transitions during larval stages has been well studied; it can induce activation or repression of suites of genes in a concentration dependent manner (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thummel [2001]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamanaka et al.

Ecdysone is required for termination of neuroblast proliferation at the larval/pupal transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Homem et al., 2014</xref>), and is known to play a significant role in remodeling of mushroom body neurons and at neuromuscular junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Awasaki and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kucherenko and Shcherbata, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schubiger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu and Schuldiner, 2014</xref>). Here we add to this list another function: to trigger a major gene expression transition in mid-larval brain neuroblasts.</p><p>Does ecdysone signaling provide an extrinsic cue that synchronizes larval neuroblast gene expression? We do not see good coordination of late gene expression, arguing against synchronization. For example, Syncrip can be detected in many neuroblasts by 60 hr, whereas Broad appears slightly later at ~72 hr, and E93 is only detected much later at ~96 hr, by which time Broad is low. This staggered expression of ecdysone target genes is reminiscent of early and late ecdysone-inducible genes in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baehrecke, 1996</xref>). In addition, for any particular temporal factor there are always some neuroblasts expressing it prior to others, but not in an obvious pattern. It seems the exact time of expression can vary between neuroblasts. Whether the pattern of response is due to different neuroblast identities, or a stochastic process, remains to be determined.</p><p>We have previously shown that the Hunchback-Krüppel-Pdm-Castor temporal gene transitions within embryonic neuroblasts are regulated by neuroblast-intrinsic mechanisms: they can occur normally in neuroblasts isolated in culture, and the last three factors are sequentially expressed in G<sub>2</sub>-arrested neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, optic lobe neuroblasts are likely to undergo neuroblast-intrinsic temporal transcription factor transitions, based on the observation that these neuroblasts form over many hours of development and undergo their temporal transitions asynchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasegawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, we show here that ecdysone signaling triggers a mid-larval transition in gene expression in all central brain neuroblasts (both type I and type II). Although ecdysone is present at all larval stages, it triggers central brain gene expression changes only following Svp-dependent expression of EcR-B1 in neuroblasts. Interestingly, precocious expression of EcR-B1 (<italic>worniu-gal4 UAS-EcR-B1</italic>) did not result in premature activation of the late factor Broad, despite the forced expression of high EcR-B1 levels in young neuroblasts (data not shown). Perhaps there is another required factor that is also temporally expressed at 56 hr. We also note that reduced ecdysone signaling in <italic>ecd<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutants or following EcR<sup>DN</sup> expression does not permanently block the Chinmo/Imp to Broad/Syncrip/E93 transition; it occurs with variable expressivity at 120–160 hr animals (pupariation is significantly delayed in these <italic>ecd<sup>ts</sup></italic> mutants), either due to a failure to completely eliminate ecdysone signaling or the presence of an ecdysone-independent mechanism.</p><p>We find a small but reproducible difference in the effect of reducing ecdysone levels using the biosynthetic pathway mutant <italic>ecd<sup>ts</sup></italic> versus expressing a dominant negative EcR in type II neuroblasts. The former genotype shows a highly penetrant failure to activate Broad in old neuroblasts, whereas the latter genotype has normal expression of Broad (despite failure to down-regulate Chinmo/Imp or activate E93). This may be due to failure of the dominant negative protein to properly repress the <italic>Broad</italic> gene. Differences between EcR<sup>DN</sup> and other methods of reducing ecdysone signaling have been noted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Homem et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Seven-up, but not Castor, is required to activate EcR receptor expression</title><p>Drosophila Svp is an orphan nuclear hormone receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mlodzik et al., 1990</xref>) with an evolutionarily conserved role in promoting a switch between temporal identity factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>).

Here we show that Svp is required for activating expression of EcR, which drives the mid-larval switch in gene expression from Chinmo/Imp to Syncrip/Broad/E93 in central brain neuroblasts. Our results are supported by independent findings that svp mutant clones lack expression of Syncrip and Broad in old type II neuroblasts (T. Lee, personal communication). Interestingly, Svp is required for neuroblast cell cycle exit at pupal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>), but how the early larval expression of Svp leads to pupal cell cycle exit was a mystery. Our results provide a satisfying link between these findings: we show that Svp activates expression of EcR-B1, which is required for the expression of multiple late temporal factors in larval neuroblasts. Any one of these factors could terminate neuroblast proliferation at pupal stages, thereby explaining how an early larval factor (Svp) can induce cell cycle exit five days later in pupae. It is interesting that one orphan nuclear hormone receptor (Svp) activates expression of a second nuclear hormone receptor (EcR) in neuroblasts. This motif of nuclear hormone receptors regulating each other is widely used in Drosophila, C. elegans, and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulanger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faunes and Larraín, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gissendanner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thummel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zelhof et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The position of the Svp+ neuroblasts varied among the type II neuroblast population from brain-to-brain, suggesting that Svp may be expressed in all type II neuroblasts but in a transient, asynchronous manner.

It is unknown what activates Svp in type II neuroblasts; its asynchronous expression is more consistent with a neuroblast-intrinsic cue, perhaps linked to the time of quiescent neuroblast re-activation, than with a lineage-extrinsic cue. It would be interesting to test whether Svp expression in type II neuroblasts can occur normally in isolated neuroblasts cultured in vitro, similar to the embryonic temporal transcription factor cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Castor and its vertebrate homolog Cas-Z1 specify temporal identity in Drosophila embryonic neuroblast lineages and vertebrate retinal progenitor lineages, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattar et al., 2015</xref>).

Larval brains were dissected in insect media (Sigma), fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBST (PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100) for 20 min. After fixing, brains were washed in PBST for 40 min and blocked in PBST with 5% normal goat and donkey serum mix (Vector Laboratories) for 40 min. Fixed brains were transferred to the primary antibody solutions of the appropriate dilutions and incubated overnight at 4C. The next day, brains were rinsed and washed for 40 min and then incubated in secondary antibody for 2 hr at room temperature. After secondary antibody incubation, a 40 min wash was performed and brains were stored and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Confocal imaging, data acquisition, and image analysis</title><p>Fluorescent images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710. Larval brain cell counting was performed using the FIJI cell counter plug in, and statistical analysis (Student’s T test) was done in Graph Pad Prism software. 0 hr pupal brain glia and neuron counting were by immortalizing GFP expression in type II neuroblast progeny using <italic>UAS-FLP actin-FRT-stop-FRT-gal4; wor-gal4 ase-gal80 UAS-mCD8:GFP</italic>, and then counting the Repo+ or Bsh+ nuclei within the GFP+ volume; nuclei were rendered using Imaris (Bitplane) and only those within the GFP+ volume were shown to eliminate expression from outside type II lineages. Figures were assembled in Illustrator (Adobe).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sen-Lin Lai, Minoree Kohwi, Qingzhong Ren and Tzumin Lee for comments on the manuscript; Claude Desplan, Hugo Bellen, Ward Odenwald, Tzumin Lee, Carl Thummel, Stefan Thor, Nick Sokol, Paul MacDonald, Gregory Guild, Ilan Davis, Florence Besse, and Cheng-Yu Lee for reagents.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Hugo Bellen, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript explores the temporal progression of type II neuroblasts using TU-tagging and differential RNA expression profiling to identify novel factors that could potentially influence neuronal diversity. Through these findings, novel transcription factors were found to be temporally expressed, and in addition, these transitions are mediated by an extrinsic factor, ecdysone. Although ecdysone is known to regulate many transitions including termination of neuroblast division, this is the first study to link ecdysone function with the early to late gene expression transition in neural progenitor cells. While the reviewers agree the manuscript is of interest, a number of concerns need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) The authors do not show actual TU-tagging data referring to that it is &quot;to be described elsewhere.&quot; It would be nice to see some of these results in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors describe an intriguing temporal gene cascade in type II NBs. How clear is it that all of the eight genes involved actually play a role with regards to cell fate and/or daughter/NB proliferation control? Can the authors clarify the connection between these eight genes and cell fate or proliferation control in Type II neuroblasts or provide a functional output?</p><p>3) Do the authors know what turns on Svp? If there is an easy solution to define this factor, it should be included.</p><p>4) In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;It would be interesting to test whether Svp expression in Type II neuroblasts can occur normally in isolated neuroblasts cultured in vitro…&quot; Since they already show type II cell culture data in the manuscript, can they easily test this?</p><p>5) The data from the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are very superficial and unconvincing. They should be presented better (Dpn staining) and they should be quantified (we only see ~10 neuroblasts) or the data should be removed.</p><p>6) The requirement of ecdysone/EcR in the transition of the neuroblasts is not absolute since the transition still occurs in their absence, although very delayed (120-160h). One possibility is that the ecdysone manipulations result in a delay of development, which impacts the neuroblasts as well. Alternatively, ecdysone and its receptor might not be necessary for the transition per se but are important for properly timing the transition. Moreover, when the authors use neuroblast-specific manipulations (such as the dominant negative EcR), the neuroblasts express Broad normally, although they do not express Syncrip and E93. And if one looks at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where the authors depict &quot;equivalent&quot; stages of larval brains with the ecdysone temperature-sensitive mutation in the permissive and restrictive temperature, it is easy to notice that these two brains are far from being in the same age: The ecdysone manipulations might have other consequences besides delaying larval development. The authors need to address or at least to discuss this issue. One possible experiment is to generate mutant neuroblast clones for Ecr-B1 and/or Usp and address the transition of the temporal factors in a wild-type background.</p><p>7) The authors suggest that EcR temporal expression is sufficient to induce an early to late transition or that ecdysone is not the triggering factor because &quot;it is present throughout larval development.&quot; However, ecdysone levels dramatically change during development and have multiple distinct peaks, one of which may trigger the transition. If temporal expression of EcR is responsible for the transition, this might actually be a way for all neuroblasts to be synchronized. Are Br/Syncrip expressed in a synchronous or asynchronous manner in individual central brain neuroblasts? If asynchronous, perhaps they can respond to the multiple ecdysone peaks during larval development, as long as they already express Svp?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26287.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors do not show actual TU-tagging data referring to that it is &quot;to be described elsewhere.&quot; It would be nice to see some of these results in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewers request, we have added the TU-tagging results for all of the genes discussed in this manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Panel A is an schematic of type II neuroblast lineage; panel B shows UPRT protein expression specifically in type II neuroblasts and their progeny; and panel C shows a heat map of genes differentially expressed at least one developmental stage. Note that elevated levels of Cas and Chinmo at 72h are likely due to the large number of neuroblast progeny expressing each gene; by 72h Cas and Chinmo proteins are undetectable in type II neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Importantly, these data highlighted the temporal expression of EcR, which launched the entire paper.</p><p><italic>2) The authors describe an intriguing temporal gene cascade in type II NBs. How clear is it that all of the eight genes involved actually play a role with regards to cell fate and/or daughter/NB proliferation control? Can the authors clarify the connection between these eight genes and cell fate or proliferation control in Type II neuroblasts or provide a functional output?</italic> </p><p>We completely agree! However, there are only two known molecular markers for neurons or glia born at different times in the type II neuroblast lineage: Repo+ glia are made early in the lineage (Izergina et al., 2009; Bayraktar and Doe, 2013) and BsH<sup>+</sup> neurons are made late in type II lineages (Bayraktar and Doe, 2013). Although analyzing all temporal genes for a role in Repo+ glial or BsH<sup>+</sup> neuron specification is beyond the scope of this paper (it would require precise birthdating of these neural subtypes and lengthy clonal functional analysis), we have followed the reviewers request and added one key experiment. We express the dominant negative EcR transgene specifically in type II neuroblast lineages, along with a GFP lineage tracer, and quantify the number of early-born Repo+ glia and the number of late-born BsH<sup>+</sup> neurons. Interestingly, we find reduction in EcR activity leads to loss of late-born neurons and a corresponding expansion of early-born glia (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This result shows that EcR is required to limit glial production and promote late-born BsH<sup>+</sup> neuron production. More speculatively, this result is consistent with the Repo+ glia being born near the end of the &quot;early&quot; window, and that failure to switch from Imp/Chinmo to Syp/E93 leads to continued production of glia at the expense of BsH<sup>+</sup> neurons.</p><p><italic>3) Do the authors know what turns on Svp? If there is an easy solution to define this factor, it should be included.</italic> </p><p>This is a great question, but we have no idea what turns on Svp.</p><p><italic>4) In the Discussion, the authors state that &quot;It would be interesting to test whether Svp expression in Type II neuroblasts can occur normally in isolated neuroblasts cultured in vitro…&quot; Since they already show type II cell culture data in the manuscript, can they easily test this?</italic> </p><p>We agree this is an interesting experiment, and we were hoping to add it to the paper. Unfortunately, we are unable to culture isolated neuroblasts from 24h larval brains without added exogenous factors such as insulin, and therefore we are unable to address the question of neuroblast-intrinsic/extrinsic cues; perhaps neuroblasts fail to come out of quiescence properly or require organism- or brain-derived survival factors. The reviewer is correct that we show in vitro culture data, but it is whole brain explants, and it is from a later stage of development (48h-60h).</p><p><italic>5) The data from the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are very superficial and unconvincing. They should be presented better (Dpn staining) and they should be quantified (we only see ~10 neuroblasts) or the data should be removed.</italic> </p><p>We have done both. We now show Dpn Ase staining to confirm type I identity, and add quantification. There is a highly significant failure to repress the early factor Chinmo and activate the late factors Broad and E93 in the absence of ecdysone signaling within type I central brain neuroblasts.</p><p><italic>6) The requirement of ecdysone/EcR in the transition of the neuroblasts is not absolute since the transition still occurs in their absence, although very delayed (120-160h). One possibility is that the ecdysone manipulations result in a delay of development, which impacts the neuroblasts as well. Alternatively, ecdysone and its receptor might not be necessary for the transition per se but are important for properly timing the transition. Moreover, when the authors use neuroblast-specific manipulations (such as the dominant negative EcR), the neuroblasts express Broad normally, although they do not express Syncrip and E93. And if one looks at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, where the authors depict &quot;equivalent&quot; stages of larval brains with the ecdysone temperature-sensitive mutation in the permissive and restrictive temperature, it is easy to notice that these two brains are far from being in the same age: The ecdysone manipulations might have other consequences besides delaying larval development. The authors need to address or at least to discuss this issue. One possible experiment is to generate mutant neuroblast clones for Ecr-B1 and/or Usp and address the transition of the temporal factors in a wild-type background.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate these comments, and we share the reviewers’ belief that it is essential to rule out general developmental delays as the origin of the phenotypes. We have multiple experiments that address this directly, and we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion describing them as a whole: &quot;Although a global reduction of ecdysone levels is likely to have pleiotropic effects on larval development, we have performed multiple experiments to show that the absence or delay in late temporal factor expression following reduced ecdysone signaling is not due to general developmental delay. […] Taken together, these data support our conclusion that ecdysone signaling acts directly on larval neuroblasts to promote an early-to-late gene expression transition.&quot;</p><p><italic>7) The authors suggest that EcR temporal expression is sufficient to induce an early to late transition or that ecdysone is not the triggering factor because &quot;it is present throughout larval development.&quot; However, ecdysone levels dramatically change during development and have multiple distinct peaks, one of which may trigger the transition.</italic> </p><p>Data from Kozlova and Thummel (2000) show that the ecdysone peak at 24h (L1-L2 transition) is larger than the ecdysone level at 56h. Thus, it is not just a supra-threshold response to ecdysone that activates late factor expression. Furthermore, we've shown that none of the EcR isoforms are detectable in type II neuroblasts prior to 56h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), making it very unlikely that ecdysone could act earlier than 56h when EcR-B1 is first detected in neuroblasts. We believe that it is both exposure to ecdysone and presence of the EcR in neuroblasts that is required. These two events are first coincident at 56h after larval hatching.</p><p><italic>If temporal expression of EcR is responsible for the transition, this might actually be a way for all neuroblasts to be synchronized. Are Br/Syncrip expressed in a synchronous or asynchronous manner in individual central brain neuroblasts? If asynchronous, perhaps they can respond to the multiple ecdysone peaks during larval development, as long as they already express Svp?</italic> </p><p>This is a great question, and the answer is asynchronous. Individual neuroblasts express temporal factors slightly asynchronously in each brain (although in general very reproducible, e.g. E93 starts to be expressed at ~96h but never at 60h). Whether this slight asynchrony is due to spatial identity differences between neuroblasts, or due to stochastic differences in responsiveness to ecdysone remains to be determined.</p></body></sub-article></article>
