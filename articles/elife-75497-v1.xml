Recently, we discovered that the distal Sh1 sheath cells associate with mitotic germ cells as they exit the niche Gordon et al., 2020. Here, we report that these sheath-associated germ cells differentiate first in animals with temperature-sensitive mutations affecting germ cell state, and stem-like germ cells are maintained distal to the Sh1 boundary. We analyze several markers of the distal sheath, which is best visualized with endogenously tagged membrane proteins, as overexpressed fluorescent proteins fail to localize to distal membrane processes and can cause gonad morphology defects. However, such reagents with highly variable expression can be used to determine the relative positions of the two Sh1 cells, one of which often extends further distal than the other.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell niche</kwd><kwd>somatic gonad</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>Sh1</kwd><kwd>gonadal sheath</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM147704-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Kacy Lynn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> adult hermaphrodite germ cells leave the stem cell niche, they associate with a pair of somatic gonad cells that were thought to be symmetrical, but that actually take on dramatically different positions in the organ.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> hermaphrodite gonad is a fruitful system in which to study organogenesis, meiosis, and stem cell niche biology. Recent work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) used two endogenously tagged alleles of genetically redundant innexin genes <italic>inx-8</italic> and <italic>inx-9</italic> to visualize the somatic gonadal sheath of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite. We discovered that the distal most pair of sheath cells, called Sh1, lies immediately adjacent to the distal tip cell (DTC), which is the stem cell niche of the germline stem cells. Previously (based on electron microscopy and on cytoplasmic GFP overexpression from transgenes active in the sheath [<italic>lim-7p::GFP</italic>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hall et al., 1999</xref>] or its progenitor cells [<italic>lag-2p::GFP</italic>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>]), Sh1 cells were thought to associate only with germ cells well into the meiotic cell cycle, so our finding required a reimagining of the anatomy of the distal gonad.</p><p>Here, we confirm that the Sh1 cells fall at the boundary of a population of germ cells in a stem-like state, report other markers that label the Sh1 cells, and verify that these markers can be used to assess gonad anatomy without unduly impacting the gonad itself. We also discuss reagents that are not suitable markers of Sh1 cells, including an overexpressed, functional cell death receptor that is used to mark Sh1 in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, we consider best practices for using endogenously tagged proteins for cell and developmental studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distal Sh1 associates with the population of germ cells that differentiate first when progression through mitosis is halted or Notch signaling is lost</title><p>Our first experiment addresses in a new way the question of what type of germ cells associate with the distal Sh1 cell. The DTC expresses the Notch ligand LAG-2, which is necessary to maintain the germline stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>). Recent work has shown that the active transcription of Notch targets <italic>sygl-1</italic> and <italic>lst-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and the accumulation of their proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shin et al., 2017</xref>) is restricted to the distal-most germ cells, describing a population of stem-like germ cells ~6–8 germ cell diameters (~25–35 µm) from the distal end of the gonad. Our recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>) reported that the position of Sh1 coincides with <italic>sygl-1</italic> promoter’s activation boundary on one side and the accumulation of the meiotic entry protein GLD-1 on the other, consistent with the hypothesis that the distal edge of Sh1 falls at the boundary of that stem-like cell population, ~30 µm from the distal end of the gonad.</p><p>A similarly positioned stem-like germ cell population was found in earlier work that used temperature-sensitive alleles to perturb germ cell fate or progress through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>). The readout was germ cell fate as determined in one of two ways. Anti-phosphohistone H3 staining of proliferative cells and GLD-1 antibody costaining for cells accumulating meiotic factors shows where cells are dividing and beginning to differentiate, respectively. Alternatively, the ‘transition zone’ in germ cell nuclear morphology between ‘mitotic’ and ‘meiotic’ zones can be visualized by the presence of crescent-shaped nuclei of meiotic prophase observed by DAPI staining. We used this latter method of visualizing nuclear morphology.</p><p>We repeated these experiments in strains that have tagged innexins to mark the distal sheath Sh1 cells to ask which population(s) of germ cells are associated with Sh1. Here, we describe the original findings and their interpretations, and then our new findings. First, an <italic>emb-30</italic> temperature-sensitive allele is known to cause germ cell division to arrest at the metaphase-anaphase transition, thus halting the distal-to-proximal movement of germ cells that is driven by the proliferation of more distal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>). In a wild-type gonad, germ cells differentiate (enter and progress through the meiotic cell cycle) as they move from distal to proximal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). In <italic>emb-30(ts</italic>) gonads, a shift to the restrictive temperature causes proliferation to halt and germ cells to remain stationary within the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). These cells can now differentiate in place—or remain in the undifferentiated state—depending on their exposure to the stemness cue. Germ cells that remain in the niche at the distal end of the gonad do not differentiate after 15 hr at the restrictive temperature, while more proximal germ cells do differentiate. Nuclear morphology differs between these two regions of the germline.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Sh1 cells associate with proliferative germ cells that are on the path to differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of hypothesis for <italic>emb-30(tn377</italic>) experiment.

Indeed, this is what we found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>), supporting our prior conclusion that there is germ cell fate asymmetry across the DTC-Sh1 boundary. These results are independent of culture time of controls at the permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Sh1 cells cover proliferative germ cells outside the niche that are closer to differentiating than those under the DTC.</p><p>The second set of experiments using temperature-sensitive alleles to reveal differences in germ cell fate along the distal-proximal axis uses <italic>glp-1(ts</italic>) alleles to stop Notch signal transduction and observe where and when germ cells acquire features of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Cinquin et al., 2010</xref>) found that the <italic>glp-1(q224</italic>) temperature-sensitive allele reared at the restrictive temperature over a 9 hr time course showed a progressively shrinking mitotic zone (as assessed by nuclear morphology of DAPI stained gonads) until hour ~5.5, at which time the remaining distal most ~5 rows of germ cells differentiate as a pool. A subsequent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fox and Schedl, 2015</xref>) used a similar approach (but with the <italic>glp-1(bn18</italic>) temperature-sensitive allele, slightly different timing, and antibody staining to determine cell fate) and found a similar result, and additionally discovered that progress through the cell cycle influenced the precise timing of germ cell differentiation.</p><p>We used the <italic>glp-1(bn18</italic>) allele to deactivate Notch signaling in a strain with GFP::INX-9 to visualize the Sh1 cells and the fluorescent histone marker <italic>naSi2(mex-5p::H2B::mCherry</italic>) to visualize germ cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We hypothesized that after 6 hr at the restrictive temperature, only the distal-most pool of stem-like cells will not have taken on the crescent-shaped nuclear morphology of meiotic germ cells, while the germ cells under Sh1 will have entered the meiotic cell cycle. We predicted that the Sh1 cell would not change its position across this time interval. Indeed, this is what we found, further supporting our hypothesis that the Sh1-associated germ cells are closer to differentiation than those under the DTC, which are the last to differentiate.</p><p>Results from these temperature-sensitive mutants confirm what the markers of germ cell fate revealed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>, which is that the Sh1 cell associates with germ cells in the proliferative zone that have left the stem cell niche and are on the path to differentiation, while the stem-like germ cells lie immediately distal to the Sh1 cell at its interface with the DTC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Different endogenously tagged membrane proteins reveal a distal position of Sh1</title><p>These experiments made use of the endogenously N-terminal tagged <italic>inx-8(qy78[mKate::inx-8]</italic>) and <italic>inx-9(qy79[GFP::inx-9]</italic>) alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>. Both tagged proteins are highly specific for the somatic gonad throughout development; in the adult, their expression differentiates, with INX-8 signal diminishing from the DTC and INX-9 signal persisting (see white DTC outline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We have since identified additional endogenous fluorescent-protein-tagged alleles that show expression in the gonadal sheath cells and localize in or near the cell membrane. One of these, <italic>ina-1(qy23[ina-1::mNeonGreen]</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), was briefly reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>.

Strikingly, among animals under a threshold of expression intensity of ~400 AU (less than 1/3 as bright as the brightest GFP samples), the incidence of a DTC-Sh1 interface was 100% (10/10, as opposed to 15/30 for the whole dataset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In samples for which CED-1::GFP signal terminates at a great distance from the distal end of the gonad, there are two possible explanations.

These markers colocalize in a substantial fraction of animals, as has been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>, see Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2 therein). In the animals that have a discrepancy between GFP and mKate localization in Sh1, the difference in expression reveals an unexpected cell boundary between the two Sh1 cells. We imaged 19 gonads from the coexpressing strain DG5131 through their full thickness. Of those, 4/19 had severe gonad morphology defects (see next section). Of the 15 morphologically normal gonads, 6/15 had discrepancies in CED-1::GFP and mKate::INX-8 signal. In 3/6 such cases, one Sh1 cell makes up the entire DTC-Sh1 interface, with the other terminating at a greater distance from the distal end. In the other 3/6 of cases, both Sh1 cells border the DTC. Fluorescence signal from mKate::INX-8 alone does not allow these cell borders to be detected because that marker is more consistently expressed across the Sh1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>The variability of the <italic>lim-7p::ced-1::GFP</italic> transgene allowed us to perform something like a mosaic analysis when the two Sh1 cells have very different expression levels but the dimmer cell is still visible (N=31/53 morphologically normal DG5020 gonads imaged to full depth, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Where the borders of the two Sh1 cells can be distinguished, one cell extends at least 20 µm farther distal than the other in 23/31 cases; five additional gonads have expression in only one Sh1 cell that terminates at a great distance (&gt;70 µm) from the distal end. The edges of dimly expressing Sh1 cells can be difficult to resolve.

Subtracting background, we find that there is a 50% reduction in tagged INX-8 in such membrane regions. Since mKate::INX-8 is a genomically encoded, functional protein, such disruption likely impacts endogenous protein function.

We conducted brood size assays for strains discussed in this study, including the DG5131 strain containing both <italic>lim-7p::ced-1::GFP</italic> and the tagged innexin <italic>qy78[mKate::inx-8]</italic> that was imaged and analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>, but not assayed for brood size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Brood size assays.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Strain name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Full genotype</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Live brood<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1"><sup>*</sup></xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reduction vs. wt %</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Unhatched eggs</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Embryonic lethality %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild type</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">295±39 (n=57)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2"><sup>†</sup></xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">KLG019</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">qy79[GFP::inx-9];nasi2<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn3"><sup>‡</sup></xref>, <italic><sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">§</xref></sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">226±22 (n=13)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">23%</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">165±58</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">41 ± 8%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">NK2571<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn5">¶</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>qy78[mKate::inx-8];cpIs122</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">§</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">220±41 (n=15)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">25%</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">20±14</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">9 ± 5%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DG5020<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn5">¶</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>bcIs39[lim-7p::ced-1::GFP];naIs37</italic><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">§</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">202±29 (n=12)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">32%</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">62±47</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">20 ± 14%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">DG5131</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">qy78[mKate::inx-8];bcIs39[lim-7p::ced-1::GFP];naIs37<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn4">§</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">187±45 (n=14)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">37%</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">40±25</td><td align="char" char="plusmn" valign="bottom">18 ± 11%</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">LP530</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>cp243[cam-1::mNG]</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">260±31 (n=10)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12%</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">NK2324</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>qy23[ina-1::mNG]</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">237±37 (n=8)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20%</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>Viable offspring that hatch from a single parent.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn2"><label>†</label><p>N2 numbers come from multiple trials, not all of which were scored for embryonic lethality, including the trial in which <italic>ina-1(qy23</italic>) and <italic>cam-1(cp243</italic>) were counted.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn3"><label>‡</label><p><italic>qy79[GFP::inx-9]</italic> allele in strains NK2572 and NK2573 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>, with germ cell nuclear marker <italic>naSi2</italic>;

We therefore turned our attention back to the distal gonad and asked whether the strains with fluorescent sheath markers have abnormalities in several metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The length of the proliferative zone differs among strains (as measured by DAPI staining of germ cell nuclei to detect and measure the length of the germline distal to crescent-shaped nuclei of meiosis I, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hubbard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C and D</xref>).

Wild-type N2 had an average of 4.6 dividing cells per gonad; NK2571 had an average of 5.1 dividing cells per gonad (these two were not significantly different); DG5020 had an average of 3.4 dividing cells per gonad; DG5131 had an average of 3.2 dividing cells per gonad (these last two strains were significantly different from wild type, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and legend).

Expression of the <italic>qy78</italic> allele alone with a DTC marker, on the other hand, does not cause any of these quantitative gonad phenotypes. The moderate brood size defects shown by all strains could be caused by numerous processes outside of stem cell regulation. For example, we find the hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>, based on the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Starich et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Starich et al., 2014</xref>, that a major role of <italic>inx-8</italic>/<italic>9</italic> is in the proximal gonad regulating the provisioning of oocytes with essential metabolites, to be compelling. This hypothesis also has support from the large number of unhatched eggs observed for <italic>inx-9(qy79[GFP::inx-9]</italic>). Thus, we conclude with the observation that endogenous, fluorescently tagged sheath membrane proteins consistently mark both of the distal Sh1 cells without measurably impairing distal gonad function and should be the reagents of choice for live imaging in this cell type. They also consistently report a distal Sh1 position adjacent to the stem cell zone, as we previously found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We discovered that the distal position of Sh1 is much closer to the distal end of the young adult hermaphrodite gonad than than was previously observed, where it forms an interface with the DTC’s proximal projections and overlaps substantially with the proliferative zone of the germline where mitotic cell divisions occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, that study did not claim that Sh1 is necessary or sufficient for what we term ‘niche exit’; we simply observed that Sh1 associates with germ cells as they exit the niche by division. We have now confirmed this finding with functional manipulations of germ cell cycling and cell fate. We observed a distal Sh1 position in other strains with endogenously tagged sheath cell membrane proteins that act in molecular pathways outside of gap junctional coupling, and in a substantial fraction of traditional transgenic animals expressing <italic>lim-7</italic> promoter-driven CED-1::GFP, GFP::CAAX and cytoplasmic GFP (though these strains have high variability in fluorescence intensity and localization). Therefore, we consider the results presented here to be confirmatory of the foundational finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>, which is that almost all mitotic germ cells in the adult hermaphrodite contact the DTC or Sh1, with a noteworthy population in contact with both. Other recent work provides further evidence of a role for sheath cell contact in promoting adult germ cell proliferation, specifically through modulation of Notch receptor <italic>glp-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gopal et al., 2020</xref>). We focus especially on young adults in these studies (less than 24 hr post mid-L4, see Methods). An important caveat to the work is that the gonad is dynamic, and cell shapes and positions change over time. Indeed, dynamic processes could lead to the surprising difference in position often seen between the two Sh1 cells in a single gonad arm, if one Sh1 cell grows more actively over germ cells as they leave the niche. The high variability of expression levels of an overexpressed <italic>lim-7p::ced-1::GFP</italic> transgene has allowed for this surprising discovery, though that variability makes it a poor marker of the absolute position of the Sh1 cells, it sometimes causes gonad defects, and it interacts synthetically with <italic>qy78</italic> to cause germline defects.</p><p>This work was inspired by a recent preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tolkin et al., 2021</xref>; <italic>biorxiv,</italic> version 1). This preprint initially reported a severe brood size and embryonic lethality defect in strains bearing the <italic>qy78</italic> allele (just over 100 offspring per animal, with day 1 embryonic lethality of nearly 90%) and hypothesized that abnormal innexin function caused by endogenously tagging INX-8 with mKate could be responsible for both the fertility defect and the novel finding of a distal position of Sh1 abutting the stem cell zone. This indeed would be a serious concern, and we are grateful that other researchers in the community are vigilant and interested in the strains we generated.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref> (revised) downscales concerns about brood size (over 200 offspring per animal) and embryonic lethality (under 10% total) but still proposes that the distal Sh1 position revealed by <italic>qy78</italic> is an artifact of protein tagging. The study uses an overexpressed, GFP-tagged, functional cell death receptor protein as the preferred marker of the sheath (the <italic>bcIs39</italic> allele encoding <italic>lim-7p::ced-1::GFP</italic>), but does not justify why such an element should be assumed to be a robust and non-phenotypic marker of the distal sheath. This genetic element—which we demonstrated to interact synthetically with <italic>qy78</italic> to cause gonad and germline defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)<italic>—</italic>is present in the genetic background of the worms analyzed in the vast majority of the experiments reported in the four data figures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>: Figure 1 (all, no true wild-type analyzed), Figure 2 (half of panels D–F with another marker in the other half of those panels, see next), Figure 3 (all, no wild-type analyzed), Figure 4 (all, no wild-type analyzed). In all of these experiments, we conclude the synthetic interaction is driving the phenotypes attributed to <italic>qy78,</italic> including the dosage-dependent and deletion-mediated suppression of the phenotypes attributed to <italic>qy78</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref> (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>In the rest of Figure 2D-F, Tolkin et al. use a <italic>fasn-1::GFP</italic> sheath marker coexpressed with <italic>qy78</italic>. Only six samples were observed, and only 2/6 had the ‘Class 3’ phenotype with a dramatically distal Sh1 border. This differs notably from what is observed for the innexin-defective <italic>inx-14(ag17</italic>) hypomorphic allele shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C for which 21/21 <italic>fasn-1::GFP</italic> coexpressing samples had ‘Class 3’ gonads. We do not find this experiment to be decisive because of low sample size for this genotype and results in Figure 2F that appear to fall within the distribution of the control.</p><p>Next, we consider the other experiments that do not include the <italic>bcIs39</italic> marker. In Figure 2B–C and Figure 2–figure supplements 1 and 2, Tolkin et al. use an anti-INX-8 antibody in an immunofluorescence experiment that reports a more proximal Sh1 boundary in the wild type than in worms carrying the <italic>qy78</italic> allele. We note the conspicuous absence of innexin detected in the DTC, where it had been reported previously (see the wild-type gonad image in both Figure 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Starich et al., 2014</xref>, and Figure 2A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Starich et al., 2020</xref>). We also note that the anti-INX-8 sheath localization is like a honeycomb, not sparse and punctate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Starich et al., 2020</xref> present evidence that a honeycomb localization pattern for innexins indicates that gap junctions are not forming properly, so this pattern in the wild-type sample is unexpected. Different imaging modalities often yield different patterns, and the previously published control image was made on a compound microscope while the image in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref> (Figure 2B) was made with a confocal microscope. However, it does not seem likely that a switch in imaging approaches would detect more abundant signal in one region (Sh1) and yet lose signal in another (the DTC) in the same field of view. Setting aside questions of reproducibility of this antibody staining experiment, this type of data could shed light on the position of the sheath in a genetically wild-type animal. Of note, Figure 3C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Starich et al., 2014</xref> shows antibody staining of gap junctions forming in what appears to be the Sh1 region at a distance of ~10 germ cell diameters from the distal end.</p><p>Transmission electron microscopy was also included in the revised version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>. The 3D reconstruction in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows a sheath that has a honeycomb pattern, presumably due to the thinness of Sh1 as it overlies germ cell bodies (annotation was based on the presence of mitochondria), so we know this technique under-annotates the thinnest regions of the Sh1 cell. It also appears to show what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>, would call a ‘Class 2’ gonad—the DTC and Sh1 cells terminate within ~2 germ cell diameters of one another. It is not representative of a ‘Class 1’ gonad with a large gap (that ‘exceeds 25 µm’). According to the scaling in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, the distal Sh1 annotations fall ~40 µm from the distal end. Taken at face value, this TEM data is equivocal on the question of whether there is a ‘bare region’ between the DTC and Sh1.</p><p>When we inspect the TEM stack in Video 4, we observe unannotated structures surrounding the germ cells. They have low complexity, making us wonder if they are an artifact of tissue shrinkage during fixation. Some appear to be contiguous with the annotated somatic cells (DTC and Sh1). Perhaps a more generous annotation would reveal more of the thin somatic cell structures that we know from live imaging are there (minimally, continuous Sh1 cover across germ cell bodies in the more proximal region). With that level of annotation, what distal Sh1 structures would appear? This is a very helpful type of data to include, and hopefully future studies of more TEM samples will help decide the issue.</p><p>Finally, each study furnishes additional strains with Sh1 fluorescence expression terminating in variously distal or more proximal domains: Tolkin et al. use <italic>fasn-1::gfp</italic> (endogenously tagged, cytoplasmic), <italic>acy-4::gfp</italic> (extrachromosomal, membrane localized), and <italic>lim-7p::gfp</italic> (integrated array, cytoplasmic); we report <italic>ina-1::mNG</italic> (endogenously tagged, membrane localized)<italic>, cam-1::mNG</italic> (endogenously tagged, membrane localized)<italic>,</italic> and <italic>lim-7p::GFP::CAAX</italic> (integrated array, membrane localized). The challenge with definitively proving a more proximal boundary of Sh1—after seeing images like those described in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and its <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) , and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref> (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) —is the challenge of proving a negative. When distal expression is not observed, how can one be certain that the whole sheath is labeled? Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and the aforementioned images make it clear that some fluorescent markers fail to capture distal Sh1 structures even when the structures are detectable by other means, and even when they brightly label more proximal cells.</p><p>Taken together, we suspect that we are seeing more or less the same things but describing them differently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref> observe a DTC-Sh1 interface in many worms (~30%) expressing their favored sheath marker (the highly variable <italic>bcIs39</italic>). These ‘Class 2’ gonads have the pattern that we first reported for endogenously tagged sheath proteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), including <italic>ina-1::mNG</italic> (an integrin subunit) and <italic>cam-1::mNG</italic> (a Wnt pathway member) that are not obvious candidates to have dominant antimorphic effects on innexin signaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref> indeed identify several genetic backgrounds in which the spatial relationship between the DTC and Sh1 is perturbed, though how the mechanism acts through changes in innexin function, CED-1::GFP overexpression, or both, remains to be seen. We strongly agree that innexins in the gonadal sheath are important for gonad and germline development.</p><p>In physics, the observer effect states that it is impossible to observe a system without changing it. In biological imaging in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this means that we can either observe wild-type animals that are dead, dissected and/or fixed and coated or stained, or we can observe genetically modified animals that are alive. Some fine, membranous cellular structures do not survive fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gerdes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, any genomic modification runs the risk of altering an animal’s physiology.</p><p>We feel most confident examining endogenously tagged gene products in Sh1 for several reasons. First, proteins expressed at physiological levels are less likely to directly damage a cell vs. overexpressed fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kintaka et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the ability to cross-reference among strains with different tagged proteins that act in different molecular pathways allows us to use concordant results in reconstructing cell positions; any single marker may or may not localize to the region of interest, but concordant results among independent experiments help construct an accurate picture of the cell. One factor to consider, however, is that not every endogenously expressed protein is likely to localize evenly across all regions of a cell. We would expect in a large cell like Sh1 that interacts with germ cells in many stages of maturation that some cell-surface proteins would be regionalized. Along those lines, it seems possible that the Sh1 cells might have mechanisms to exclude the cell death receptor CED-1 from the cell membrane domain that contacts proliferating germ cells. The <italic>bcIs39</italic> transgene is typically used to study engulfment of apoptotic germ cell corpses at the bend of the gonad and rescues <italic>ced-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants for apoptotic germ cell corpse engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). We find this marker to be unreliable in the distal region of the cell, and to cause gonad defects especially but not only when combined with endogenously tagged <italic>inx-8(qy78</italic>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tolkin et al., 2022</xref>) uses this transgene in most of the backgrounds analyzed (sometimes detecting the CED-1::GFP by anti-GFP antibody staining, which appears to amplify the variability of the marker), so we find this problematic reagent to undermine that study’s conclusions.</p><p>The need for caution when observing and interpreting endogenously tagged fluorescent proteins is noted. Several steps can and should be taken to increase confidence that a tagged protein is not causing cryptic or unwanted phenotypes. First, multiple edited lines should be recovered and outcrossed, thereby reducing the likelihood that a phenotype is caused by off-target Cas9 cutting creating lesions in any individual edited genome. Second, brood size should be estimated either by timed food depletion (less rigorous) or formal brood size assays (more rigorous). Third, edited lines should be examined for known phenotypes caused by loss of function of the targeted genes. This can be done, in order of least to most rigorous, by consulting the literature, by comparing to RNAi treatments or known mutants, and finally by introducing AID tags and using the degron strategy to deplete the gene product under the lab’s exact experimental conditions of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), however this step will not work for extracellular tags (because extracellular AID tags are not accessible to TIR1 ubiquitin ligase). Finally, any ‘markers’ used should be assessed on their own for phenotypes. Even with these controls in place, synthetic interactions can emerge between ‘markers’ and alleles, including tagged proteins of interest. These interactions can themselves reveal biologically relevant phenomena, but only if they are recognized.</p><p>In the end, no transgenic or genome-edited strain is truly wild type, and it should be our expectation that such strains might be somewhat sensitized as a result. Indeed, the synthetic interaction we document between <italic>lim-7p::ced-1::gfp</italic> and <italic>inx-8(qy78</italic>) suggests that the <italic>qy78</italic> is sensitized for gonad defects caused by other genetic elements affecting the gonadal sheath. However, the perfect reagent does not exit. We can only look for congruent results among a set of independent reagents with non-overlapping weaknesses. Finally, we can formulate questions narrowly enough that, despite their shortcomings, our imperfect reagents are adequate to help answer them. In the future, new endogenously tagged alleles that are expressed in the sheath, single-copy, membrane-localized transgenes that do not affect distal gonad patterning, and different imaging modalities like electron microscopy will shed more light on the complex relationship between the gonadal sheath and the germline. At the present time, however, we consider the existence of an interface between the DTC and Sh1 cells that coincides with the boundary of the distal-most stem-like germ cells to be supported by the preponderance of evidence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>In strain descriptions, we designate linkage to a promoter with a <italic>p</italic> following the gene name and designate promoter fusions and in-frame fusions with a double semicolon (::).

Mid L4 animals are picked from healthy, unstarved populations (which are maintained without starving for the duration of the experiment). These animals are kept at 20°C for 16–18 hr, until adulthood is reached and ovulation begins. We prefer not to age the animals much farther into adulthood for routine imaging (though we did this for the temperature shift experiments to follow previously published experimental regimes), as once a full row of embryos is present in the uterus, the distal gonads can become compressed or obscured by embryos. For strains in which a gonad migration defect is observed (DG5020, DG5131), picking animals in the L4 stage prevents bias for or against normal-looking adults (as the defects are profound enough to be visible on the dissecting scope in adults).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Temperature-sensitive mutant analysis</title><p>Worms from the <italic>emb-30(tn377</italic>) mutant genotype were grown at the permissive temperature (16°C) for 24 hr past L4.

A DTC-Sh1 interface is detected by subtracting the first value from the second value—negative numbers reflect the amount of overlap of these cellular domains across the germline, positive numbers reflect a gap. This is a conservative estimate, as a gap of less than 1 germ cell diameter (~5 µm) would still allow germ cells to contact both the DTC and Sh1 at the same time.

The singled animals were passaged once per day on each of the following 5 days to fresh plates, with all plates maintained at 20°C. Two days after removing the parent, the plates with larval offspring were moved to 4°C for 20 min to cause worm motion to cease, and all larvae (and unhatched eggs when noted) were counted on a dissecting scope with a clicker by the same team of worm counters, with internal controls.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including X as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Judith Yanowitz (Reviewer #2); Ekaterina Voronina (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the manuscript represents an important advance that is based on the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Gordon et al.). However, there are important issues brought up by reviewers that need to be addressed as you can see below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overall, it seems that this manuscript presents a compelling case that their earlier conclusion was correct. However, the data as well as explanation are sometimes not detailed enough, making it difficult to assess the rigor of the work. As detailed below, I'd like to see a bit more data that affirm their conclusion.</p><p>– line 62-69 is very difficult to understand. The emb-30 mutant and glp-1 mutant are not explained sufficiently (what they are, what phenotypes to expect in more details are needed), making it hard to understand the flow of the logic. The results seem to be consistent with the notion that Sh1 influences the differentiation of germ cells, once they exit the stem cell niche created by the DTC. But I think at least more thorough explanation is necessary, and perhaps additional more convincing data are needed. In Figure 1, 'germ cell phenotype' is only assessed by DAPI staining (the other markers only telling the location of DTC and Sh1) and it cannot be concluded for sure whether their assessment is correct.</p><p>– Fig4E (legend says it's G, please correct) - what it tries to show is unclear to non-expert. Please add control and elaborate exactly what is a defect.</p><p>– Figure 5: this is a critical figure to prove that Tolkin et al. might have used a combination of transgenic alleles that together causes germ cell defects. However, the 'phenotypes' is only assessed by DAPI in Figure 5, and it is unclear whether their observations (defects, or lack thereof) are comparable to what Tolkin et al. described in their manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The Li et al. paper is essentially a response to recently submitted manuscript, Tolkin et al. 2021 and a follow-up on the senior author's prior work characterizing the relationship between Sh1, the DTC, and germ cell proliferation. Overall the manuscript provides evidence that the ced-1::GFP marker in Sh1 appears to be deleterious and therefore argues for caution when using extrachromosomal arrays and when relying heavily on single reporters to assess cell morphology. However, there is little new in the data, but rather it stands as a commentary to Tolkin et al.</p><p>One of the critical issues here as that the Tolkin paper suggests that the tagged inx-8 allele should not be used as a Sh1 marker since it is dominant negative. This paper suggests that there are defects associated with lim-7::CED-1::GFP which preclude this as a marker. While substantive data supports the latter (albeit with fairly low N numbers), the authors do not address whether there might be problems with the inx-8 mKate strain. They do, however, argue about the validity of their observations by a detailed analysis of imaging data that accounts for weak fluorescence and by use of multiple difference promoter GFP transgenes.</p><p>One of the major areas of conflict between this paper and Tolkin et al. is whether the inx-8 tagged strains has brood size defects: this paper and prior work say no; the Tolkin paper says yes. Are there differences in the growth media or temperatures used in the different labs? This should be resolved between the labs.</p><p>There is some concern that a subset of the markers are extracellular vs intracellular and the extracellular markers could be cleaved – an issue that is dismissed.</p><p>For all figures, the transgenes/tagged proteins used and specific strains must be listed in the figure and legend.</p><p>The statement that &quot;A recent study (Tolkin et al., 2021) uses this transgene in all of the backgrounds analyzed (sometimes detecting the CED-1::GFP by anti-GFP antibody staining, which appears to amplify the variability of the marker), so we find this problematic reagent to undermine that study's conclusions.&quot; Is untrue. The Tolkin paper also used Plim-7::GFP without CED-1. Please modify this statement and clarify how you think that marker would be incorrectly analyzed.</p><p>It is very difficult to interpret the images in Figure 1 and 2: in some cases the DTC has long projection, in others it does not; in some images the germ lines are fat (Figure 1A,B) or bent and deformed (Figure 2A,C). IN figure 2F, it is unclear why this is DIC +GFP since the full GFP signal may not be apparent with the DIC and why are there lots of eggs around. Overall an improvement in the imaging would better help the reader understand the data and compare across figures/genotypes.</p><p>The description of the emb-30 and glp-1 alleles is confusing. It is not clear why these alleles would be a test of their hypothesis. Also of concern is that the shift of these alleles is done is L4/adulthood after the Sh1 cells is differentiated? Are they arguing that the Sh1 does not change in morphology in response to the shift in the germ cell state?</p><p>In Figure 2A-C, an asterick should be used to mark the DTC.</p><p>In text it would be helpful to better describe what Figure 1 is showing. What do you mean by &quot;pink arrow marking gc transition&quot;.</p><p>The actual distance here is irrelevant if the germ lines are different sizes. A better measure is the number of nuclear widths.</p><p>In the methods, it is stated that, 16{degree sign}C experiments are cultured longer (for emb-30), but what is the evidence to support the choice of a 3 hour difference? Why is a similar criterion not use for the glp-1(ts)?</p><p>DAPI staining in the methods: &quot;DAPI staining was done according to standard protocols&quot;. Needs to be referenced. I am shocked at the concentration of DAPI. My understanding is that concentrations of 1/50,000 dilution of 10ug/ml stock are used. Was this really not in water and not buffer?</p><p>While the desire to be concise is appreciate, in the methods or an accompanying table, the full description of the strains must be provided.</p><p>There needs to be clarification as to the source of the strains. (perhaps in a strain table).</p><p>What is meant by &quot;DG5020 and DG5131 were shipped overnight on 9/23&quot;. Shipped from where?</p><p>In table 1, subscript &quot;b&quot; says: &quot;N2 numbers come from multiple trials, not all of which counted negligible numbers of dead embryos, including the trial in which ina-1(qy23) and cam-1(cp243) were counted&quot;. Does this mean that in a subset of the trials, there was embryonic lethality in the N2 strain? How is the accounted for? Why is it not shown?</p><p>Also related table 1, it is stated: &quot;our endogenously tagged inx-8(qy78) and inx-9(qy79) strains had dramatically different degrees of embryonic lethality, with qy79 producing over 150 unhatched eggs per worm.&quot; When I look at the table, the brood size for inx-9 is ~226 with 41% embryonic lethality. This would lead to on average ~85 unhatched eggs/worm not 150. Where do these numbers come from and which is correct?</p><p>Given that there are differences between the labs in the behaviors of different strains, it is critical that Kacy et al. perform the control brood sizes on the inx-8 and inx-9 described in lines 231 -236 since a critical aspect of their interpretation hinges on this.</p><p>Lines 239-240, please provide references for other brood sizes conducted in the lab.</p><p>What do you mean in Figure 4 by aberrant engulfment? It seems it is just pointing to foci at the cell membranes that could be junctions between the cells.</p><p>Lines 114-121 should refer to an image figure (3C,D)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Li et al. describe their further investigation of somatic Sh1 cells association with underlying germ cells. This work provides further support for the model where the distal border of Sh2 cell is forming an interface with DTC and Sh1 overlays the mitotic germ cells poised for differentiation. These findings confirm and extend the previous report, but do not test the functional significance of Sh1/germ cell association. Additionally, through the analysis of coexpressing CED-1::GFP and mKate::INX-8, this work revealed that two Sh1 cells may have drastically different levels of CED-1::GFP expression, while maintaining relatively similar mKate::INX-8 levels. The distinct regulation of transgene expression and asymmetric architecture of Sh1 cells around the germ cells have not been appreciated before, but the functional significance of these findings is unclear. The authors argue that overexpression of CED-1::GFP is detrimental as it is associated with gonad morphology defects, and further propose that high levels of CED-1::GFP expression in distal Sh1 are not well-tolerated.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript presents findings that confirm the previously published model; however, several discrepancies between this manuscript and Tolkin et al. preprint are concerning:</p><p>1) bcIs39 CED-1::GFP transgene was reported to perfectly overlap with mKate::INX-8 in &gt;85% of cases by Tolkin et al., but only in 60% of cases in the current work.</p><p>2) The reported brood size and embryonic lethality for several identical or equivalent strains are vastly different. Specifically, NK2571 inx-8(qy78) brood size is 220 vs 155 with embryonic lethality of 8% vs 58% and DG505 embryonic lethality is 20% vs 1%. The causes for these differences need to be identified (culture conditions? temperature? formulation of culture plates?); otherwise these problems will persist/emerge for any other research group using these markers leading to issues with result reproducibility. In contrast to the assertion in Line 243, Tolkin et al. have assessed qy78 allele for brood size and embryonic lethality by itself after an outcross or in the NK2571 strain containing cpIs122 transgene, not in combination with bcIs39. Therefore, one cannot argue that brood size and embryonic lethality defects originated from the genetic interaction of qy78 and bcIs39.</p><p>Additionally, a detailed analysis of CED-1::GFP marker of Sh1 in Figure 4 revealed that ~50% of morphologically-normal gonads display an interface between DTC and Sh1, while remaining morphologically-normal gonads show a gap between these cells. This provides an opportunity to test the assertion of the model put forth by Gordon et al. 2020 and challenged by Tolkin et al. preprint – that the distal boundary of Sh1 cells impacts germ cell switch from proliferation to differentiation. According to Gordon et al., 2020 model, the proximal displacement of Sh1 in 50% of gonads expressing CED-1::GFP is expected to shift the position of meiotic entry away from the distal end resulting in a larger distal mitotic region in these germlines. By contrast, data in Figure 5 shows a shorter mitotic region in both strains expressing CED-1::GFP, consistent with Tolkin et al's conclusion that Sh1 position does not affect meiotic entry. Therefore, it appears that while the normal position of Sh1 distal boundary is closer to DTC than previously appreciated, its displacement is unlikely to affect the underlying germ cell population.</p><p>Other suggested revisions:</p><p>1. Line 180: the conclusion that bcIs39 &quot;sensitizes worms for gonad morphology defects&quot; is unwarranted as disruption of DTC migration appears similar in both described genetic backgrounds. It appears that bcIs39 directly disrupts DTC migration.</p><p>2. Line 196: remove &quot;of&quot;.</p><p>3. Line 209: using CRISPR/Cas9 *to* introduce… (add &quot;to&quot;).</p><p>4. Figure 1 and legend: include the allele designations of edited inx-8 and inx-9 for consistency with other figures.</p><p>5. Figure 1D: The position of Sh1 distal boundary in the right column (restrictive temperature) is hard to judge; the dashed line indicates a distal projection in the middle that is not apparent by diffuse GFP signal.</p><p>6. line 546, 557, 564 and Figure 1E: I don't think &quot;gc transition&quot; is an accepted term in the field. Perhaps replace with &quot;mitotic cell population boundary&quot;?</p><p>7. line 571: the legend indicates strain ID only for DG5020; is this necessary?

We have expanded the description of what these temperature sensitive alleles have been used for in the past, how our results agree with these prior findings, and furthermore how our result reveal the position of the sheath relative to the stem-like population of germ cells. Pages 1-3 have a rewritten section describing these experiments.</p><p>This assay is not demonstrating that Sh1 influences the germ cells. Instead, the original experiments helped to identify a feature of the germline—its division into a distal, stem like population and a more proximal, mitotically proliferating population that is fated to differentiate though has not yet entered the meiotic cell cycle. We find that the distal position of Sh1 falls at the same proximodistal position as the boundary between stem and non-stem germ cells, and it is the cells beneath Sh1 that differentiate first when progress through the cell cycle is halted or the germ cell receptor of the stemness cue is deactivated. This evidence independently supports the conclusion we drew from the experiments reported in Gordon et al., 2020, Figure 5.</p><p>While we are eager to share the results of an experiment that builds of off foundational work in the field to confirm our 2020 findings, we did these experiments independently of and prior to our engagement with the Tolkin et al. group, and they are not meant to address that study directly.

The lim-7p::CED-1::GFP transgene is typically used to visualize the engulfment of apoptotic germ cells near the bend of the gonad; this region of the germline undergoes physiological apoptosis, in which dying germ cells give cytoplasm to their sisters to inflate oocytes. The CED-1::GFP signal on the sheath membrane forms concentrated bubbles around germ cells being engulfed. We observe such “bubbles” of GFP in some samples of DG5131 (2/18 in the relevant dataset) that are located abnormally distal in the gonad (2 projections of the same gonad from Figure 4E). There are so many abnormal Sh1 membrane protrusions that we agree with the reviewer that the full projection is difficult to understand. This isn’t a phenotype we want to characterize, but it provides further evidence that this strain has abnormal gonad biology.</p><p>We have updated the projection shown in in Figure 4E and labeled the engulfed germ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5: this is a critical figure to prove that Tolkin et al. might have used a combination of transgenic alleles that together causes germ cell defects.

The most relevant figure from Tolkin et al. to the results shown in our Figure 5 is the experiment in Tolkin Figure 4, in which fixed, dissected gonads of various genotypes were antibody stained for the CYE-1(+) progenitor pool and anti-GFP against the lim-7p::ced-1::GFP transgenic protein that they use to label the sheath. The CYE-1(+) technique (from Mohammad et al., 2018) reveals a proximal boundary of CYE-1(+) cells that falls a bit distal to the crescent shaped nuclei of the “Transition Zone”. Therefore, while we don’t expect the PZ measurements in each dataset to be an exact match (ours should be longer), we do expect the magnitude and direction of difference between strains to be concordant<italic>.</italic></p><p>We can use Mohammed et al.

This agrees with the observations of Mohammed et al. (2018). Next, wild-type N2 have the longest proliferative zone, with DG5020 having a somewhat shorter proliferative zone, and DG5131 having a profoundly shorter proliferative zone. In our analysis, we find that NK2571(<italic>qy78;cpIs122</italic>) has a proliferative zone that is statistically indistinguishable from wild type (Tolkin did not analyze either fully wild-type or NK2571 in this experiment). Importantly, the results shown in Tolkin Figure 4 and its supplement show that DG5020 has an abnormal distal gonad compared to previously published wild-type measurements, which is consistent with our findings.</p><p>We have now updated our Results section in Line 281-323 to clarify this comparison. We also have increased the N for all strains analyzed (see Figure 5 legend).</p><p>To address the issue that we report only lengths of the proliferative zone using DAPI staining, in this revision, we add two additional measurements: incidence of germ cell division and total gonad length (Figure 5B and 5E). Overall, these tell a consistent story: in the NK2571 strain for which we observe a far distal Sh1 cell boundary, the germline is statistically indistinguishable from wild type<italic>.</italic> On the other hand, the “markers only” DG5020 strain preferred by Tolkin et al. is slightly diminished in all measures. Finally and crucially, the combination of alleles in the DG5131 strain that Tolkin uses to assess the function of the <italic>qy78</italic> allele in nearly all experiments is dramatically impaired both for the size of the proliferative zone, the number of actively dividing germ cells observed, and the length of the gonad. We believe this is strong evidence to refute the idea that <italic>qy78</italic> is a “poison” allele on its own; instead, there is a synthetic interaction with the markers used by Tolkin et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The Li et al. paper is essentially a response to recently submitted manuscript, Tolkin et al. 2021 and a follow-up on the senior author's prior work characterizing the relationship between Sh1, the DTC, and germ cell proliferation.

To clarify, these are not promoter::GFP transgenes in Figure 2A-D, these are CRISPR/Cas9-mediated fusions between endogenous protein coding genes and fluorescent protein coding genes. In addition to the <italic>inx-8</italic> and <italic>inx-9</italic> tags, we also observe distal Sh1 expression in CRISPR-tagged <italic>ina-1</italic> and <italic>cam-1</italic> strains. These latter two genes are not innexin genes (one encodes an integrin subunit, the other a Wnt receptor complex member). These proteins localize to the cell membrane.</p><p>The fluorescence in Figure 2A-D is dimmer and more punctate because these are tagged worm proteins expressed by their two genomic copies from endogenous promoters, localizing to the cell membranes in particular ways. This makes them less variable and less prone to silencing than overexpressed transgenes. However (related to the prior point about <italic>qy78</italic>), these tags also may potentially affect the function of the tagged proteins themselves. We consider this risk, and ways to address it, in the Discussion section (lines 381-416). We do not see a way in which tagging integrin or a Wnt receptor could affect innexin hemichannel function in the same way, however, so the distal Sh1 boundary is not only seen in strains with abnormal innexin proteins, as Tolkin et al. propose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the major areas of conflict between this paper and Tolkin et al. is whether the inx-8 tagged strains has brood size defects: this paper and prior work say no; the Tolkin paper says yes. Are there differences in the growth media or temperatures used in the different labs? This should be resolved between the labs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this crucial question must be resolved, and it was our priority in revising the manuscript (see first section of this letter). The Tolkin paper has now dropped the brood size defect and embryonic lethality claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is some concern that a subset of the markers are extracellular vs intracellular and the extracellular markers could be cleaved – an issue that is dismissed.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on 3D models of another innexin (Oshima et al., 2016), we suspect our N-terminal tags on mKate::INX-8 and GFP::INX-9 are extracellular. We do not address (or explicitly dismiss) potential N-terminal cleavage in this manuscript, but we also don’t suspect it for several reasons. First, the mKate::INX-8 fluorescence is punctate, suggesting that anchoring of some kind rather than free diffusion within the gonad governs its localization. Second, where mKate::INX-8 is coexpressed with a DTC or sheath membrane marker (lag-2p::mNG::PH or lim-7p::CED-1::GFP), we see mKate colocalization at the cell membrane, not diffusion away from the GFP signal. Finally, we see considerable localization of the mKate::INX-8 signal within oocytes and embryos (Gordon et al., 2020, Figure S1), which Starich et al. 2014 report in their antibody staining experiments (that paper explains that the INX-8 protein is internalized from the sheath-germ cell interface, not produced by the embryos or germ cells). While this question of protein processing is interesting, we worry it would be a distraction to include this discussion in the manuscript. Our extracellular, membrane-tethered fluorescent protein tags might circumvent a problem with visualizing the Sh1 cell, which is that its thin, flat shape leaves relatively little room for cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins to accumulate to visible levels, hence the “honeycomb” appearance of cytoplasmic GFP in that cell.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, Tolkin et al. add a CRISPR tagged FASN-1::GFP as well, a GFP fusion to an endogenous locus encoding fatty acid synthase (presumably with cytoplasmic localization). They have also added an extrachromosomal array transgene expressing a fusion of ACY-4::GFP, which is predicted to be localized to the membrane, and which has the most “Class 2” gonads with a DTC-Sh1 interface of any of their markers (Figure 1—Figure supplement 1). The same caveats about variability of extrachromosomal arrays apply to this strain; absence of expression should not be construed as absence of a cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For all figures, the transgenes/tagged proteins used and specific strains must be listed in the figure and legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.

The Tolkin paper also used Plim-7::GFP without CED-1. Please modify this statement and clarify how you think that marker would be incorrectly analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the need to correct “all” to “most” (line 396). Tolkin et al. do indeed use <italic>lim-7</italic> promoter-driven cytoplasmic GFP strains in Figure 1—Figure Supplement 1 (where the <italic>lim-7p::GFP</italic> is coexpressed with a DTC marker in otherwise wild-type and <italic>inx-14(ag17</italic>) backgrounds) and Figure 2—Figure Supplement 2 (where it is coexpressed with a DTC marker and <italic>inx-8(qy78)</italic>).</p><p>Our results for <italic>lim-7::GFP</italic> in Li Figure 2F do not agree with the results shown in Tolkin Figure 1—Figure Supplement 1; we find a mean distance of Sh1 from the distal end of 40.63 microns (N=20), Tolkin et al. show a mean of ~80 microns. Of note: this distal Sh1 position is dramatically different from what Tolkin et al. report for the <italic>bcIs39[lim-7p::ced-1::gfp]</italic> sheath marker strain (~50 microns, same figure). The internal inconsistency between these two markers is not discussed in that study.</p><p>We cannot comment further on this discrepancy except to say we measured sheath position in a different strain, strain DG1575 from the CGC (ordered 06-15-2020) which carries the <italic>tnIs6</italic> allele and was used to visualize the sheath in Hall et al., 1999. As for how it could be analyzed incorrectly, we suspect the same issue of variable/low levels of GFP expression from the <italic>lim-7</italic> promoter in the distal sheath could be at work in this case as well as for the <italic>lim-7::ced-1::GFP</italic> allele which we discuss at length.</p><p>We also analyzed this <italic>tnIs6</italic> allele in Gordon et al., 2020 (Figure 1—Figure Supplement 1C) in the presence of the <italic>inx-8(qy78)</italic> allele, and in that case find results that almost precisely agree with Tolkin’s conclusion in Figure 2—Figure Supplement 2. The two markers largely overlap (in our hands, 11/12 and 24/28 gonads in two separate replicates), and when they don’t, the mKate::INX-8 expression is farther distal than the GFP signal, due to apparent loss of GFP in the distal-most Sh1 cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is very difficult to interpret the images in Figure 1 and 2: in some cases the DTC has long projection, in others it does not; in some images the germ lines are fat (Figure 1A,B) or bent and deformed (Figure 2A,C). IN figure 2F, it is unclear why this is DIC +GFP since the full GFP signal may not be apparent with the DIC and why are there lots of eggs around. Overall, an improvement in the imaging would better help the reader understand the data and compare across figures/genotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions to improve these figures. Asterisks have been added to the distal end of all gonads in every figure.</p><p>In Figure 1, we are not visualizing dedicated DTC markers. Fluorescence from the <italic>cpIs122 lag-2p::mNG::PH</italic> is quenched by methanol fixation for DAPI staining in Figure 1B (hence no DTC outline indicated), while the <italic>inx-9(qy79)</italic> allele has robust but punctate GFP::INX-9 localization on both Sh1 and DTC (outlined in white, Figure 1D). Additionally, we have now further highlighted that the experiments in Figure 1 depict older animals than the other figures, based on the timing used in the experiments we are replicating. The <italic>emb-30</italic> allele certainly causes gonads to look fat at the restrictive temperature; in this strain, germ cells stop moving proximally.</p><p>In Figure 2D and 2F, we feel it is important to show the DIC channel so the distal tip of the gonad is pictured. We have taken care not to wash out any GFP signal in the merged image. Eggs are sometimes visible, as the uterus lies immediately ventral to the distal tip of the gonad, and we are looking at reproductive adults in their first day of egg laying. Slight bends at the distal end of gonads are not deformities, but artifacts of coverslipping; the gonad tip is free in the body and when compressed, settles around gut or eggs nearby.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The description of the emb-30 and glp-1 alleles is confusing. It is not clear why these alleles would be a test of their hypothesis. Also of concern is that the shift of these alleles is done is L4/adulthood after the Sh1 cells is differentiated? Are they arguing that the Sh1 does not change in morphology in response to the shift in the germ cell state?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that our results show that the position of Sh1 does not change in these temperature sensitive mutants, and that its distal position does not differ from the position of the germ cell population that differentiates first after temperature shift. We have improved our explanation of these experiments thanks to this helpful feedback and the similar suggestions of Reviewer 1 (above). Specifically, we have explained that we are using the germ cell perturbations of the ts alleles to reveal distal (stem-like) and proximal (still mitotic, but more genetically differentiated) germ cell populations, in relation to the position of the Sh1 cells. In both experiments, we find that the pool of germ cells that differentiates first at the restrictive temperature is the pool that lies under the Sh1 cells. This confirms that these cells have left the niche.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2A-C, an asterick should be used to mark the DTC.</p><p>In text it would be helpful to better describe what Figure 1 is showing, What do you mean by &quot;pink arrow marking gc transition&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The “transition zone” of the germline is the position where the nuclei take on the characteristic crescent shape of leptotene/zygotene of meiosis I. While some of the small, circular nuclei distal to this position are in S phase of meiosis I, the vast majority are mitotic germ cells, so the gonad distal to the transition zone is referred to as the proliferative zone. However, in the temperature-shifted experiments, it seemed wrong to call this the “proliferative zone” because the cells have ceased to proliferate. However, the difference in nuclear morphology can still be observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The actual distance here is irrelevant if the germ lines are different sizes. A better measure is the number of nuclear widths.</p></disp-quote><p>The results from the <italic>emb-30</italic> experiment are difficult to analyze in terms of germ cell diameters, because the germ cell nuclei are malformed due the failure of metaphase-anaphase transition. However, we added this measurement for one of the replicates (shown in Figure 1—Figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the methods, it is stated that, 16{degree sign}C experiments are cultured longer (for emb-30), but what is the evidence to support the choice of a 3 hour difference? Why is a similar criterion not use for the glp-1(ts)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the need to better explain these experiments, which Reviewer 1 also noted (see above). These experiments were inspired by key prior work that provides evidence for a distal pool of stem-like germ cells; in this paper we repeat these experiments in the presence of our fluorescent DTC and sheath markers to observe the positions of the soma and stem-like germ cell pool. These genetic loss of function experiments provide corroborating evidence that the germ cells that lie under the Sh1 cells are further along the path to differentiation than the distalmost stem-like cells. Our 2020 study used fluorescent markers related to germ cell fate to first test this hypothesis.</p><p>The original <italic>emb-30(ts)</italic> experiment by Cinquin et al. (2010) imaged a starting point control but had no aged control that was kept at the permissive temperature while the experimental group was shifted to the restrictive temperature for 15 h. This seemed like a nonideal control to us since the gonad and germline change over time, so the initial 18 hour control was chosen for experimenter convenience; the experimental group was fixed, stained, and imaged at 15 hours with the control continuing to run in the meantime. We have since repeated the experiment with a starting point control only (as in the original study), and we see the same result that we obtained with the 18 hour control, as well as a 21 hour control we recently performed (Figure 1—Figure supplement 1). This suggests that by 36 hours post mid-L4, the relationship between the stem cell zone and Sh1 cell are fixed.</p><p>On the other hand, the original <italic>glp-1(bn18)</italic> experiments of Fox and Schedl (2015) included controls that were exactly matched for time, so our use of this allele similarly uses a control kept at the permissive temperature for the same amount of time that the experimental group is observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>DAPI staining in the methods: &quot;DAPI staining was done according to standard protocols&quot;.

DAPI was reconstituted in distilled water per the MSDS, but you are correct that the working solution was made in 0.01% Tween in PBS. The lower end of suggested working concentrations given on the MSDS is 1 ug/ml. We noted that this is higher than the Nayack Lab protocol suggests, but we get clean staining, even if we waste some dye. Since we cut our methanol fixation short to preserve mKate::INX-8 fluorescence, we probably have lower tissue penetration to compensate for.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the desire to be concise is appreciate, in the methods or an accompanying table, the full description of the strains must be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, a Key Resources Table has now been composed.

We did however delete references to details of strain maintenance in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In table 1, subscript &quot;b&quot; says: &quot;N2 numbers come from multiple trials, not all of which counted negligible numbers of dead embryos, including the trial in which ina-1(qy23) and cam-1(cp243) were counted&quot;. Does this mean that in a subset of the trials, there was embryonic lethality in the N2 strain? How is the accounted for? Why is it not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not typically quantified embryonic lethality when performing brood size assays, and we always include an N2 wild-type control population. In this case, we ran one brood size assay for strains LP520 and NK2324 with a wild-type N2 control and did not score embryonic lethality. Later, when we received the Tolkin strains, we ran a brood size assay for DG5020 and DG5131 along with our strains NK2571 and KLG019 and an N2 control, and we did score embryonic lethality because we saw that the other group had done so. So while we can pool the N2 brood size, we can’t report a total embryonic lethality for the same dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also related table 1, it is stated: &quot;our endogenously tagged inx-8(qy78) and inx-9(qy79) strains had dramatically different degrees of embryonic lethality, with qy79 producing over 150 unhatched eggs per worm.&quot; When I look at the table, the brood size for inx-9 is ~226 with 41% embryonic lethality. This would lead to on average ~85 unhatched eggs/worm not 150.

This work provides further support for the model where the distal border of Sh2 cell is forming an interface with DTC and Sh1 overlays the mitotic germ cells poised for differentiation. These findings confirm and extend the previous report, but do not test the functional significance of Sh1/germ cell association. Additionally, through the analysis of coexpressing CED-1::GFP and mKate::INX-8, this work revealed that two Sh1 cells may have drastically different levels of CED-1::GFP expression, while maintaining relatively similar mKate::INX-8 levels. The distinct regulation of transgene expression and asymmetric architecture of Sh1 cells around the germ cells have not been appreciated before, but the functional significance of these findings is unclear. The authors argue that overexpression of CED-1::GFP is detrimental as it is associated with gonad morphology defects, and further propose that high levels of CED-1::GFP expression in distal Sh1 are not well-tolerated.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript presents findings that confirm the previously published model; however, several discrepancies between this manuscript and Tolkin et al. preprint are concerning:</p><p>1) bcIs39 CED-1::GFP transgene was reported to perfectly overlap with mKate::INX-8 in &gt;85% of cases by Tolkin et al., but only in 60% of cases in the current work.</p></disp-quote><p>The “&gt;85%” figure from Tolkin et al., Figure 2 Supplement 2B is derived from 11/13 gonads where the two markers overlap. The image they select to illustrate an example of nonoverlapping expression indeed does show overlapping expression, however, they have just underexposed or underscaled the GFP signal in the distal portion of the sheath (see visible Sh1 features). This observation informed our approach, and instead of looking for cases of “non overlapping expression” we counted cases where two vastly different GFP expression intensities in the two Sh1 cells could lead to a similar inadvertent mis-scaling. We report discrepancies in the coexpressed markers in 6/15 cases in a dataset that was collected for this particular experiment (imaging through the full thickness of the gonad with long exposure times to see the entirety of both Sh1 cells). In other DG5131 datasets, we see discrepancies in expression levels between cells in 5/10 gonads (imaged by Singh on 10/8) and 7/16 gonads (imaged by Gordon, 10/5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reported brood size and embryonic lethality for several identical or equivalent strains are vastly different. Specifically, NK2571 inx-8(qy78) brood size is 220 vs 155 with embryonic lethality of 8% vs 58% and DG505 embryonic lethality is 20% vs 1%. The causes for these differences need to be identified (culture conditions? temperature? formulation of culture plates?); otherwise these problems will persist/emerge for any other research group using these markers leading to issues with result reproducibility. In contrast to the assertion in Line 243, Tolkin et al. have assessed qy78 allele for brood size and embryonic lethality by itself after an outcross or in the NK2571 strain containing cpIs122 transgene, not in combination with bcIs39. Therefore, one cannot argue that brood size and embryonic lethality defects originated from the genetic interaction of qy78 and bcIs39.</p></disp-quote><p>Tolkin et al. have now dropped those criticisms. However, because the Tolkin paper used “wild type” to refer to their strain carrying the bcIs39 marker and DTC marker, we were unsure about the precise genotypes they measured brood size for. Unfortunately, we did not have access to the strains that Tolkin et al. refer to as “qy78” in their table, which are described as a 1x and 2x outcross of our NK2571 strain to “wild-type males”. We recapitulated this experiment by outcrossing to wild-type N2 males, and again we see no dramatic embryonic lethality phenotype caused by the <italic>qy78</italic> allele (see first section of letter).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, a detailed analysis of CED-1::GFP marker of Sh1 in Figure 4 revealed that ~50% of morphologically-normal gonads display an interface between DTC and Sh1, while remaining morphologically-normal gonads show a gap between these cells. This provides an opportunity to test the assertion of the model put forth by Gordon et al. 2020 and challenged by Tolkin et al. preprint – that the distal boundary of Sh1 cells impacts germ cell switch from proliferation to differentiation. According to Gordon et al., 2020 model, the proximal displacement of Sh1 in 50% of gonads expressing CED-1::GFP is expected to shift the position of meiotic entry away from the distal end resulting in a larger distal mitotic region in these germlines. By contrast, data in Figure 5 shows a shorter mitotic region in both strains expressing CED-1::GFP, consistent with Tolkin et al's conclusion that Sh1 position does not affect meiotic entry. Therefore, it appears that while the normal position of Sh1 distal boundary is closer to DTC than previously appreciated, its displacement is unlikely to affect the underlying germ cell population.</p></disp-quote><p>In the past we had hoped we could use some of these transgene overexpression strains (specifically our <italic>lim-7p::gfp::caax</italic> transgenic) to perturb the sheath position, however we strongly suspect that these strains have a failure to label the distal Sh1 cell rather than a displacement of the distal Sh1 cell away from the distal end. We have no way to know for sure given these tools. After observing so many transgenic animals with the GFP patterns observed in Figure 2H and Figure 3B’—and especially 3D—I don’t feel confident concluding that the Sh1 cell is <italic>not</italic> there, based on absence of transgene fluorescence alone. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, as they say. We discuss this in the results, lines 153-174.</p><p>However, we did displace the sheath from the distal end by applying RNAi against genes that encode key regulators of branched actin dynamics (<italic>arx-2</italic> and <italic>unc-60</italic>, which encode an Arp2/3 subunit and cofilin, respectively), we don’t shift the proliferative zone as recognized by nuclear morphology, but do shift the region in which GLD-1::GFP accumulates in germ cells (Gordon et al., 2020, Figure 7). We know that Sh1 is not necessary for differentiation (Killian and Hubbard, 2005), but that Sh1-ablated animals are temporally delayed for meiotic entry.</p><p>We suspect that the shorter mitotic regions in DG5131 CED-1::GFP;mKate::INX-8 (and to a lesser extent in DG5020 CED-1::GFP) animals reflect impaired germ cell proliferation due to Sh1 abnormality. Recent work that is not affiliated with our group (Gopal et al., 2021) finds that loss of syndecan in <italic>sdn-1</italic> mutant alleles and caused by <italic>sdn-1</italic> RNAi applied across the late larval-young adult transition shortens the mitotic region of the adult germline and impairs germ cell proliferation; the mutants are rescued by sheath specific expression of <italic>sdn-1</italic> (neither DTC nor germ cell expression rescues). Gopal et al. go on to demonstrate that the syndecan phenotype is a <italic>glp-1</italic>-mediated effect, implicating signaling from Sh1 on the Notch-dependent mitotic germline. This link is easily explained by the morphological overlap of Sh1 and the mitotic germline that Gordon et al. (2020) and Li et al. (under review) describe, and it is harder to explain if Sh1 does not contact the mitotic germline in adults, as Tolkin et al. claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other suggested revisions:</p><p>1.
