(operons) to co-translate proteins involved in the same biological processes. Whether eukaryotes achieve similar regulation by selectively assembling and translating monocistronic messages derived from different chromosomes is unknown. We employed transcript-specific RNA pulldowns and RNA-seq/RT-PCR to identify yeast mRNAs that co-precipitate as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Consistent with the hypothesis of eukaryotic RNA operons, mRNAs encoding components of the mating pathway, heat shock proteins, and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins multiplex in trans, forming discrete messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes (called <italic>transperons</italic>). Chromatin capture and allele tagging experiments reveal that genes encoding multiplexed mRNAs physically interact; thus, RNA assembly may result from co-regulated gene expression. Transperon assembly and function depends upon histone H4, and its depletion leads to defects in RNA multiplexing, decreased pheromone responsiveness and mating, and increased heat shock sensitivity. We propose that intergenic associations and non-canonical histone H4 functions contribute to transperon formation in eukaryotic cells and regulate cell physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>histone H4</kwd><kwd>yeast mating pathway</kwd><kwd>heat shock proteins</kwd><kwd>operon</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1190-96.13/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001658</institution-id><institution>Minerva Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>711130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001735</institution-id><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHGRI U54HG00306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusbaum</surname><given-names>Chad</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007246</institution-id><institution>Council of Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelin-Licht</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>578/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerst</surname><given-names>Jeffrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prokaryotes use polycistronic messages for coordinated translation, whereas eukaryotic cells may achieve tunable protein synthesis by packaging monocistronic mRNAs into functional multiplexes via co-transcriptional interallelic coupling and non-canonical histone-H4 functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prokaryotic organisms can rely on polycistronic transcription (operons), which allows for the expression of needed mRNAs from a single promoter and enables a rapid and robust response to corresponding stimuli (e.g., lactose operon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacob and Monod, 1961</xref>). However, this mode of action has not been reported in eukaryotes, except for a few limited examples (e.g., in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<italic>C. elegans</italic>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spieth et al., 1993</xref>), and eukaryotic operons have been observed to give rise to dicistronic messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blumenthal, 2004</xref>). However, it is intriguing to postulate whether eukaryotes have devised functional alternatives to operons. One possibility is that eukaryotic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles, which are composed of multiple RNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitchell and Parker, 2014</xref>), effectively confer combinatorial gene expression networks similar to prokaryotic operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keene and Tenenbaum, 2002</xref>). In this case, however, the mRNP particles contain individual mRNAs that undergo co-translational control and may encode proteins involved in the same biological process or molecular complex. The idea that mRNPs might essentially constitute RNA operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keene, 2007</xref>) or <italic>transperons</italic>, as termed here, implies several features. First, although mRNAs derived from different chromosomes can reside in the same mRNP, they should have common regulatory elements not only for transcriptional and translational control, but also for interacting at the post-transcriptional level with other mRNAs within the particle. The latter includes motifs/structures to facilitate interactions with shared RBPs, as well as elements that might facilitate RNA-RNA interactions (e.g., base-pairing). Second, some mechanism must confer the recruitment and assembly, in trans (i.e., multiplexing), of the individual mRNAs into single mRNP particles. Third, in order to be functionally relevant, transperons should contain mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the same functional context (e.g., organelle biogenesis, macromolecular complex, or biological process). Although the mechanism remains unknown, studies have shown that genomic DNA folds create sites of transcriptional hot spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2014</xref>) that could facilitate multiplexing by co-localizing messages during transcription and coordinating the subsquent association of RBPs. Moreover, RNA-RNA interactome studies show that extensive interactions can occur directly between RNAs in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aw et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engreitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kudla et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the multiplexing of mRNAs into mRNPs to yield transperons should be directly testable.</p><p>Although individual yeast RBPs have been shown to bind to numerous (e.g., 10s-1000s) mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hogan et al., 2008</xref>), these RNA-binding studies are based primarily upon crosslinking and RBP pulldowns that are unable to define the minimal number of mRNA species in a single mRNP particle. To test the idea of RNA multiplexing and define the composition of such particles, we employed a single mRNA species pulldown procedure (RaPID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slobodin and Gerst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slobodin and Gerst, 2011</xref>). This method employs MS2 aptamer tagging of endogenously expressed messages in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haim et al., 2007</xref>) and their precipitation from cell lysates via the MS2 coat protein (MCP) to identify bound non-tagged transcripts using RNA-seq (RaPID-seq). We have previously demonstrated that RaPID-seq identifies MS2-tagged target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref>) and now show here that additional messages associate with these transcripts.</p><p>By employing <italic>MAT</italic>α yeast in RaPID-seq pulldown experiments, we found that select MS2-labeled target mRNAs (e.g., <italic>SRO7, EXO70, OM45</italic>) co-precipitated untagged mRNAs encoding secreted proteins involved in cell mating (e.g., <italic>STE3</italic>, <italic>SAG1, MFα1, MFα2</italic>). Since a corresponding complex (e.g., <italic>STE2, AGA1, AGA2, MFA1, MFA2</italic>) could also be precipitated from <italic>MAT</italic>a cells, it suggested to us that mRNAs encoding secreted proteins involved in mating (e.g., pheromones, pheromone receptors, agglutinins, and proteases) multiplex into a functionally selective mRNP complex <bold>–</bold> the mating transperon. To identify potential factors involved in mating transperon assembly, we employed pulldowns of these mRNAs followed by mass spectrometry (RaPID-MS). We found that the yeast histone H4 paralogs, Hhf1 and Hhf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dollard et al., 1994</xref>), interact with these mRNAs to regulate complex assembly. Furthermore, both pheromone responsiveness (e.g., shmooing) and mating were inhibited by either histone H4 depletion or a block in H4 acetylation. When mutated, no other histones had this effect. Moreover, we could identify conserved <italic>cis</italic> elements in the mating mRNAs and demonstrate that mutations therein had deleterious effects on mRNA multiplexing, pheromone responsiveness, and mating, which were similar to those seen upon histone H4 mutation.</p><p>To help elucidate the mechanism by which mRNA multiplexing might occur, we performed chromatin conformation capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>), as well as genomic locus tagging experiments, to look for evidence of direct allelic interactions. Importantly, a specific interaction between the <italic>STE2</italic> and <italic>AGA2</italic> genes was identified in <italic>MAT</italic>a cells, which suggests that interallelic coupling may give rise to RNA multiplexing. Furthermore, coupling appeared to occur in both a transcription- and histone H4-dependent manner. To help validate this hypothesis, we examined whether mRNAs encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), whose genes were previously shown to undergo intergenic interactions during heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>), also undergo multiplexing. Importantly, HSP mRNAs were found to multiplex in trans during heat shock to form RNP complexes, and histone H4 was required for both RNA multiplexing and robust post-heat shock cell recovery. Parallel studies revealed the existence of additional RNA multiplexes for mitochondrial outer membrane proteins and MAP kinase pathway proteins in yeast. Together, these results suggest that histone H4-mediated chromatin interactions may lead to the formation of functionally selective transperons in eukaryotic cells and possibly act as a means to co-regulate gene expression in place of polycistronicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mRNAs encoding yeast mating pathway components co-precipitate in mRNPs</title><p>We developed the RaPID procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slobodin and Gerst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slobodin and Gerst, 2011</xref>) to identify RBPs and mRNAs that bind to specific RNAs of interest. Unlike CLIP or PAR-CLIP, which collects information on all RBP-RNA interactions in the cell and is biased toward highly expressed mRNAs with long poly-A tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>), RaPID allows for a biochemical view of the protein and RNA constituents of mRNPs at the single transcript level. RaPID employs the precipitation of MS2 aptamer-tagged messages using the MCP fused to streptavidin-binding peptide, followed by elution from immobilized streptavidin with free biotin, and then mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slobodin and Gerst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slobodin and Gerst, 2011</xref>) or RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref>) to identify bound proteins and RNAs, respectively. In order to address issues regarding whether the MS2 system might affect the stability of MS2 aptamer-tagged messages, we performed RaPID and RNA-seq (RaPID-Seq) on 11 endogenously expressed MS2 aptamer-tagged messages in <italic>MAT</italic>α yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref>). These included representative transcripts having a wide range of intracellular patterns of localization (e.g., mitochondria: <italic>OXA1</italic> and <italic>OM45</italic>; cortical endoplasmic reticulum [cER]/asymmetrically localized mRNAs: <italic>ABP1, SRO7, EXO70, ASH1, MYO2,</italic> and <italic>MYO4</italic>; peripheral nuclear endoplasmic reticulum [nER]: <italic>ATG8</italic>; and peroxisomes: <italic>PEX14</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gadir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zipor et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to identifying the target mRNA in each pulldown, we identified non-tagged RNAs that co-precipitated with the targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for RNA-seq data). These included retrotransposable elements (e.g., Ty elements), tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, telomere and small nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, five mRNAs encoding secreted and membrane proteins (mSMPs) of the mating process were found associated with a subset of target RNAs. These target transcripts consisted of two cER-localized mRNAs that encode polarity factors (mPOLs; <italic>SRO7</italic> and <italic>EXO70</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronov et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>OM45,</italic> an mRNA that encodes a mitochondrial outer membrane protein (MOMP), which we have shown to localize to both mitochondria and ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gadir et al., 2011</xref>).

Perhaps due to the greater complexity observed both at the gene and cellular levels, eukaryotes have preferentially relied on the discontiguous distribution of genes over different chromosomes. In this case, the co-regulation of gene expression presumably becomes dependent on shared transcriptional control elements and specific RBPs that interact selectively with certain transcripts and confer trafficking to sites of co-translation. However, given that the number of RBPs is limited and that they can interact with a wide number of potential transcripts, it is unclear if and how defined subsets of mRNAs are packaged together in order to facilitate co-translation.</p><p>We hypothesized that mRNAs encoding proteins involved in the same process might assemble into macromolecular complexes composed of multiplexed transcripts and specific RBPs to form discrete RNP complexes. By performing mRNA pulldown and RNA-seq experiments, we first identified a subset of mRNAs that encode secreted components involved in the mating of α-haploid cells. This mRNP complex included mRNAs encoding the a-pheromone receptor (<italic>STE3</italic>), α-mating factor (<italic>MFα1</italic>, <italic>MFα2</italic>), α-agglutinin (<italic>SAG1</italic>), and a-pheromone blocker (<italic>AFB1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Correspondingly, we identified a mating mRNP complex from <italic>MAT</italic>a cells that included mRNAs encoding the α-mating factor receptor (<italic>STE2</italic>), a-mating pheromone (<italic>MFA1, MFA2</italic>), and a-agglutinins (<italic>AGA1, AGA2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, we demonstrated that mRNAs coding for proteins of the same cellular process multiplex into mRNP complexes, presumably to allow for their delivery to the same intracellular site for local translation. Additional experiments in which we identified the existence of other mRNA subsets that multiplex, like those encoding HSPs, MOMPs, and MAPK pathway proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), clearly support this idea. Thus, mRNA multiplexing in trans appears to form functional transperons (i.e., RNA operons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keene, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keene and Tenenbaum, 2002</xref>]) relevant to cell physiology (see below). While we do not know the full extent of RNA multiplexing, we might predict that analogous transperons (i.e., containing other transcripts) form within cells to modulate other physical processes. For example, recent works by Ashe and colleagues have shown that mRNAs encoding either translation factors or glycolytic enzymes co-localize and undergo co-translation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morales-Polanco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pizzinga et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, mRNAs encoding proteins in hetero-oligomeric/multisubunit complexes (proteasome, exocyst, COPI, FAS, ribosome, etc.) might form multiplexes to facilitate polypeptide complex assembly upon co-translation, as shown at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shiber et al., 2018</xref>), even if dedicated assembly chaperones are needed. In our study, we may have missed multiplexes in the initial RaPID-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) for several reasons. First, RNA multiplexing may require elevated gene expression, as in the case of the HSP or MOMP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A–C</xref>), which require induction conditions to visualize the RNA granules, as opposed to the normal growth conditions employed initially. Second, the RaPID-seq pulldowns employed only 0.01% formaldehyde in the crosslinking procedure, as initially published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slobodin and Gerst, 2010</xref>), and not the 0.1–0.5% formaldehyde we have employed in the later work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zabezhinsky et al., 2016</xref>). Third, the precipitated complexes were stringently washed and, thus, these different factors may have disrupted weaker transperons or missed them entirely.</p><p>Importantly, by using a variety of molecular and single-cell imaging techniques (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; live fluorescence imaging) we show specific and robust physical interactions between genes located on different chromosomes that encode mRNAs that form transperons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This observation of allelic coupling is strengthened by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>, where the intergenic association of yeast HSP genes was shown. Other chromatin conformation capture studies have revealed intergenic associations that lead to the so-called transcription factories associated with different transcriptional regulators (e.g., promoters, transcription factors). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schoenfelder et al., 2010</xref> showed interchromosomal interactions between Klf4-regulated globin genes in fetal liver cells that allowed for co-regulated gene transcription. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Papantonis et al., 2012</xref> revealed that TNF-α responsive coding and miRNA genes in human endothelial cells undergo intrachromosomal interactions regulated by NFκB upon cytokine induction. Thus, specialized transcriptional factories created through allelic coupling may be a common mechanism for co-regulated gene expression in eukaryotes.</p><p>How allelic coupling comes about to form these factories and resulting transperons is not yet clear. However, we identified a role for histone H4 in the assembly of the mating transperon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C, D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and its physiological consequences (i.e., pheromone responsiveness of both mating partners and mating; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). RaPID-MS pulldowns of mating mRNAs encoding secreted proteins identified the H4 paralog, Hhf1, as binding to the <italic>STE2</italic>, <italic>MFA1</italic>, and <italic>MFA2</italic> mRNAs, but not to <italic>ASH1</italic> mRNA or <italic>STE2</italic> mRNA lacking its 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, specific H4-RNA interactions are likely to be involved in transperon assembly. Hhf1 pulldowns directly precipitated the mating transperon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref>) and the deletion of either paralog (<italic>HHF1</italic> or <italic>HHF2</italic>) led to defects in RNA multiplexing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>) and mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Likewise, a combination of <italic>HHF2</italic> deletion and an auxin-induced degradative form of Hhf1 resulted in a complete block in mating and loss of mRNA co-localization under conditions in which cell viability was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and E</xref>). Similar results were obtained using the HSP mRNAs, which also form physiologically functional transperons and co-localize in a manner dependent upon histone H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that both Hhf1 and Hhf2 are important for the formation of the mRNA complexes identified here.</p><p>Mutations in the amino terminal histone H4 acetylation sites had similar effects as gene deletions, whereby inactivating K-to-R mutations inhibited mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). In contrast, K-to-Q mutations (or H4 overexpression) improved mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, histone H4 paralogs, but no other histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>), appear to affect the transmission of physiological signals relevant to RNA multiplexing. More work is required to demonstrate the role histone H4 plays in transperon formation and whether H4 is present in these multiplexes post-assembly and export from the nucleus. Although we found that fluorescent protein-tagged Hhf1 labeled the nucleus, we were unable to observe H4 in the cytoplasm or show co-localization there with <italic>STE2</italic> mRNA (data not shown). Thus, we do not know whether this non-canonical interaction of H4 with mRNA is exclusive to the nucleus or not. Canonical histone functions relate mainly to DNA-protein interactions that facilitate nucleosome formation. However, the requirement of acetylation for H4 function in mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>) suggests that histone H4 might participate in the formation of a DNA-RNA intermediate upon gene transcription. This mechanism potentially allows for RNA multiplexing, provided that the loci encoding mRNAs intended for assembly in trans also are in close apposition, as evidenced here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B and F</xref>). Results showing that a transcription inhibitor affects allelic coupling imply that gene apposition and transcription may be connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, the fact that H4 deletion also affects allelic coupling may implicate an involvement of chromatin architecture in transperon formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>Our lab is interested in how mRNA localization affects cell physiology, and a previous work has demonstrated that yeast mSMPs (including <italic>MFA2</italic>) localize to ER in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kraut-Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we verified that endogenously expressed <italic>STE2</italic> and <italic>AGA1</italic> mRNAs also localize to ER in the cell body, both before and after treatment with pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, these mRNAs co-localize both prior to and post nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). This finding demonstrates once again that mSMPs are not asymmetrically localized to the polarized extensions of yeast (e.g., bud and shmoo tips), unlike <italic>ASH1</italic> and polarity-establishing mRNAs (e.g., <italic>SRO7, SEC4, CDC42</italic>) in budding cells, which is mediated by She2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aronov et al., 2007</xref>), or <italic>SRO7</italic> and <italic>FUS3</italic> mRNAs in shmooing cells, which is mediated by Scp160 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gelin-Licht et al., 2012</xref>). It also demonstrates that RNA multiplexing and transperon formation occur within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>). Since this work and previous studies have revealed that mRNAs encoding secreted mating pathway components, MOMPs, and pheromone-activated MAPK pathway components localize to the ER, mitochondria, and ER of the shmoo tip, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gadir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gelin-Licht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zabezhinsky et al., 2016</xref>), we predict that these mRNAs are targeted as intact transperons. Moreover, as Scp160 binds MAPK pathway mRNAs (e.g., <italic>FUS3, STE7, KAR3</italic>) and delivers them to the shmoo tip upon pheromone treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gelin-Licht et al., 2012</xref>), we predict that Scp160 might traffick this MAPK transperon.</p><p>An earlier work has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aronov et al., 2015</xref>) suggested that mRNAs encoding mating components, like <italic>MFA2</italic>, localize preferentially to P-bodies in the shmoos and shmoo tips of pheromone-treated yeast, and that P-bodies are necessary for transmission of the mating signal and subsequent mating. However, these results were obtained under conditions of mRNA overexpression. In contrast, we found that neither endogenously expressed MS2-tagged <italic>MFA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref>) nor <italic>STE2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>) localize to P-bodies, nor do P-bodies form under normal growth conditions conducive to the expression of these mRNAs and to mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>; top panel). In addition, we show here that <italic>MFA2</italic> and other mating mRNAs (e.g. <italic>MFA1</italic>, <italic>STE2</italic>, and <italic>AGA1</italic>) do not localize to the shmoos or shmoo tips, but rather to ER present in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the deletion of genes necessary for P-body formation (e.g., <italic>PAT1, DHH1</italic>) had no significant effect upon mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As mating pathway mRNAs localize to P-bodies only upon stress conditions (e.g., gene overexpression, glucose starvation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), it would appear that P-bodies are not sites for mating mRNA localization or transmission of the mating signal under normal growth conditions. Our findings re-emphasize the importance of (i) measuring mRNA localization under native conditions of gene expression; (ii) considering the possibility that RNA overexpression and/or the insertion of RNA aptamers may induce artifacts (e.g., mRNA mislocalization, P-body formation, or both); and (iii) examining mRNA integrity/localization using additional techniques (e.g., Northern analysis, RNA-seq, smFISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia and Parker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haimovich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinrich et al., 2017</xref>) for secondary validation.</p><p>As <italic>cis-</italic>acting RNA elements may work in conjunction with specific RNA-binding proteins to confer multiplexing, we analyzed the coding regions and 3’UTRs of the mating mRNAs from the two yeast haplotypes. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of conserved motifs present in the mating mRNAs from either <italic>MAT</italic>a or <italic>MAT</italic>α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We mutated the <italic>MAT</italic>a sequence element in the <italic>AGA2</italic> gene and found that it affected transperon assembly similar to the deletion of <italic>AGA2</italic> (<italic>aga2Δ</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, this correlated with an inhibition in cellular responsiveness (i.e., shmooing) toward its mating partner, as well as the responsiveness of its mating partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), resulting in significant defects in mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, defects in transperon formation result in significant changes in cell physiology, and we predict that a yet unidentified RBP interacts with this element to facilitate RNA assembly and, possibly, trafficking. The <italic>MAT</italic>a element is unlikely to be the H4-interacting motif itself, since it was not identified among the mating mRNAs from <italic>MAT</italic>α cells, which have other shared motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Likewise, removal of the 3’UTR from <italic>STE2</italic> appeared to reduce H4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), possibly indicating its role in histone association. Additional RaPID-MS experiments should help reveal the identity of this protein, as well as those interacting with the motifs in mating mRNAs from <italic>MAT</italic>α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and genetic analyses should reveal their contribution to the mating process.</p><p>Finally, we note that in a few cases, transcripts from genes that neighbor the target gene were enriched in MS2-tagged target mRNA pulldowns in our RaPID-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for RNA-seq data), as compared to the bead control. For example, we observed that <italic>PET122</italic> (YER153C) mRNA precipitated with <italic>OXA1</italic> (YER154W); <italic>SPE1</italic> (YKL184W) with <italic>ASH1</italic> (YKL185W); <italic>SNC1</italic> (YAL030W) with <italic>MYO4</italic> (YAL029C); <italic>SNC2</italic> (YOR327C) with <italic>MYO2</italic> (YOR326W); and <italic>ALY2</italic> (YJL084C) with <italic>EXO70</italic> (YJL085W). It is possible that these genes are co-expressed and that their chromatin-associated RNA transcripts precipitate during RaPID, prior to DNase treatment. We did not examine these interactions further. Nonetheless, this possibility does not negate our hypothesis supporting the existence of RNA multiplexes/transperons, which was validated by a variety of means (e.g., RaPID-qRT-PCR, smFISH, and physiological assays).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the results presented here support the concept that eukaryotic mRNP complexes/transperons are the functional equivalents of bacterial operons, as first proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keene, 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keene and Tenenbaum, 2002</xref>. Thus, eukaryotes may circumvent polycistronicity by assembling relevant mRNAs into functional complexes that confer co-translation. This is likely to occur via physical intergenic interactions that couple individual alleles concurrent with transcription to form transperons that can undergo export and translation at different sites within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). A schematic describing mRNA assembly into functional transperons encoding secreted mating pathway components via histone H4 mediation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>. While this work implies that there are higher order principles governing the selection of mRNAs for mRNP complex assembly, further study is required to uncover the entire mechanism by which mRNAs are recruited and assembled together into multiplexes, and to elucidate how histones and other proteins link mRNAs to fully formed transperons.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Models for mRNP transperon formation and its role in the co-translation of proteins involved in cell physiology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustrating the mechanism of mRNA multiplexing and its role in cell physiology. Gene loci located on different chromosomes undergo allelic coupling under different growth conditions to form intergenic associations. Upon transcription, intergenic association allows for the mRNAs to assemble into a mRNA ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex (transperon) that is exported to the cytoplasm and confers mRNA co-localization at different organelles (mitochondria, ER, cytoplasm). RNA co-localization and co-translation allow for coordination of the pathways responsible for the control of cell physiology. (<bold>B</bold>) mRNA multiplexing and transperon formation control the mating pathway in yeast. Yeast (<italic>MAT</italic>a cells, as shown) express mRNAs encoding soluble secreted and membrane proteins (e.g., Mfa1, Mfa2, Aga1, Aga2, and Ste2, respectively) from genomic loci located on different chromosomes (as listed) that undergo allelic coupling to form intergenic associations. Histone H4 paralogs (Hhf1 and -2) are required for the mRNAs to assemble into a mating mRNA transperon that is exported to the cytoplasm and confers RNA co-localization at the endoplasmic reticulum peripheral to the nucleus (nER). Co-translational translocation of these proteins at the ER may coordinate the pathways responsible for the cellular responsiveness to pheromone of the opposite mating type (i.e., via both Ste2 signaling and Aga1 and Aga2 function in cell adhesion) and transmission of the cell’s own mating signal to cells of the opposite mating type (i.e., via Mfa1 and Mfa2 secretion).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66050-fig10-v3.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, genomic manipulations, growth conditions, and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Yeast strains bearing endogenously expressed genes tagged with the MS2 aptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haim et al., 2007</xref>) were grown in a volume of 400 ml to mid-log phase at 26°C with constant shaking to an O.D.<sub>600</sub>=~0.8. Cells were centrifuged in a Sorvall SLA3000 rotor at 1100 x<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, resuspended in 200 ml of complete synthetic medium lacking methionine in order to induce the expression of the MS2-CP-GFP-SBP protein, and grown for an additional 1 hr. The cells were collected by centrifugation as described above, washed with PBS buffer (lacking Ca<sup>++</sup> and Mg<sup>++</sup>), and transferred into a 50 ml tube and pelleted as above. For the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, proteins were crosslinked by the addition of 8 ml PBS containing 0.01% formaldehyde and incubated at 24°C for 10 min with slow shaking. For all other experiments, 0.05% formaldehyde was used. The crosslinking reaction was terminated by adding 1 M glycine buffer, pH = 8.0, to a final concentration of 0.125 M with additional shaking for 2 min. The cells were then washed once with ice-cold PBS buffer, and the pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.</p><p>For cell lysis and RNA pulldown, cell pellets were thawed upon the addition of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5% NP40 supplemented with aprotinin [10 mg/ml], phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) [1 mM], pepstatin A [10 mg/ml], leupeptin [10 mg/ml], 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 80 U/ml RNAsin [Promega]) at 1 ml per 100 O.D.<sub>600</sub> U, and 0.5 ml aliquots were then transferred to separate microcentrifuge tubes containing an equal volume of 0.5 mm glass beads, and vortexed in an Vortex Genie Cell Disruptor (Scientific Instruments, New York) shaker at maximum speed for 10 min at 4°C. Glass beads and unbroken cells were sedimented at 4°C by centrifugation at 1700 x<italic>g</italic> for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed to new microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 11,000 x<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 10 min. The total cell lysate (TCL) was then removed to a fresh tube and protein concentration was determined using the microBCA protein determination kit (Pierce). Protein (10 mg of total cell lysate) was taken per pulldown reaction. In order to block endogenous biotinylated moieties, protein aliquots were incubated with 10 μg of free avidin (Sigma) per 1 mg of input protein for 1 hr at 4°C with constant rotation. In parallel, streptavidin-conjugated beads (Streptavidin-sepharose high performance, GE Healthcare) were aliquoted to microcentrifuge tubes according to 5 µl of slurry per 1 mg of protein (not &gt;30 μl overall), washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, once with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and blocked with a 1:1 mixture of 1 ml of lysis buffer containing yeast tRNA (Sigma; 0.1 mg/100 ml of beads) and 1 ml of 4% BSA in PBS at 4°C for 1 hr with constant rotation. Following blocking, beads were washed twice in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Pulldown was performed by adding the indicated amount of avidin-blocked TCL to the beads, followed by incubation at 4°C for 2–15 hr with constant rotation. Yeast tRNA was added to the pulldown reaction (0.1 mg/tube) to reduce nonspecific interactions. We used standard 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes when working with small volumes of TCL or 15 ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tubes with larger volumes. Following pulldown, the beads were centrifuged at 660 x<italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 2 min, the supernatant then removed, and the beads washed three times with lysis buffer (e.g., 1 ml volume washes for small tubes, 2 ml for large tubes), twice with wash buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100), all performed at 4°C (each step lasting 10 min with rotation). The beads were then equilibrated by a final wash in 1–2 ml of cold PBS, pelleted by centrifugation as above, and excess buffer aspirated. For elution of the crosslinked RNP complexes from the beads, 150 ml of PBS containing 6 mM free biotin (Sigma) was added to the beads, followed by 1 hr of incubation at 4°C with rotation. After centrifugation at 660 x<italic>g</italic> for 2 min, the eluate was transferred into a fresh microcentrifuge tube, re-centrifuged, and transferred into another tube to assure that no beads were carried over. To reverse the crosslink, the eluate was incubated at 70°C for 1–2 hr with an equal volume of 2X crosslink reversal buffer (100 mM Tris, pH7.0, 10 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT, and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) for RNA analysis or with an appropriate volume of 5X protein sample buffer (5X: 0.4 M Tris at pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.5 M DTT, and 0.25% bromophenol blue) for protein analysis using SDS-PAGE.

Differentially expressed genes were identified using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), with the dispersion parameter manually set to 0.1. Those genes reported as at least fourfold differentially expressed (FDR &lt;0.001) were retained as significantly differentially expressed. After log transforming the data (log2(TPM +1)), the gene expression values from the control sample were subtracted from experimental samples and plotted in a heat map illustrating expression levels as compared to the control sample.

that function on the same pathway into single ribonucleoprotein particles that can be co-trafficked and presumably co-translated. Interestingly, this form of gene regulation is dependent upon histone H4 function and interchromosomal contacts that allow the genes encoding these mRNAs to be closely apposed during transcription. As opposed to prokaryotic cells that employ polycistronic operons, eukaryotic cells can employ monocistronic messages as RNA operons (transperons) to achieve gene co-expression.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Introduction of aptamer-binding sites can lead to the accumulation of decay intermediate that accumulate in P-body-like structures (see results from the Parker and Weis labs 2017). It is therefore critical that the authors perform extensive FISH experiments with untagged alleles (using probes against the body of the mRNAs). In situs should be performed for the different groups of mRNAs involved in mating, heat shock etc. The experiments need to be carefully quantified, statistically evaluated and all experiments need to include negative controls (i.e. mRNAs that do not co-localize).

The only signals one can see are for MFalpha1 and MFalpha2, but the signals in the input fraction are much more abundant for those genes that the signals seen for the control transcripts, making it impossible to say if these mRNAs are actually truly enriched. The control used for Figure A is the signal from the input, while for B, the only control provided is &quot;-RT&quot;.

I wasn't convinced that the IST2 mRNA was significantly enriched in the pulldown in</p><p>Figure 2A relative to Figure 2B- as claimed by the authors.

Have the authors tested the expression levels of the Hhf1K-R and K-Q- as these mutations a differential effect on protein stability could explain the observations?</p><p>4. Similar to above- have the authors measured the RNA levels for AGA2 47-MUT or AGA2 27-MUT relative to wild type, as effects on RNA stability or expression could explain the observed effects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this novel version of the manuscript, the authors have, I think, satisfactorily answered to most reviewer concerns about the first version.</p><p>Considering the suggestion to provide the results of the replicate of the Rapid-RNAseq experiment, the authors rather preferred to remove all mentions of it. Considering that all analyzed and discussed results of the now single documented experiment are validated by independent RaPID followed by qRT-PCR experiments, one can consider this as acceptable.</p><p>I have one suggestion, thought. When examining Figure 1 and the associated Table S1, one can see that some of the transcripts most highly enriched together with the bait MS2 tagged mRNAs are actually the mRNAs from the directly adjacent genes. This is true for PET122 (YER153C) pulled down by OXA1 (YER154W), or SPE1 (YKL184W) / ASH1 (YKL185W), SNC1 (YAL030W) / MYO4 (YAL029C), SNC2 (YOR327C) / MYO2 (YOR326W) or ALY2 (YJL084C) / EXO70 (YJL085W). This striking observation, which cannot have escaped the authors, is never mentioned nor discussed, which, I think, is a pity. These genes are most likely without any functional link with the bait mRNAs. Moreover, they are indifferently in tandem, divergent of convergent orientations, which preclude the fact that these co-purifications might result from the existence of some kind of polycistronic mRNAs. The most likely explanation that comes to mind is thus that the RaPID procedure is able to enrich not only MRNP particles but also chromatin fragments with their associated nascent transcripts.</p><p>I think that this is important to discuss because it suggests that a substantial fraction of the transcripts enriched in the genomic experiment might actually represent such chromatin-associated transcripts. This observation would not be in conflict with the suggestion in the following sections of the manuscript that co-purified mRNAs are synthesized within &quot;transcription factories&quot; in which the genomic locations of the corresponding scattered genes are brought to vicinity.</p><p>Anyhow, this observation, which is readily apparent, should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66050.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The results fully support our previous observations made using the endogenously expressed aptamer-tagged mRNAs.

These are shown in the new Figure 2A and B. We found that the results matched our original RT-PCR results and show that the quantitative coprecipitation of mating RNAs is significant compared to the negative controls (Figure 2, and B). We note that we previously used qRT-PCR to demonstrate the multiplexing of the HSP, MOMP, MAPK RNAs (Figures 8A, 9A and D, S8A and B) in the original version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The fact that deletion of DHH1 or PAT1 does not affect mating is not an argument against (1). However, the authors should colocalize Dhh1 and Pat1 in their aptamer-tagged strains. Note that this experiment does not replace the need of the FISH experiments described in (1).</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion we looked for the colocalization of Dhh1 protein and MS2-tagged STE2 mRNA under conditions of normal growth (and mating), as compared to conditions that induce P-body formation (i.e. no glucose – 10min; Figure S5C). Under normal growth conditions (2% glucose), we found that only ~2% of cells had Dhh1-mCherry-labeled puncta and which did not colocalize with the mating pathway mRNA examined (STE2). As a positive control for P-body formation, we exposed the cells to no glucose conditions for 10min, which resulted in all cells having well-formed Dhh1-mCherry puncta (P-bodies). Under these conditions, we now observed around 41% colocalization of puncta colocalizing with STE2 mRNA (Figure S5C). Our results confirm the idea that under conditions conducive to normal growth or mating (i.e. in the presence of glucose) that mating pathway mRNAs do not colocalize with P-bodies (if even formed) and, therefore, conclude that P-bodies cannot be a major site for mating pathway signaling events. Thus, our work contrasts with the earlier study of Aronov et al.et al. 2015 (JCB) in a number of critical points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Hhf1 seems to fill the entire nucleus and thus is likely to &quot;interact' with every mRNA that would be tested in such a way.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewer in that an mRNA in the nucleus is likely to colocalize with Hhf1 protein because of the high concentration of protein therein. The point we endeavored to show is that we cannot observe colocalization between RFP-Hhf1 with the mRNAs in the cytoplasmic transperons, either due to lack of RFP-Hhf1 presence in the cytoplasm or that the level in transperons is below the threshold of detection. Since the experiment is inconclusive, we have removed this figure in order to prevent any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The observations presented are potentially interesting.

We have now removed this sentence (i.e. about the experiment being performed twice) from the text in order to prevent any confusion. We concur with the reviewer that if these experiments would be performed today they would be done differently, with replicates, and under different conditions of stringency in order to identify (and not eliminate) other potential multiplexes. We are in the process of setting this up and, in parallel, will perform quality Hi-C experiments for the yeast genome under different conditions, since allelic coupling appears to be part of the mechanism leading to RNA multiplexing. In this revised version of the paper we now validate the existence of mating pathway RNA multiplexes (as observed in Figure 1A and B for MATalpha cells), in both MATa and MATalpha yeast using RaPID and qRT-PCR (Figure 2A and B). These results verify the existence of the multiplex shown in Figure 1 as well as the original RT-PCR results obtained via RaPID pulldowns in the original Figure 2. In addition, we now add smFISH experiments (new Figure 3A and B) that also validate our original finding that aptamer-tagged mating pathway mRNAs colocalize (Figure 2D-F). Together with the original data, our new experimentation further validates the hypothesis that these mRNAs form functional multiplexes in yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 A and B provide the data for the key experiment, which is at the basis of the whole manuscript.

Figure 2, 3, 8, 9</p><p>The mRNA localization results vary dramatically between different experiments (e.g., STE2 foci in different conditions). Why? Irrespectively, this makes it very hard to compare the experiments and the controls. Furthermore, the signal overlap in hs between SSA2 and HSP104 are not convincing.

However, it is important to note these results did not change our overall conclusions regarding RNA colocalization. Nevertheless, we repeated the smFISH experiment in Figure 2E and F now using probes for endogenous <italic>STE2</italic> mRNA and PP7 probes for <italic>AGA2</italic> mRNA, and observed much greater numbers of RNA foci and colocalization.

However, we also showed previously (Figure 8A) that heat shock increases <italic>SSA2</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> multiplexing. Moreover, we show in Figure 8—figure supplement 2C that colocalization is dependent on histone H4 levels, which is independent of mRNA levels as shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 2D. Therefore, the increased colocalization is most likely a consequence of increased multiplexing and not increased gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The AID experiments in hs are not convincing. mRNA levels go down which might be sufficient to reduce co-localization (see 2). AID-tagging alone (without auxin) also leads to a reduction, which is potentially problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown previously in Figure S3D (now referred as <italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1D)</italic>, the mRNA levels for both <italic>STE2</italic> and <italic>AGA1</italic> do not go down upon auxin addition (either with or without α factor). In fact, the levels for <italic>STE2</italic> mRNA do not change, while those of <italic>AGA1</italic> actually go up a bit. Thus, the auxin-induced depletion of histone H4 does not greatly affect the levels of the mating pathway mRNAs and, therefore, the reduced colocalization of <italic>STE2</italic> and <italic>AGA1</italic> mRNAs (Figure S3E; now referred as <italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</italic>) is independent of RNA levels. In <italic>Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</italic>, we now show that the mRNA levels of <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic> also do not go down upon histone depletion, either with or without heat shock. This shows that the reduced amounts of <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic> mRNA colocalization (S8C; now referred as <italic>Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</italic>) are also likely to be independent of RNA levels.</p><p>As shown in <italic>Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</italic>, AID tagging alone (e.g. without auxin) does not affect the levels of <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>SSA2</italic> mRNA. Likewise AID tagging (e.g. with α factor) did not affect <italic>STE2</italic> mRNA levels, but slightly increased those of <italic>AGA1</italic> slightly (Figure S3D; now referred as <italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</italic>). Thus, AID tagging did not affect gene expression in the case of either transperon. We also showed previously that AID tagging alone did not affect Hhf1 protein levels (Figure S3B; now referred as <italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</italic>). We did observe a decrease in RNA colocalization in the tagged strains, but this more likely reflects the effect of the single histone H4 deletion (<italic>hhf2</italic>delta), which we have demonstrated to affect RNA multiplexing (Figure 4C and D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 9 (A-C) is also problematic since no convincing negative controls are included.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion we have now included negative controls (<italic>e.g. HSP104</italic> vs. <italic>TOM6</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> vs. <italic>FUS3</italic> RNA colocalization) for the mitochondrial outer membrane and MAPK pathway transperons, respectively. Our results fully support our previous observations regarding the existence of these RNA multiplexes/transperons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors present a detailed set of experiments to describe and mechanistically characterize potential multiplexing of functionally related mRNAs. The focus is mainly the mating pathway mRNAs and the physiology of the mating pathway in yeast. The work supports models where the fate of functionally related mRNAs is coordinated and the authors show that this coordination is first seeded at the site of mRNA transcription which may involve a histone protein. The mechanistic advances supporting colocalized mRNA biogenesis at the site of transcription in the nucleus leading to a coordination of the subsequent cytosolic fate of this set of mRNAs are exciting and particularly noteworthy.</p><p>The authors present a revised version of a manuscript describing mRNA multiplexing and going on to study the mechanism of mRNA localization and physiological role of this process. The manuscript is very much improved over the previous version, but I do have some further comments for the authors – detailed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful comments and suggestions, and have addressed the issues raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

This new figure shows improved significance in the pulldown results for the mating pathway mRNAs and supports the idea that each yeast haplotype creates its own mating RNA multiplex. We now better describe the significance, statistical tests performed, and number of experiments performed in the figure and legend of Figure 2A and B. With regards to <italic>IST2</italic>, we could only observe significant enrichment in the <italic>SAG1</italic> pulldown from <italic>MAT</italic>alpha cells.

We did not examine protein levels (due to a lack of specific antibody), so it’s possible that protein instability could also contribute to the effect. A statement to this effect has been added to the text. As for the <italic>HHF1</italic>K-Q mutation (used in Figure 5B), this gene was expressed using a multicopy plasmid, but we did not examine protein stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Considering that all analyzed and discussed results of the now single documented experiment are validated by independent RaPID followed by qRT-PCR experiments, one can consider this as acceptable.</p><p>I have one suggestion, thought. When examining Figure 1 and the associated Table S1, one can see that some of the transcripts most highly enriched together with the bait MS2 tagged mRNAs are actually the mRNAs from the directly adjacent genes. This is true for PET122 (YER153C) pulled down by OXA1 (YER154W), or SPE1 (YKL184W) / ASH1 (YKL185W), SNC1 (YAL030W) / MYO4 (YAL029C), SNC2 (YOR327C) / MYO2 (YOR326W) or ALY2 (YJL084C) / EXO70 (YJL085W). This striking observation, which cannot have escaped the authors, is never mentioned nor discussed, which, I think, is a pity. These genes are most likely without any functional link with the bait mRNAs. Moreover, they are indifferently in tandem, divergent of convergent orientations, which preclude the fact that these co-purifications might result from the existence of some kind of polycistronic mRNAs. The most likely explanation that comes to mind is thus that the RaPID procedure is able to enrich not only MRNP particles but also chromatin fragments with their associated nascent transcripts.</p><p>I think that this is important to discuss because it suggests that a substantial fraction of the transcripts enriched in the genomic experiment might actually represent such chromatin-associated transcripts. This observation would not be in conflict with the suggestion in the following sections of the manuscript that co-purified mRNAs are synthesized within &quot;transcription factories&quot; in which the genomic locations of the corresponding scattered genes are brought to vicinity.</p><p>Anyhow, this observation, which is readily apparent, should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We duly appreciated the reviewer’s suggestion. This was indeed observed, but since we had not examined the interactions could not prove or disprove the findings. However, we agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and explanation, and briefly discuss the issue in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
