Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid of clinical relevance, is one of the few molecules known to activate TRPV2. Using the patch-clamp technique, we discover that CBD can sensitize current responses of the rat TRPV2 channel to the synthetic agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) by over two orders of magnitude, without sensitizing channels to activation by moderate (40°C) heat. Using cryo-EM, we uncover a new small-molecule binding site in the pore domain of rTRPV2 in addition to a nearby CBD site that had already been reported. The TRPV1 and TRPV3 channels are also activated by 2-APB and CBD and share multiple conserved features with TRPV2, but we find that strong sensitization by CBD is only observed in TRPV3, while sensitization for TRPV1 is much weaker. Mutations at non-conserved positions between rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 in either the pore domain or the CBD sites failed to confer strong sensitization by CBD in mutant rTRPV1 channels. Together, our results indicate that CBD-dependent sensitization of rTRPV2 channels engages multiple channel regions, and that the difference in sensitization strength between rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels does not originate from amino acid sequence differences at the CBD binding site or the pore domain. The remarkably robust effect of CBD on TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels offers a promising new tool to both understand and overcome one of the major roadblocks in the study of these channels – their resilience to activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRP channel</kwd><kwd>TRPV1</kwd><kwd>TRPV3</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>channel sensitization</kwd><kwd>cannabinoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008562</institution-id><institution>University of Texas at Austin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4R00NS101053-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Programs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cannabidiol is an ultra potent sensitizer for 2-APB responses in rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 channels but not in rTRPV1 through a mechanism that engages channel regions further from the cannabidiol binding site and the pore.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The non-selective, cation-permeable transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) channel is a homo-tetrameric protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>) expressed in multiple cell types and tissues in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caterina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tamura et al., 2005</xref>). Adult mice in which TRPV2 channel expression in cardiomyocytes was ablated died within 2 wk and exhibited severe structural abnormalities of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iwata and Matsumura, 2019</xref>). In neonatal mice, TRPV2-deficient cardiomyocytes were also highly dysfunctional after growth in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katanosaka et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that TRPV2 channel expression in cardiomyocytes is required for normal development and function of the heart. In macrophages, TRPV2 channel expression is essential for phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Link et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lévêque et al., 2018</xref>), in pancreatic β-cells it influences insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hisanaga et al., 2009</xref>), in red blood cells it contributes to their response to osmotic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belkacemi et al., 2021</xref>), and its expression levels are significantly altered in multiple types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kudou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Siveen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guéguinou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the identity of the stimuli that orchestrate TRPV2 channel activity in each of the examples mentioned above remains unknown. Very few stimuli capable of activating the TRPV2 channel have been identified; the extreme temperatures (&gt;55°C) required to activate rodent TRPV2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caterina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>) and the lack of thermo-sensitivity of the human orthologue under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neeper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yao et al., 2011</xref>) exclude a likely role for this protein in thermo-detection. Yet, oxidative modification of specific methionine residues in rodent and human TRPV2 channels resulted in robust channel activation at temperatures &lt;50°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fricke et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that redox processes, temperature, and membrane depolarization together could promote channel activity in native tissues under physiological or pathological conditions. The synthetic agonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) robustly activates rodent but not human TRPV2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Juvin et al., 2007</xref>), and even rodent TRPV2 channels have very low apparent affinity for 2-APB, with an EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>) that is close to the solubility limit of the compound. Importantly, 2-APB also targets other channels, including TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Togashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kovacs et al., 2012</xref>), STIM-Orai channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bootman et al., 2002</xref>), and gap-junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2006</xref>). Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotropic compound from the cannabis plant that has received much attention recently for its potential use in treating a variety of disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pauli et al., 2020</xref>), has also been found to activate rodent TRPV2 channels with much higher apparent affinity than 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qin et al., 2008</xref>). Other cannabis-derived compounds, including Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are also reported to activate TRPV2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neeper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In stark contrast with the limited number of stimuli that activate the TRPV2 channel, the TRPV1 channel expressed in nociceptive neurons can be activated by the stimuli that activate the TRPV2 channel, but also by a remarkably diverse set of inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zygmunt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hwang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieto-Posadas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joseph et al., 2019</xref>), animal toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and natural products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salazar et al., 2008</xref>). Paradoxically, both channels are &gt;40% identical in amino acid sequence, have an identical structural fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huynh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>), and utilize similar mechanisms to gate the passage of cations through their ion conduction pathway in response to stimulation with 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, high sensitivity to a TRPV1-specific agonist, resiniferatoxin (RTx), could be engineered into the rat TRPV2 channel simply by substituting four non-conserved residues in a pocket that is otherwise equivalent to where RTx binds in TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of rat TRPV2 channels obtained in the presence of CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pumroy et al., 2019</xref>) and CBD together with 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>) suggest that the cannabinoid binds close to the regions in the channel that directly gate the passage of cations through the pore in response to stimulation. Here we set out to use the patch-clamp technique and cryo-EM structural determination to characterize the actions of CBD on rat TRPV2 channels, and learn more about how the mechanisms of TRPV2 channel activation contrast with those of its closest homologue, the TRPV1 channel that can be activated by so many different types of stimuli. We discovered that CBD potently sensitizes the rTRPV2 channel to activation by 2-APB, without an effect on channel sensitivity to moderate heat. We obtained structures of rTRPV2 in the presence of CBD and 2-APB representing two non-conducting conformations; one has CBD bound to a previously identified site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pumroy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>) providing confirmatory evidence for the site. The other conformation exhibits an additional non-protein density at a site located at an allosteric nexus between the pore domain, the S4-S5 linker, and a bound lipid molecule. We assign this density to CBD, but it is possible that other molecules, including endogenous ligands, could occupy that site to modulate channel function physiologically. When comparing the effect of CBD on the TRPV1 and TRPV3 channels, which are also activated by CBD and 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2004</xref>), we find that only TRPV3 channels are potently sensitized by CBD. Further, mutations at rTRPV1 sites that differ between TRPV1 and TRPV2 and that are located in the pore domain or the CBD binding region failed to confer strong sensitization by CBD. These findings establish that the robust sensitization by CBD observed in TRPV2 channels involves a CBD-specific allosteric mechanism that engages channel regions distant from the CBD binding site and the pore.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CBD strongly sensitizes rTRPV2 channels to activation by 2-APB</title><p>We expressed rat TRPV2 (rTRPV2) channels in HEK293 cells and began by measuring the magnitude of the currents elicited by a low concentration of 2-APB (0.5 mM) or a near-saturating concentration (10 µM) of CBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qin et al., 2008</xref>) in the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp at a holding potential of –80 mV. Even at this low concentration, 2-APB elicited currents that were much larger than those by CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When 2-APB and CBD were applied together, we observed large currents that were comparable to those measured in response to a concentration of 2-APB (6 mM) that maximally activates rTRPV2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Currents in the presence of 0.5 mM 2-APB were over two orders of magnitude larger in the presence of CBD than in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Importantly, 2-APB and CBD applied together elicited no increase in whole-cell currents from un-transfected cells recorded in response to voltage pulses from –100 to +100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, the same voltage-stimulation protocol elicited robust currents in rTRPV2-transfected cells when exposed to 0.5 mM 2-APB or 10 µM CBD applied separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). The sensitization caused by CBD is so strong that it becomes challenging to quantitate; at 0.5 mM 2-APB, channel activity is barely detectable in the whole-cell configuration, and yet with CBD added currents reach maximal activation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and H</xref>). The magnitude of sensitization we measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) likely represents a lower bound for the sensitizing effect of CBD on rTRPV2 channels. We therefore analyzed data in a semi-quantitative manner without attempting to quantify the energetics associated with sensitization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cannabidiol (CBD) strongly sensitizes rTRPV2 channels to activation by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) in whole-cell and in excised patch recordings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative whole-cell gap-free current recording at –80 mV from a cell expressing rTRPV2 channels.

The resulting concentration–response relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) confirm that CBD activates rTRPV2 channels with much higher affinity (EC<sub>50</sub> ~ 4 µM) than 2-APB but also with much lower efficacy, and that rTRPV2 channels can be assumed to be fully bound by CBD at a concentration of 10 µM CBD. We next tested whether rTRPV2 channels display an increased apparent affinity for 2-APB when bound to CBD by measuring rTRPV2 channel activation at increasing concentrations of 2-APB in the presence and absence of 10 µM CBD, and found that the EC<sub>50</sub> for 2-APB activation decreased approximately tenfold in the presence of CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The TRPV2 channel is reported to undergo sensitization upon stimulation with 2-APB that is irreversible over the duration of a patch-clamp experiment, leading to hysteresis in the 2-APB dose–response relations obtained pre- and post-sensitization: in most but not all patches, repeated short exposures to low concentrations of 2-APB were found to elicit progressively larger currents until reaching a plateau ~15-fold larger than the initial response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). Sensitization also reached saturation after a single short stimulation with a concentration of 2-APB that maximally activates channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). To investigate whether 2-APB and CBD sensitize rTRPV2 channels to a similar extent, we performed experiments where we first briefly exposed cells to 0.5 mM 2-APB, then we stimulated cells with a maximally activating concentration of 2-APB (6 mM), which we repeated three times to ensure all channels had become sensitized (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2,</sub> and I<sub>3</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and finally exposed cells to 0.5 mM 2-APB and 10 µM CBD first applied separately and then together. We found that currents activated by 0.5 mM 2-APB increased nearly tenfold after repeated stimulation with 6 mM 2-APB in some but not all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, ① vs. ②), whereas co-application with CBD increased currents by &gt;100-fold in all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). The observed magnitude and cell-to-cell variability of 2-APB-dependent sensitization is consistent with previously reported measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>), and markedly smaller than sensitization by CBD. These results indicate that the predominant states adopted by rTPRV2 channels when bound to CBD must be energetically different than those adopted by 2-APB-sensitized channels in the absence of ligands.</p><p>Recording solutions containing 2-APB and CBD also included dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) that we used to make stock solutions of both compounds, so the amount of DMSO applied to cells was larger in solutions that contained both agonists. To rule out an influence of DMSO on our results, in the same experiments described above we exposed cells to solutions with either 2-APB or CBD with added DMSO so that its concentration was the same as in solutions that contained both agonists together. We found that the additional DMSO did not change the magnitude of the currents in 0.5 mM 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, ② vs. ③) or 10 µM CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, ④ vs. ⑤).</p><p>To rule out a direct chemical reaction between 2-APB and CBD, yielding a product with enhanced potency to activate the channel, we ran samples containing our recording solution (blank), 2-APB, CBD, and 2-APB and CBD mixed together, through a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. We found that the elution time and height of the two peaks present in a sample with both agonists perfectly matched each single peak observed in samples with CBD or 2-APB alone, suggesting the two do not interact chemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to being weakly sensitized by 2-APB, rTRPV2 channels are strongly and irreversibly sensitized by heat, in which channel activation with extreme heat resulted in a tenfold decrease in the EC<sub>50</sub> for 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). In addition, heat-sensitized rTRPV2 channels no longer require extreme temperatures (&gt;55°C) to activate, showing current responses at temperatures at or below 40°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). We therefore tested whether the mechanisms of rTRPV2 channel sensitization by CBD and heat are related. We reasoned that if this was the case, then the presence of CBD should facilitate channel activation by heat and enable current responses at around 40°C. Using rTRPV1 channel currents as a positive control for their high sensitivity to temperature changes in the 20–40°C range, we successfully detected steeply temperature-dependent currents as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>). When we performed experiments using cells expressing rTRPV2 channels in the absence of CBD, we were unable to detect any temperature-dependent changes in current that were noticeably different from those measured under identical conditions in un-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C, E</xref>) as expected because the threshold for heat activation for rTRPV2 channels is &gt;55°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the responses in rTRPV2-expressing cells were the same in the absence and presence of CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>), indicating that CBD does not strongly sensitize rTRPV2 channels to activation by heat. We also tested whether CBD sensitizes rTRPV2 channels to activation by the synthetic agonist probenecid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 2007</xref>), but we failed to detect any probenecid-elicited currents in the absence or presence of CBD (data not shown).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the sensitizing effect of CBD on activation of rTRPV2 channels by 2-APB also occurs in excised membrane patches devoid of many cellular components. Exposure of outside-out or inside-out patches expressing rTRPV2 channels to 0.5 mM 2-APB or 10 µM CBD alone elicited negligible currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and similarly to our results in the whole-cell configuration, application of both agonists together elicited very large currents of the same magnitude as those elicited in response to 6 mM 2-APB that maximally activates channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results indicate that patch excision does not disrupt sensitization of 2-APB responses by CBD, and that both agonists are capable of reaching their sites in the channel regardless of the side of the membrane to which they are applied.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>rTRPV2 channel sensitization by CBD increases channel open probability</title><p>To determine whether CBD sensitizes rTRPV2 channels to activation by 2-APB by increasing channel open probability (P<sub>o</sub>), we undertook single-channel recordings. Although we were unable to obtain patches containing a single channel because the rTRPV2 channel expresses extremely well in HEK293 cells, we obtained recordings from inside-out patches containing multiple channels under conditions where the P<sub>o</sub> is very low and gating transitions of individual channels can be readily distinguished. For each patch, we recorded channel activity in the absence of agonists (i.e. control), and in the presence of 2-APB and CBD applied separately or together. All recorded data are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> as data blocks organized into two 3 × 4 arrays: each row of data blocks in the array contains data from a different inside-out patch (n = 6), and columns separate data obtained under different experimental conditions.

In contrast, exposure of patches to 2-APB and CBD together resulted in robust channel activity in all six patches, with multiple simultaneous channel opening events observed in many of the patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Exposure to 2-APB and CBD did not elicit changes in channel activity in patches from un-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), strongly suggesting that the increases in channel activity observed in rTRPV2-expressing cells reflect a dramatic increase in P<sub>o</sub> in rTRPV2 channels when CBD and 2-APB are simultaneously present.</p><p>To compare between data from different patches at each experimental condition, we generated all-points current amplitude histograms from each of the 24 data blocks shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; each vertical lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is a histogram, with current–amplitude bins on the vertical axis and a color scale to denote the logarithm of the normalized number of points per bin. For almost all patches, the histograms in control, 2-APB, or CBD have a single peak centered at 0 pA, the mean current amplitude when no channels are open. Consistent with a much greater P<sub>o</sub> in the presence of 2-APB and CBD together, the corresponding histograms all have robust peaks at larger amplitudes representing the opening of one or more channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel). We could not accurately determine single-channel current amplitudes in 2-APB or CBD because of the short duration and sparsity of openings when the agonists were applied separately. In the presence of 2-APB and CBD together, the single-channel current amplitude was centered at around 4.3 pA in five out of the six patches, with one patch exhibiting a much larger open amplitude of 8.2 pA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In one of the patches in the presence of the two agonists, the open-channel current amplitude was initially ~4 pA but we also began observing openings with a larger current amplitude of 10.5 pA that became predominant for the rest of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We are fairly confident that both amplitudes correspond to open rTPRV2 channels because we were able to observe multiple transitions between the two single-channel current amplitude levels when only one channel was open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these findings imply that rTRPV2 channels can undergo transitions between open states with different cation-conducting properties, as described for the closely related rTRPV1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canul-Sánchez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geron et al., 2018</xref>) and the RTx-sensitive TRPV2-QM variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), and establish that the CBD-dependent sensitization of rTRPV2 channels arises from increased open probability of channels bound to CBD and 2-APB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Interaction sites for CBD in the rTRPV2 channel</title><p>To further explore the mechanism by which CBD sensitizes rTRPV2 to activation by 2-APB, we set out to confirm where CBD binds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pumroy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>) and to solve structures of rTRPV2 with both ligands.

undertook further focused classification of the TM region into seven classes without image alignment. Six classes were indistinguishable from conformation A, while one class shows interesting features that are distinct from conformation A which we refer to as conformation B. Although the reported resolution of conformation B was 3.32 Å, the density near the CBD binding site is much stronger compared to conformation A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In this new conformation, we observed density for CBD bound to the previously described site, similarly to conformation A. In addition, we observed a second non-protein density located nearby the S5 and S6 helices and the S4-S5 linker towards the intracellular side of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>), which represents a new potential binding site for small molecules in the rTRPV2 channel. Because this second non-protein density can be well fit by CBD in contrast to 2-APB, we have assigned this density to CBD over 2-APB based on its shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), but we acknowledge that the density could represent another molecule carried over from the cells during purification. We also observed a well-defined density at the vanilloid site of a lipid molecule interacting with and likely stabilizing the second CBD molecule at this new site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, E and F</xref>). Because the headgroup density for this lipid has a conical shape that can be fit with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), we tentatively assigned the lipid as POPC. In conformation A and earlier structures of TRPV2, the S4-S5 linker adopts a helical secondary structure, whereas in conformation B, residues at the C-terminal end of the S4-S5 linker are incorporated into the S5 helix to lengthen that TM, and the remaining residues in the linker adopt an extended loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, the position of the vanilloid site lipid in conformation B resembles density attributed to lipid in rTRPV2 structures obtained in the presence of 2-APB together with CBD that were proposed to represent an activated state of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>). In both of these instances, the position of the lipid is closer to the S4-S5 linker when compared to vanilloid lipid observed in other structures of TRPV2 or TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2023</xref>). However, as with conformation A, we see no clear density for 2-APB in conformation B, including those regions where 2-APB has been reported to bind to either TRPV2 or TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Although we do see extra density within the S1-S4 domain in both conformation A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>), similar density can also be seen in this region for structures solved for the apo-form of TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>, left) or TRPV2 in the presence of CBD or 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>, middle and right, respectively). From these results, we conclude that it remains unclear where 2-APB binds to rTRPV2, but that CBD could potentially bind to two sites within each subunit of rTRPV2, with binding to the most intracellular site involving stabilizing interactions with the lipid at the vanilloid site and a localized conformational change in the S4-S5 linker.</p><p>We note that a much larger number of particles were used to refine conformation A (321,717) compared to conformation B (43,071) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the binding of CBD to the more extracellular site has higher occupancy compared to the more intracellular site. This difference in CBD occupancy might suggest that the affinity of CBD is higher for the more extracellular site. Another possibility is that conformation B is only transiently populated during activation or desensitization of rTRPV2. Finally, it is possible that CBD binding to the second site in conformation B requires the presence of a lipid other than the POPC that we modeled that has been carried over from purification, and the majority of particles are observed to adopt conformation A because they lost that lipid during purification. The conformational change in the S4-S5 linker observed in conformation B is interesting because this structural element plays a critical role in coupling conformational changes in the S1-S4 domain to the pore domain where the gate resides.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CBD sensitizes rTRPV1 channels weakly and mTRPV3 channels strongly to activation by 2-APB</title><p>Rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1) and mouse TRPV3 (mTRPV3) channels share 49 and 42% amino acid sequence identity with rTRPV2, respectively, and accumulating evidence suggests that some agonists follow similar mechanisms to activate these three channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zubcevic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimada et al., 2020</xref>).

We therefore tested whether CBD exerts a similar sensitizing effect on rTRPV1 and mTRPV3 channels. First, we confirmed that 10 µM CBD can elicit currents in rTRPV1 or mTRPV3-expressing cells by recording current–voltage relations in the absence and presence of CBD and found that for both channels 10 µM CBD noticeably increased currents relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cannabidiol (CBD) sensitizes rTRPV1 channels weakly and mTRPV3 channels strongly to activation by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative whole-cell current families obtained from rTRPV1 expressing cells in control or in the presence of 10 µM CBD.

We performed experiments where we exposed cells to 50 µM 2-APB and 10 µM CBD, first applied separately and then together, and finally we applied 10 µM capsaicin to maximally activate channels. To our surprise, we observed only moderate sensitization of the response to 2-APB in the presence of CBD (less than tenfold increase), and sensitized currents were much smaller than the maximal currents recorded in the presence of capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). In experiments using a higher concentration of CBD (40 µM), we obtained similar results, indicating that 10 µM CBD is enough to bind most rTRPV1 channels in the membrane, and that CBD-bound rTRPV1 channels are not strongly sensitized to activation by 2-APB, contrary to our observations with rTRPV2 channels.</p><p>We then tested the sensitizing effect of CBD on mTRPV3-expressing cells. We used a concentration of 2-APB that maximally activates channels (60 μM), albeit with extremely slow kinetics due to the large energy barrier associated with the activation of this channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Following activation, there is an even larger energy barrier in the reverse direction (i.e. back towards the initial closed state before exposure to 2-APB), resulting in the irreversible sensitization of channels. Sensitized and non-sensitized channels therefore open from different closed states upon stimulation by 2-APB, and the energy barrier for activation is much smaller for sensitized channels such that the kinetics of activation by 2-APB become much faster after sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zubcevic et al., 2019</xref>). We found that a brief 10 s exposure to 2-APB resulted in a slow and minimal increase in current, whereas exposing the same cell to 2-APB together with CBD resulted in maximal current activation with a time constant &lt;10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and K</xref>). In contrast, in experiments where cells were repeatedly exposed to 60 μM 2-APB in the absence of CBD, currents elicited by the agonist took several minutes to reach a steady state at maximal activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and K</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zubcevic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). We noticed that over the course of an experiment the activation kinetics of currents elicited by 2-APB changed with each exposure to the agonist. To evaluate this effect, for each exposure to agonist we fitted a bi-exponential function of time to the current time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, red curves), and averaged the resulting slow (yellow) and fast (magenta) time constants across experiments at equivalent timepoints where exposure to agonist was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, left panel, yellow and magenta symbols). During the first exposure to 2-APB, current activation was mono-exponential and slow – likely because at the beginning of the experiment there are no sensitized channels, and so activation kinetics are dominated by the slow activation of non-sensitized channels. Currents followed a bi-exponential time course during the second and all subsequent exposures to agonist. The slow time constants were similar to what we measured during the first stimulation, whereas the fast time constants were similar to what we obtained from mono-exponential fits to currents elicited by 2-APB in combination with CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, right panel, black circles). We interpret this fast component as originating from the fraction of channels in the cell that have become sensitized by 2-APB. We think that the slow time constant reflects the slow process of sensitization by 2-APB. Consistently, the slow time constants obtained from fits to individual 2-APB exposures are similar to those obtained from a mono-exponential fit to the time course spanning the entire experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, right panel, blue circles). Together these data indicate that channels activate fast when sensitized by either 2-APB or 2-APB + CBD, but the latter experimental condition allows channels to reach the sensitized state much more rapidly than 2-APB binding alone.</p><p>Our results so far indicate that CBD can sensitize mTRPV3 channels much more rapidly than 2-APB at 60 μM. We next tested whether 2-APB at a much higher concentration (3 mM) would sensitize channels much more rapidly. We first found that pre-stimulation of cells with 3 mM 2-APB had negligible effect on the kinetics of activation by 60 μM 2-APB applied together with CBD, confirming that CBD binding rapidly sensitizes all channels in the recorded cell membrane to activation by 2-APB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and K</xref>). In contrast, we found that currents elicited by 60 μM 2-APB remained bi-exponential and continued to slowly increase upon repeated exposures after pre-stimulation with 3 mM 2-APB for &gt;1.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>). These results establish that CBD is a much weaker agonist than 2-APB for the mTRPV3 channel, but has a more potent sensitizing effect, similarly to our results with rTRPV2 channels. The absence of a strong sensitizing effect of CBD in rTRPV1 channels points to a key energetic difference regarding activation of rTRPV1 channels by 2-APB relative to rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Structural determinants of sensitization strength by CBD in rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels</title><p>We next sought to identify the structural determinants for the strong sensitization by CBD observed in the rTRPV2 channel relative to the weak sensitization observed in the rTRPV1 channel. The CBD site first identified in the full-length rTRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pumroy et al., 2019</xref>) shows high conservation at the amino acid sequence level between the TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under the assumption that sensitization in CBD-bound rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 channels follows a similar mechanism, we began by inspecting the amino acid sequence alignment between the three channels and identified three residues in the S5 helix in the pore domain and the S4-S5 linker that are identical in rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 channels and different in rTRPV1 channels, and are also located very close to the CBD site in conformation A that is also supported by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pumroy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We generated six mutant channels where we individually swapped each of the non-conserved residues between the rTRPV2 (V532M, L538C, L541M) and rTRPV1 channels (M572V, C578L, M581L). For each channel, we also generated a double (rTRPV2 L538C+L541M; rTRPV1-C578L+M581L) and a triple mutant (rTRPV2-V532M+L538C+L541M; rTRPV1-M572V+C578L+M581L). Our hypothesis was that if those amino acid side chain differences determine the strong or weak sensitization to 2-APB in CBD-bound rTRPV2 or rTRPV1 channels, respectively, then these introduced mutations should weaken sensitization in rTRPV2 channels and strengthen it in rTRPV1 channels.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cannabidiol (CBD) binding site in TRPV2 channels and its conservation in TRPV1 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of full-length rTRPV2 in nanodiscs with CBD bound in conformation A (with one CBD per subunit; PDB: 8SLX).

The L541M mutation closest to the CBD binding site in the rTRPV2 channel conformation A structure resulted in a small but appreciable increase in apparent affinity for 2-APB, which became more pronounced in the double mutant (rTRPV2 L538C+L541M EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.97 ± 0.18 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The corresponding mutations in TRPV1 had the opposite trend, with a small yet appreciable decrease in apparent affinity in the single mutants (C578L and M581L) and a slightly larger decrease in the double mutant (rTRPV1 C578L+M581L EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.15 ± 0.14 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Mutation at position V532 in rTRPV2 had the most profound effect: the single (V532M) and the triple (V532M+L538C+L541M) mutants were unresponsive to 2-APB or CBD, indicating that V532 is critical for rTRPV2 channel operation, potentially contributing to folding, surface expression, or gating. Consistent with a critical role for this site in gating, we found that mutation M572V in rTRPV1 impacted agonist sensitivity the most: the single mutation drastically reduced the apparent affinity for 2-APB to be even lower than in WT rTRPV2 (rTRPV1 M572V EC<sub>50</sub> = 3.32 ± 0.2 mM), and for the triple mutant (rTRPV1 M572V+C578L+M581L) we were unable to determine an EC<sub>50</sub> because even the highest attainable 2-APB concentrations in solution were insufficient to maximally activate channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Interestingly, for all rTRPV1 channel mutants we found a much stronger reduction in the apparent affinity for 2-APB than for capsaicin, and for the two constructs containing the M572V, the efficacy of activation by 2-APB was also reduced compared to capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>).</p><p>Although none of the side chains we mutated are reported to contact 2-APB when bound to any of its proposed sites in TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2023</xref>), we observed altered sensitivity to this agonist in most mutant channels. This observation is consistent with our hypothesis that the region containing the CBD site in conformation A exerts allosteric control over the response to 2-APB by both rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels. We therefore proceeded to test whether sequence differences between the rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels at any of these three sites are responsible for the differences in sensitization strength between the two channels. To test our hypothesis, we performed experiments similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and assessed sensitization at three different concentrations of CBD to ensure that for each mutant we measured sensitization at full channel occupancy by this ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). To account for differences in sensitivity to 2-APB in each mutant when assessing sensitization, we related the current elicited by a sub-activating concentration of 2-APB (I<sub>2APB</sub>) to a maximally activating concentration of 2-APB (I<sub>2APB,max</sub>), given by the current ratio I<sub>2APB,max</sub>/I<sub>2APB</sub>, as well as to the sensitized response to 2-APB in the presence of the highest concentration of CBD (I<sub>CBD+2APB</sub>), given by the ratio I<sub>CBD+2APB</sub>/I<sub>2APB</sub>. For experiments with WT rTRPV2, where CBD-sensitized responses to 2-APB reached maximal channel activation, the two ratios yielded similar values and when graphed against each other, data localized close to the diagonal given by I<sub>2APB,max</sub>/I<sub>2APB</sub> = I<sub>CBD+2APB</sub>/I<sub>2APB</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

For rTRPV1, mutations C578L and M581L appeared to slightly increase sensitized responses, which became more marked for the double mutant, with data from the single and double mutants falling closer than WT to the diagonal on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>. However, sensitized responses in these rTRPV1 channel mutants remained lower than maximal activation, and weaker than for rTRPV2 channels. Notably, channels carrying the single mutation M572V lacked sensitization altogether (i.e. I<sub>CBD+2APB</sub>/I<sub>2APB</sub> &lt; 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>), and in the triple mutant M572V+C578L+M581L sensitization was restored to levels similar to WT rTRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Interestingly, the M572V mutation brought down the EC<sub>50</sub> for 2-APB close to that of WT rTRPV2 without enhancing sensitization by CBD, establishing that apparent affinity for 2-APB and sensitization strength by CBD are not obligatorily coupled. Together, these results support the idea that the region containing the CBD site observed in conformation A of the rTRPV2 channel exerts allosteric control on the response to 2-APB in both rTRPV1 and rTRPV2 channels, and that position V532 in rTRPV2 and M572 in rTRPV1 has a prominent allosteric role in this mechanism. However, our results also showed that the difference in sensitization strength that we observed between the rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels is not determined by amino acid sequence differences near the CBD binding site in rTRPV2 conformation A.</p><p>The second tentative CBD site that we observed in conformation B could be potentially involved in determining sensitization strength by CBD in the rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels. Importantly, the side chain at position Q530 localizes near to the bound CBD molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and is not conserved in rTRPV1. We therefore tested whether mutations to alanine and glycine that would eliminate a potential interaction with that side chain in rTRPV2 would weaken sensitization by CBD. However, we found that both mutant channels had strong sensitization comparable to that of WT rTRPV2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), leaving the relevance of the second CBD site for mediating sensitization in TRPV2 an open question.</p><p>We and others have shown that residues in the pore-domain can dramatically tune sensitivity to activators in TRPV1-3 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grandl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grandl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore proceeded to interrogate whether amino acid sequence differences between the pore domains of rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels could be responsible for their differences in sensitization strength by CBD. We found eight additional positions in the pore domain that are conserved in rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 channels but not in rTRPV1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) – A552, V553, L555, and S557 in the S5 helix of rTRPV2 (S592, T593, V595, T597 in rTRPV1), D595 and A596 in the pore helix of rTRPV2 (S632, T633), Q613 above the selectivity filter in rTRPV2 (T650 in rTRPV1), and L623 in the S6 helix of rTRPV2 (I660 in rTRPV1). We cumulatively substituted each of these positions in rTRPV1 with the amino acids present in rTRPV2, together with four substitutions near the CBD sites (E570Q near CBD site 2, equivalent to Q530 in rTRPV2, and CBD site 1 residues M572V, C578L, M581L in TRPV1), and tested whether CBD had a stronger sensitizing effect in the resulting rTRPV1-12M channel. The sensitivity to 2-APB was highly disrupted in rTRPV2-12M channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), with a concentration of 12 mM 2-APB producing a similar extent of activation as 50 µM 2-APB in WT rTRPV1 channels relative to 10 µM capsaicin. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). In contrast to the heavily impaired sensitivity to 2-APB, sensitivity to CBD, and the magnitude of the sensitization caused by CBD appeared to be minimally affected relative to WT rTRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). Capsaicin sensitivity was also seemingly less affected, as we observed robust responses to a concentration of 10 µM that were much greater than those elicited by the highest concentration of 2-APB that we tested. Finally, we introduced two additional substitutions at the extracellular S6 loop (Y653L and D654R) of rTRPV1-12M channels, which are not conserved between rTRPV2, mTRPV3, and TRPV1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and found that the resulting channels, rTRPV1-14M, behaved very similarly to rTRPV1-12M channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Together, our results establish that differences in the amino acid sequence of the pore domain between the rTRPV2 and rTRPV1 channels are not responsible for the different sensitization strength caused by CBD binding in each of these two channels. These results also indicate that the determinants for sensitization strength must be located at other sites of the protein further from the CBD binding site(s).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cumulative substitutions at non-conserved positions in the rTRPV1 pore do not enhance sensitization.</title><p>Representative time courses for (<bold>A</bold>) rTRPV1-12M channels (E570Q + M572V + C578L + M581L + S592A + T593V + V595L + T597S + S632D + T633A + T650Q + I660L) or (<bold>B</bold>) rTRPV1-14M channels (E570Q + M572V + C578L + M581L + S592A + T593V + V595L + T597S + S632D + T633A + Y653L + D654R + T650Q + I660L) displaying sensitization by cannabidiol (CBD) of the response to 12 mM 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB).

Despite the low efficacy of CBD relative to 2-APB as an agonist of rTRPV2, rTRPV1, and mTRPV3 channels, CBD sensitized all three channels to subsequent activation by 2-APB. However, sensitization in rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 channels was orders of magnitude stronger than in rTRPV1 channels. Our cryo-EM structural data for the full-length rTRPV2 in the presence of CBD and 2-APB confirmed the location of the CBD binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pumroy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>) at the interface between the pore domain, the membrane and the S4-S5 linker helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and identified a second location where CBD or other small molecules could possibly bind. The regions where CBD binds in rTRPV2 channels are highly conserved between TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and our mutagenesis results with rTRPV1 and rTRPV2 channels establish that the few residues that are not conserved between these channels are not determinant for the strength of the sensitization caused by CBD binding. Based on these findings, we propose that CBD interacts at similar locations in TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels, and speculate that this may also apply to TRPV3 channels. In contrast to the CBD site, the 2-APB binding sites proposed based on observations in TRPV3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zubcevic et al., 2019</xref>) and TRPV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pumroy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2023</xref>) channel structures lack sequence conservation, suggesting that the energetics of activation by 2-APB could be very different in TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 channels, and could even involve distinct regions in each channel. Importantly, we observed no evidence for 2-APB-associated densities in our cryo-EM maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), calling for experimental clarification regarding the site or sites where 2-APB interacts with each of these channels.</p><p>We hypothesize that binding of CBD in rTRPV2 channels favors rearrangements on multiple sites in the protein that contribute energetically to activation by 2-APB without directly influencing the open-to-closed equilibrium because CBD is such a low-efficacy agonist. Because binding of CBD sensitizes responses to 2-APB in rTRPV1 and rTRPV2 channels, albeit with different strength, it can be predicted that mutations at the site where CBD binds would significantly affect sensitivity to 2-APB by means of allosteric coupling. Indeed, we found that each of the positions we substituted had a minor influence on the sensitivity of rTRPV1 and rTRPV2 channels to CBD and a stronger influence on the sensitivity to 2-APB; further, each of the rTRPV1 channel mutants we examined affected sensitivity to 2-APB more strongly than to capsaicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, rTRPV1 channels have an increased apparent affinity for 2-APB relative to rTRPV2 channels, with an EC<sub>50</sub> ~ 10-fold lower than that of rTRPV2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). It could thus be hypothesized that the absence of strong sensitization in rTRPV1 channels results from these channels already existing in a sensitized conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zubcevic et al., 2019</xref>). Our mutagenesis results, however, show that the apparent affinity for 2-APB and sensitization by CBD are not strictly coupled in rTRPV1 channels: mutant M572V had an EC<sub>50</sub> for 2-APB that is similar in magnitude to WT rTRPV2 channels, and yet sensitization by CBD was completely absent, whereas the apparent 2-APB affinity for the triple mutant rTRPV1-M572V+C578L+M581L was so low that an EC<sub>50</sub> could not be determined, and yet responses to 2-APB were sensitized by CBD to the same extent as in WT rTRPV1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Observations like this suggest a framework of TRPV channel function where the ensembles of conformational channel states stabilized by distinct agonists and allosteric modulators differ from each other at multiple significant locations throughout the protein, and that these differences, which could involve relatively subtle structural rearrangements, ultimately determine how the ensemble will respond to further challenges.</p><p>There appear to be many independent mechanisms through which TRPV2 channels can become sensitized to activation by 2-APB. Our results clearly indicate that sensitization caused by 2-APB itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>) is over an order of magnitude weaker than that caused by CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). This large difference suggests that the ensemble of conformations adopted by the rTRPV2 channel when bound to CBD must have energetically significant differences from the set of conformations that predominate after channels become sensitized by a strong stimulation with 2-APB. Sensitization by extreme heat increases the apparent affinity of rTRPV2 channels for 2-APB to a similar extent as CBD does, and also results in noticeable channel activity at ~40°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Qin, 2016</xref>). We did not detect rTPRV2 channel activity at ~40°C in the presence of CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that CBD binding is not strongly coupled to heat activation, and suggesting that the structural ensemble of heat-sensitized channels also bears significant differences at the energetic level from that of CBD-bound channels at temperatures below 40°C. Interestingly, oxidative modification of two methionine residues in rTRPV2 channels strongly sensitized their responses to both heat and 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fricke et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that methionine oxidation is less specific in its action than CBD, and suggesting that the underlying mechanism involves regions central to channel activation regardless of the stimulus.</p><p>In the case of mTRPV3 channels, we found that sensitization by 2-APB occurred much slower than by CBD, even when very high concentrations (3 mM) of 2-APB were used to pre-sensitize channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–K</xref>). However, we also observed that current activation kinetics in the presence of CBD + 2-APB were similar to those after 2-APB-dependent sensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H and K</xref>), suggesting that CBD-bound and 2-APB-sensitized apo mTRPV3 channels could adopt similar structural ensembles. It is unclear why CBD is so effective at sensitizing mTRPV3 channels without robustly activating them, whereas 2-APB can maximally activate channels but only after a slow sensitizing process – perhaps the CBD site is widely accessible in non-sensitized, apo mTRPV3 channels, whereas accessibility for 2-APB at the site that causes sensitization requires additional conformational rearrangements in the protein (and possibly the associated lipids; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2023</xref>). The binding of CBD could rapidly sensitize channels by promoting these latter rearrangements and allowing 2-APB to access its sensitizing site. Importantly, the remarkably potent effect of CBD on mTRPV3 channel activation establishes it as a promising experimental manipulation that can help understand the unique kinetic features that characterize TRPV3 channel activation.</p><p>It will be interesting to test whether other molecules in addition to CBD can have similar effects on the sensitivity of TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels to 2-APB and possibly other agonists, especially because both ion channels have few known activators, endogenous or synthetic. Future drug or activator screens for TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels could benefit from combining test drugs together with low doses of 2-APB or CBD to determine whether nonlinear additivity between ligands is a more general feature in these proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) from ATCC (CRL-1573) were kept at 37°C in an atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with high glucose, pyruvate, L-glutamine, and phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (vol/vol) and 10 mg/mL gentamicin. For transfection, cells were detached with trypsin, resuspended in DMEM, and seeded onto No. 1 glass coverslips in 3 mL dishes at 10–40% confluency. Transfections were performed on the same day using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science, Madison, WI).

Electrophysiological recordings were done 18–36 hr after transfection. Cells tested negative for Mycoplasma infection, and were not authenticated; cell type is not critical for this study, as the most relevant aspect concerning our observations is that there are no contaminating currents that might me confounded for the TRPV1, TRPV2, or TRPV3 channels studied here.

Data were acquired with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and digitized with a Digidata1550B interface and pClamp10 software (Molecular Devices). All data were analyzed using Igor Pro 8.04 (Wavemetrics, Portland, OR). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm O.D. × 0.86 mm I.D. × 75 mm L; Harvard Apparatus) using a Sutter P-97 puller and heat-polished to final resistances between 0.5 and 4 MΩ using a MF-200 microforge (World Precision Instruments). 90% series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>) compensation was applied in all whole-cell recordings except those involving changes in temperature. An agar bridge (1 M KCl; 4% weight/vol agar; teflon tubing) was used to connect the ground electrode chamber and the main recording chamber.</p><p>The extracellular solution consisted of (mM) 130 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.4 (NaOH/HCl). The same solution was used as the intracellular recording solution except for the addition of 10 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, which was included to block endogenous inward-rectifying and low-threshold temperature-sensitive currents that were observed in some recordings. Stocks of 2-APB (1 M; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), CBD (10 mM; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) were prepared using DMSO, and capsaicin stock solutions (100 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared in ethanol. 2-APB stocks were prepared fresh every day, and CBD stocks were aliquoted and stored at –20°C, and diluted in recording solution immediately prior to recordings. The effective concentration of 2-APB in some of the most concentrated recording solutions that we used might be overestimated because they were close to the solubility limit of the compound. Probenecid stock solution (100 mM) was made in 1 M NaOH, and used at a final concentration of 100 µM in recording solution. We verified the pH of solutions using pH-indicator paper.</p><p>Whole-cell and excised-patch data using gap-free recordings were acquired at 5 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Current–voltage (I–V) relations were acquired at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, and were obtained by applying 300-ms-long voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 mV with a frequency of 1 Hz. Test pulses went from –100 to +100 mV in 10 mV increments. In all experiments at room temperature, a gravity-fed perfusion system (RSC-200, BioLogic, France) was used, in which outlets of glass capillaries were placed right in front of the recorded cells, and a motorized holder was used to switch between tube outlets. For rTRPV2 channel concentration–response relations for CBD and 2-APB in the presence and absence of CBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), we did not subtract background currents from the plotted data, which we normalized to the maximal concentration of either CBD (40 µM), 2-APB (4 mM), or 2-APB (4 mM) + 10 µM CBD. For the dose–response relations for WT and mutant rTRPV1 and rTRPV2 channels, as well as group data from gap-free recordings and measurements of sensitization, we subtracted the background currents measured in the absence of stimuli from the test currents before normalization. For normalization of the dose–response relations for 2-APB in some of the mutants, we used the concentration that yielded maximal currents because we observed pronounced channel desensitization at the highest concentrations in some of the mutants. Mean time courses of mTRPV3 channel activation were obtained by aligning currents from each experiment to the time in which cells were exposed to 2-APB for a second time (i.e. after the first exposure of 10 s duration that was used for normalization), segmented into intervals of 1.4 s duration (i.e. 7000 data points), normalized, and averaged. All group data are shown as mean ± SEM.</p><p>For single-channel recordings in the inside-out configuration, we acquired data at 10 kHz, low-pass filtered at 2 kHz, and we covered pipettes with dental wax to reduce capacitive transients and used pipettes with open tip resistances between 4 and 10 MΩ. Holding voltage was –80 mV, and 500 ms sweeps were recorded with a 100 ms inter-sweep interval, with 50 sweeps per patch in either control, 2-APB or CBD, and 2-APB and CBD applied together. All recorded traces were baseline-subtracted so that the mean current value in the absence of opening events was centered at 0 pA. The all-points histograms containing data from all sweeps per patch and experimental condition were normalized to the number of points at the peak centered at 0 pA and binned using 0.2 pA intervals.</p><p>Experiments involving temperature increases were carried out using a custom-built device as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Islas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sánchez-Moreno et al., 2018</xref>), which consists of using a wire-based microheater enclosed in a glass pipette for insulation and connected to a power source for heating. For our device, we used 0.1 mm diameter nichrome wire connected to a Keysight Technologies (Santa Rosa, CA) E3631A Triple Output DC Power Supply. Maximum output was utilized from the power supply, which was approximately 6 V and 0.74 A. The wire was introduced into a glass capillary pipette, which was bent to a U-shape using a flame. The U-shaped pipette with the wire inside connected to the power source was held on a micro-manipulator and placed right in front of the patch pipette inside the recording chamber. To estimate the changes in temperature achieved by our heating device, we used the resistance measured from an open patch pipette, whose resistance measurements as a function of heating were previously calibrated by exchanging the recording bath with solutions at multiple temperatures, which we measured with a thermistor (Warner TC-324B, Hamden, CT) placed close to the pipette tip inside the bath. The heating device was then placed at a defined distance from the same pipette tip and the pipette resistance measured after turning the power supply on with maximal output for 90 s.

Images were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios equipped with a Gatan LS image energy filter (slit width, 20 eV) operating at 300 kV. A Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector was used to record movies in superresolution mode with a nominal magnification of ×105,000,, resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 0.415 Å per pixel. The typical defocus values ranged from −0.5 to −1.5 μm. Exposures of 1.6 s were dose-fractionated into 32 frames, resulting in a total dose of 52 <italic>e</italic><sup>−</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup>. Images were recorded using the automated acquisition program SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image processing</title><p>All processing was completed in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>). The beam-induced image motion between frames of each dose-fractionated micrograph was corrected and binned by 2 using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Micrographs were selected, and those with outliers in defocus value and astigmatism, as well as low resolution (&gt;5 Å) reported by CTFFIND4 were removed. The initial set of particles from 300 micrographs were picked using Gautomatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/zhang-software/#gauto">www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/locally-developed-software/zhang-software/#gauto)</ext-link> and followed by reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification in RELION. The good classes were then used as template to pick particles from all selected micrographs using Gautomatch. Particles (1,665,271) were picked and extracted with 2× downscaling (pixel size, 1.66 Å). Several rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed to remove ice spot, contaminants, and bad particles. The good particles were 3D classified with C4 symmetry using reference generated by 3D initial model. Good class (380,829) were then selected and reextracted without binning (pixel size, 0.83 Å) followed by 3D auto-refine. After that, the refined particles were expanded from C4 symmetry to C1 symmetry and then subjected to 3D Classification (skip alignment) with transmembrane domain mask. Six classes show one CBD binding site in each monomer (conformation A) and one class shows two CBD binding sites per monomer (conformation B). Particles (1,370,377) from these six classes were combined and duplication was removed. Finally, 321,717 unique particles were obtained and submitted to final step of 3D auto-refine with C4 symmetry. Particles (43,071) from conformation B were selected by removing duplication followed by 3D auto-refine. The final reconstruction was reported at 3.23 Å for conformation A and 3.32 Å for conformation B.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Model building and structure refinement</title><p>Model building was first carried out by manually fitting the monomer of rTRPV2 (PDB 6U84) into the electron microscopy density map using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including László Csanády as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wei Lü (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors obtained ligand densities at positions different from those observed in previous TRPV2 studies. Therefore, given that their structures were obtained under different experimental conditions, it seems inappropriate to use previously published apo structures as a control. It is therefore essential to obtain an apo rTRPV2 structure as a control, to support the assignment of the observed ligand densities.</p><p>2. The authors have identified two distinct CBD binding sites, but the manuscript does not discuss the functional roles of those sites. Two of the positions they have targeted so far (L538, L541) seem to be part of the single CBD site observed in conformation A, whereas the third position (M532) is near the internal CBD site but the side chain is pointing in the opposite direction. A more systematic screening of the two CBD binding sites through electrophysiological assessment of mutants seems essential to evaluate the roles of both sites, specifically to investigate whether both sites are necessary for the observed sensitization of TRPV2 by CBD.</p><p>3. There is a strong density within the S1-S4 domain. That density was not modeled in the structure and is not mentioned in the manuscript. Is it possible that this density represents a bound 2-APB molecule? Although a complete 2-APB molecule cannot fit into the density, a portion of 2-APB could reasonably fit, leaving for example one of the phenyl groups outside of the density, potentially due to its high flexibility. Such a possibility would be further supported if the density didn't show up in the apo structure (see 1. above). In that case, studying the residues around it by targeted mutagenesis and patch clamp electrophysiology would be recommended.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a few formal comments regarding data display that the authors may consider.</p><p>Figures 1G (bottom right), 1H, 4F, 4K (right), Figure 7C, Figure 6 – Figure Suppl. 1F-G:</p><p>Bar charts with logarithmic ordinates should perhaps be replaced by dot plots (the bar representation is visually misleading, as the plotted bar height is arbitrary…)</p><p>Figure 2: The heat-map representations of Po and amplitude histograms are unusual.

There is a strong density within the S1-S4 domain. This density was not modeled in the structure and is not mentioned in the manuscript. Is it possible that this density represents a bound 2-APB molecule? Although a complete 2-APB molecule cannot fit into the density, a portion of 2-APB could reasonably fit, leaving for example one of the phenyl groups outside of the density, potentially due to its high flexibility. It is worth noting that the hydrophobic tails of the two CBD molecules in this study also lack densities, which should be acknowledged in the manuscript. While I highly recommend further investigation of the nature of this density by studying the residues around it using patch clamp electrophysiology, it's up to the authors to decide whether they want to do this.</p><p>2. The authors generated mutants in residues that are close to the CBD binding sites to investigate the mechanism of CBD-dependent sensitization. It should be noted that V352, one of the mutated residues, is not in direct contact with CBD, and is actually located on the opposite side of the S5 helix from the CBD binding site. On the other hand, V352 faces (but does not form direct contact with) the proposed 2-APB binding site by Pumroy et al. 2022, although a 2-APB molecule is not unambiguously supported by the density in that study, as noted by the authors of this manuscript. Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting the electrophysiology data of the V532 mutant.</p><p>3. It is interesting to note that the authors have identified two distinct CBD binding sites. However, the manuscript does not discuss the functional roles of these sites. It would be informative to investigate whether both sites are necessary for the observed sensitization of TRPV2 by CBD, which would provide a more detailed understanding of the mechanism by which CBD sensitizes TRPV2.</p><p>4. Although the nominal resolution of conformation A is higher than that of conformation B, it is clear that the map quality of B is substantially higher than that of A. This should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>5. The authors discussed three possibilities as to why the extracellular CBD site is present in more protein particles than the intracellular CBD site. However, it is also possible (perhaps more likely) that the difference is caused by delipidation since an important part of the intracellular CBD binding site is formed by a lipid molecule that was modeled in the structure. The identity of this lipid is unclear and may be missing in the lipid mixture used for nanodisc reconstitution. In fact, the authors assigned the lipid as phosphatidylinositol, which was not added in their nanodisc reconstitution.</p><p>6. The description of how conformations A and B were obtained reads a bit confusing. The text suggests B was obtained by further classification of particles used to refine A. But Figure 3 – —figure supplement 2 implies that both conformations were obtained in the same TMD-focused classification. Furthermore, it is unclear why the first three gray classes in the TMD-focused classification were shown twice in Figure 3 – —figure supplement 2.</p><p>7. The visual representation of Figure 4K and 6G can be improved for better readability. Similarly, in Figure 3B, the two CBD molecules and the lipid molecule should be labeled for easy identification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Essential additions for presented experiments:</p><p>• Obtain control structures of TRPV2 under the following conditions: apo, in the presence of only CBD, in the presence of only 2-APB. As the authors got a different result in their structure with 2-APB and CBD from previous work, they must do controls to show how their preparation of TRPV2 behaves as a baseline and how each individual drug impacts the channel. They report no density for 2-APB in their structures, but it remains possible that 2-APB on its own may cause conformation changes. Additionally, these controls would show whether 2-APB is necessary for the second 2-APB site to be accessible.</p><p>• As one of the TRPV2 mutation sites (V532M) showed no response to either 2-APB or CBD, the authors should do controls to determine via other stimuli whether the loss of response is specific to these drugs or due to a dead channel.</p><p>Technical/Presentation Issues:</p><p>• As a technical note for the structural work, the pixel size of the cryo-EM maps is incorrect. When compared to the 2019 and 2022 maps of TRPV2 with CBD and maps of apo TRPV1, the maps from this paper were noticeably larger. A crude scaling based on a structure of the TRPV2 ankyrin repeat domains obtained by x-ray crystallography suggests that the correct pixel size is around 0.83 Å/pix rather than 0.86 Å/pix, a significant difference in scale that needs to be corrected.</p><p>• The authors have assigned the extra densities in the vanilloid pocket in their conformation B as a π lipid and CBD. They should provide figures showing the fit of these molecules as well as other possibilities, specifically other lipid headgroups such as PC for the lipid density and 2-APB for the CBD density. Given the conical rather than flat shape of the headgroup density and the incorrect scale of the map, it seems unlikely that the lipid in conformation B is PI.</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>• This paper seems to be pulling in two directions at once. On one hand, the stated goal of the paper is an investigation into the mechanisms of TRPV2 sensitization by CBD, on the other hand, the authors seem primarily interested in investigating it only from the perspective of how the group of TRPV1-TRPV3 responds to the same form of sensitization. I think the authors should pick one direction and stick with it. If they want to focus on TRPV2, they could examine TRPV2 orthologs and/or examine how CBD sensitization interacts with the other reported forms of sensitization. Alternatively, they could do a more in-depth comparative examination of the response of TRPV1-3 to CBD and 2-APB, ideally including more structural work. With either of these approaches, even if the authors are ultimately unable to track down the exact molecular basis of sensitization, they would at least have produced data that can be meaningfully interpreted for future studies on the topic.</p><p>• Throughout the entire paper, the authors use a single orthologue of three different channels, rat for TRPV1 and TRPV2, and mouse for TRPV3. If the author's interest is in tracking down the mechanisms of channel sensitization, it might be a more productive approach to examine several orthologues of the same channel to see if there are varying degrees of sensitization by CBD, a feasible possibility as TRPV2 orthologs are known to respond to 2-APB differently. That would significantly reduce variables when introducing mutations to test the effect on channel sensitization. An approach like this was successfully used to examine heat desensitization of TRPV1 (Luo, Wang, Li, et al., Nat Commun 2019).</p><p>• Zubcevic et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2019 did a very nice job of tracing channel hysteresis to the conformation of the C-terminal loop and showed that the channel could be rendered completely sensitized to 2-APB by disrupting a single salt bridge with either K169A or E751A. This was tied to structural work showing a change in channel conformation, and the presence of density for 2-APB, in a structure with that mutation. This work is directly relevant to the observations in this paper, particularly as TRPV2 conserves those two residues and the conformational range at the C-terminus as observed in TRPV3. The authors may wish to investigate how this mutation interacts with 2-APB and CBD sensitization – is TRPV2 sensitized to the same extent as TRPV3 with this mutation? Does CBD still further sensitize either TRPV2 or TRPV3 with this mutation?</p><p>• Work in Mo et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2022 showed that Tyr phosphorylation can also sensitize TRPV2. The authors should mention this in their paper and may wish to investigate how this form of sensitization, as well as the methionine oxidation sensitization they already mention in the text, interacts with CBD sensitization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86166.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The only assignments of ligand densities we report here are for CBD. Under our experimental conditions, the majority of picked particles represent conformation A, which is practically identical (RSMD 0.647 Å) to the previous structure of rTRPV2 bound to CBD (PDB:6U88) and shows an equivalent non-protein density within the CBD site. A smaller fraction of our particles represents a newly observed conformation (conformation B), which nonetheless also has a non-protein density within the previously identified CBD binding site that is fully consistent with the assigned ligand. Together, our observations provide strong support for the previously proposed location of the CBD binding site, which was one of our stated goals for obtaining structural information.</p><p>Our map of conformation B contains an additional non-protein density that we assigned to CBD. We have now expanded Figure 3 to more clearly show the two densities we assigned to CBD and show how the density is better fit by CBD than 2-APB. As pointed out by reviewer 2, the two densities we assign to CBD in conformation B are higher quality compared to conformation A (and when compared to previously published CBD densities). In the revised manuscript we now more clearly articulate why we think the new density corresponds to CBD.</p><p>We also observed potentially interesting non-protein densities at other sites in the protein, which we did not assign, including a density within the S1-S4 domain. We agree that having our own apo structures might have allowed us to assign some of these densities. However, we carefully inspected all the previously published maps and found that contrary to the CBD-assigned density in conformation B, which is unique to our map, the rest of the unassigned densities can also be observed in several published TRPV2 structures, including an apo map (PDB:6U84, EMD-20677), a CBD-bound map (PDB:6U8A, EMD-20686) and a 2-APB bound map (PDB:7N0M, EMD-24109), suggesting that they do not represent CBD or 2-APB. We have modified Figure 3 – Figure Supp 5 to add a direct comparison with previous structures for the extra density within the S1-S4 domain, which are indistinguishable from ours.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, our interrogation of the previously published site did not help to localize determinants that explain the differential sensitivity between TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels to CBD, diminishing our enthusiasm for further interrogation of the new site.</p><p>We found that mutations at position V532 (in TRPV2) and M572 (in TRPV1) had the most marked effects of all mutations on the observed currents activated by 2-APB, completely ablating currents in the case of TRPV2 and dramatically reducing both the apparent affinity for 2-APB and the sensitization caused by CBD in the case of TRPV1. There is no structural evidence suggesting that 2-APB or CBD interact directly with the side-chains at V532 or M572, so the effect of mutations at that those sites must be allosteric. Even if mutations introduced at the second tentative CBD site were shown to affect CBD-dependent sensitization of 2-APB responses in TRPV2 channels, it would be impossible to determine whether the observed effect of the mutation is due to an allosteric effect or a direct disruption of the interaction between the channel and the CBD molecule. Further, it seems unlikely that structural determinants in that region are responsible for the large sensitizing effect of CBD on rTRPV2 vs the small effect on rTRPV1, since mutations at all non-conserved residues (including E570Q near the second CBD site) failed to confer a gain-of- function phenotype to TRPV1 (see Figure 7B).</p><p>We tested the strength of CBD-dependent sensitization in two TRPV2 mutants containing single residue substitutions at positions near the second CBD site, rTRPV2+Q530A and rTRV2+Q530G (new Figure 6—figure supplementFigure Suppl. 3), and found them to be indistinguishable from WT. We have modified the text to make it clearer that the functional relevance for the second CBD site remains unknown, but we still consider it noteworthy as an observation because of the possibility that other molecules, including endogenous ligands, could regulate channel function by interacting with that site. We also agree that thorough exploration of the role of the S4-S5 linker region on 2-APB and CBD sensitivity in TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels is warranted, but we consider this to be beyond the scope of this work. We think this body of work still makes an important contribution to the field and as both reviewer 1 and 2 state, the data presented supports the key conclusions we have formulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We think this is appropriate because most recordings under all conditions except in the presence of 2- APB+CBD lack any channel openings, precluding quantitation of the NPo. We believe that the heat maps most clearly show that channel openings are almost exclusively observed when CBD and 2-APB are applied together in rTRPV2-transfected cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: In all panels please indicate the channel construct used (rTRPV1 or mTRPV3)</p><p>Figure 4J: Please indicate voltage also for the second part of the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4K left: Please indicate in the legend what the magenta symbols represent.

The slow and fast time-constants obtained from these fits are shown on Figure 4K in yellow and magenta, respectively. In the first stimulation both the fast and slow time- constants take similar values, indicating an absence of sensitized channels because cells have not yet been exposed to agonist. After a single stimulation with 2-APB, the fast time-constant adopts values similar to those obtained from mono-exponential fits to currents elicited by 2-APB in combination with CBD – this fast time-constant likely originates from the fraction of channels in the cell that have become sensitized by 2-APB. We think that the slow time constant reflects the slow process of sensitization by 2-APB. Consistently, the slow time-constants obtained from fits to individual stimulations with 2-APB are similar to the values obtained from mono-exponential fits to the time course spanning the entire experiment. Together these data indicate that channels activate fast when sensitized by either 2-APB or 2-APB + CBD, but the latter experimental condition allows channels to reach the sensitized state much more rapidly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6G: This 2-D graph with two different axes for each dimension and two types of symbols for each of these axes is impenetrable.

As pointed out by reviewer 2, the two densities we assign to CBD in conformation B are higher quality compared to conformation A (and when compared to previously published CBD densities) In the revised manuscript text we now more clearly articulate why we think the new density corresponds to CBD.</p><p>We also observed potentially interesting non-protein densities at other sites in the protein, which we did not assign, including a density within the S1-S4 domain. We agree that having our own apo structures might have allowed us to assign some of these densities. However, we carefully inspected all the previously published maps and found that contrary to the CBD-assigned density in conformation B, which is unique to our map, the rest of the unassigned densities can also be observed in several published TRPV2 structures, including an apo map (PDB:6U84, EMD-20677), a CBD-bound map (PDB:6U8A, EMD-20686) and a 2-APB bound map (PDB:7N0M, EMD-24109), suggesting that they do not represent CBD or 2-APB. We have modified Figure 3 – Figure Supp 5 to add a direct comparison with previous structures for the extra density within the S1-S4 domain, which are indistinguishable from ours.</p><p>Finally, we agree with the reviewer that with our dataset it is not possible to establish whether the distinct structural properties of conformation B were induced by binding to CBD or 2-APB. However, we argue that structures without ligands or with single ligands would also not address this conclusively: conformation B was not observed in previous structural studies of TRPV2 in the presence of 2-APB and CBD, so if we obtained structures in the apo state or in the presence of single ligands and failed to observe conformation B, this would not preclude that conformation B can be adopted under either of those conditions. Conversely, observing conformation B in the presence of just one of the ligands would not rule out that binding of the other ligand can also stabilize conformation B. Importantly, both conformations A and B are likely to represent desensitized states; regardless of the mechanistic origin of their structural differences, the general significance of conformational changes between desensitized states remains almost entirely unknown. Addressing this last point is beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• As one of the TRPV2 mutation sites (V532M) showed no response to either 2-APB or CBD, the authors should do controls to determine via other stimuli whether the loss of response is specific to these drugs or due to a dead channel.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data does not allow us to determine whether V532M channels can still respond to other stimuli. However, we consider that having that information would not have an impact on the main conclusions of the manuscript; our data establishes that position V532 is very important for channel operation, either by controlling a key step in the folding or trafficking process, or for responding to 2-APB and CBD once channels localize to the membrane. Regardless, our results establish that the identity of the residue at this position is not responsible for determining the difference in sensitization strength between rTRPV1 and rTRPV2 channels; a mutation in the equivalent position in TRPV1 results in a dramatic decrease in the apparent affinity for 2-APB, and a lesser, yet measurable reduction in the sensitivity to capsaicin, without an effect on channel trafficking. Importantly, the M572V mutation in TRPV1 does not increase the strength of sensitization by CBD, but rather further decreases sensitization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical/Presentation Issues:</p><p>• As a technical note for the structural work, the pixel size of the cryo-EM maps is incorrect. When compared to the 2019 and 2022 maps of TRPV2 with CBD and maps of apo TRPV1, the maps from this paper were noticeably larger. A crude scaling based on a structure of the TRPV2 ankyrin repeat domains obtained by x-ray crystallography suggests that the correct pixel size is around 0.83 Å/pix rather than 0.86 Å/pix, a significant difference in scale that needs to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this. We had used an earlier calibration and the more recent calibration of 0.83Å/pix is indeed correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors have assigned the extra densities in the vanilloid pocket in their conformation B as a π lipid and CBD. They should provide figures showing the fit of these molecules as well as other possibilities, specifically other lipid headgroups such as PC for the lipid density and 2-APB for the CBD density. Given the conical rather than flat shape of the headgroup density and the incorrect scale of the map, it seems unlikely that the lipid in conformation B is PI.</p></disp-quote><p>After obtaining the new map under 0.83 Å/pix, we found that the density for the headgroup of lipid resembled a PC lipid rather than a π lipid. We have added the requested figure as Figure 3E and F. Our assignment is tentative, and we have rewritten this section to be clear that another type of lipid could be bound to this site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions:</p><p>• This paper seems to be pulling in two directions at once. On one hand, the stated goal of the paper is an investigation into the mechanisms of TRPV2 sensitization by CBD, on the other hand, the authors seem primarily interested in investigating it only from the perspective of how the group of TRPV1-TRPV3 responds to the same form of sensitization. I think the authors should pick one direction and stick with it. If they want to focus on TRPV2, they could examine TRPV2 orthologs and/or examine how CBD sensitization interacts with the other reported forms of sensitization. Alternatively, they could do a more in-depth comparative examination of the response of TRPV1-3 to CBD and 2-APB, ideally including more structural work. With either of these approaches, even if the authors are ultimately unable to track down the exact molecular basis of sensitization, they would at least have produced data that can be meaningfully interpreted for future studies on the topic.</p><p>• Throughout the entire paper, the authors use a single orthologue of three different channels, rat for TRPV1 and TRPV2, and mouse for TRPV3. If the author's interest is in tracking down the mechanisms of channel sensitization, it might be a more productive approach to examine several orthologues of the same channel to see if there are varying degrees of sensitization by CBD, a feasible possibility as TRPV2 orthologs are known to respond to 2-APB differently. That would significantly reduce variables when introducing mutations to test the effect on channel sensitization. An approach like this was successfully used to examine heat desensitization of TRPV1 (Luo, Wang, Li, et al., Nat Commun 2019).</p><p>• Zubcevic et al., eLife 2019 did a very nice job of tracing channel hysteresis to the conformation of the C-terminal loop and showed that the channel could be rendered completely sensitized to 2-APB by disrupting a single salt bridge with either K169A or E751A. This was tied to structural work showing a change in channel conformation, and the presence of density for 2-APB, in a structure with that mutation. This work is directly relevant to the observations in this paper, particularly as TRPV2 conserves those two residues and the conformational range at the C-terminus as observed in TRPV3. The authors may wish to investigate how this mutation interacts with 2-APB and CBD sensitization – is TRPV2 sensitized to the same extent as TRPV3 with this mutation? Does CBD still further sensitize either TRPV2 or TRPV3 with this mutation?</p><p>• Work in Mo et al., eLife 2022 showed that Tyr phosphorylation can also sensitize TRPV2. The authors should mention this in their paper and may wish to investigate how this form of sensitization, as well as the methionine oxidation sensitization they already mention in the text, interacts with CBD sensitization.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all excellent suggestions for extending our work. We agree with some of the stated shortcomings of our study, and we have tried to revise the manuscript to improve/clarify the presentation and we have commented on this reviewer’s idea that differences in the binding site for 2-APB could be responsible for the different sensitization strength observed between TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels. With all due respect however, we think our study provides valuable new findings that need to be considered in future studies. Our structural data alone are the highest quality data for CBD, we identify a real issue concerning previous assignments of 2-APB, by pointing towards densities that are also present in apo datasets in the absence of 2-APB, and we provide a thorough characterization for how CBD sensitizes TRPV channels. The sensitizing effect of CBD on TRPV1 and TRPV3 channels had not been previously reported. In this regard, we want to bring attention to the robustness of our observations and the magnitude of the effect that we describe: the sensitization caused by CBD in rTRPV2 and mTRPV3 is massive, whereas that observed in TRPV1 is at least one order of magnitude weaker. Robust effects like this are ideal for mechanistic investigation because interpretation of results can be unambiguous – we therefore think that focusing on the differences that we highlight here between the three channels offers a promising path for uncovering fundamental differences in the way each of these channels work. Our data already establishes that the CBD site is not responsible for the differences in sensitization strength between the distinct TRPV channels, and that other sites, possibly including the 2-APB interaction site(s), must be responsible for the observed differences. In addition, our observations are relevant because of the limited number of available stimuli that can robustly activate TRPV2 and TRPV3 channels, which otherwise require 2-APB concentrations close to its solubility limit to reach maximal activation.</p><p>Finally, we also recognize that rTRPV2 channels have multiple mechanisms of sensitization (heat, oxidation of methionine residues, phosphorylation, likely others) in addition to the one we describe here caused by CBD. The allosteric nature of these receptors strongly suggests that each of these sensitizing mechanisms will have various degrees of mechanistic overlap (in the end, each one of them will affect opening and closing of the pore gate) – disentangling these mechanisms in terms of defined conformational changes is one of the current goals of our research program. However, we are aware of the complexities that this would entail, and that the amount of work required to achieve this goal is well beyond the scope of any singular publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
