core of the nucleosome known as the tetrasome. How CAF-1 ensures there is sufficient space for the assembly of tetrasomes remains unknown. Structural and biophysical characterization of the lysine/glutamic acid/arginine-rich (KER) region of CAF-1 revealed a 128-Å single alpha-helix (SAH) motif with unprecedented DNA-binding properties. Distinct KER sequence features and length of the SAH drive the selectivity of CAF-1 for tetrasome-length DNA and facilitate function in budding yeast. In vivo, the KER cooperates with the DNA-binding winged helix domain in CAF-1 to overcome DNA damage sensitivity and maintain silencing of gene expression. We propose that the KER SAH links functional domains within CAF-1 with structural precision, acting as a DNA-binding spacer element during chromatin assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone chaperone</kwd><kwd>DNA binding</kwd><kwd>nucleosome assembly</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM135604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchill</surname><given-names>Mair EA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM134918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Duncan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA95641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM139816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aguilar</surname><given-names>Rhiannon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM64475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD012033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchill</surname><given-names>Mair EA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019346</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH P30 CA046934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churchill</surname><given-names>Mair EA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lysine/glutamic acid/arginine region in chromatin assembly factor (CAF-1) forms a long single alpha-helix DNA-binding domain, facilitating the recognition of tetrasome-length DNA and linking functional domains within the CAF-1 architecture for efficient tetrasome assembly after DNA synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, dynamic local and global chromatin structures regulate accessibility to the genome for all DNA-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yadav et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>). The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of chromatin, comprising two H3/H4 and two H2A/H2B histone dimers wrapped by approximately 147 bp of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). DNA replication requires the disassembly of parental nucleosomes, followed by a highly regulated dynamic assembly process for recycling of parental histones and depositing nascent histones onto the newly replicated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Stillman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escobar et al., 2021</xref>). The histone chaperone chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) facilitates the dimerization of nascent H3/H4 dimers onto replicated DNA, forming the subnucleosomal structure known as the tetrasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In multicellular organisms, the essential functions of CAF-1 are required for the maintenance of epigenetic landscapes and gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheloufi and Hochedlinger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2018</xref>). How CAF-1 deposits H3/H4 at sites of DNA synthesis remains largely unknown. However, the identification of functional domains within CAF-1 has provided significant insight. Three subunits, Cac1, Cac2, and Cac3, form the CAF-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>). Central to the localization of CAF-1 to replicated DNA are interactions with the replisome through PCNA interacting peptides (PIP box) in the Cac1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krawitz et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, the DNA-binding function of the winged helix domain (WHD) located in Cac1 contributes to the recruitment of CAF-1 to sites of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>DNA-binding studies of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CAF-1 (yCAF-1) revealed a preference for binding to DNA that is at least 40 bp long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>)<italic>,</italic> which is slightly less than the length of DNA needed to form a tetrasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donham et al., 2011</xref>). As the WHD binds to short (10–16 bp) DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>), it is unlikely to confer this DNA-length dependence to CAF-1 or allow for sufficient spacing for the assembly of tetrasomes in vivo. However, the lysine/glutamic acid/arginine-rich (KER) region of the Cac1 subunit has been implicated as a possible second DNA-binding domain (DBD), as CAF-1 lacking the WHD could still bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>). Whether the KER cooperates with the WHD or PIP box to recruit CAF-1 to sites of DNA synthesis, contributes to the length-dependent DNA recognition of CAF-1, or has other biological roles remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we characterized the KER region of yCAF-1 using biophysical, structural, and functional approaches in vitro and in budding yeast. The crystal structure of the KER and DNA-binding experiments revealed a novel single alpha-helix (SAH) domain with DNA-binding ability that we found drives the selectivity of yCAF-1 for tetrasome-length DNA. Features of the structure and sequence of the KER SAH required for DNA binding were defined. In yeast, the KER structure is important for CAF-1-mediated chromatin assembly through cooperation with the WHD during DNA damage repair and gene silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The KER is a major DBD in CAF-1 that cooperates with the WHD in vivo</title><p>The previously observed DNA-length preference of yCAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>) cannot be explained by the DNA-binding properties of the WHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether the KER promotes this DNA-length preference, we first expressed and purified recombinant tri-subunit yCAF-1, and the isolated domains KER (Cac1 residues 136–225, yKER), and WHD (Cac1 residues 457–606, yWHD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2a–c</xref>). Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) we measured the binding affinity for each protein to DNA fragments of different lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a, b</xref>). To determine the DNA-binding affinities, the EMSA images were quantitated and the resulting binding curves fitted with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j, k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c</xref>), which gave values for the dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) and cooperativity (Hill coefficient, <italic>h</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). yCAF-1 and the isolated domains bound to DNA with the appearance of a ladder of bands, especially for the yKER that has the largest number of bands, which are related to the length of the DNA fragment (20, 30, 40, and 80 bp). These results indicate that multiple proteins bind to a single DNA fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–i</xref>) and the Hill coefficients suggest a cooperative mode of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). For DNA of the same length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>), the yKER had <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values between 18 and 50 nM, whereas the yWHD bound three to six times more weakly. yCAF-1 had <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values between those observed for the yKER and the yWHD, except for weaker binding to the 30-bp DNA fragment (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 330 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). This analysis shows that yCAF-1 has a higher affinity for DNA fragments in the range of 50–80 bp, which are DNA lengths considered to be sufficient for tetrasome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donham et al., 2011</xref>).

These results suggest a role of the KER independent of recruitment of CAF-1 to the replisome via the PIP box.</p><p>CAF-1 function can influence cellular gene expression profiles, presumably by the deposition of nascent nucleosomes that promote the reestablishment of chromatin landscapes post-DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2016</xref>). To investigate the role of the KER in this process, we used strains with a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) reporter in the <italic>HMR</italic> mating-type locus of budding yeast.

Almost 100% of <italic>sir2∆</italic> cells exhibited GFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>). Consistent with the CPT and Zeocin sensitivity assays, we found that ∆KER, mWHD, and mPIP cells had low expression of GFP. As previously reported, a high percentage of <italic>cac1</italic>∆<italic>rtt106</italic>∆ cells have increased GFP expression and mPIP+mWHD cells have a comparable level of GFP expression, suggesting a near-total loss of CAF-1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). No increase in GFP expression is seen in response to combined ∆KER+mPIP cells when compared to mPIP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1o</xref>). In contrast, ∆KER+mWHD cells had GFP expression, similar to <italic>cac1</italic>∆<italic>rtt106</italic>∆ cells, suggesting a near-complete loss of CAF-1 function. Finally, to assess the impact of deleting the KER more directly on nucleosome assembly in vivo, we examined histone deposition onto Okazaki fragments during DNA replication as we have shown previously that the length of Okazaki fragment lengths is determined by histone deposition into nucleosomes and is disrupted upon deletion of <italic>CAC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>). We compared CAF-1 mutants in the WT yeast background and in yeast lacking Rtt106. We found that the Okazaki fragment length distributions of the ∆KER mutant were indistinguishable from that of WT while that of <italic>cac1∆</italic> was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3g</xref>). That we did not detect effects on Okazaki fragment lengths for the yCAF-1 mutants lacking the intact KER is consistent with the results of the viability and silencing assays for KER mutants, which also retained the WHD. Strikingly, the Okazaki fragments from <italic>rtt106∆ cac1∆</italic> yeast were highly disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3g</xref>) further highlighting the redundancy between Rtt106 and Cac1 for assembling histones onto newly replicated DNA. Together, these results suggest that yCAF-1 requires the coordinated action of the KER and WHD to prevent DNA damage sensitivity and maintain silencing of chromatin in vivo. Since both the KER and the WHD bind to DNA, they might have overlapping yet complementary functions in targeting or aligning CAF-1 correctly to the DNA during nucleosome assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The KER is a first-in-class SAH DBD</title><p>To gain insight into how the KER region binds to DNA and facilitates CAF-1 function in vivo, we determined the structure of the yKER at 2.81 Å resolution.

Superposition of the four KER copies gives root mean square deviation (RMSD) values between 0.66 and 2.2 Å, as the helices have a marked curvature in the region of aa 165–190 and larger deviations at the termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Inspection of the sequence of the yKER reveals a pattern of opposite-charged residues, lysine/arginine and glutamic acid, that are three or four residues apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), capable of forming an ion pair network.

Furthermore, chemical crosslinking with disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) showed no evidence of KER multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), supporting the conclusion that the yKER does not form a tertiary structure. In contrast, in the presence of 40 bp DNA, the thermal denaturation of the yKER showed an increase of 10°C in the melting temperature and a two-state cooperative unfolding transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which demonstrates the ability of the yKER to form a stably folded protein–DNA complex. The monomeric state of the yKER also suggests that the additional yKER–DNA complexes observed in the EMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–i</xref>) are due to the addition of yKER monomers to the same molecule of DNA. This was substantiated through use of a heterogenous subunit EMSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hope and Struhl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gangelhoff et al., 2009</xref>) with the yKER, MBP-yKER, and a combination of the two proteins. The mixed-protein subunit:DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>) can only be explained if the KER forms no obligate oligomers on the DNA. Rather, multiple monomers of yKER are recruited to the same molecule of DNA, creating the multiplicity of bands in the EMSA.

Although regions of the yKER outside of the middle-A region likely contribute to KER function, the middle-A region is required for DNA binding due to both the positively charged residues and alpha helical structure. Notably, deletion of the middle-A residues from yCAF-1 (yCAF1 ∆middle-A) abrogates binding of yCAF-1 to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming the importance of this region. Interestingly, we also observed that yCAF1 ∆middle-A binds to DNA worse than the deletion of the KER (yCAF1 ∆KER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>), suggesting that residual SAH structure might not support the correct organization or architecture of yCAF-1 in a manner that hinders the activity of the WHD. In the context of CAF-1, a substitution of the KER for the Myosin 7a SAH (KER::Myo7a) in yCAF-1, also abolished DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). In vivo, ∆middle-A yeast behave like the ∆KER cells, exhibiting similar sensitivity to CPT and Zeocin, and even higher GFP expression levels in the silencing assay when in combination with mWHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i, j</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that a specific region within the KER domain (middle-A) simultaneously forms an alpha-helix and engages with DNA to drive DNA binding and the biological functions of yCAF-1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The yKER middle region is required for DNA binding and yCAF-1 function in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Surface representation of two views of the yCAF-1 KER structure with basic residues colored in blue, acidic in red, and polar or hydrophobic in gray.

To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel EMSA approach, which uses equimolar concentrations of Cy5-labeled DNA fragments spanning 10–50 bp in length (Cy5-DNA ladder) to detect the DNA-length preferences of CAF-1 under competition conditions between different lengths of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>). The free DNA signal for each fragment in the Cy5-DNA ladder was quantitated and plotted as a function of protein concentration. Subjecting yCAF-1 to this assay resulted in a DNA-length selective binding behavior, as shown by the preferential depletion of the 50 and 40 bp DNA fragments from the free DNA at lower concentrations of yCAF-1 compared to the 20 and 30 bp fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), while 10 bp remained unchanged. In order to visualize these differences in competition, we plotted the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (<italic>K</italic><sub>Dapp</sub>) as a means to compare different proteins and different DNA lengths in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). We observed a threshold effect whereby CAF-1 binds to DNA of 40 bp in length length or longer with a similar <italic>K</italic><sub>Dapp</sub>, but there were mutants that had increased binding affinity for 50 bp compared to 40 bp. This can be seen by plotting the rate of the apparent dissociation constant change from 40 to 50 bp, which allows for these thresholds to be easily distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f, g</xref>). Similarly, the yKER bound to the Cy5-DNA ladder in a DNA-length-dependent manner. However, the yKER substantially depleted 30 and 20 bp fragments from the free DNA at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), revealing a very slight threshold effect compared to yCAF1. In contrast, the yWHD exhibited virtually no DNA-length selective binding, except that like the KER, the shortest 10 bp DNA was bound poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). yCAF-1 with the WHD deleted (Cac1 amino acids 520–606) (yCAF1 ∆WHD) did not bind well to the 10–30 bp fragments, but did have a slight preference for the 50 bp over the 40 bp DNA (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, d</xref>). Relevant to this observation, previous studies revealed that in a truncated form of CAF-1, the WHD interacts with the ED region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and that H3/H4 dimer binding to the ED was needed to displace the WHD and free it to bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). This ‘autoinhibited state’ of the WHD can also be released through substitution of Cac1 residues 397–431 in the ED region by a glycine/serine/leucine linker (ED::GSL), which decreases the affinity of the WHD for the ED and allows the WHD to bind DNA in a histone-free manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we recapitulated the ED::GSL substitution in the context of full-length yCAF-1 (yCAF1 ED::GSL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>) and subjected it to the Cy5-DNA ladder assay. We found that yCAF1 ED::GSL showed a slight preference for the 50 bp DNA compared to the 40 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–g</xref>), suggesting that the uninhibited WHD contributes further to the length of DNA recognized by CAF-1. Together, these results demonstrate that the KER, but not the WHD, equips yCAF-1 with a DNA-length selectivity function that favors binding to DNA fragments that are at least 40 bp in length. Also, the presence of the WHD permits yCAF1 binding to 20 and 30 bp DNA, suggesting it has either a direct or indirect contribution to DNA binding of yCAF-1; and that there is a further contribution to the length threshold in the state where the WHD is released from the ED.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The yKER confers DNA-length selectivity to yCAF-1.</title><p>(<bold>a–e</bold>) Representative images of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showing DNA binding of yCAF-1, yKER, yWHD, yCAF-1 ∆WHD, or yCAF-1 ED::GSL where each Cy5-labeled DNA fragment is at 1 nM concentration and the range of protein concentration was 37–760 nM for all constructs.

The length of the KER regions in other species differ. In the human homolog CHAF1A, the KER has a similar distribution of basic residues, but it is at least 20 residues longer than the yKER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). To address the hypothesis that the longer hKER might have different DNA-binding properties than the yKER, we expressed and purified the hKER (CHAF1A residues 331–441) and using CD found that it has high alpha helical content, and exhibits non-cooperative unfolding as expected for an SAH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).

However, substitution of the yKER for the hKER in yCAF-1(yCAF1 KER::hKER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>) slightly altered the DNA-length selectivity function of yCAF-1, as seen by the slight difference between the depletion of the 50 bp DNA fragments relative to the shorter DNA in our Cy5-DNA ladder assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This difference is largely due to the decreased competitiveness of the 30 and 40 bp DNA compared to the 50 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f, g</xref>). This is only observed in the context of yCAF-1 but not in the isolated KERs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>) and suggests that the longer hKER can alter the DNA-length preference of yCAF-1.

Many alpha helical DNA-binding motifs, including leucine zippers and helix–loop–helix motifs, bind across the DNA within the major groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luscombe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolberger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchill and Travers, 1991</xref>). Alternatively, the positively charged face of the KER could align with the DNA, similar to the long helices that lie parallel to the DNA exist in chromatin remodelers, such as the HSA and post-HSA domains in the actin-related proteins (Arp4 and Arp8) of INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knoll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2021</xref>). However, these helices simultaneously interact extensively with other polypeptides in addition to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knoll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2021</xref>). In the context of the intact CAF-1 complex, there are fewer CAF-1–DNA complexes observed, which suggests that KER–DNA binding is constrained by other interactions within the complex. Whether the KER binds along the length of the DNA or engages only short stretches of the DNA in a similar manner to the other helical motifs is not clear. Our results are consistent with aspects of both of these models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>), as the middle region of the KER confers the ability to bind to DNA, and the positively charged amino acids along one face of the SAH-DBD would be suitable for electrostatic steering as well as recognition of long segments of DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Function of the KER SAH-DBD in CAF-1 and implications for nucleosome assembly</title><p>The KER confers the preference of CAF-1 for tetrasome-length DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), in spite of the SAH-DBD recognition of shorter DNA lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Surprisingly, nearly all perturbations to the KER that we tested in yeast had reduced resistance to DNA damage and loss of gene silencing in combination with the mWHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), even a deletion of two residues, which rotated the helix approximately 200° relative to the DNA or other regions of CAF-1. Although doubling or extending the length of the yKER in yCAF-1 did not change the selectivity for 40 bp DNA, the 2xKER strain overall survived CPT and Zeocin induced DNA damage and maintained gene silencing in the absence of a functional WHD. This suggests that the second KER SAH functionally substitutes for the WHD in vivo. We also increased the DNA-length preference of yCAF-1 to 50 bp by either derepressing the DNA-binding function of the WHD, via the ED:GSL mutation or substituting the yKER with the hKER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Both of these mutations provide additional potential DNA-binding interactions, but the hKER substitution also had a similar loss of function to the deletion of the KER in vivo. Thus, the context of the KER, including molecular interactions, presence of a viable WHD and structural requirements imposed by the architecture of the CAF-1 complex, is critical for DNA-length sensing and CAF-1 function in vivo.</p><p>How might a DNA-length-sensing function of the KER in CAF-1 be relevant during DNA synthesis? One possibility is that extrusion of DNA through PCNA exposes CAF-1 to increasing lengths of naked DNA. The ability of CAF-1 to preferentially bind to a tetrasome length of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) could ensure sufficient DNA is available so that as histone binding releases the WHD, there will be sufficient space along the DNA for the subsequent assembly of tetrasomes, while simultaneously protecting newly replicated DNA from spurious binding of other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramachandran and Henikoff, 2016</xref>). Loss of the KER can be compensated by the WHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7b</xref>), but deletion of both the KER and WHD renders yeast with a reduced ability to survive DNA damage or maintain gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Moreover, the yKER is shorter than the KER in humans and many other eukaryotes, and correspondingly preferentially recognizes shorter DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) than the hKER in the context of yCAF-1, which raises the possibility that the KER serves a spacer function to ensure that tetramers are assembled at specific spacings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Classic SAHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dudola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gáspári et al., 2012</xref>) predominantly use the long rigid helix to bridge two functional domains either as a linker, spacer, or flexible spring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wolny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wolny et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandera et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the KER SAH acts as a DNA-binding physical spacer element and bridge that links with structural precision multiple functional domains within CAF-1 to configure the architecture of CAF-1 for efficient tetrasome assembly after DNA synthesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed molecular mechanism model of KER-mediated nascent tetrasome assembly by CAF-1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The KER safeguards DNA for tetrasome assembly. Because the KER has strong binding affinity toward DNA and is readily competent for binding, recruitment of CAF-1 to DNA through the KER can be an initial transient state prior to assembly of tetrasomes during DNA replication (left panel). Furthermore, the DNA-length selectivity function of the KER equips CAF-1 to bind to free DNA regions that are tetrasome-length (≥40 bp). While CAF-1 is bound to DNA through the KER, CAF-1 can receive newly synthesized H3/H4 dimers from the histone chaperone Anti-silencing Function 1 (Asf1) which in turn facilitates DNA binding of the winged helix domain (WHD; middle panel). The KER and WHD bind cooperatively to DNA which facilitate the recruitment of two copies of the CAF-1–H3/H4 complex to the same DNA vicinity (middle panel). A transient DNA–(CAF-1–H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> complex provides the conditions to favor the formation of the H3/H4 tetramer (middle panel, green arrows) following its the deposition on DNA and presumably ejecting CAF-1 from the DNA (right panel). (<bold>b</bold>) Deletion of the KER from yCAF-1 (yCAF-1 ∆KER) impairs binding to DNA in vitro, presumably because the WHD binds more weakly to DNA and is in an autoinhibited state. But in vivo yCAF-1 ∆KER is still competent for tetrasome assembly with minimal sensitivity to DNA damage and defects on heterochromatin formation. (<bold>c</bold>) In contrast, deletion of the KER (∆KER) in combination with inhibition of the DNA-binding function of the WHD (mWHD) dramatically impairs DNA repair and heterochromatin formation functions of yCAF-1 in vivo. Because in ∆KER+mWHD cells yCAF-1 has no detectable functional DNA-binding domain, tetrasome formation cannot occur efficiently. (<bold>d</bold>) The length of the KER domain in CAF-1 varies across species and it can alter the DNA length recognized by CAF-1 in vitro, which could alter tetrasome assembly during DNA replication.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83538-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Cartoon models of KER–DNA association.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The KER is aligned along the length of the DNA.

They found that KER region forms a single α helix motif (SAH). Unlike SAH found in other proteins, they showed that SAH motif of both yCac1 and its human counterpart, p150, binds DNA in sequence length dependent manner. They found that depletion of KER in yeast cells when combined with WHD region of Cac1, another region that binds DNA, completely destroyed the function of Cac1 in heterochromatin silencing and in response to DNA damage agents. Furthermore, the KER region and WHD region bind DNA with different affinity and likely have distinct function in cells. Then, they performed a series of mutagenesis studies on yeast KER and identified a couple of key amino acids important for the function. Overall, almost all experiments are well designed and controlled, and the results largely support the conclusion. I have only one major concern and several minor concerns described below.</p><p>The results that hKER cannot complement the function of yeast KER are very puzzling considering the following results shown (1) both yKER and hKER bind DNA; (2) Cac1 mutant with 2KER behaves like wild type Cac1. These results suggest that in addition to bind DNA, the KER region may have additional function. Other possibilities include, (1) the Cac1 mutant contain hKER was not expressed, (2) the mutant CAF-1 with hKER cannot bind DNA. The authors need to test some of these possibilities to strengthen conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1.</p><p>– The data shown in this figure would be easier for readers to compare if gels from experiments with the same titrant proteins were stacked vertically above one another.</p><p>– The exact protein concentrations used in each set of experiments (Figure 1b-I and Figure 1 Supp. 2a-b and Figure 3) is not stated in the figure legend (preferable) or in the Materials and methods.</p><p>– Also, the authors should briefly comment on why a different set of DNA sizes was used for the yCAF-1 and y-KER experiments.</p><p>– The indication of wild type (WT) and Cac1 WT in Figure 1n and o, I found a bit confusing, perhaps use &quot;Cac1 WT&quot; for both.</p><p>The authors should provide a detailed linear map for Cac1 delineating the position of KER, and the precise location of the mutants and deletions used in the work.</p><p>Figure 1 – supplementary 1 – the authors should indicate the proteins shown are derived from isolated yCAF-1 complexes from insect cells.

Fortunately, the subsequent analyses of smaller deletions largely resolves this problem: the δ-middle-A mutant protein appears to not bind DNA efficiently, without appearing to cause aggregates at the bottom of the gel well (Figure 3h). Therefore, I suggest Figure 1m be moved to the supplemental data, and perhaps a wider titration of the δ-middle-A protein could take its place.</p><p>Figure 4: Some of the Cy5 DNA ladder profiles appear very similar to those observed with wild-type yCAF-1. Specifically, by what statistical measures are the ED::GSL (Figure 4e) and KER::hKER (Figure 6c) mutants distinct from wt CAF-1? Also, Since some of the differences among these curves are subtle, it would greatly help the reader to have the curves for wild-type CAF-1 alongside all mutants examined, e.g. in Figure 5. Or, combine all these titrations into a single figure?</p><p>To test the contribution of the KER domain, it would have been instructive to analyze δ-middle-A CAF-1 complex using these same titrations in the Cy5 DNA ladder assay. Also, some mutants are not fully characterized: the helix altering delta145-9 and delta225-6 mutants (Figure 5d-e) should be tested in the biochemical assays, and the +N-half mutant needs to be tested in biological assays.</p><p>The 2xKER and +N-half mutant CAF-1 complexes bind short DNA fragments (20-30 bp) better than wt, consistent with the observed bypass by 2xKER of the deltaWHD phenotypes in the biological assays. What is the proposed molecular mechanism, that is, why do the authors think increasing the length of KER would provide affinity for a broader range of DNA sizes?

We considered using an in vitro nucleosome assembly assay, such as the reconstitution of nucleosomes onto gapped DNA using purified components developed by Kadyrova et al., 2013 (doi: 10.4161/cc.26310). However, they found defects only in the amount of nucleosome assembly and not changes in nucleosome spacing without CAF-1. In addition, we didn’t have the system set up and knew that it would be unlikely to produce data in the time needed for a revision of the manuscript, or even show spacing changes in nucleosomes at all. Therefore, we chose an assay system in yeast that already has been used to assess the impact of CAF-1 DNA binding mutants on nucleosome assembly (Smith and Whitehouse, 2012; pmid: 22419157 and Mattiroli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017 doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.22799). This approach, developed by Smith and Whitehouse, uses a degradable Ligase I system in yeast, which reveals Okazaki fragment lengths, and shows a defect when CAF-1 activity is knocked out (Smith and Whitehouse, 2012). This assay also showed that mutations or deletions in the Cac1 WHD DNA binding domain, led to increased lengths of Okazaki fragments (Mattiroli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017). As the WHD DBD impacts Okazaki fragment lengths, we reasoned that mutations in the KER DBD might also.</p><p>We generated numerous new yeast strains that included the degradable Ligase I system and collaborated with Dr. Duncan Smith of (Smith and Whitehouse, 2012; pmid: 22419157) to detect nascent Okazaki fragments in various CAC1 mutants in strains that were <italic>RTT106</italic> or <italic>rtt106∆</italic>. We found that the Okazaki fragment lengths from <italic>cac1∆</italic> yeast were larger and less discrete than from <italic>CAC1</italic> yeast (as Dr Smith published previously) and that the Okazaki fragments from the <italic>cac1∆ rtt106∆</italic> strain were barely detectable, presumably because they were too long to be resolved on the gel. However, the assay did not have sufficient resolution to detect changes between the Okazaki fragment length distribution between wild type CAC1 or the ∆KER, ∆middle-A and 2xKER mutants of CAC1, in either the <italic>RTT106</italic> or <italic>rtt106∆</italic> background. Therefore, we were unable to detect direct effects of the KER mutants on Okazaki-fragment lengths. We considered using the combination of KER mutants with the WHD mutants, but as this would not directly assess the effects of the KER mutants and CAF-1 proteins lacking the KER and the WHD don’t bind to DNA (Figure 3 in Mattiroli et al., 2017), we didn’t pursue it. As the complete deletion of the KER, shortening of the KER and lengthening of the KER did not give detectable changes in this assay, we also did not pursue the other mutants tested in the manuscript. Although, we are disappointed the experiment did not reveal effects that we had hoped for, this experiment provides support for the redundant functions of CAF-1 and Rtt106 in nucleosome assembly, which has not been shown using this assay. As such, we have added Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and text to the Results section, methods section and strain table. We have included Prof. Duncan Smith and his student Anne Seck as authors.</p><p>Added text lines 195 to 207: “Finally, to assess the impact of deleting the KER more directly on nucleosome assembly in vivo, we examined histone deposition onto nascent Okazaki fragments during DNA replication as we have shown previously that the length of Okazaki fragment lengths are determined by histone deposition into nucleosomes and is disrupted upon deletion of <italic>CAC1</italic> (Smith and Whitehouse, 2012). We compared CAF-1 mutants in the WT yeast background and in yeast lacking Rtt106. We found that the Okazaki fragment length distributions of the ∆KER mutant was indistinguishable from that of WT while that of <italic>cac1∆</italic> was disrupted (Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 1—figure supplement 3g). That we did not detect effects on Okazaki-fragment lengths for the yCAF-1 mutants lacking the intact KER is consistent with the results of the viability and silencing assays for KER mutants, which also retained the WHD. Strikingly, the Okazaki fragments from <italic>rtt106∆ cac1∆</italic> yeast were highly disrupted (Figure 1—figure supplement Figure 1—figure supplement 3g) further highlighting the redundancy between Rtt106 and Cac1 for assembling histones onto newly replicated DNA.

Indeed, we have invested a large amount of time and effort to obtain the structure of the KER-DNA complex and we had performed molecular docking. However, we opted previously not to present any detailed models in this manuscript, which may give the reader the sense that we favor a particular mode of binding, when there are several viable alternatives. We have now added Figure 7—figure supplement 1, which shows two possible modes of KER-DNA binding. For example, the KER binds independently and cooperatively to DNA in a final ratio related to the DNA length, suggesting a model by which the KER “crosses the DNA”, much like a leucine-zipper DBD. Alternatively, the positively-charged face of the KER could align with the DNA in the context of intact CAF-1. However, for the KER in the context of the intact CAF-1 complex, the number of CAF-1-DNA complexes observed is 2 and this number does not change with alterations to DNA length, which suggests that DNA binding is constrained by other interactions within the complex.</p><p>Edited text within 596 to 612: “the KER SAH is capable of binding to DNA independently and cooperatively in a final ratio related to the DNA length with an estimated site size as short as 20 bp, which is typical of many DBDs. Many α helical DNA binding motifs, including leucine zippers and helix-loop-helix motifs, bind across the DNA within the major groove (Luscombe et al., 2000; Wolberger, 2021; Churchill and Travers, 1991). Alternatively, the positively-charged face of the KER could align with the DNA, similar to the long helices that lie parallel to the DNA exist in chromatin remodelers, such as the HSA and post-HSA domains in the actin related proteins (Arp4 and Arp8) of INO80 (Knoll et al., 2018; Baker et al., 2021). However, these helices simultaneously interact extensively with other polypeptides in addition to the DNA (Knoll et al., 2018; Baker et al., 2021). In the context of the intact CAF-1 complex, the number of CAF-1-DNA complexes observed is limited to 2 and this number does not change with different DNA lengths, which suggests that KER-DNA binding is constrained by other interactions within the complex. Whether the KER binds along the length of the DNA or engages only a short stretch of the DNA in a similar manner to the other helical motifs is not clear. Our results are consistent with aspects of these models (Figure 7—figure supplement 1a and b), as the middle region of the KER confers the ability to bind to DNA, and the positively charged amino acids along one face of the SAH DBD would be suitable for electrostatic steering and recognition of longer segments of DNA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Rosas et al. performed the structural and functional studies of KER region of yeast Cac1, the large subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1).

In fact, like yCAF1 KER::hKER, small deletions within the KER also give rise to similar phenotypes as the ∆KER. These findings led us to propose that the SAH structure of the KER functions as a “… physical spacer element and bridge that links with structural precision multiple functional domains within CAF-1 to configure the architecture of CAF-1 for efficient tetrasome assembly after DNA synthesis” (pg 19). Further details on the molecular mechanism of this proposed “bridge” function of the KER SAH are beyond the scope of this article and may require a more detailed understanding of the overall structure of the entire CAF-1 complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1.</p><p>– The data shown in this figure would be easier for readers to compare if gels from experiments with the same titrant proteins were stacked vertically above one another.</p><p>– The exact protein concentrations used in each set of experiments (Figure 1b-I and Figure 1 Supp. 2a-b and Figure 3) is not stated in the figure legend (preferable) or in the Materials and methods.</p><p>– Also, the authors should briefly comment on why a different set of DNA sizes was used for the yCAF-1 and y-KER experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions.

Therefore, we feel it would be better to leave the figure placements as they are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: Some of the Cy5 DNA ladder profiles appear very similar to those observed with wild-type yCAF-1. Specifically, by what statistical measures are the ED::GSL (Figure 4e) and KER::hKER (Figure 6c) mutants distinct from wt CAF-1? Also, Since some of the differences among these curves are subtle, it would greatly help the reader to have the curves for wild-type CAF-1 alongside all mutants examined, e.g. in Figure 5. Or, combine all these titrations into a single figure?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, but there are some differences that we observed and wished to compare for the mutants. It was be difficult to put all of the results in one figure due to the rationale for the design of the mutants and the flow of the manuscript. Therefore, have left the EMSA and analyses where they were. To address the comparison suggested by this reviewer, we added a comparison graph. We considered many approaches for quantitating these differences to make these comparisons easier for the reader. We settled on measuring the concentration at 50% bound for each of the fragments and summarized the results in Figure 4f and g. The new Figure 4g shows the rate (slope) by which the apparent dissociation constant changes from 40 bp to 50 bp, which is one way to visualize a difference in the threshold of maximum binding affinity for the 30-50 bp fragments. When compared to yCAF-1, the ED::GSL and KER::hKER have a greater preference for the longer 50 bp DNA compared to 40 bp. To demonstrate that this threshold is significantly different for these two mutants, we have looked at the rate (slope) by which the apparent dissociation constant changes from 40 bp to 50 bp. Using one-way ANOVA, the rate change from 40 bp to 50 bp is significantly different for only ED::GSL and KER::hKER when compared to yCAF-1 (now Figure 4g). This has been introduced and described in the manuscript at line 381-386. “We observed a threshold effect whereby CAF-1 binds to DNA of 40 bp in length length or longer with a similar KDapp, but there were mutants that had increased binding affinity for 50 bp compared to 40 bp. This can be seen by plotting the rate of the apparent dissociation constant change from 40 bp to 50 bp, which allows for these thresholds to be easily distinguished (Figure 4f and g).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To test the contribution of the KER domain, it would have been instructive to analyze δ-middle-A CAF-1 complex using these same titrations in the Cy5 DNA ladder assay. Also, some mutants are not fully characterized: the helix altering delta145-9 and delta225-6 mutants (Figure 5d-e) should be tested in the biochemical assays, and the +N-half mutant needs to be tested in biological assays.</p></disp-quote><p>The CAF-1 Δmiddle A doesn’t bind to DNA at all at 250 nM concentrations (Figure 3h), which are in the range of the Cy5 ladder assay. Therefore, we did not test any lower concentrations. To make this point clearer, we have included a version of Figure 3h using 760 nM of protein concentration (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) where we observed no DNA shifts for ∆middle-A. Reference to this new figure has been introduced in the manuscript. With regard to testing the ∆145-149 and ∆225-226 mutants, we had already found that larger fragments, N-half and C-half, were unable to bind to DNA, and the middle-A could bind to DNA without those regions. Therefore, recombinant yCAF-1 complexes with ∆145-149 or ∆225-226 deletions were not considered for insect cell production and DNA binding testing. Regarding testing the +N-half in yeast, we had not done this because the 2XKER tested for the effect of very long KER and the hKER represents a KER that is slightly (20 aa) longer KER and believed that these together represent two extremes and that the +N-half was intermediate to those.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The 2xKER and +N-half mutant CAF-1 complexes bind short DNA fragments (20-30 bp) better than wt, consistent with the observed bypass by 2xKER of the deltaWHD phenotypes in the biological assays. What is the proposed molecular mechanism, that is, why do the authors think increasing the length of KER would provide affinity for a broader range of DNA sizes? And why would the longer human hKER not be able to do this?</p></disp-quote><p>In isolation and unlike the yCAF-1 complex, the KER binds well to 20 bp and 30 bp fragments of DNA (Table 1, Figure 4b and g). This suggests that something in the CAF-1 complex is limiting the DNA binding to short fragments, possibly steric hindrance due to the presence of the rest of the CAF-1 complex. In the case of the yCAF-1 2xKER and +N-half mutants, the overall KER region is substantially larger than in the intact yCAF-1, 37 and 90 residues longer respectively. These longer KER domains could reduce the physical constrains imposed in the CAF-1 complex around the KER-DNA-binding region, therefore increasing the accessibility and binding to short DNA fragments. In the case of the hKER, which is only 20 residues longer than the yKER this increase in the length of the KER domain in the yCAF-1 yKER::hKER mutant is not sufficient to observe an increased binding affinity to short fragments of DNA or compensate for the loss of the WHD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the analysis in Figure 4f- why not show the data for the yWHD domain?</p></disp-quote><p>The depletion of the Cy5-DNA ladder fragments for the yWHD (Figure 4c) shows that the DNA binding of the WHD is not substantially impacted by the length of DNA, i.e. the WHD does not exhibit DNA length selectivity. Therefore, the yWHD was not considered for the analysis on the estimates of DNA-length-dependent dissociation constants.</p></body></sub-article></article>
