It is relatively straightforward to determine how many colors we can see or sounds we can hear because these stimuli are well defined by physical properties such as wavelength. We know the range of wavelengths that the eye can see or the ear can hear, and we can also understand how two such stimuli (e.g., red and blue) are arranged perceptually (think of a color wheel). It is harder, however, to do the same for smell because most ‘olfactory stimuli’ consist of mixtures of different odor molecules. Moreover, we understand much less about how olfactory stimuli are arranged perceptually.</p><p>In 2014 researchers at Rockefeller University reported that humans can distinguish more than one trillion smells from one another. To calculate this number the researchers tested the ability of human subjects to discriminate between mixtures of different odor molecules. Each mixture consisted of 10, 20 or 30 molecules selected from a chemical library of 128 different odor molecules. Since each mixture of 10 molecules could contain any 10 of the 128 molecules, more than 200 trillion combinations were possible; the number of possible combinations for the 20- and 30-molecule mixtures were even higher.</p><p>The aim of the experiment was to identify—by sampling from this very large number of combinations—the number of molecules that two mixtures could have in common and still be distinguishable to the typical person. The Rockefeller team used this number and a geometrical analogy to conclude that humans could discriminate at least 1.72 trillion odors, which was much higher than expected from previous reports and anecdotes.</p><p>Now Gerkin and Castro report that the claims made in the Rockefeller study are unsupported because of flaws in the design of the analytical framework used to make sense of the data. In particular, Gerkin and Castro report that the results are extremely sensitive to some parameters of the experimental and analytical design, such as the number of subjects tested, whereas the results of a robust analysis would not be so sensitive to such factors. By modestly varying any of these parameters it is possible to obtain almost any value for the number of smells that can be discriminated. Moreover, the geometrical analogy used set an upper bound on the final answer, rather than a lower bound: in other words, even assuming that the rest of the analysis was robust, the result should have been that humans can discriminate ‘no more than’ 1.72 trillion smells rather than ‘at least’. In a separate paper Meister also reports that the 1.72 trillion smells claim is unjustified.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08127.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08127.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>psychophysics</kwd><kwd>sensory systems</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The recent claim that humans can discriminate more than one trillion odors is shown to be unwarranted.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) proposed that humans can discriminate between at least a trillion olfactory stimuli. Using that paper's methods to reanalyze the data it presented, we show that this estimate is problematically fragile. Specifically, it varies systematically and sensitively (over tens of orders of magnitude, in both directions), for very modest changes in incidental experimental and analysis parameters against which a result ought to be robust. Had the experiment enlisted ∼ 100 additional subjects similar to the original ones, the same analysis would have concluded that <italic>all possible stimuli</italic> are discriminable (i.e., that each of the more than 10<sup>29</sup> olfactory stimuli possible in their framework are mutually discriminable). By contrast, if the same experimental data were analyzed using moderately more conservative statistical criteria, it would have concluded that there are fewer than 5000 discriminable olfactory stimuli—no larger than the folk wisdom value that the new estimate purports to replace.</p><p>Therefore, under this framework, data describing the same underlying perceptual abilities admit a wide range of extremely disparate (varying over <italic>25 orders of magnitude</italic>), yet unobjectionable alternative conclusions (including both the largest and smallest possible estimates allowed by the analysis framework). We conclude that the framework is unsound: there may be trillions of discriminable olfactory stimuli, or more, or fewer, but the framework does not provide the means for settling this question. Here we first demonstrate the framework's fragility, and then explain the sources of that fragility. For most of this paper, we remain agnostic about whether the framework is conceptually sound, to highlight the fact that it has strictly methodological problems of a statistical origin that do not depend on the validity of a competing set of assumptions.</p><p>We also show that the formula used to derive the estimated number of discriminable stimuli, given an estimated perceptual limen, yields an upper bound, not a lower bound, meaning that any estimate derived here or in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>), under any assumptions, is a maximum and not a minimum. In other words, the original paper in fact supports the conclusion that humans can discriminate <italic>at most</italic> one trillion olfactory stimuli (or more or fewer, due to the problem described above), a rather uninspiring claim. In a concluding section, we explore possibilities for improving the estimate.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Problems with the estimate</title><p>The first main concern is that the estimated number of discriminable stimuli depends steeply, systematically, and non-asymptotically on choices of arbitrary experimental parameters, among them the number of subjects enrolled, the number of discrimination tests performed, and the threshold for statistical significance. We show below that the order of magnitude claim of ‘one trillion olfactory stimuli’ requires that those parameters assume a very narrow set of values. Certainly, the precise value of an estimate may change as additional data are collected, but the estimate should not change <italic>in expectation</italic>; it should not be possible to make an estimate arbitrarily large (or small), simply by collecting more (or less) data. Similarly, the estimate itself should not become arbitrarily small or large with adjustment of a significance criterion. Estimates that scale systematically with such incidental parameter choices are considered statistically <italic>inconsistent</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is the inconsistency of the present estimate that produces a tremendously large space of extremely different, yet unobjectionable alternative conclusions that can be reached about the number of discriminable olfactory stimuli.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08127.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Consistency of an estimator.</title><p>An estimator is consistent if the resulting estimate asymptotically converges (in expectation) as sample size increases (black line). Uncertainty in the estimate (gray area) may shrink with sample size, but the estimate itself should not systematically change with sample size, and should converge on the truth. Estimators without this property are termed inconsistent (the blue line is a relevant example), and are considered unreliable, as the resulting estimate can be heavily biased by the sample size. If the estimate has a minimum and maximum allowed value (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>), an especially inconsistent estimator can even produce any estimate within that range.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08127.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08127.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08127-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08127.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Fraction discriminated at which statistical significance is reached.</title><p>For each possible value of the number of tests <italic>T</italic> conducted per mixture class, there is a cumulative distribution of the fraction <italic>f</italic> of those tests that will be correctly discriminated, under the null hypothesis of chance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> responding.

The thin red lines correspond to the same calculation for <italic>d</italic> but using data for only a single subject (one per line), showing similar sensitivity to the choice of threshold. The absence of a robust d for any individual subject argues that the group data are not simply explained by averaging across a population with well-defined, but diverse values of <italic>d</italic>. Note that very modest and reasonable alternative choices for the threshold result in extremely disparate estimates. The vertical axis is bounded by the smallest and largest possible number of discriminable stimuli allowed by the framework. The dashed lines are a visual guide to specific (threshold, <italic>z</italic>) pairs.

Note that the worst performing subjects under one threshold can discriminate many more stimuli than the best performing subjects under a slightly more liberal threshold (compare best subject using a 60% threshold vs worst subject using a 40% threshold). Therefore, it is impossible to report with any confidence the number of discriminable stimuli using this approach. In the main text, we show that the actual framework used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) is nominally employed to make a more principled choice of threshold; however it merely cloaks the arbitrariness of the threshold choice, but does not eliminate it.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08127.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08127.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08127-fig4-figsupp2-v1"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>Because olfactory stimuli do not have obvious physical dimensions analogous to wavelength, olfaction is not amenable to an identical calculation.

In (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>)'s three-alternative forced-choice experiments, chance responding would produce a fraction correct of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, so the appropriate threshold would be somewhere between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and 1.

If not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), it will be very fragile. We explored this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and concluded that it does not suffice for deriving a robust <italic>d</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Thresholding the fraction <italic>significantly</italic> discriminable</title><p>The approach actually used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) is instead to apply a threshold not to the fraction <italic>discriminated</italic> (explored in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), but to the fraction <italic>significantly discriminable</italic>. In other words, determine for which subjects (or alternatively, for which classes of mixtures) the fraction discriminated is <italic>significantly greater</italic> than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf39"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, i.e., for which subjects the null hypothesis of chance discrimination can be rejected. To facilitate visualization of this step, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) re-plotted the summary data (fraction correctly discriminated) as fraction significantly discriminable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This view of the data provides a linear relationship between distance <italic>D</italic> and the fraction significantly discriminable, which holds across all the values of <italic>N</italic> tested. The relationship is much steeper than for fraction discriminable (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) because this hypothesis-testing step acts as a strong non-linear threshold that exaggerates otherwise small differences in the data. An arbitrary choice of threshold is required; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) chose a threshold of 50% significantly discriminable, and computed <italic>d</italic> from the fraction significantly discriminable using linear regression and interpolation.</p><p>Varying the threshold (i.e., 50%) itself (not shown), would change the computed <italic>d</italic> (and consequently <italic>z</italic>), but this is not the largest issue. By introducing a hypothesis-testing step, the <italic>d</italic> derived from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> now varies systematically with the number of subjects enrolled in the study (and the number of mixtures tested), and with the choice of significance criterion <italic>α</italic>. This is because each data point used to compute <italic>d</italic> becomes the binary result of a hypothesis test, each of which depends critically on sample size and test specificity. Because <italic>d</italic> is then fed into an expression (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) that explodes geometrically, the result is a recipe for producing any of a range of estimates for <italic>z</italic> that one might choose. If one enlists more subjects or slackens the significance criterion, a very large (even the largest possible) number will be obtained. If one enlists fewer subjects or makes the significance criterion more strict, a very small (even the smallest possible) number will be obtained. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the explicit dependence of the estimate on each of these quantities alone. Naturally, these can be varied in tandem too, with even more dramatic consequences, as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>A hypothesis test is meant to assess the strength of evidence for or against a hypothesis (often against a null hypothesis), not to make a point estimate. However, it may not be uncommon for researchers to use hypothesis testing in the manner done in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>)—to count the number or fraction of data points exhibiting a certain property. In many cases this may amount to a venial statistical sin with (hopefully) benign consequences. But that is unfortunately not the case in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>), due in part to the extremely steep dependence of <italic>z</italic> on <italic>d</italic> guaranteed by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>.</p><p>If one claims that an estimate is meaningful, it is fair to ask how vigorously would one have to defend a specific choice of arbitrary experimental parameters to defend a particular order-of-magnitude range around that estimate. Unfortunately, the systematic sensitivities exhibited here severely undermine the plausibility and relevance of the estimate reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>). Due to these sensitivities, one could pick almost any number of discriminable stimuli in advance, and affirm this number using these or similar data. Ultimately, the absence of a robust <italic>d</italic> to characterize the data is an insurmountable obstacle for the framework.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="intro"><title>Building the stimulus space</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The structure of the stimulus space</title><p>One might ask: what is the right way to calculate <italic>d</italic> in order to obtain a robust estimate of the number of discriminable stimuli? Before heading down this road and devising alternative statistical approaches, it is worth first clearly articulating the assumptions of a framework in which a single variable plays such a special role. Under what conditions is it sensible to expect that plugging a single data-derived number (<italic>d</italic>) into <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> will produce a meaningful estimate of the number of discriminable olfactory stimuli?</p><p>To gain some intuition into this, we can ask the analogous question in the simplified visual system example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) that was used as the principal motivation for the procedure. The ‘sphere packing’ calculation in this case naturally involves measuring the resolution of perception in terms of the stimulus, but its validity is not a consequence of this measurement alone. Rather, the procedure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is sensible because the thing we are calling an independent stimulus dimension (wavelength) is respected as such by perception: we encounter monotonically changing, non-redundant percepts as we move from one extreme of the stimulus space to the other. If we didn't—say, if the same percept ‘blue’ were experienced for several non-overlapping disjoint intervals—the sphere packing formulation would fall apart. We might observe that on average discriminability improves with distance, but this would not be evidence of a characteristic length scale that partitions stimulus pairs into discriminable vs indiscriminable sets.</p><p>Thus the sphere-packing framework is valid only if the underlying geometry of <italic>stimulus space</italic> (that the investigator has designed) aligns with the geometry of <italic>perceptual space</italic> (as implemented in neural circuitry). Formally, the map from stimulus space to perceptual space needs to be homeomorphic, or nearly so. See (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Meister, 2015</xref>) for further insight on this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Redundancy in the stimulus space</title><p>Instead of providing evidence for this homeomorphism, it was assumed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) for the purposes of calculation that each component of the molecular library (of size <italic>C</italic> = 128 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>]) spanned an informative additional dimension for perception to explore: each molecule in the library is treated as an olfactory primary that is independent of all the others. This is the assumption, codified in the numerator of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, that allows for a massive space of potential discriminable stimuli. Indeed, the guaranteed runaway growth of the numerator as molecules are added to the <italic>C</italic>-sized library was offered in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) as an argument for why the reported ‘trillion’ figure is an underestimate—after all, <italic>C</italic> could always be higher.</p><p>It is worthwhile to quantify the behavior of the estimate as <italic>C</italic> changes.

One may object that the inflation of <italic>C</italic> here is an unfair critique, as the perceptual redundancy of molecules must at some point provide an important constraint on the size of the artificially constructed stimulus space. Indeed, it has been reported that as few as thirty components are required to imbue most mixtures with a common smell, even when there is no component overlap between the mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Weiss et al., 2012</xref>). But this is the essence of the problem with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>: where does that point lie, and why wasn't the constraint important to consider for the original <italic>C</italic> = 128 molecular library?</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>An upper or a lower bound?</title><p>Even if one takes the estimate of <italic>d</italic> to be unimpeachable, the formula used to derive <italic>z</italic> does not provide a lower bound as reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>). This much is suggested by the worst-case behavior of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> as <italic>C</italic> grows. After all, worst case behavior should correspond to <italic>z</italic> = 1. If one cannot discriminate anything (maximal <italic>d</italic>), then there is only one percept. Examining <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> more closely, we see that it is a variant of the so-called Hamming bound for constant weight codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">MacWilliams and Sloane, 1977</xref>). which is well-known to be an upper bound for an identically formulated problem in the theory of error-correcting codes. It is, as suggested in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>), an estimate derived from a hypothetical sphere-packing approach to filling the stimulus space, but it is the <italic>largest</italic> possible value for the correct answer, not the <italic>smallest</italic>.

Since the upper bound exceeds the correct answer, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, while not particularly tight as an upper bound, is nonetheless not wrong, so long as we acknowledge that it is an upper and not a lower bound. The same applies for all other values of <italic>d</italic>, including the one derived from the data in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Thus <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, as used in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>), provides no insight into the <italic>lower</italic> bound for <italic>z</italic>, with a <italic>lower</italic> bound being required to overturn conventional wisdom about the number of discriminable stimuli. Instead, to obtain a lower bound one must dispense with the factor of 2 in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, yielding Levenshtein's constant weight version of the so-called Gilbert-Varshamov bound for error-correcting codes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Levenshtein, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">MacWilliams and Sloane, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Jiang and Vardy, 2004</xref>],see Supplemental Materials). A plot of the lower bound obtained in this manner is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, along with the reconstructed upper bounds from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) a, showing the true bounded interval for <italic>z</italic>.

In cognitive science, psychometrics, and marketing, subject responses to stimuli are used to create maps of the underlying perceptual (or conceptual) representations of those stimuli. These maps are characterized by the attribute that pairs of items which are considered intuitively to be perceptually near (rated similar or difficult to discriminate) are nearer to one another on the map than pairs of items which are perceptually more distant (rated dissimilar or easy to discriminate). There are many algorithms for generating such maps, many of which have been used before in olfaction, including variants of PCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Zarzo and Stanton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Khan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Koulakov et al., 2011</xref>), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Castro et al., 2013</xref>]), and multi-dimensional scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Mamlouk et al., 2003</xref>). While there are open questions in the generation of these maps (e.g., how many dimensions should they have?), they all have the virtue that their accuracy can be checked (e.g., by examining the correlation between subjects' indications of item pair dissimilarity and the distance between that pair on the map), and thus the maps can be improved. Developing these maps may also have the collateral benefit of revealing stimulus dimensions intrinsic to olfaction (if any), which could constrain the experimental choice of a resolution to measure.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is difficult if not impossible to create these maps from the data discussed here, because each mixture of a tested pair is used only once in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>), in that pair alone, and never in any other pairs. Thus, there are no serial comparisons of the same mixture that could be used to anchor a stimulus on the map relative to a stimulus against which it was not directly compared experimentally. Thus, there is no way to compute distances between stimuli that do not appear together in a tested pair. In other words, the structure of the perceptual space is severely under-determined by the data. In future experiments such serial repetition of already-tested mixtures would be required to build up a data set to which the proposed method could be applied.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

id="s4-1"><title>Proof of sample size dependence</title><p>Here, we provide a more detailed statistical argument describing the framework's extreme sensitivity to incidental parameters. The crux of the statistical issue is this: the framework could only be valid if <italic>d</italic>, the estimated difference limen used in the calculation step, is a measure of olfactory resolution that converges to the true value of this quantity as more data is collected, that is, if it is <italic>consistent</italic>.</p><p>‘Significantly discriminable’ is a moving target dependent on sample size, choice of significance criterion, and correction for multiple comparisons. And <italic>d</italic> is the only data-dependent value used in subsequent calculations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>), Together, this guarantees that the estimate of <italic>z</italic> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) is a moving target as well, dependent on these same parameters. <italic>d</italic> is generated by testing a number of null hypotheses, and is closely related to the fraction of these which are rejected. But the probability of and criteria for rejection of these null hypotheses depends critically on sample size and <italic>α</italic>, the values that we explored in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>. Certainly, we would agree that there is nothing objectionable about the specific parameters chosen in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is nothing objectionable about many other values for those parameters either.</p><p>In effect, calculating <italic>d</italic> is somewhat like judging whether a coin meets a cutoff for being fair based on a series of tosses. It matters very much how many tosses one makes, and how much deviation from chance one is willing to tolerate before calling a coin unfair. If you have no particular reason to believe a coin is unfair, you might be disinclined to call it unfair if you observe <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (60%) heads, but probably not if you observed <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>600</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> heads (also 60%). However, if you own a casino, you might call 5100 heads in 10,000 (51%) evidence of an unfair coin. Whether the coin is fair is not something we directly measure, but rather we have more or less evidence for various degrees of fairness.</p><p>A similar situation applies in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>)'s analysis by considering its formal definition of <italic>d</italic> (a definition we verified by reconstructing the critical figures from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. <italic>d</italic> is defined as that inter-stimulus distance <italic>D</italic> for which 50% of subjects can significantly discriminate a mixture class. By a mixture ‘class’ we denote the set of mixture pairs for which each mixture has the same number of total components (<italic>N</italic>) and each pair has the same number of distinct, non-overlapping components <italic>D</italic> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For example, the mixture pair (<italic>ABC</italic>, <italic>ABC</italic>) would be a member of the class with <italic>N</italic> = 3 and <italic>D</italic> = 1 distinct components. We focus here on calculations pertaining to the number of tests <italic>T</italic> per class, but the same argument is readily translated over to the number of subjects <italic>S</italic>.</p><p>To assess significant discriminability from chance, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) used a two-tailed binomial test. Thus if a p-value is smaller than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> then the subject is considered able to significantly discriminate from pairs in the mixture class. The p-value is given by 1 minus the cumulative binomial distribution function for <italic>n</italic> = <italic>T</italic> trials, <italic>k</italic> successes, and a probability of success equal to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, with <italic>k</italic> corresponding to the number of subjects discriminating correctly, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> to chance in a 3-way forced choice task.

However, it is inappropriate for the discriminability limen to depend on <italic>α</italic> and <italic>T</italic> in this way. As we showed above, this has serious consequences for the estimate of <italic>d</italic>, and therefore also for the estimate of <italic>z</italic>. It is what makes <italic>z</italic> inconsistent.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the relationship between the critical <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf70"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>α</italic>.

The same principle applies to a consideration of changes to the number of subjects <italic>S</italic>, instead of the number of tests. This illustrates the core of the problem.

However, there is no clean way to generate hypothetical data in such a way for non-trivial cases, such as data where the mixtures are clearly discriminable, without knowing in advance what the population average is! If one could partition mixture classes into clearly discriminable and indiscriminable, and assume that the indiscriminable converge to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> discriminated, and the discriminable to same value larger than <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf78"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the resulting plot would show a clear limen boundary where the data departed from <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf79"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. However it is likely that <italic>all</italic> mixture classes have at least some discriminable pairs, and even if that is only one pair out of a thousand, and only one subject out of a thousand can discriminate it, we would declare the class to be discriminable and the limen <italic>d</italic> to be smaller than the <italic>D</italic> for that class; we would likely do this for all classes, resulting in the conclusion (using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) that all stimuli are discriminable. This occurs because we need <italic>d</italic> to be a property of the stimulus space in general, not a quirk of a small fraction of mixtures. But this kind of <italic>d</italic> is elusive.

Providing a very high upper bound for the number of olfactory stimuli that humans can discriminate does nothing to advance our understanding of human olfactory ability. An expanded version of the following (including code for all calculations, and additional supporting plots) can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/rgerkin/trillion">http://github.com/rgerkin/trillion</ext-link>.</p><p>The minimum possible number of discriminable stimuli occurs when olfactory resolution is as bad as possible. This occurs when <italic>d</italic>, the discriminability limen, is equal to <italic>N</italic>, the number of components. This means that even when every component is substituted in a mixture, discrimination is still hard or impossible. In the visual system, the equivalent situation would be a discriminability limen that spans the entire range of visible wavelengths. Here, the ‘sphere packing’ calculation for such a limen produces the sensible result that there is only one resolvable color percept, only if one large ‘sphere’ of diameter <italic>d</italic> spans these wavelengths.</p><p>Curiously though, using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (implemented exactly from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>]), and setting <italic>d</italic> = <italic>N</italic>, we obtain the value 4561 (for <italic>N</italic> = 30), that is, we would estimate that there are thousands of discriminable stimuli. This can be confirmed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) by inspecting the y-intercept of its <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, or in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Clearly this is problematic since <italic>d</italic> = <italic>N</italic> should correspond to worst possible performance.</p><p>Perhaps this simply traces back to ambiguity in how the limen <italic>d</italic> is defined, and how end-points are treated. For example, we could adopt the convention that a limen of 20 nm in color vision means that stimuli separated by 20 nm are <italic>just discriminable</italic>; alternatively, that such stimuli are the farthest that are <italic>still indiscriminable</italic>, which is slightly different. Along similar lines, one interpretation of a limen of <italic>d</italic> = <italic>N</italic> is that stimuli are only discriminable when <italic>all components</italic> are replaced. If this is the case, then the estimate should be equivalent to the number of ways replacing all <italic>N</italic> components. For a library of size <italic>C</italic>, this can be done in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf80"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>128</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> ways, which is still clearly discordant with the result from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> (4561). While 4561 is not remarkably high, it is clearly inconsistent with common sense. Furthermore, the edge-case, <italic>d</italic> = <italic>N</italic> behavior of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> as <italic>C</italic> increases produces increasingly implausible results, which are independent of the data: they are guaranteed by the equation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to understand the behavior of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, which is advertised in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bushdid et al., 2014</xref>) to provide the number of discriminable stimuli, one can ask ‘what value <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf81"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is needed to produce the result that there is only 1 discriminable stimulus?’ (that is, that only 1 ‘ball’ occupies the range of discriminable stimuli). The answer is that <italic>d</italic> must be equal to 2<italic>N</italic> before <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> will provide the result of 1 discriminable stimulus. But clearly <italic>d</italic> = 2<italic>N</italic> is impossible since <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> by definition. This indicates that there is potentially a spurious factor of two somewhere in the calculation for the lower bound.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Correcting the lower bound</title><p>A common-sense interpretation of a scenario where <italic>no</italic> N-component mixtures differing in all components (<italic>d</italic> = <italic>N</italic>, the largest possible limen) can be discriminated from one another is that there is only one resolvable percept (not thousands).

As the authors demonstrate, the formula used in the previous account poses an upper bound, not a lower bound, on the number of discriminable odorants. Furthermore, the formula used depends in a very sensitive way on various factors like the number of participants and the number of test odors used. In conclusion, the statement from the previous study is untenable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is a critique of the methods used in a recent paper by Bushdid et al. in which the authors purport that humans can discriminate between at least a trillion odors. Gherkin and Castro here dissect methodically the reasons why this conclusion is unwarranted and provide a limpid assessment of the mistakes made in the original study. (The critique is carefully limited to methodological issues, and makes no statement as to whether the initial claim might eventually be shown to be true or not.)</p><p>This paper is a treasure of clarity and thoroughness. The points made in the main manuscript are further expanded in an appendix, and the suggestion to improve the estimate via constructing a “continuous” perceptual map of odors is excellent.</p><p>[Editors’ note: minor issues and corrections have not been included, so there is not an accompanying Author response.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
