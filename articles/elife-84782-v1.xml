pigmentation and inflammation. MC1-R has also been found in the rat and human liver, but its functional role has remained elusive. We hypothesized that MC1-R is functionally active in the liver and involved in the regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. We generated hepatocyte-specific MC1-R knock-out (Mc1r LKO) mice and phenotyped the mouse model for lipid profiles, liver histology, and bile acid levels. Mc1r LKO mice had significantly increased liver weight, which was accompanied by elevated levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver as well as in the plasma. These mice demonstrated also enhanced liver fibrosis and a disturbance in bile acid metabolism as evidenced by markedly reduced bile acid levels in the plasma and feces. Mechanistically, using HepG2 cells as an in vitro model, we found that selective activation of MC1-R in HepG2 cells reduced cellular cholesterol content and enhanced uptake of low- and high-density lipoprotein particles <italic>via</italic> a cAMP-independent mechanism. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that MC1-R signaling in hepatocytes regulates cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and its deficiency leads to hypercholesterolemia and enhanced lipid accumulation and fibrosis in the liver.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>melanocortin 1 receptor</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>triglyceride</kwd><kwd>fibrosis</kwd><kwd>steatosis</kwd><kwd>bile acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>315351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinne</surname><given-names>Petteri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006306</institution-id><institution>Sigrid JusÃ©liuksen SÃ¤Ã¤tiÃ¶</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinne</surname><given-names>Petteri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003125</institution-id><institution>Suomen Kulttuurirahasto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinne</surname><given-names>Petteri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Finnish Foundation for Cardiovascular Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savontaus</surname><given-names>Eriika</given-names></name><name><surname>Rinne</surname><given-names>Petteri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-104080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Minying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1-R) deficiency in hepatocytes increases cholesterol levels in the circulation and liver in mice, while selective activation of MC1-R reduces cellular cholesterol content in cultured hepatocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity is recognized as a global epidemic and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caballero, 2007</xref>). In particular, visceral obesity is associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high levels of triglycerides (TG), TG-rich lipoproteins, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grundy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klop et al., 2013</xref>). The liver plays a central role in this pathogenetic process as a regulator of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. As a consequence of hepatic dysregulation, de novo production and storage of cholesterol and fatty acids are enhanced leading to lipid accumulation in the liver, which eventually manifests as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehl and Day, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Than and Newsome, 2015</xref>). Novel therapeutic strategies to enhance clearance and reduce excessive production of cholesterol and fatty acids in the liver are needed to mitigate the burden of obesity-associated dyslipidemia, NAFLD, and associated cardiovascular complications such as atherosclerosis.</p><p>Melanocortins are a family of peptide hormones that are proteolytically cleaved from the precursor molecule proopiomelanocortin (POMC) to yield adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) and Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-MSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantz and Fong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith and Funder, 1988</xref>). Melanocortins bind to and activate five different G-protein coupled melanocortin receptor subtypes named from MC1-R to MC5-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gantz and Fong, 2003</xref>). Melanocortins and their receptors are expressed in the brain as well as in the periphery and regulate important physiological functions including skin pigmentation, sexual behavior, immune responses, and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catania et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wikberg and Mutulis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo et al., 2021</xref>). There has been wide interest in melanocortin receptors as potential drug targets and in fact, melanocortin receptor-targeted drugs have been recently approved for the treatment of rare skin diseases and genetic obesity syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montero-Melendez et al., 2022</xref>). MC1-R was the first member of the melanocortin receptor family to be cloned and it binds only Î±-MSH with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mountjoy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mountjoy et al., 1992</xref>). MC1-R is abundantly expressed in melanocytes in the skin and is thus implicated as an integral regulator of skin pigmentation. MC1-R expression has been also demonstrated on a variety of peripheral cells including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Becher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catania et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmeyer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reichrath and Girndt, 2005</xref>). Accordingly, increasing evidence demonstrates that MC1-R mediates potent and wide-ranging anti-inflammatory actions by suppressing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while simultaneously increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catania et al., 2004</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>MC1R/Mc1r</italic> mRNA has also been detected in the human and rat liver following the testing of a hypothesis that MC-Rs might modulate inflammation in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malik et al., 2012</xref>). However, these early studies aimed to only characterize the expression profile of different MC-Rs in the liver, and the functional role of hepatic MC1-R has thereby remained unexplored.</p><p>We have recently found that global deficiency of MC1-R signaling accelerates atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E knockout mice (<italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) by increasing arterial monocyte accumulation and by disturbing cholesterol and bile acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rinne et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, MC1-R deficient mice showed elevated cholesterol levels in the plasma and liver in conjunction with a distinct bile acid profile characterized by reduced primary and increased secondary bile acid levels. This phenotype could be, however, caused by multiple mechanisms leaving an open question of whether MC1-R in the liver has a regulatory role in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. In the present study, we aimed to address this question by engineering a hepatocyte-specific MC1-R knock-out mouse model. We here show that the loss of MC1-R signaling in hepatocytes causes hypercholesterolemia and enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver, and disturbs bile acid metabolism. Moreover, using HepG2 cells as an in vitro model, we found that Î±-MSH and selective MC1-R activation reduced cellular cholesterol content and enhanced uptake of LDL and HDL. This study demonstrates that MC1-R is functionally active in the liver and regulates cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in a protective way that could also have therapeutic implications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency enhances cholesterol and lipid accumulation in the liver</title><p>We first aimed to investigate whether MC1-R is expressed in the mouse liver. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a strong and uniform expression of MC1-R in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining further revealed that MC1-R expression co-localizes with the hepatocyte marker serum albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) as well as with the cholangiocyte marker cytokeratin 19 and the monocyte and macrophage marker Mac-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), while no clear colocalization was observed in CD31-positive endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we sought to investigate whether the expression level of MC1-R in the liver is affected by feeding mice a cholesterol-rich Western diet. Remarkably, 12 weeks of Western diet feeding resulted in significant downregulation of the MC1-R mRNA level in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This result was further corroborated by Western blotting, which showed reduced protein expression of MC1-R in the liver of Western diet-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>).

First, we aimed to verify that human hepatocytes also express MC1-R. Indeed, HepG2 cells clearly express MC1-R protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). Consistent with the finding of reduced MC1-R expression in the liver of Western diet-fed mice, loading of HepG2 cells with palmitic acid (a saturated free fatty acid) caused a rapid decrease of MC1-R protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>). However, exposure of HepG2 cells to excess LDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>) or treatment with the HMGCR inhibitor atorvastatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>) to lower cellular cholesterol content did not change MC1-R protein level. Second, we studied how MC1-R activation affects cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells. For this purpose, HepG2 cells were stimulated with the endogenous MC1-R agonist Î±-MSH and the amount of cellular free cholesterol was quantified using Filipin staining. We observed that Î±-MSH (1 ÂµM) significantly decreased the free cholesterol content in HepG2 cells with an effect appearing after 3 hr and plateauing towards the 24 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In terms of concentration-responsiveness, cholesterol content was already reduced with a subnanomolar concentration (0.1 nM) of Î±-MSH, and the maximal response was achieved with 1 ÂµM Î±-MSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The reduction in cellular cholesterol was accompanied by significant increases in LDL and HDL uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>), as evaluated after 24 hr treatment with Î±-MSH using fluorescently labeled lipoprotein particles (Dil-LDL and Dil-HDL). In good agreement with these findings, gene expression analysis revealed that Î±-MSH upregulated LDL receptor (<italic>LDLR</italic>) and the HDL receptor SR-BI (<italic>SCARB1</italic>) mRNA levels in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). These effects were only apparent at a 3 hr time point, which probably reflects the short half-life of Î±-MSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Redding et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rudman et al., 1983</xref>). Nevertheless, upregulated <italic>LDLR</italic> and <italic>SCARB1</italic> mRNA levels translated into more sustained increases in the corresponding protein levels (LDLR and SR-BI) after Î±-MSH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5âsource data 1</xref>).

Since most MC-Rs are known to be coupled to Gs proteins, we first measured intracellular cAMP levels in Î±-MSH-treated HepG2 cells. However, Î±-MSH did not either increase or decrease cAMP levels, while the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, as a positive control, induced a robust increase in cAMP level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We also screened other potential signaling pathways of MC1-R and found that mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), are affected by Î±-MSH treatment. The highest concentration of Î±-MSH (1 ÂµM) reduced ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) at 5- and 15 min time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Second, hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency rendered mice susceptible to enhanced accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Loss of MC1-R signaling in hepatocytes disturbed also bile acid metabolism. Third, in vitro experiments using HepG2 cells revealed that triggering MC1-R signaling either with the endogenous ligand Î±-MSH or the selective MC1-R agonist LD211 reduced cellular cholesterol content and enhanced the uptake of HDL and LDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which are preventive mechanisms against hypercholesteremia and associated cardiovascular complications.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic figure illustrates the role of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1-R) in regulating cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis.</title><p>Hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency enhanced the accumulation of cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) in the liver, promoted fibrogenesis, and lead to a disturbance in bile acid metabolism.

Here, we show that the MC1-R is present also in the mouse liver where it localizes mainly in hepatocytes but also in other cell types such as cholangiocytes. Of note, hepatic MC1-R mRNA and protein levels were reduced after feeding mice a cholesterol-rich Western diet. Consistently, hepatic <italic>MC1R</italic> expression was downregulated in patients with NAFLD or NASH. We also analyzed MC1-R expression in HepG2 cells to gain further insight into the regulation of MC1-R expression in hepatocytes. Intriguingly, acute changes in cellular cholesterol load, as produced by treatment with atorvastatin or LDL-cholesterol, did not affect the MC1-R protein level, while treatment with palmitic acid evoked an immediate reduction in MC1-R expression. These findings suggest that cholesterol per se does not regulate MC1-R expression but it might be rather modulated by inflammatory processes that are triggered by lipid overload.</p><p>To investigate the regulatory role of hepatic MC1-R, we generated Mc1r LKO mice and found that hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency induced hypercholesteremia and higher liver weight, which was accompanied by increased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the liver. Mc1r LKO mice closely phenocopied the features of <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with global deficiency of MC1-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rinne et al., 2018</xref>), which displayed enhanced hypercholesteremia and cholesterol accumulation in the liver. Thus, the present findings suggest that the disturbed cholesterol metabolism previously observed in global MC1-R deficient mice was attributable to the loss of MC1-R signaling in hepatocytes. The precise mechanism leading to enhanced hepatic lipid accumulation and hypercholesterolemia in Mc1r LKO mice is not yet clear. Under normal physiological conditions, SREBP1c preferentially activates the genes of fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthesis pathway, while SREBP2 is considered as the master regulator of cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hua et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yokoyama et al., 1993</xref>). In the presence of excess cellular cholesterol, transcriptional induction and posttranslational activation of SREBP2 are suppressed, which, in turn, downregulates <italic>Hmgcr</italic> and <italic>Dhcr7</italic> and reduces cholesterol synthesis as a counterregulatory mechanism. Therefore, given the increase in hepatic cholesterol content, it was expected that HMGCR and DHCR7 protein levels were reduced in the liver of Mc1r LKO mice. These data, in combination with the finding that MC1-R activation did not affect HMGCR or DHCR7 expression in HepG2 cells, could indicate that hepatic MC1-R signaling does not directly control cholesterol synthesis. Although the phenotype observed in Mc1r LKO mice might be, at least partly, caused by disturbed cholesterol conversion into bile acids, further research is warranted to dissect the exact mechanism by which hepatic MC-1R deficiency triggers hypercholesterolemia and enhanced lipid accumulation in the liver.</p><p>A central feature of the Mc1r LKO mouse model was liver steatosis that occurred on a normal chow diet and without any signs of increased susceptibility for obesity. Although the precise mechanisms leading to NAFLD remain unclear, human and animal studies have shown that under normal caloric intake, the development of NAFLD is strongly associated with disturbance in liver cholesterol metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kainuma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Min et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simonen et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the increased levels of plasma and liver cholesterol in Mc1r LKO mice may have secondarily led to the accumulation of triglycerides. Simple steatosis can progress to NASH that is characterized by progressive inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Mc1r LKO mice showed enhanced liver fibrosis without any signs of elevated inflammation. Persistent lipid overload and consequent lipotoxicity could be the cause of fibrosis in Mc1r LKO mice. However, MC1-R signaling has been shown to mediate anti-fibrotic effects and protect against skin fibrosis and systemic sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">BÃ¶hm and Stegemann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kondo et al., 2022</xref>), which opens the possibility that hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency directly induces fibrogenesis. This view is further supported by the finding that selective MC1-R activation down-regulated fibrotic genes in HepG2 cells.</p><p>Mc1r LKO mice also displayed a unique bile acid profile with reduced secondary bile acid levels, particularly in the plasma and feces. Furthermore, the ratio of CA to CDCA was reduced in the plasma of Mc1r LKO mice. This phenotype recapitulates some of the key features observed in mice with global deficiency of MC1-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rinne et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the relative amount of CA and the ratio of CA to CDCA were reduced in both mouse models. In the quest for a possible explanation for this phenotype, we found that CYP8B1 was upregulated both at the mRNA and protein level in the liver of Mc1r LKO mice. This contradicts the finding of a reduced CA:CDCA ratio, which is predominantly determined by the enzymatic activity of CYP8B1 that is required for CA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang, 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that BA synthesis <italic>via</italic> the classical pathway is disturbed in Mc1r LKO mice due to dysfunctional CYP8B1, which leads to a compensatory enhancement of BA synthesis <italic>via</italic> the alternative pathway. This could explain the upregulation of StAR and CYP27A1, which operate in the mitochondria to feed the alternative BA pathway. Under physiological conditions, the majority of BAs are produced by the classical pathway, while in liver diseases such as NAFLD, the alternative BA pathway may become more dominant when compensating disturbances in the classical BA synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crosignani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lake et al., 2013</xref>). Patients with NASH and NASH-driven hepatocellular carcinoma have also been reported to have increased hepatic StAR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caballero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conde de la Rosa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In terms of BA transport, the upregulation of NTCP and downregulation of MRP4 in Mc1r LKO mice might also indicate compensatory changes to disrupted BA synthesis. Increased NTCP is likely to enhance BA uptake from the portal circulation and thus enterohepatic circulation of BAs, while reduced MRP4 expression prevents excessive spillover of BAs into the systemic circulation. These changes synergistically help to maintain the liver BA pool in the presence of disturbed BA synthesis. Reduced MRP4 expression in Mc1r LKO mice also provides a mechanistic explanation for the finding of reduced BA levels in the plasma. It remains, however, to be determined whether the dysregulated BA metabolism contributes to the hypercholesteremia and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in Mc1r LKO mice. For instance, CYP7A1 deficiency in both humans and mice causes hypercholesterolemic phenotype with increased hepatic cholesterol content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pullinger et al., 2002</xref>). Because there is a reciprocal interaction between fatty liver disease and dysregulated BA metabolism, it is difficult to determine whether MC1-R deficiency per se disturbs BA metabolism or whether enhanced lipid accumulation in Mc1r LKO mice causes a defect in BA metabolism. However, in vitro experiments with HepG2 cells support the notion that hepatic MC1-R signaling might directly affect BA metabolism, since treatment with the endogenous MC1-R agonist Î±-MSH modestly increased CYP8B1 expression, CA synthesis, and CA:CDCA ratio. Furthermore, considering that MC1-R was expressed also in cholangiocytes and that Cre recombinase is known to be active in cholangiocytes of <italic>Alb<sup>Cre</sup></italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemaigre, 2015</xref>), it is plausible that deficiency of MC1-R signaling in cholangiocytes contributes to the defect of BA metabolism in Mc1r LKO mice. Cholangiocytes in co-operation with hepatocytes are responsible for bile formation and secretion but these cells also significantly contribute to bile modification by absorbing bile acids and other molecules from the biliary tree and returning them to the liver sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tabibian et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In good agreement with our findings in Mc1r LKO mice, in vitro experiments using HepG2 cells demonstrated that triggering MC1-R signaling with the endogenous agonist Î±-MSH or the synthetic agonist LD211 induced a reverse phenotype, namely reduction in cellular cholesterol content. MC1-R activation was also associated with enhanced LDL and HDL uptake in HepG2 cells. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis (e.g. by statins) is known to similarly reduce cellular cholesterol levels in hepatocytes, which, in turn, upregulates LDL-R and reduces plasma total and LDL cholesterol. In the case of MC1-R activation, the increase in LDL-R expression and LDL uptake might be partly independent of the effect on cellular cholesterol content, since the upregulation of LDL-R occurred rapidly after Î±-MSH treatment (at 1 hr time point) and before any noticeable change in cellular cholesterol level. Therefore, the data suggest that the upregulation of LDL-R, as well as SR-BI, is attributable mainly to direct transcriptional induction by MC1-R signaling. Supporting the therapeutic relevance of this finding, we had previously observed that chronic treatment of atherosclerotic mice with a selective MC1-R agonist increased LDL-R expression in the liver and reduced plasma total cholesterol concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rinne et al., 2017</xref>). The underlying mechanism remained obscure in that study, but the present findings suggest that the upregulation of LDL-R expression was a consequence of MC1-R activation in hepatocytes. In the current study, we also found that MC1-R activation reduced cellular cholesterol content in HepG2 cells but we were unable to pinpoint the exact molecular-level mechanism for this effect. Since we did not observe any change in the expression of the major cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes (HMGCR or DHCR7), we speculate that MC1-R signaling might inhibit other enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway or modulate the phosphorylation state of HMGCR that determines its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burg and Espenshade, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition to other mechanisms, enhanced cholesterol turnover into BAs, as evidenced by increased CA production and CYP8B1 expression in Î±-MSH-treated HepG2 cells, might reduce cellular cholesterol content. In any case, these data uncover a functional role for MC1-R signaling in hepatic cholesterol metabolism that might be of therapeutic relevance in the management of hypercholesterolemia.</p><p>In terms of intracellular signaling, MC1-R activation in HepG2 cells evoked phosphorylation of AMPK and inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK without any effect on cAMP levels. Melanocortin receptors are classically coupled to Gs protein and cAMP-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodrigues et al., 2015</xref>), but the present findings demonstrate that the MC1-R-mediated effects on cholesterol metabolism occur in a cAMP-independent manner. Mechanistic experiments further revealed that the reduction of cellular cholesterol level by Î±-MSH was partially reversed after AMPK inhibition with dorsomorphine. However, in the presence of dorsomorphine, low concentrations of Î±-MSH were still effective in reducing cellular cholesterol content and the concentration-response closely mirrored the profiles observed in p-JNK and p-ERK1/2 levels in Î±-MSH-treated HepG2 cells (i.e. U-shaped concentration-response). These results suggest that the Î±-MSH-mediated reduction in cellular cholesterol content relies on multiple pathways involving AMPK and MAPK signaling pathways. On the other hand, the cholesterol-lowering effect of the selective MC1-R agonist LD211 appeared to be completely dependent on AMPK phosphorylation, which might indicate that this synthetic agonist has a stronger signaling bias toward the AMPK pathway compared to Î±-MSH. Early in vitro studies have established that AMPK activation reduces cholesterol synthesis by inducing an inactivating phosphorylation of HMGCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke and Hardie, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinberg and Kemp, 2009</xref>), while inhibition of AMPK increases cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol accumulation in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loh et al., 2018</xref>). The link between MAPK signaling and cholesterol metabolism has not been widely studied but in vitro experiments using HepG2 cells have demonstrated that ERK1/2 activation phosphorylates SREBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotzka et al., 2004</xref>), which, in turn, is likely to induce e.g., <italic>HMGCR</italic> transcription. The role of hepatic JNK signaling is even less clear in this regard, but some evidence demonstrates that it contributes to diet-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis as well as to cholesterol and BA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manieri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manieri and Sabio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vernia et al., 2014</xref>). Against this background, it is plausible that both AMPK phosphorylation and inhibition of ERK1/2 and JNK signaling are involved in mediating the effects of Î±-MSH on cholesterol metabolism in hepatocytes. However, further experiments are warranted to dissect the exact signaling mechanism(s) of MC1-R activation that regulate cholesterol metabolism, e.g., to determine which G-protein subtype is involved in this regulation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study uncovers a novel role for MC1-R signaling in hepatic cholesterol and BA metabolism. Hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency increased plasma cholesterol and TG concentration, disturbed BA metabolism, and led to signs of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Conversely, MC1-R activation in hepatocytes reduced cellular cholesterol content and increased LDL and HDL uptake, which are preventive mechanisms against hypercholesterolemia and the progression of NAFLD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experiments were performed on adult (3â6 months) female mice.

After blocking with Tris-Buffered Saline (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.1% Tween 20 detergent (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5% skimmed milk (Carl Roth) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT), membranes were incubated with specific primary antibodies for MC1-R (Alomone Labs, #AMR-025), LDLR (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA, #NBP1-06709), SR-BI (NovusBio, #NB400-104), SREBP2 (Novus Biologicals, #NB100-74543), HMGCR (Novus Biologicals, #NBP2-66888), DHCR7 (abcam, #ab103296), MRP4 (Cell Signaling Tech, Frankfurt, DE, #12857), StAR (Cell Signaling Tech, #8449), CYP8B1 (St Johnâs Laboratory Ltd, #STJ92607), phospho-AMPKÎ± (Cell Signaling Tech, #2535), and AMPKÎ± (Cell Signaling Tech, #2532) over-night at +4 Â°C. Next day, membranes were washed and incubated with Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Tech) for 1 hr at RT. Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Millipore, MA, USA). Target protein expression was normalized to Î²-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, #2066) or vinculin (Bio-Rad, #MCA465GA) to correct for loading, and band densities were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Plasma and liver extract analyses</title><p>Plasma samples were obtained from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood after centrifugation. Plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were determined using enzymatic colorimetric assays (CHOD-PAP and GPO-PAP, mtiDiagnostics, Idstein, Germany) according to the manufacturerâs protocols. For the determination of hepatic lipid content, liver samples (~100 mg) were homogenized in 500 Âµl of PBS with 0.1% NP-40 (Abcam) using TissueLyser and then centrifuged to remove insoluble components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nuutinen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rinne et al., 2018</xref>). Cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations were quantified in the liver homogenates using CHOD-PAP and GPO-PAP reagents.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Bile acid measurements</title><p>Bile acids (BA) were measured in plasma, liver, and fecal samples.

A 170 uL aliquot of the supernatant was dried under a gentle flow of nitrogen and resuspended using 20 ÂµL resuspension solution (Methanol:water (40:60) with 5 ppb Perfluoro-n-[13C9]nonanoic acid as in injection standard). Blank samples were prepared by pipetting 200 Âµl crash solvent into a vial, then drying and resuspending them the same way as the other samples. Calibration curves were prepared by pipetting 20 Âµl of standard dilution into vials, adding 200 ÂµL crash solution, and drying and resuspending them in the same way as the other samples. The concentrations of the standard dilutions were between 0.0025 and 600 ppb.</p><p>Aliquots of 25 mg of liver were powdered using dry ice under a glass plate and transferred to a plastic tube. Water (100 Âµl) was added and the sample was sonicated for 30 s. For protein precipitation and extraction, 300 ul of acetonitrile was added and the samples were filtered using a Supelco protein precipitation filter plate. A 255 ul aliquot of the supernatant was dried under a gentle flow of nitrogen and resuspended using a 20 Âµl resuspension solution.</p><p>Feces were collected over 48 hr from individually housed mice. All fecal samples were freeze-dried prior to extraction to determine the dry weight and 20 Âµl of water was added for each mg of dry weight in the sample. The samples were homogenized by adding homogenizer beads, freezing samples to at least â70 Â°C, and homogenizing them for 5 min using a bead beater. BAs were extracted by adding 40 Âµl fecal homogenate to 400 Âµl crash solvent (methanol containing 62, 5 ppb each of the internal standards) and filtering them using a Supelco protein precipitation filter plate. The samples were dried and resuspended the same way as serum samples. QCs, blanks, and calibration curves were prepared similarly to plasma samples.</p><p>The LC separation was performed on a Sciex Exion AD 30 (AB Sciex Inc, Framingham, MA) LC system consisting of a binary pump, an autosampler set to 15 Â°C, and a column oven set to 35 Â°C. A waters Aquity UPLC HSS T3 (1.8 Âµm, 2.1 Ã 100 mm) column with a precolumn with the same material. Eluent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and eluent B was 0.1% formic acid in methanol. The gradient started from 15% B and increased to 30% B over 1 min. The gradient further increased to 70% B over 15 min. The gradient was further increased to 100% over 2 min. The gradient was held at 100% B for 4 min then decreased to 15% B over 0.1 min and re-equilibrated for 7.5 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and the injection volume was 5 ÂµL.</p><p>The mass spectrometer used for this method was a Sciex 5500 QTrap mass spectrometer operating in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode in negative mode.

As mentioned in the introduction (lines 84-87), MC1-R has been also demonstrated to be expressed in a variety of peripheral cells. Therefore, to unequivocally demonstrate that MC1-R is mainly expressed in these cells colocalization studies by confocal microscopy of MC1-R and different cell type markers (hepatocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblastsâ¦) are required. Without a robust expression of MC1-R exclusively in hepatocytes, further mechanistic studies are not fully justified.</p><p>3) Concerns regarding the specificity of the antibody used for both immunohistochemistry images in Figure 1A and western blotting analysis in Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1 might rise. As a receptor, MC1-R expected localization would be in the plasma membrane whereas on the presented histological images appears to have uniform immunostaining all over the cytoplasm. Likewise, blots in Supplementary Figure 1 show diverse unspecific bands. In this figure, is the lack of bands in HepG2 protein extract due to the species-specificity of the MC1-R antibody? What is the reason behind the use of mouse heart samples in this study?</p><p>4) If experimentally possible and/or publicly available data, expression levels of MC1-R in human liver samples from healthy vs. liver disease (hypercholesterolemia, NASH, NAFLDâ¦) will further strengthen your findings and add valuable translational value to your work.</p><p>5) The observation of that liver from L-MC1-R-/- mice exhibit signs indicative of fibrosis, but no changes were observed in pro-inflammatory genes is intriguing and deserves additional investigation. Does the expression of the fibrosis- and inflammation-related genes tested in the mice changes in the HepG2 under the different treatments employed?</p><p>6) Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data from Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5A should be provided as a supplementary table and raw data deposited in an appropriate public data repository with the corresponding mention in the method section. Moreover, a more detailed description of this methodology would be highly appreciated by the readers.</p><p>7) What is the biological relevance of the ratio of CA:CDCA observed in Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure 5B?</p><p>8) The dysregulation of genes involved in bile acid synthesis, uptake/secretion of bile acids, and nuclear receptors in the liver from KO mice is convincing at the mRNA level in Figures 4A-C. At the protein level (Figures 4D and E) it is unclear. Only two of these proteins were confirmed by western blotting studies (and another protein showed contradictory results). These studies are clearly insufficient in order to draw any valid conclusion. The potential changes of a meaningful number of genes should be validated by alternative methods.</p><p>9) Blot images presented in Figures 4D, 5A-C, and 5J, and Supplementary Figures 6C-D and 7E do not seem to have quality enough and/or be representative of their corresponding quantifications. Please replace them in accordance.</p><p>10) The use of HepG2 cells for the in vitro studies is not enough justified. This cellular model is not ideal for the study of metabolic disturbances and does not match some of the criteria used in the in vivo model (they are derived from a male child with hepatocellular carcinoma). It may be understood that they were used for initial screening purposes but selected, key aspects, of the study should be checked in primary hepatocytes from L-MC1-R-/- and control mice.</p><p>11) The decrease in MC1-R in HepG2 in response to palmitic acid, but not when exposed to LDL or atorvastatin, is an interesting observation. Based on what did you choose the selected concentration of these compounds to mimic the cholesterol-rich diet administrated to the animals?</p><p>12) The authors also show that Î±-MSH treatment reduced the lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. However, it is unclear whether the pathological mechanisms mediated by the downregulation of MC1-R in hepatocytes would be restored by the addition of Î±-MSH. Additional studies in which MC1-R expression can be manipulated may be needed. Similarly, it would also be worthwhile to use clinically approved melanocortin receptor-targeted drugs in these experiments.</p><p>13) The attempt to elucidate the intracellular signalling cascades that might be behind the beneficial effects of MC1-R in the liver is mostly appreciated. Nevertheless, in the present form, these investigations fail to pinpoint a specific mechanism leading to inconclusive results. It would be more convincing if the authors can perform transcriptomics or proteomics in primary hepatocytes from L-MC1-R-/- and control animals to pursue potential targets.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84782.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Justify the use of only female mice for in vivo studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of female mice was based on two main reasons. First, body composition was measured by quantitative NMR scanning, which according to our own experience, can provoke aggressive behavior in group-housed male mice due to cross-contamination of odors (etc. urine) between cages.

In line with the expression pattern of <italic>MC1R</italic> in the human liver, the colocalization studies demonstrate the presence of MC1-R in albumin-expressing hepatocytes (Figure 1B). In addition, MC1-R expression colocalized in CK19positive cholangiocytes and Mac2-positive monocytes/macrophages in the mouse liver, but not substantially in CD31-positive endothelial cells (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). These findings open the possibility for investigating the role of MC1R in other cell types of the liver in future studies. Importantly, supporting our initial hypothesis that MC1-R is involved in the regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in the liver, MC1-R was found to mainly colocalize in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes that are major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discuss the potential roles of MC1R in cholangiocytes in the modulation of bile acid homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important aspect of the study, which is supported by the finding of MC1-R expression in cholangiocytes (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1).

However, there was considerable residual MC1-R expression in L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which most likely reflects the presence of MC1-R in nonhepatocytes as discussed above (response to comment #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Determine the effects of HFD on disease progression in hepatic MC1R KO mice, or, determine the therapeutic potential of LD211 or MSH in reversing diet-induced obesity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we phenotyped the hepatic MC1R KO (L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup>) mice after feeding them a cholesterol- and fat-rich Western diet for 12 weeks (RD Western Diet, D12079B, Research Diets Inc, NJ, USA). This was exactly the same dietary regimen (product and duration) that was used to study the changes in hepatic MC1-R expression in wild-type C57Bl mice (Figure 1C and D). We observed that 12-week Western diet feeding induced a significant gain in body weight and total fat mass as well as an increase in plasma and hepatic cholesterol and TG levels (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not show a difference in body weight gain, but the weight gain was attributable to enhanced gain in fat mass and a blunted increase in lean mass compared to control Mc1r<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A, D and E). Furthermore, liver weight and plasma cholesterol and TG concentrations were unchanged in HFD-fed L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B, C, F and G). Importantly, recapitulating the phenotype observed in chow-fed mice, hepatic cholesterol and TG content was significantly increased in L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice after a HFD challenge (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2H and I). Taken together, it appears that the phenotype of HFD-fed L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice was slightly diluted compared to the phenotype observed in chow-fed L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This phenotypic difference might relate to the finding that Western diet feeding reduced the hepatic expression of MC1-R, thus limiting the incremental effect of genetically induced MC1-R deficiency on hypercholesterolemia and hepatic lipid accumulation.</p><p>We have previously studied the effects of pharmacological MC1-R activation in</p><p>Western diet-fed <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and observed that chronic treatment with a selective MC1-R agonist reduced plasma cholesterol level and upregulated hepatic <italic>Ldlr</italic> expression without affecting body weight gain (<italic>Rinne P et al., Circulation. 2017 Jul 4;136(1):83-97.</italic>). These findings are also discussed on manuscript page 12/ lines 475478. Although the selective MC1-R agonist was different in that particular study, it is expected that LD211 would also elicit a similar cholesterol-lowering effect in Western diet-fed mice. Chronic treatment with a-MSH, on the other hand, would likely produce wide-ranging metabolic effects. In addition to MC1-R activation in hepatocytes and its consequent effect on liver cholesterol metabolism, a-MSH would affect feeding, energy expenditure and cholesterol metabolism <italic>via</italic> MC4-R activation in the central nervous system as well as fatty acid and glucose metabolism <italic>via</italic> MC5-R activation in the skeletal muscle. Therefore, the phenotype associated with a-MSH treatment would be complex and mediated by multiple mechanisms and MC-R subtypes, thus making it difficult to interpret the exact contribution of hepatic MC1-R signaling to the observed phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Assess MC1R expression in cholangiocytes via IHC.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we did a double immunofluorescence staining using MC1-R antibody in combination with an antibody against cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) (<italic>He L et al., Nat.

Although the selective MC1-R agonist was different in that particular study, it is expected that LD211 would also elicit a similar cholesterol-lowering effect in Western diet-fed mice. Chronic treatment with a-MSH, on the other hand, would likely produce wide-ranging metabolic effects. In addition to MC1-R activation in hepatocytes and its consequent effect on liver cholesterol metabolism, a-MSH would affect feeding, energy expenditure and cholesterol metabolism <italic>via</italic> MC4-R activation in the central nervous system as well as fatty acid and glucose metabolism <italic>via</italic> MC5-R activation in the skeletal muscle.</p><p>Therefore, the phenotype associated with a-MSH treatment would be complex and mediated by multiple mechanisms and MC-R subtypes, thus making it difficult to interpret the exact contribution of hepatic MC1-R signaling to the observed phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below follows specific questions and comments:</p><p>1) Please justify the use of only female mice for in vivo studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of female mice was based on two main reasons. First, body composition was measured by quantitative NMR scanning, which according to our own experience, can provoke aggressive behavior in group-housed male mice due to cross-contamination of odors (etc. urine) between cages. Second, we had previously observed that pharmacological activation of MC1-R reduced plasma cholesterol level and induced hepatic <italic>Ldlr</italic> expression in female <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (as discussed on manuscript page 12, lines 475-479), which further supported the preferential use of female mice in the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although immunohistochemistry images in Figure 1A demonstrating the presence of MC1-R in the liver are convincing and understanding that since hepatocytes represent the more abundant cell type in this organ is plausible to conclude that MC1-R is mainly expressed in these cells, these images do not fully support this conclusion. As mentioned in the introduction (lines 84-87), MC1-R has been also demonstrated to be expressed in a variety of peripheral cells. Therefore, to unequivocally demonstrate that MC1-R is mainly expressed in these cells colocalization studies by confocal microscopy of MC1-R and different cell type markers (hepatocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, fibroblastsâ¦) are required. Without a robust expression of MC1-R exclusively in hepatocytes, further mechanistic studies are not fully justified.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering that MC1-R is widely expressed in various tissues and cell types, it is very likely that MC1-R is also present in other cell types of the liver besides hepatocytes. Our initial objective was to assess whether MC1-R is expressed in the liver/hepatocytes (and not to specifically investigate its expression in nonhepatocytes). The presence of MC1-R in the liver/hepatocytes gave us the rationale to engineer the hepatocyte-specific MC1-R KO mouse model to investigate the functional significance of MC1-R in the liver. As suggested by the reviewer, we performed double immunofluorescence staining with the MC1-R antibody in combination with antibodies against cell type-specific markers to further investigate the localization of MC1-R in the liver and to validate its presence in hepatocytes. Importantly, these colocalization studies demonstrate the presence of MC1-R in albumin-expressing hepatocytes (Figure 1B). In addition, MC1-R expression colocalized in cholangiocytes and monocytes/macrophages in the mouse liver (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1), but not substantially in endothelial cells (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). We do not however understand the reviewerâs comment: âWithout a robust expression of MC1-R exclusively in hepatocytes, further mechanistic studies are not fully justifiedâ. Why would MC1-R expression in other cell types nullify the justification for studying the role of MC1-R in hepatocytes? As stated in the introduction (page 3, lines 101-108), our hypothesis was based on the previous findings of disturbed cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis in global MC1-R deficient mice. Therefore, we turned our attention to the liver and more specifically to hepatocytes, which are major regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and bile acid synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concerns regarding the specificity of the antibody used for both immunohistochemistry images in Figure 1A and western blotting analysis in Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1 might rise. As a receptor, MC1-R expected localization would be in the plasma membrane whereas on the presented histological images appears to have uniform immunostaining all over the cytoplasm. Likewise, blots in Supplementary Figure 1 show diverse unspecific bands. In this figure, is the lack of bands in HepG2 protein extract due to the species-specificity of the MC1-R antibody? What is the reason behind the use of mouse heart samples in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these remarks. Regarding Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure 1 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 in the revised submission), the multiple bands on the Western blot most likely represent native, oligomerized and glycosylated forms of MC1-R as have been previously reported and characterized (<italic>SÃ¡nchez-Laorden BL et al., J Invest Dermatol. 2006 Jan;126(1):172-81</italic>). Furthermore, all the major bands disappeared in the presence of molar excess of a blocking MC1-R peptide (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2), which indicates that the additional bands were not unspecific. The lack of bands in HepG2 cell extracts in this context might be caused by a considerably difference in the expression level of MC-1R between the samples, since the antibody has been tested to react also with human MC1-R. Mouse heart samples were included as a positive control in Supplementary Figure 3, since they are a rich source of endothelial cells, which are known to express MC1-R. Mouse heart samples have been also used in the antibody testing by other companies (<italic>e.g.</italic> https://www.novusbio.com/products/melanocortin-1-r-mc1rantibody_nbp3-02970).</p><p>Regarding the MC1-R immunohistochemistry, it is indeed somewhat unexpected that the positive signal mainly localizes to cytoplasm. However, the appearance of MC1-R positive cells is highly similar with the images provided by the manufacturer (https://www.elabscience.com/p-mc1r_polyclonal_antibody-35168.html) as well as with the images published in other papers (e.g. <italic>Salazar-Onfray F et al., Br J Cancer. 2002 Aug 12;87(4):414-22</italic> and <italic>Cai W at al, Mol Neurodegener. 2022 Feb 23;17(1):16</italic>). It is known that a significant proportion of total MC1-R is internalized and localize to the cytoplasm, particularly in the presence of endogenous/exogenous agonist, which in part explains the expression pattern of MC1-R in the immunohistochemical images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If experimentally possible and/or publicly available data, expression levels of MC1-R in human liver samples from healthy vs. liver disease (hypercholesterolemia, NASH, NAFLDâ¦) will further strengthen your findings and add valuable translational value to your work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which would indeed add valuable translational value to the study. To this end, we used RNA sequencing data deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE120064) to study <italic>MC1R</italic> expression in human liver biopsy samples from patients diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH and from healthy obese control cases (<italic>Govaere O et al., Sci Transl Med. 2020 Dec 2;12(572)</italic>). In good agreement with the findings in Western diet-fed mice, hepatic <italic>MC1R</italic> expression was significantly downregulated.in NAFLD and NASH patients (log2 fold change=-1.1 for both comparisons) (Figure 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The observation of that liver from L-MC1-R-/- mice exhibit signs indicative of fibrosis, but no changes were observed in pro-inflammatory genes is intriguing and deserves additional investigation. Does the expression of the fibrosis- and inflammation-related genes tested in the mice changes in the HepG2 under the different treatments employed?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point, which we addressed by analyzing fibrotic and inflammatory gene expression in a-MSH- and LD211-treated HepG2 cells. We found that low concentration (0.1 nM) of LD211 downregulated the expression of fibrotic genes such as <italic>TGFB1</italic>, <italic>ACTA2</italic> and <italic>COL1A1</italic> without affecting the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). The concentration-response profile thereby mirrors the changes observed in ERK1/2 and <italic>JNK</italic> phosphorylation (Figure 7B and C, Figure 7âfigure supplement 2), which are known to contribute to liver fibrosis (<italic>Jeng K-S et al., Int J Mol Sci. 2020 May 27;21(11):3796</italic> and <italic>Kluwe J et al., Gastroenterology. 2010 Jan;138(1):347-59</italic>). No significant changes were observed in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Likewise, low concentration of a-MSH appeared to downregulate the expression of the fibrotic genes <italic>TGFB1</italic> and <italic>COL1A1</italic> (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1), but these changes did not reach statistical significance (P=0.08 and 0.051, respectively). These findings suggest that hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency could directly promote liver fibrosis in <italic>L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as discussed on manuscript page 11/lines 413-417.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data from Figure 3 and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5A should be provided as a supplementary table and raw data deposited in an appropriate public data repository with the corresponding mention in the method section. Moreover, a more detailed description of this methodology would be highly appreciated by the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now provided the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data as source data-files. Furthermore, we added a more detailed description of the BA analysis in the âMaterials and methodsâ section (page 16-17, lines 662-723).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What is the biological relevance of the ratio of CA:CDCA observed in Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure 5B?</p></disp-quote><p>The ratio of CA:CDCA reflects the contribution of the classical and alternative pathways to bile acid synthesis and is largely determined by the enzymatic activity of CYP8B1. Thus, reduced CA:CDCA ratio in L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice might indicate compromised CYP8B1 activity as discussed on manuscript page 11/lines 424-437.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The dysregulation of genes involved in bile acid synthesis, uptake/secretion of bile acids, and nuclear receptors in the liver from KO mice is convincing at the mRNA level in Figures 4A-C. At the protein level (Figures 4D and E) it is unclear. Only two of these proteins were confirmed by western blotting studies (and another protein showed contradictory results). These studies are clearly insufficient in order to draw any valid conclusion. The potential changes of a meaningful number of genes should be validated by alternative methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We aimed to validate those genes at the protein level that could potentially explain the observed BA profile in LMc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice. It is not uncommon that mRNA level and corresponding protein product of a gene are showing opposite effects. For example, reduced protein level (due to enhanced degradation) could lead to a compensatory increase in mRNA level and the other way around. Therefore, we do not consider the results in Figure 4A and B vs 4D and E to be contradictory, but they rather help to resolve the possible mechanisms leading to disturbed bile acid metabolism in in L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We acknowledge that the data does not allow making a conclusion on the exact mechanism, but based on the observed reduction in CA:CDCA ratio and changes in CYP8B1 expression, we speculate that MC1-R deficiency primarily disturbs BA synthesis <italic>via</italic> the classical pathways, leading to compensatory changes in the expression of BA transporters and enzymes involved in the alternative BA synthesis pathway. The results are discussed in more detail on manuscript pages 11/lines 428-445.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Blot images presented in Figures 4D, 5A-C, and 5J, and Supplementary Figures 6C-D and 7E do not seem to have quality enough and/or be representative of their corresponding quantifications. Please replace them in accordance.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment and have now replaced the representative blot images as requested. However, based on the low quality of the blot images obtained with phospho-Akt and total Akt antibodies, we decided to exclude the Supplementary Figures 6D-E and 7E (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 7figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). This does not affect the conclusions of the manuscript because the underlying mechanisms appear to be independent of Akt phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The use of HepG2 cells for the in vitro studies is not enough justified. This cellular model is not ideal for the study of metabolic disturbances and does not match some of the criteria used in the in vivo model (they are derived from a male child with hepatocellular carcinoma). It may be understood that they were used for initial screening purposes but selected, key aspects, of the study should be checked in primary hepatocytes from L-MC1-R-/- and control mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that HepG2 cells are not an ideal in vitro model to study certain aspects of hepatocyte biology. Despite the apparent differences between HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes, comparative studies have demonstrated that these models have similar properties in terms of cholesterol metabolism (<italic>Nagarajan SR et al., Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2019 Apr 1;316(4):E578-E589</italic> and <italic>Wang SR et al., Biochim Biophys Acta. 1988 Aug 12;961(3):351-63</italic>). More importantly, the central model of the study is the hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficient mice that were used to test the hypothesis that MC1-R is expressed in hepatocytes and involved in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. Having noted a phenotype of enhanced lipid accumulation in L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we proceeded to investigate the direct actions and underlying mechanisms of aMSH and the selective MC1-R agonist in HepG2 cells. Without the in vivo evidence, it would be more critical to investigate whether the key responses observed in HepG2 cells are also recapitulated in primary hepatocytes.</p><p>We originally planned to address the reviewerâs comment by isolating primary hepatocytes from <italic>L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and control mice. However, after producing new mice for the in vivo experiment (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2), we have had major difficulties in expanding and even maintaining this mouse colony. Therefore, we have not been able to perform these experiments within a reasonable time frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The decrease in MC1-R in HepG2 in response to palmitic acid, but not when exposed to LDL or atorvastatin, is an interesting observation. Based on what did you choose the selected concentration of these compounds to mimic the cholesterol-rich diet administrated to the animals?</p></disp-quote><p>The concentrations of palmitic acid, LDL and atorvastatin were selected based on previous publications that have demonstrated these concentrations to evoke significant biological responses in terms of lipid and cholesterol loading (<italic>Hae Seo M et al., PLoS One. 2016 Dec 1;11(12)</italic> and <italic>Feng J et al., Commun Biol. 2019 May 8;2:173.</italic>) and cholesterol depletion (<italic>e.g. Mohammadi A et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 1998 May;18(5):783-93</italic>.), respectively. The purpose was not to specifically mimic the cholesterol-rich diet administered to the animals, because it is highly challenging to estimate the exposure of hepatocytes in vivo to different components of the diet. Furthermore, even if the exposure could be estimated, HepG2 cells might respond to the treatments at a different concentration compared to primary hepatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors also show that Î±-MSH treatment reduced the lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. However, it is unclear whether the pathological mechanisms mediated by the downregulation of MC1-R in hepatocytes would be restored by the addition of Î±-MSH. Additional studies in which MC1-R expression can be manipulated may be needed. Similarly, it would also be worthwhile to use clinically approved melanocortin receptor-targeted drugs in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We do not however understand what the reviewer means by â<italic>it is unclear whether the pathological mechanisms mediated by the downregulation of MC1-R in hepatocytes would be restored by the addition of</italic> a<italic>-MSH</italic>.â MC1-R deficiency/downregulation in hepatocytes is likely to disturb the signaling mediated by the endogenous MC1-R agonist a-MSH as well as to lead to pathological changes even in the absence of aMSH, considering that MC1-R possesses agonist-independent constitutive activity (<italic>e.g. SÃ¡nchez-MÃ¡s J et al., Pigment Cell Res. 2004 Aug;17(4):386-95</italic>). The addition of a-MSH to a MC1-R deficient model is likely to evoke signaling <italic>via</italic> other MC-R subtypes (and MC1-R in other tissues/cell types) and could thus potentially restore some pathophysiological mechanisms caused by hepatocyte-specific MC1-R deficiency/MC1-R downregulation. We do not however anticipate that addition of aMSH would restore MC1-R expression/activity in hepatocytes and therefore, this kind of experiment would not help in unraveling the role of MC1-R signaling in hepatocytes. Likewise, the use of clinically approved melanocortin receptor-targeted drugs in these experiments would involve significant uncertainty in evaluating the contribution of MC1-R-dependent signaling on the observed effects, since none of these drugs is selective for MC1-R.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The attempt to elucidate the intracellular signalling cascades that might be behind the beneficial effects of MC1-R in the liver is mostly appreciated. Nevertheless, in the present form, these investigations fail to pinpoint a specific mechanism leading to inconclusive results. It would be more convincing if the authors can perform transcriptomics or proteomics in primary hepatocytes from L-MC1-R-/- and control animals to pursue potential targets.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed transcriptomics/RNA sequencing analysis for liver samples from L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> and control mice. Unfortunately, we did not have sufficient number of mice with desired genotypes to be used for primary hepatocyte isolation and subsequent transcriptomics. Thus, we needed to perform transcriptomics using previously collected liver samples. A Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the liver of chow-fed L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> (n=4) versus L-Mc1r<sup>+/-</sup> mice (n=4) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>.

In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for gene ontology revealed only one significant term: extracellular space (adjusted Pvalue: 0.0071, number of genes: 55).Taken together, the results of RNA-seq analysis do not provide clear answers that would help in identifying potential targets that could explain the observed phenotype in L-Mc1r<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therefore, we would rather omit these data from the main manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
