antioxidants. Nevertheless, little is known about its environmental behavior and no bacteria have been reported to use it as the growth substrate. Herein, we describe a pathway for 1NA degradation in the isolate <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain JS3066, determine the structure and mechanism of the enzyme NpaA1 that catalyzes the initial reaction, and reveal how the pathway evolved. From genetic and enzymatic analysis, a five gene-cluster encoding a dioxygenase system was determined to be responsible for the initial steps in 1NA degradation through glutamylation of 1NA. The γ-glutamylated 1NA was subsequently oxidized to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene which was further degraded by the well-established pathway of naphthalene degradation via catechol. A glutamine synthetase-like (GS-like) enzyme (NpaA1) initiates 1NA glutamylation, and this enzyme exhibits a broad substrate selectivity toward a variety of anilines and naphthylamine derivatives. Structural analysis revealed that the aromatic residues in the 1NA entry tunnel and the V201 site in the large substrate-binding pocket significantly influence NpaA1’s substrate preferences. The findings enhance understanding of degrading polycyclic aromatic amines, and will also enable the application of bioremediation at naphthylamine contaminated sites.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pseudomonas</kwd><kwd>1-Naphthylamine</kwd><kwd>Glutamine synthetase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA0909500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Ning-Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100022886</institution-id><institution>Chemours Corporate Remediation Group</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spain</surname><given-names>Jim C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Elucidating the 1-naphthylamine degradation pathway in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain JS3066 and analyzing the catalytic mechanism of the 1-naphthylamine glutamine synthetase deepens the understanding of microbial degradation of polycyclic aromatic amines.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aromatic amines include monocyclic aromatic amines, such as aniline and chlorinated derivatives, and polycyclic aromatic amines, such as naphthylamine and its derivatives. Aromatic amines have been widely utilized as raw materials for manufacturing dyes, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palmiotto et al., 2001</xref>). Anthropogenic activities have led to their widespread release into the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akyüz and Ata, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupret et al., 2011</xref>). The United States produced 1050 thousand metric tons of aniline in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Council, 2023</xref>). Meanwhile, China’s export volume of 1-naphthylamine, 2-naphthylamine, and their derivatives amounted to 19.8 thousand metric tons in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Network, 2018</xref>). Several aromatic amines are potentially harmful to human health, with both aniline and naphthylamines increasing the risk of bladder tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferraz et al., 2012</xref>). These compounds are often found in mixtures in the environment as impurities or by-products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">IARC, 1974</xref>). Although various aromatic amines cause environmental pollution and threaten human health, their transport and fate are poorly understood.</p><p>Currently, only a few anilines and their derivatives have been reported to be degraded by microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Król et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qu and Spain, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeo et al., 2013</xref>). Under aerobic conditions, microbial degradation plays a major role in the elimination of aniline, and the molecular basis has been well-established in several bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukumori and Saint, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Król et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeo et al., 2013</xref>). The aniline dioxygenase (AD) enzyme system is responsible for converting aniline to catechol, which is then assimilated via the widespread <italic>meta</italic>/<italic>ortho</italic>-cleavage pathways. AD comprises a γ-glutamylanilide synthase, a glutamine amidotransferase (GAT)-like enzyme, and a two-component Rieske-type aromatic compound dioxygenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeo et al., 2013</xref>). The γ-glutamylanilide synthase catalyzes ATP-dependent ligation of L-glutamate to aniline to generate γ-glutamylanilide (γ-GA). Due to the cytotoxicity of high concentration of γ-GA, the GAT-like enzyme can hydrolyze γ-GA to aniline so as to maintain γ-GA at a proper level inside the cell. Subsequently, the dioxygenase catalyzes the transformation of γ-GA to catechol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeo et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies established that the γ-glutamylanilide synthetase and oxygenase of AD play dominant roles in the substrate specificity of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). To enhance the engineering potential of AD systems, the structure and mechanism of the oxygenase have been revealed to broaden its substrate range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 2007</xref>). However, limited research has been conducted on the γ-glutamylanilide synthetase.</p><p>In contrast to the well-established degradation of anilines, little is known about the environmental fate and biodegradation of 1NA, and bacteria able to assimilate it have not been reported. Here, we report the isolation of an aerobic bacterial strain able to use both 1NA and aniline as growth substrates through selective enrichment with samples from a 1NA-manufacturing site. Detailed investigations established the degradation pathway of 1NA and the genes encoding the enzymes involved. An enzyme system homologous to the AD system mentioned above catalyzes glutamylation of 1NA and subsequent oxidation of the product to dihydroxynaphthalene. Previous research has suggested that the substrate specificity of the glutamylating enzyme, which is responsible for the initial glutamylation of aromatic amines, plays a crucial role in determining the range of substrates that can be degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we elucidated the detailed structure and mechanism underlying its substrate specificity. The results will enable us to predict and enhance 1NA biodegradation at contaminated sites and provide the basis for a better understanding of the degradation of other polycyclic aromatic amines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain JS3066 is a 1NA degrader</title><p>Selective enrichment with 1NA as the growth substrate yielded an isolate that grew aerobically on 1NA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The replication initiator protein TrfA of plasmid pJS3066 shares 100% amino acid sequence identity with that of plasmid pTP6, which indicates that pJS3066 likely belongs to the IncP-1β subgroup of plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stenger and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thorsted et al., 1996</xref>). Collectively, the whole genome of strain JS3066 is 6,202,908 bp with an average G+C content of 62.95%.</p><p>The ability of the isolate to degrade aniline coupled with the fact that 1NA is an analog of aniline prompted the hypothesis that the initial reactions of 1NA and aniline catabolism might be mediated by the similar genetic determinants within strain JS3066.

Then the abilities of recombinant KT/pNPA01 (including <italic>npaA1A2A3A4A5</italic> genes) and its derivatives to metabolize 1NA were analyzed.

This indicates that NpaA1 is an essential component in the conversion of 1NA, while NpaA2 is not necessary. According to sequence alignment, NpaA2 is a GAT-like protein, sharing 98% sequence identity with AtdA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeo et al., 2013</xref>).

The corresponding entry for 1NA in NpaA1 is surrounded by a long loop V68’-M81’ which is located on part of the 15<sup>th</sup> motif in the N-terminal domain of the adjacent monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). The unique loop V68’-M81’ seems to form part of the active pocket leading to a larger and more hydrophobic cavity (318.17 Å<sup>3</sup>) compared to that of the <italic>St</italic>GS protein (PDB ID:1F1H; 163.83 Å<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The enriched hydrophobic residues on the 15<sup>th</sup> motif of loop V68’-M81’ (A69’, I70’, G71’, P72’, and F75’) stabilize the aromatic ring of 1NA through hydrophobic interaction. The volume of the large pocket in NpaA1 is sufficient to accommodate 1NA, which also allows NpaA1 to accommodate a wider range of substrates. The 15<sup>th</sup> motif is present in the majority of GoaS enzymes responsible for catalyzing the glutamylation of organic amines. Similarly, GmaS, which possesses the 15<sup>th</sup> motif, also acts on organic amines as substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The 15<sup>th</sup> motif is situated in the vicinity of the active pocket in GmaS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) and GoaS, suggesting that this motif may play a role in facilitating the binding of organic compounds in these GS-like enzymes.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Residues involved in 1-Naphthylamine (1NA) binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The 1NA entry tunnel was predicted by Caver 3.0 (in red).

To investigate how the differences in amino acids would affect substrate preferences and conversion rates, a predicted structure of AtdA1 was obtained from the AlphaFold2 protein structure database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Structure overlapping of NpaA1 and AtdA1 suggested that the binding pockets in these two proteins are similar, while the variations in tunnel and binding pocket residues between NpaA1 and AtdA1 likely account for their different substrate specificities. We employed CAVER 3.0 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chovancova et al., 2012</xref>) to analyze potential tunnels for the entry of 1-naphthylamine or aniline into NpaA1 and AtdA1. The prediction of the tunnel in NpaA1 is based on structural docking after the removal of the ligand MetSox-P from the NpaA1—ADP—MetSox-P complex and subsequent docking of phosphorylated glutamate. 1NA docked in NpaA1 was selected as a mandatory site. The tunnel analysis in NpaA1 identified eight tunnels. Among the generated tunnels, a tunnel extending from the buried 1NA binding region to the surface of the bifunnel-shaped entry appears to be the most likely candidate for facilitating 1NA diffusion and overall catalysis in NpaA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). One of the predicted tunnels in AtdA1 overlaps with this tunnel in NpaA1, therefore, likely to be the amine binding channel.</p><p>In NpaA1, the indole ring of W235 is oriented parallel to the channel and likely engages in π-π interactions or cation-π interactions with substrates or surrounding aromatic amino acids, assisting in substrate entry. Structural analysis indicates that hydrophobic residues on the 15<sup>th</sup> motif contribute to the formation of the substrate tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), with the most important ones being three hydrophobic aromatic amino acids (F75’, F86’, and W235) located at the tunnel bottleneck. Both NpaA1 and AtdA1 have three aromatic amino acids at the bottleneck, suggesting that these three aromatic amino acids may help in the proper positioning of aromatic amines in the tunnel. To identify the roles of these aromatic amine residues in regulating and controlling the substrate spectrum of NpaA1, a series of protein variants was generated with mutations in the NpaA1 tunnel, and the resultant mutant proteins were tested by enzyme assays. The enzyme assays of the NpaA1 mutants showed that F86A and F75A retained 15–25% activity towards 1NA but almost completely lost activity towards aniline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that F75 and F86 have a greater impact on aniline than on 1NA binding in the tunnel. The mutant W235A was completely inactive, indicating the critical role of W235 for NpaA1 in proper substrate entry into the tunnel. Any combination of double mutations in NpaA1 resulted in a complete loss of activity towards both 1NA and aniline, indicating that the three aromatic amino acids act synergistically, likely participating in π-π interactions with substrates or cation-π interactions with the positively charged amino groups of aromatic amines in NpaA1. The tryptophan residues at the bottleneck of the NpaA1 and AtdA1 tunnels (W235 in NpaA1 and W81’ in AtdA1, respectively) are apparently different sites that affect the tunnel’s radius. We converted these residues in NpaA1 to their corresponding amino acids in AtdA1 and got the following mutations: M81A, M81W, W235L, and M81W/W235L (double mutation). The enzyme assays of the NpaA1 mutants showed that the single mutant M81A retained the ability to convert 1NA but almost completely lost activity towards aniline. However, the substitution of M81’ to the corresponding tryptophan in AtdA1 caused a reversal in substrate selectivity, from native NapA1 preferring 1NA to its mutant M81A preferring aniline. The W235L mutation in NpaA1 has a negligible effect on 1NA preference but enhances the effect of M81W in the M81W/W235L double mutant, completely eliminating 1NA conversion similar to AtdA1, with aniline becoming the only detectable substrate. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results suggest that the different sites of the tryptophan residues in NpaA1 and AtdA1 are crucial for influencing the differences in substrate spectra of the two enzymes. The residues M81 and W235 are the two crucial residues in NpaA1 that play a decisive role in NpaA1’s ability to catalyze naphthylamine glutamylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>V201 is a key site influencing the selectivity of NpaA1 substrates</title><p>The substrate binding tunnel terminates at the active center. Docking analysis of NpaA1 and AtdA1 revealed V201 implicated in 1NA binding, in the NpaA1 pocket, leading to a larger naphthylamine-binding volume. In AtdA1, Y205 (conserved in GS proteins) with a larger tryptophan side-chain group may increase steric hindrance for naphthylamine’s diphenyl ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Surprisingly, the V201Y mutant in NpaA1 exhibited higher catalytic activity for both 1NA and aniline compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Single-site saturation mutagenesis was performed to investigate the effect of V201 for 1NA binding in NpaA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast to V201Y, V201F altered NpaA1’s substrate preference, indicating the contribution of hydroxyl groups on tryptophan to enhanced substrate binding. The substitution of Val201 with Leu enhanced activity toward 1NA by 8.8-fold, indicating a more accommodating pocket for naphthylamines. Mutating V201 to hydrophobic amino acids with longer side chains increased the likelihood of catalyzing monocyclic aniline conversion. In summary, V201 is pivotal in determining substrate preference in NpaA1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In contrast to well-studied microbial degradation of monocyclic aromatic amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arora, 2015</xref>), the mechanisms for microbial degradation of polycyclic aromatic amines have remained unknown until now. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain JS3066 is the first reported isolate with the ability to mineralize 1NA. The fact that enrichment from the soil at a former naphthylamine manufacturing site yielded an isolate capable of robust growth (doubling time approximately 6 hr) on 1NA suggests strongly that it plays a role in naphthylamine degradation in situ.</p><p>The mechanism involved in the degradation of 1NA by strain JS3066 was elucidated both at genetic and biochemical levels.

The fact that the isolate retains the ability to grow on aniline indicates that the initial enzyme system plays a dual role in the degradation of both aniline and naphthylamine.</p><p>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played an important role in the dispersal of pathogenicity-related genes, antibiotic-resistance genes, and biodegradative genes. Bacteria respond to selective pressure exerted by anthropogenic chemicals by HGT of genetic determinants that enable the recipient to utilize the compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Meer et al., 1992</xref>).

Whether or not hosts acquired specific genes by HGT can be predicted by comparison of the differences in G+C content, codon usage, and phylogenies between the candidate genes and the whole genomes, as well as analyzing the presence or absence of mobile genetic elements adjacent to defined genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Vallvé et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Syvanen, 1994</xref>).

The <italic>npaA1A2A3A4A5</italic> genes and the <italic>npaBFCXEDJIKL</italic> genes are flanked by transposase-encoding genes. Based on these observations, it is likely that the genes encoding enzymes that make up the 1NA degradation pathway have originated from those involved in biodegradation of aniline and of naphthalene, a process probably mediated by HGT.</p><p>During the HGT process of <italic>npaA1A2A3A4A5</italic>, the genes (i.e. <italic>nagAaGHAbAcAd</italic> in strain U2 and similar strains) encoding transformation of naphthalene into <italic>cis</italic>-naphthalene dihydrodiol and conversion of salicylate to gentisate within the naphthalene degradation pathway were completely replaced with the <italic>npaA1A2A3A4A5</italic> genes likely derived from aerobic aniline degraders (e.g. <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp.

More importantly, the above-mentioned process led to the loss of the <italic>nagGH</italic> genes encoding the oxygenase component of salicylic acid 5-hydroxylase (S5H), thereby abolishing the ability of strain JS3066 to transform salicylate via gentisate even if genes (<italic>npaJIKL</italic>) involved in conversion of gentisate to intermediates for TCA cycle remained intact in strain JS3066. To complete the pathway of 1NA degradation, strain JS3066 employs the <italic>npaG</italic> gene encoding salicylic acid 1-hydroxylase (S1H) to transform salicylate into catechol prior to ring fission. The evidence supports the hypothesis that the evolution of the 1NA degradation pathway has occurred in a modular fashion, where the assembly of catabolic modules originating from different sources proceeded by transposition and subsequent rearrangement.

However, combining the phylogenetic, function, and structure analysis in this research, the group seems sufficiently distinct from the glutamine synthase enzymes that we propose designating them ‘glutamyl-organic amine synthases’ (GoaS).</p><p>Previous studies indicated that the GoaS protein lost the ability to catalyze the formation of glutamine from ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Azevedo Wäsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rexer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeo et al., 2013</xref>).

Despite structural comparisons with GS, the catalytic mechanisms and binding properties of aromatic amine compounds in GoaS have not been established. In this study, we investigated the aromatic amine binding site in NpaA1 from both structural and biochemical perspectives. Despite similarities in ATP, glutamate, and manganese ion binding sites between NpaA1 and GSI, the amine binding pockets exhibit marked differences. NpaA1 evolved a large and hydrophobic substrate binding pocket to accommodate the catalysis of bulky organic amine compounds. To accommodate organic amines, both the substrate binding pocket and tunnel of NpaA1 are rich in hydrophobic amino acids. Besides hydrogen bonding interactions similar to GS proteins, hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in facilitating substrate binding in NpaA1. GoaS lost the conserved catalytic residues found in GS during evolution, including the residues Glu357 involved in the Glu flap and the catalytic Asp 50' in <italic>St</italic>GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill and Eisenberg, 2001</xref>). The conserved catalytic residues in GS are replaced by hydrophobic residues or loops in NpaA1. These differences could be significant reasons why GoaS cannot catalyze ammonium glutamylation, indicating a fundamentally different catalytic mechanism between NpaA1 and GSI.</p><p>Structural analysis indicates that different residues within both the 1NA entry tunnel and the binding pocket contribute to the broader substrate spectrum of NpaA1 compared to that of AtdA1. Specifically, the tryptophan site determines the catalytic activity towards naphthylamine. The results of mutation analysis have revealed that V201 in the substrate binding pocket of NpaA1 can only alter the preference for naphthylamine or aniline, but several mutations can enhance the activity of NpaA1, indicating a high degree of plasticity in the large substrate binding pocket of NpaA1, which is promising for future engineering endeavors on NpaA1.</p><p>The discovery of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain JS3066 and its ability to degrade 1-naphthylamine sheds light on the environmental fate of this toxic compound and provides a potential bioremediation strategy.

The optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of cell suspensions was adjusted to approximately 8.0. The substrate 1NA (final concentration of 0.4 mM) was added to the suspension, and degradation experiments were performed at 30 °C and 170 rpm on a rotary shaker. Samples were collected at regular intervals, and the change in concentrations of 1NA was analyzed by HPLC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Enzyme assays</title><p>Activities of NpaA1 and AtdA1 against different substrates were analyzed spectrophotometrically with a Lambda 25 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer/Cetus, Norwalk, CT) by following the disappearance of tested substrates at individually defined wavelengths. The reaction system (0.5 ml volume) contained 1.5 mM ATP, 1.0 mM <italic>L</italic>-glutamate, 2.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.28 mg of NpaA1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The assay was initiated by adding different substrates. The molar extinction coefficients of various potential substrates were obtained by measuring their absorbance values in the reaction buffer at each characteristic wavelength. As for NpaA1 and AtdA1, one unit of enzyme activity (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme required for the consumption of 1 μmol of substrate in 1 min at 30 °C. Specific activities for NpaA1 and AtdA1 are expressed as units per gram of protein. The activity of NpaG against salicylate was measured by monitoring NADH oxidation at 340 nm and the molar extinction coefficient for NADH was taken as 6220 M<sup>–1</sup>·cm<sup>–1</sup>. The reaction system (0.5 ml volume) contained 200 μM NADH, 40 μM FAD, 80 μM salicylate, and 0.38 μg of NpaG in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). For NpaG, one unit of enzyme (U) is defined as the amount of enzyme required for the consumption of 1 μmol of NADH in 1 min at 30 °C. Specific activity for NpaG against salicylate is expressed as units per milligram of protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analytical methods</title><p>To isolate and identify the metabolites, the biotransformation sample was acidified to pH 2 with concentrated HCl and then extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate which was subsequently removed by evaporation. Bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (volume ratio: 99/1) was used as the derivatization reagent so that active hydrogen atom(s) of the 1NA metabolites were replaced by a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group (Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>), m/z 73. The pellet was dissolved in BSTFA-TMCS and then incubated at 60 °C for 30 min prior to GC-MS analysis. GC-MS analyses were performed on a TRACE 1310 gas chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) using a capillary column HP-5MS (0.25 mm × 30 m, Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The column temperature gradient was 0–5 min, 60 °C; 5–27 min, 60–280°C (10 °C min<sup>–1</sup>); 27–32 min, 280 °C. The detector was a TSQ8000 Triple Quadrupole MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The following conditions were applied for mass analysis: ionization mode, EI<sup>+</sup>; ionizing electron energy, 70 eV; source temperature, 250 °C, and mass range m/z 0–500. Mass spectra of individual total ion peaks were identified by comparison with authentic standards and the <italic>Wiley</italic>.275L mass spectra data base.</p><p>HPLC analysis of substrates and their oxidation products was performed on a Waters e2695 Separation Module equipped with a C18 reversed-phase column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm).The mobile phase consisted of water containing 0.1% (vol/vol) acetic acid (A) and methanol (B) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min<sup>–1</sup>. A gradient elution program was as follows: 0–15 min 20–80% B; 15–25 min 80% B; 25–25.1 min 80–20% B; 25.1–40 min 20% B. The column temperature was 30 °C and the injection volume was 20 μl. Qualitative analysis of the oxidation product from the reaction of 1NA degradation catalyzed by NpaA1 was executed with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS), with the electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive ion mode.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Identities of ORFs from gene clusters responsible for 1-Naphthylamine (1NA) degradation.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95555-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Crystallographic data collection and refinement of NpaA1 and its complex.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95555-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Strains and plasmids used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95555-supp3-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Primers used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95555-supp4-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Primers used for constructing mutant vectors.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95555-supp5-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-95555-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The complete genome of Pseudomonas sp. strain JS3066 is available in the NCBI database under BioProject identifier (ID) PRJNA1035437 or BioSample accession SUB13951314.

Our work primarily consists of elucidating the biodegradation pathway of 1-naphthylamine and investigating the substrate selectivity mechanism of the key enzyme NpaA1 in this pathway. Due to space limitations, the original title may not have fully conveyed the whole story. To emphasize both aspects, we have revised the title to: “Discovery of the 1-naphthylamine biodegradation pathway reveals a broad-substrate-spectrum enzyme catalyzing 1-naphthylamine glutamylation”.</p><p>I have also made modifications to the abstract, and the revised version is as follows: “1-Naphthylamine (1NA), which is harmful to human and aquatic animals, has been used widely in the manufacturing of dyes, pesticides, and rubber antioxidants. Nevertheless, little is known about its environmental behavior and no bacteria have been reported to use it as the growth substrate. Herein, we describe a pathway for 1NA degradation in the isolate <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. strain JS3066, determine the structure and mechanism of the enzyme NpaA1 that catalyzes the initial reaction, and reveal how the pathway evolved. From genetic and enzymatic analysis, a five gene-cluster encoding a dioxygenase system was determined to be responsible for the initial steps in 1NA degradation through glutamylation of 1NA. The g-glutamylated 1NA was subsequently oxidized to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene which was further degraded by the well-established pathway of naphthalene degradation via catechol. A glutamine synthetase-like (GS-like) enzyme (NpaA1) initiates 1NA glutamylation, and this enzyme exhibits a broad substrate selectivity toward a variety of anilines and naphthylamine derivatives. Structural analysis revealed that the aromatic residues in the 1NA entry tunnel and the V201 site in the large substrate-binding pocket significantly influence NpaA1's substrate preferences. The findings enhance understanding of degrading polycyclic aromatic amines, and will also enable the application of bioremediation at naphthylamine contaminated sites.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. γ-Glutamylorganoamide synthetase and naphthylene dioxygenase are two enzymes, as they are not forming a complex nor catalyze a single reaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, γ-glutamylorganoamide synthetase and naphthalene dioxygenase are two enzymes that catalyze distinct reactions. They are the components of naphthylamine dioxygenase system. The deamination of aniline involves two steps: glutamylation and dioxygenation. Since the genes encoding enzymes catalyzing both steps are often clustered together, studies have referred to aniline glutamine synthetase and glutamine aniline dioxygenase as constituting the aniline dioxygenase system (AD system)<sup>[1]</sup>, a terminology widely accepted in the field<sup>[2, 3]</sup>. This convention also applies to the naphthylamine dioxygenase system discussed in this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
