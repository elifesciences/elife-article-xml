The main functions of liver cNK cells and ILC1s not only include directly killing target cells but also regulating local immune microenvironment of the liver through the secretion of cytokines. Uncovering the intricate mechanisms by which transcriptional factors regulate and influence the functions of liver cNK cells and ILC1s, particularly within the context of liver tumors, presents a significant opportunity to amplify the effectiveness of immunotherapies against liver malignancies. Using Ncr1-drived conditional knockout mouse model, our study reveals the regulatory role of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in shaping the composition and maturation of cNK cells. Although <italic>Prdm1</italic> did not affect the killing function of cNK cells in an in vivo cytotoxicity model, a significant increase in cancer metastasis was observed in <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout mice. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granzyme B, and perforin secretion decreased significantly in <italic>Prdm1</italic>-deficient cNK cells and liver ILC1s. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data also provided evidences that Prdm1 maintains functional subsets of cNK cells and liver ILC1s and facilitates communications between cNK cells, liver ILC1s, and macrophages. The present study unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism of Prdm1 in cNK cells and liver ILC1s, showing promising potential for developing innovative immune therapy strategies against liver cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immune surveillance</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>innate lymphoid cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Plan of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFF1202901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Youwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82372801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Youwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LY21H150002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhouxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006606</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23JCYBJC01560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Huaiyong</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Youwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Planning Project of Tianjin Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YGYB14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006606</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23JCYBJC01370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Huaiyong</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Youwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006606</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21JCZDJC00430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Huaiyong</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Youwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prdm1 (BLIMP1) promotes liver Group 1 ILCs cancer surveillance and preserves functional heterogeneity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Group 1 ILCs consist of cNK cells and ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Spits et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2013</xref>), with distinct developmental trajectories and effect molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2021</xref>). Both cNK cells and ILC1s play indispensable roles in combatting viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weizman et al., 2017</xref>), maintaining local immune homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>), eradicating malignant transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ducimetière et al., 2021</xref>), and fostering cross-talk with adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fumagalli et al., 2022</xref>). cNK cells demonstrate potent cellular cytotoxicity, facilitating direct elimination of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiessling et al., 1975</xref>). On the contrary, a defining attribute of ILC1s is their predominant cytokine-mediated functions, with limited cellular killing capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nabekura et al., 2020</xref>). In a state of homeostasis, liver group 1 ILCs (CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>NKp46<sup>+</sup>) can be discriminated into cNK cells and ILC1s by the differential expression of CD49a and CD49b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2013</xref>): cNK cells are marked by the expression of CD49b, while liver ILC1s exhibit a distinctive positivity for CD49a. Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is also expressed on liver ILC1s, but not on cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takeda et al., 2001</xref>). Transcriptional factors (TFs) such as T-bet, Nfil3, PLZF, and ID2 are required for cNK cells and liver ILC1s development or generation of their progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yokota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gascoyne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>). Eomes is considered to be necessary for NK cell maturation, but not for ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>). Liver environment facilitated T-bet expression in the early stage of NK cells development, which results in Eomes repression. The repression of T-bet is required for Eomes<sup>+</sup> NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daussy et al., 2014</xref>). On the contrary, deficiency of Hobit results in the depletion of ILC1s, while only leaving little impact on liver NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackay et al., 2016</xref>). These studies suggest that some TFs may, or usually, play different roles in NK cells and ILC1s.</p><p>During the development of liver cancers, the functions of immune cells are often inhibited, resulting in the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and sometimes even systemic immune suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Transforming a poorly immunogenic tumor into a immunologically ‘hot’ tumor with a stronger immune response is one of the goals of many cancer immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galon and Bruni, 2019</xref>). Research targeting the immune system is showing increasing clinical promise in liver cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruff et al., 2022</xref>). One of our recent studies also found that Toll-like receptor agonists can significantly enhance the anti-tumor effect of Sorafenib by reconstructing the tumor immune microenvironment and reshaping the vascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">He et al., 2023</xref>). The anti-tumor activity of cNK cells in the liver is relatively well-established, whereas the relationship between liver ILC1 and tumors is still a topic of controversy. Clinical data showed that liver tumors with a higher infiltration of NK cells are associated with a better prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nersesian et al., 2021</xref>). Decreased NK cell activity is closely correlated with the malignancy of liver tumors and represents a significant risk factor for recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). The tumor microenvironment orchestrates the transformation of cNK cells into ILC1s in a TGF-β-dependent manner, resulting in their diminished capacity to control tumor growth and metastasis. This process ultimately promotes tumor immunoevasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). However, researches also revealed that, distinct from directly inhibiting tumor growth, the primary function of ILC1 is to suppress the seeding of metastatic tumor cells in liver tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ducimetière et al., 2021</xref>). Comprehensive research in this field is essential to harness the precision of group 1 ILCs targeted immunotherapy for liver cancers.</p><p>The transcription factor network governs the function of group 1 ILCs and the balance between cNK and ILC1. Our research team, along with others, has observed that one of the transcription factor in TGF-β pathway, Smad4, promotes the shift in balance from cNK cells towards ILC1 in a TGF-beta-independent pathway, and simultaneously, it positively regulates the expression of another transcription factor, PR domain 1 (Prdm1/Blimp1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortez et al., 2017</xref>). Prdm1 plays a crucial role in the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells and the homeostasis of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller and Maniatis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kallies et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martins et al., 2006</xref>). The function and regulatory network of Prdm1 in NK cells is distinct from B cells and T cells, for its expression is independent of B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) and Interferon Regulatory actor 4 (IRF4) but relies on T-bet. In the study that identified Prdm1 as an essential transcriptional factor for NK cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kallies et al., 2011</xref>), no significant difference was observed in IFN-γ production or cytotoxicity between Prdm1-deficient and wild-type NK cells. Although Prdm1 expression is dependent on IL-15 in immature NK cells and can be further upregulated by IL-12 or IL-21, it plays a role in downregulating the expression of certain cytokine receptors, such as CD25 (IL-2Rα), consequently diminishing the responsiveness of NK cells to IL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akman et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, some studies even suggested that Prdm1 suppressed the secretion of IFN-γ in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). These findings imply that, although Prdm1 promotes NK cell development, it may function as a negative regulator of their activity. However, direct evidence supporting the impact of Prdm1 on NK cell anti-tumor capabilities is still lacking. Furthermore, there has been no investigation into its influence on the homeostasis of cNK cells and ILC1s in the liver, nor has there been an exploration of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>In the current study, we found that the deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Ncr1<sup>+</sup> cells resulted in an imbalance in the homeostasis of liver group 1 ILCs, with a shift towards cNK cells. The data also support the essential role of Prdm1 in the cancer surveillance mediated by cNK cells. While Prdm1 positively regulates genes associated with cellular cytotoxicity, it concurrently exerts inhibitory control over certain positive regulators of NK cell development and functionality, such as JunB. Using scRNA-seq, we have identified a subset of cNK cells within the liver characterized by elevated JunB expression. These cells exhibit decreased expression of genes associated with cellular cytotoxicity, and their abundance significantly increases following Prdm1 knockout. Furthermore, our data also support that Prdm1 promotes the cross-talk between group 1 ILCs and macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Prdm1</italic> promotes group 1 ILCs homeostasis and terminal maturation</title><p>Examination of 363 liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed a positive correlation between the expression of NK-cell-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cursons et al., 2019</xref>) (<italic>NCR1</italic>, <italic>KLRB1</italic>, <italic>CD160</italic>, <italic>PRF1,</italic> etc.) and <italic>PRDM1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Furthermore, NK cells can secrete cytokines that activate other immune cells, thereby orchestrating a broader immune response for the elimination of tumors. Moreover, the cytotoxicity assay, due to its relatively short duration, might not fully represent the anti-tumor activity of NK cells when continuously exposed to immune inhibitory signals in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we initiated an in vivo tumor model to further investigate the impact of <italic>Prdm1</italic> on NK cell anti-tumor capability. B16F10 is a melanoma cell line with low expression of MHC-I, which was susceptible to NK cell killing and usually used to evaluate NK cell anti-tumor capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Viant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cillo et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sathe et al., 2014</xref>). The B16F10 cells were intravenously (for lung metastasis) or intrasplenic (for liver metastasis) administrated in the mice.

Yet, no statistical difference of PRF1 was found within the CD11b<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> subsets, likely due to the relatively lower perforin levels in these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

The predominant majority (92.98%) of <italic>Junb</italic> high liver cNK cells are derived from <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice, with less than ten percent (7.02%) originating from <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Many signal transduction elements, gene expression regulator, and transcriptional factors, such as <italic>Nfkbia</italic>, <italic>Tnfaip3</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1/2/3</italic>, <italic>Batf3</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Fosb</italic>, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, and <italic>Kit</italic> were upregulated in the <italic>Junb</italic> high liver cNK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

GO analysis showed that genes upregulated in <italic>Junb</italic> high liver cNK cells enriched in cell differentiation, cell activation, and transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). GSEA indicates that the NF-kappa B, IL-17, MAPK, and TNF signaling pathways were upregulated in this clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, I-L).

Increased proportion of <italic>Junb</italic> high cluster in <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient cNK cells suggested impaired anti-tumor activity, which was consistent with more melanoma metastasis in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice and lower expression of cytotoxicity-related genes in splenic cNK cells based on bulk RNA-sequencing.</p><p>The <italic>Cxcr3</italic> high cNK cell cluster was characterized with high expression of <italic>Cxcr3</italic>, <italic>Ccr2</italic>, and some genes encoding ribosomal subunits such as <italic>Rps7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Expression of tissue-resident markers <italic>Cd69</italic> was also highly expressed in this clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The enrichment of chemokine receptors in genes upregulated in the <italic>Cxcr3</italic> high cluster implied a greater likelihood of this cluster being tissue-resident compared with other cNK cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). To further confirm tissue-resident properties of this clusters, we calculated the module score based on top30 DEGs in ILC1 versus cNK clusters, including <italic>Cxcr6</italic>, <italic>Itga1</italic>, <italic>Cd160</italic>, <italic>Cd226</italic>, etc. <italic>Cxcr3</italic> high cNK clusters have the highest score among all cNK clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H</xref>), indicating the similarity with liver ILC1s. In the tumor microenvironment, reports indicated that NK cells could transform into ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). If this conversion of cNK cells into ILC1s also occurred under normal physiological conditions then <italic>Cxcr3</italic> high cNK cell cluster might be the most susceptible to such transformation.</p><p>The significant enrichment of ribosomal subunits and cytoplasmic translation in <italic>Cxcr3</italic> high cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) implied their distinct and active metabolic profile and the capability to mount immune responses. The remarkably decreased proportion of <italic>Cxcr3</italic> high cNK cell cluster in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) emphasized the critical role of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in maintaining this cluster of liver cNK cells, consistent with the flow cytometry result that showed an increase in the number of NK cells in the bone marrow and a decrease in NK cells in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is consistent with flow cytometry data, which showed a decrease in the proportion of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cNK cells across all tested organs following Prdm1 knockout. However, it is noteworthy that, in contrast to the trend in cNK cells, CX3CR1 expression was increased in liver ILC1s after Prdm1 knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, F and G). This not only substantiates the involvement of Prdm1 in managing NK cell migration but also underscores its distinctive regulatory impacts on the chemokine receptor expressions within NK cells and ILC1 populations. Bulk RNA sequencing data also found that the expression of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr6</italic> decreased in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko cNK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings supported the hypothesis that <italic>Prdm1</italic>, through regulating chemokine receptor expression levels, influenced the distribution of NK cells in the bone marrow and peripheral tissues, particularly within the liver tissue.</p><p>Three clusters of ILC1s were identified from liver ILC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), comprising ‘<italic>Il7r</italic> high’, ‘<italic>Klra</italic> high’, and ‘<italic>Gzmb</italic> high’ ILC1s. <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko ILC1s seemed to co-cluster largely and have minor difference within the proportion of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, B and C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The first two clusters of ILC1s were characterized by higher expression of <italic>Il7r</italic> (CD127) and <italic>Klra5</italic> separately, while the <italic>Gzmb</italic> high ILC1 cluster was identified by elevated expression of both <italic>Gzma</italic> and <italic>Gzmb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, A, C and D).

The high expression of <italic>Il18r1</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> in <italic>Il7r</italic> high ILC1s indicated this cluster of cells was highly responsive to IL-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Through the integration of the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data, we identified 17 DEGs that are regulated by Prdm1 among liver cNK cells, splenic cNK cells, and liver ILC1s. <italic>Batf3</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, and <italic>Nfkb1</italic> was upregulated, whereas <italic>Gzmb</italic>, <italic>Prf1</italic>, and <italic>Fgl2</italic> downregulated, in both <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko liver and splenic cNK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

On top of that, our findings unveiled the negative regulatory influence of Prdm1 on Batf3 within both spleen and liver NK cells.

Following the knockout of Hobit, the DEGs were primarily identified within ILC1s. Conversely, after the knockout of Prdm1, a greater number of DEGs were observed in cNK cells. This indicates that Prdm1 likely possesses a broader range of target genes within cNK cells, whereas Hobit appears to have a more pronounced impact on gene expression within ILC1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, C-F).

The scRNA-seq data revealed that following Prdm1 knockout in NKp46<sup>+</sup> cells, there was a decrease in the proportion of KCs within the macrophage population, while the proportion of MDMs increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor, is extensively utilized to distinguish KCs and MDMs within macrophages. Cells expressing CX3CR1 are classified as MDMs, whereas those without CX3CR1 expression are categorized as KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heymann et al., 2015</xref>). Using flow cytometry and assessing CX3CR1 expression, we determined the ratios of KCs and MDMs. In contrast to the scRNA-seq findings, flow cytometry indicates that following <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout in group 1 ILCs, there is a minor increase in the proportion of KCs within the total liver macrophages, and a decrease in the proportion of MDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This discrepancy might stem from the different bases of classification: scRNA-seq defines KCs based on gene expression profiles, whereas flow cytometry differentiates between KCs and MDMs using the single surface marker, CX3CR1. Analysis of the macrophage subsets identified by scRNA-seq reveals that, while MDM clusters generally show high CX3CR1 expression, there exists a subset within MDMs, labeled <italic>Mrc1</italic> high, that also exhibits high levels of CX3CR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consequently, if flow cytometry solely employs CX3CR1 for differentiating between KCs and MDMs, it could result in disparities when compared to scRNA-seq data. Both KCs and MDMs has significantly increased in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice, which was consist with the scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, B and F).

Additionally, we employed flow cytometry to examine Ly6C expression within the macrophages. Similar with the scRNA-seq findings, there were no notable differences in Ly6C expression levels between <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>High-resolution interactions among liver cNK cells, ILC1s, and macrophages were established and compared between <italic>Prdm1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice using the CellChat program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2021</xref>).

In a study involving systemic knockout combined with competitive transplantation, it was found that Prdm1 promotes NK cell maturation and the expression of Gzmb. On the contrary, the same study also found that NK cells with Prdm1 deficiency exhibit heightened proliferation, increased survival, enhanced migratory abilities toward tumors, and greater cytotoxicity against subcutaneously implanted RMAS tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kallies et al., 2011</xref>). Using Ncr1-driven conditional knockout transgenic mice, which specifically delete <italic>Prdm1</italic> in group 1 ILCs, we not only validated <italic>Prdm1</italic>’s positive regulation of NK cell maturation, but also demonstrated its indispensable role in NK cell anti-tumor activity. The compromised mitochondrial function and reduced IFN-γ, granzyme B, and perforin production appear to be potential contributing factors to Prdm1-mediated NK cell cancer surveillance. Reduction of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> NK cells in multiple tissues, and decreased expression of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Cxcr6</italic> was observed in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko splenic cNK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), both of which are essential for NK cells egressing from bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sciumè et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chea et al., 2015</xref>). Our results not only confirmed a decrease in cytotoxic molecules in <italic>Prdm1</italic>-deficient NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kallies et al., 2011</xref>) but also showed that the reduction in Gzmb and perforin is not solely attributable to the diminished maturation of these cells. Mature NK cells in bone marrow obtained the expression of CX3CR1 and acquired ability to enter the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sciumè et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chea et al., 2015</xref>). The quantity of cNK cells increased exclusively in the bone marrow, with reductions observed in all other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), indicating <italic>Prdm1</italic> might regulate chemokine receptors to facilitate the egression of cNK cells from the bone marrow to peripheral tissues. In addition, higher expression of <italic>Cxcr6</italic> compared to cNK cells is also a key factor for liver tissue residence of ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hudspeth et al., 2016</xref>). Decreased expression of <italic>Cxcr6</italic> in <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient group 1 ILCs may also contribute to the balance shift towards cNK cells. Furthermore, although both liver NK cells and liver ILC1s require Prdm1 to maintain their quantity, liver ILC1s demonstrate a more pronounced dependency on Prdm1. However, it is currently widely believed that liver NK cells and liver ILC1s originate from different progenitors. It is worth noting that while we observed changes in the NK and ILC1 proportions after <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout, our data does not support the hypothesis that Prdm1 affects progenitor differentiation decisions, thereby influencing the fate selection of NK and ILC1. Further research may be needed to elucidate how Prdm1 regulates the balance between NK cells and ILC1s.</p><p>The scRNA-seq analysis reveals that both liver cNK cells and ILC1s can be further divided into three subgroups based on their gene expression patterns. JunB is a crucial transcriptional factor for the cytotoxic function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells. However, excessive <italic>Junb</italic> expression has been found to promote T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lynn et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous study showed that as NK cells mature, the expression level of <italic>Prdm1</italic> increased while the expression level of <italic>Junb</italic> gradually decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The current study demonstrated that in NK cells, the expression level of <italic>Junb</italic> significantly increases upon the deletion of Prdm1, indicating that <italic>Junb</italic> expression is suppressed by Prdm1. As <italic>Junb</italic> expression decreases with NK cell maturation, and it is inhibited by the gradually increasing Prdm1 during maturation. This implies that constraining <italic>Junb</italic> expression is likely a fundamental prerequisite for NK cell maturation. However, the precise mechanism by which Prdm1 downregulates <italic>Junb</italic> in NK cells still needs further research. Furthermore, <italic>Junb</italic> high NK cells exhibit lower expression levels of cytotoxic genes and reduced mitochondrial-related signaling pathways. Mitochondria are pivotal organelles crucial for cellular metabolism. Disruptions in mitochondrial function have been linked to T Cell exhaustion, attributed to glycolytic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, mitochondrial fragmentation has been closely associated with NK cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, the concept of NK cell exhaustion isn't as firmly established as it is for T cells. Exhausted NK cells should primarily exhibit diminished functions. This is characterized by a diminished ability to destroy tumor cells, a reduced capability to activate other components of the immune system, and compromised proliferation and survival rates. Additionally, this reduced functionality is associated with a decline in the expression of molecules responsible for cytotoxic activity, lower production of IFN-γ, and metabolic disturbances that may arise from mitochondrial dysfunction. While our current data is not sufficient to definitively classify these cells as exhausted NK cells, it supports that a subpopulation, referred to <italic>Junb</italic> high cluster, demonstrates an exhaustion-like phenotype. The significant increase in this cell population following <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout in NK cells may potentially be one of the reasons why <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice lose their tumor-killing capacity. Whether the excessive expression of JunB in NK cells is also a contributing factor to their exhaustion, similar to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lynn et al., 2019</xref>), requires further investigation.</p><p>The scRNA-seq data revealed that <italic>Prdm1</italic> plays distinct roles in regulating cNK cells and ILC1s despite being required for the quantity of both lineages. Specifically, <italic>Prdm1</italic> appears to be more involved in promoting the resistance against exhaustion in cNK cells, whereas in ILC1s, it may play a role in the plasticity between ILC1s and ILC3s. In both our previous study and a study by Colonna et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>), it was demonstrated that <italic>Smad4</italic>, a transcriptional factor involved in TGF-β signal pathway, upregulated <italic>Prdm1</italic> in NK cells and depletion of <italic>Smad4</italic> resulted in a decreased ratio of NK cells to ILC1s in the liver. However, knocking out <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Ncr1<sup>+</sup> cells increased the ratio of NK cells to ILC1s in liver group 1 ILCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These findings suggest the possibility of a Smad4-independent pathway through which <italic>Prdm1</italic> promotes the maintenance of ILC1s, or that <italic>Prdm1</italic> plays a more significant role in maintaining ILC1s compared to its role in NK cells.</p><p>Previous studies have identified Hobit and Prdm1 as central regulators instructing tissue-dependent programs and retention of diverse tissue-resident lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedrich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yomogida et al., 2021</xref>). Liver ILC1s required Hobit, but not necessary for cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ducimetière et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of Prdm1 was remarkably higher in cNK cells versus ILC1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackay et al., 2016</xref>). While in our study, cNK cells and liver ILC1s reduced simultaneously in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice, and even more significant in ILC1s. This indicates that while Prdm1 is expressed at lower levels in ILC1s, its role in preserving the quantity of ILC1s may be more crucial. Thus, Prdm1 and Hobit may have parallel program in instructing ILC1s functional development and maturation. Prdm1 and Hobit directly bound and repressed <italic>Tcf7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mackay et al., 2016</xref>), which encoded TCF-1, a TF binding and limiting the activity of Gzmb regulatory element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeevan-Raj et al., 2017</xref>). Gzmb has been demonstrated directly bound and activated by Junb in NK cells, which suggested Gzmb expression regulated by multiple Prdm1/Hobit downstream signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In human T cells, binding motif of JUNB was enriched in the binding sites of PRDM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2022</xref>), indicating the essential role of PRDM1-JUNB axis during NK cell and T cell development. In <italic>Prdm1</italic> deficient NK cells, we noted a decrease in Gzmb levels alongside with an elevation in Junb expression. This indicates that Prdm1 not only facilitates the expression of Gzmb in NK cells but also suppresses Junb expression. Given that Junb is recognized as a positive regulator of Gzmb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babichuk and Bleackley, 1997</xref>), this presents a complex interplay that seems contradictory. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a theoretical framework to comprehensively understand and interpret this paradoxical relationship. Here, we hypothesize that during the early stages of NK cell development, JunB may enhance the expression of certain molecules associated with cytotoxicity, thereby aiding NK cells in acquiring the capacity to eliminate target cells. At these initial stages, Prdm1 level are comparatively low, thus exerting a weaker inhibitory effect on JunB. As NK cells mature, there is a progressive increase in Prdm1 level, which then exerts a stronger inhibitory influence on JunB, contributing to the reduced JunB level in fully matured NK cells. Consequently, this reduces the potential for NK cell exhaustion caused by elevated levels of JunB.</p><p>Chronic inflammation is a crucial factor in promoting tumorigenesis, and macrophages play a significant role in this process. Macrophages interact with both cNK cells and ILC1s. However, the TFs that regulate these interactions are poorly understood. Fortunately, recent advances in scRNA-seq technology and the CellChat software tool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2021</xref> have allowed us to gain a better understanding of the <italic>Prdm1</italic> signaling pathway in group 1 ILCs and its impact on macrophages at the transcriptional level. Increased metastasis in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice may be due to a decrease in the killing ability of NK cells, making them more prone to exhaustion, or it could be due to abnormalities in group 1 ILCs, leading to a decrease in the anti-tumor abilities of macrophages and an enhancement of their pro-tumor capabilities. It is worth noting that normal ILC1-macrophage interactions are more prevalent than the interaction between NK cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also found that CXCL signaling-based interaction remarkably diminished in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice, which suggested CXCL-CXCR may contribute to keep the sufficient interaction between group 1 ILC and macrophage. Specifically, <italic>Prdm1</italic> in group 1 ILCs may be critical in preventing the overactivation of macrophages that can lead to cancer development. Increased population of both MDMs and KCs in <italic>Prdm1</italic> cko mice, as well as different distribution of macrophage clusters, indicating the homeostasis of macrophages require environment with functional cNK cells and ILC1s. Although not all macrophage phenotypes have been verified in this study, the present research serves primarily to offer initial insights and preliminary data for investigating the interactions between group 1 ILCs and macrophages. It aims to inspire further research into the role of transcription factors within the liver and the cancer microenvironment.</p><p>While our findings underscore the importance of Prdm1 in liver cNK cells and ILC1s tumor immune surveillance, it does not be validated in human NK cells, whereas previous studies have found that PRDM1 might inhibit the proliferation and function of human NK cells, or human NK cell derived cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Küçük et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we did not provide an in-depth evaluation in multiple tumor models. Further research may provide deeper insight into the role of PRDM1 in the anti-tumor function of human NK cells, enabling a more direct investigation of its application in cancer therapies. Given its important role in preserving liver cNK cells and ILC1s functional heterogeneity, enhancing Prdm1 function in human NK cells could potentially be a strategy to promote NK-cell-based immunotherapy for cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Prdm1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Ncr1-iCre</italic> and <italic>B2m<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were purchased from Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc.

We have carefully considered your comments and present the results of new experiments conducted in response to your suggestions. Please find the detailed responses below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>Comment 1: The authors do not control for the potential effects of Cre expression. Expression of Cre from within the Ncr1 locus (using the mouse model established by Narni-Mancinelli et al.) has significant effects on NK cells and especially ILC1s reducing their frequency and absolute numbers and altering their functionality. The authors should characterize the Ncr1cre mice used here (developed by Shanghai Model Organism Center) in this regard and should use proper controls (Ncr1Cre+ Prdm1wt/wt as control for Ncr1Cre+ Prdm1fl/fl, instead of WT littermates) for all of their key data, e.g. those depicted in Fig 1FG, 2ADFH, 7D, S2,3,4.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1: This is a very insightful question that has posed a challenge for many researchers, including us, engaged in conditional knockout studies. The expression of Cre and the insertion of loxP sequences both have the potential to influence gene expression. This is because the region where loxP is inserted may contain regulatory sequences for the gene of interest. Ncr1-Cre is a frequently used transgenic mouse model in our laboratory. In our prior research, we also had concerns about the possible impact of Cre on NKp46 expression, which could lead to a decline in NK cell function. Therefore, in our previous studies focused on Smad4 expression in NK cells, we conducted similar experiments. In Figure 6 of our published paper in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (Wang et al., <italic>J Clin Invest</italic>, 2018), we compared NKp46-iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/WT with NKp46-iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/fl. Although the primary purpose is to establish Smad4's independence from TGF-β, it also allows for a comparison between Smad4fl/fl and Smad4fl/WT in the presence of Cre. In the critical phenotype we assessed, NKp46-iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/fl (compared with NKp46-iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/WT) exhibited the same phenotype as NKp46-iCreSmad4fl/fl (compared with NKp46WTSmad4fl/fl). This suggests that Cre's influence on NK cells may be within a reasonable and controllable range. Furthermore, in contrast to the decrease in Ncr1 expression caused by Cre, the reduction in the expression levels of genes targeted by Loxp knockout, such as Prdm1 in this study (Figure 1 E), is more significant. Therefore, with the current techniques and research methods, we believe that the data provided in this study can support the role of Prdm1 in</p><p>NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Several of the phenotypic findings on NK cells have been described before by Kallies et al. in 2011 (Ref 29), although using a different genetic Prdm1-ablation model (Prdm1-GFP/GFP knockin/knockout model). This study reported impaired NK cell maturation, reduced Gzmb expression, impaired in vivo cytotoxicity against subcutaneous RMA-S cells, impaired in vitro proliferation, comparable in vitro killing, increase in BM NK cell numbers. The authors should discuss/mention this more prominently in their manuscript, and highlight where they confirm or refine these previous findings, and where they actually provide new information.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2: We appreciate your valuable suggestions. The article you referred to, published in <italic>Blood</italic>, is indeed an excellent work. While we had cited this article, our discussion regarding its specific content was limited. Based on your advice, we have made revisions and included the following content in our discussion section (page 24; line 489-493):</p><p>“In a study involving systemic knockout combined with competitive transplantation, it was found that Prdm1 promotes NK cell maturation and the expression of Gzmb. On the contrary, the same study also found that NK cells with Prdm1 deficiency exhibit heightened proliferation, increased survival, enhanced migratory abilities towards tumors, and greater cytotoxicity against subcutaneously implanted RMAS tumors (31).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: What is the reason to refer to the enriched cluster in Blimp1-deficient NK cells as &quot;Junbhi&quot;? There is no follow-up for a function of Junb, and there are many other genes upregulated in these cells. Most critically, these cells seem to represent exactly the c-Kithi cells that Kallies et al. already showed and discussed in their paper. The authors should stain for Kit, and also refer to this. Also, MacKay et al. performed Blimp1-Chip-Seq (in T cells), maybe it would be interesting to check to which of the identified DEGs Blimp1 can bind.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3: We appreciate the suggestion from the reviewer. We think a gene that supports the development of lymphocytes doesn't necessarily positively regulate their function. For example, JunB is essential for T cell development but can also induce T cell exhaustion (Lynn et al., <italic>Nature</italic>. 2019). Therefore, while Prdm1 has been shown to promote NK cell development, it cannot be assumed that it always positively regulates NK cell function, especially for anti-cancer immune surveillance. In this respect, we try to find a driving-factor of the impaired anti-tumor ability of <italic>Prdm1</italic>Δ<italic>Ncr1</italic> NK cells. Although there are many other genes upregulated in this cluster (e.g. Kit), JunB attracts more our interest of its potential for regulating NK cells functions in cancer, whereas c-Kit is more likely a marker of NK cells maturation, which has been well-demonstrated by Kallies et al. and other studies. Our previous studies also showed that the expression of c-kit was decreased in mature NK cells, compared immature NK cells (Wang et al., <italic>J Clin Invest</italic>, 2018).</p><p>The lack of following experiments of Junb is because we cannot find valuable surface markers to investigate the follow-up function of _Junb_hi cNK cluster. If we use intracellular markers, it is more likely an analysis of gene expression pattern, which has been well-described in our RNA-seq data. As we describe above, our study did not aim to further investigate the role of prdm1 in NK cells maturation, as the c-Kit expression was upregulated in Prdm1-kncok NK cells and correlated with NK cell maturation, which has been validated by Kallies et al..</p><p>We also have discussed the potential DEGs that could be bound and regulated by Prdm1 in our revised manuscript (page 27-28; line 561-571):</p><p>“Prdm1 and Hobit directly bound and repressed <italic>Tcf7</italic> (18), which encoded TCF-1, a TF binding and limiting the activity of Gzmb regulatory element (69). Gzmb has been demonstrated directly bound and activated by Junb in NK cells, which suggested Gzmb expression regulated by multiple Prdm1/Hobit downstream signals (26). In human T cells, binding motif of JUNB was enriched in the binding sites of PRDM1 (70), indicating the essential role of PRDM1-JUNB axis during NK cell and T cell development. In NK cells deficient in Prdm1 expression, we noted a decrease in Gzmb levels alongside with an elevation in Junb expression. This indicates that Prdm1 not only facilitates the expression of Gzmb in NK cells but also suppresses Junb expression. Given that Junb is recognized as a positive regulator of Gzmb (71), this presents a complex interplay that seems contradictory. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a theoretical framework to comprehensively understand and interpret this paradoxical relationship.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: cNK cells are considered circulating cells, that transiently pass through the liver.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have suggested almost identical gene expression patterns in hepatic and splenic NK cells. In functional tests, they often &quot;perform&quot; identically. I am therefore a bit surprised that the authors find a differential dependency of Blimp1 for the IFNg production of splenic (no role of Blimp1) versus hepatic (Blimp1 regulating IFNg production) NK cells (Fig S3). Do the authors have any suggestions on that? The analyses are performed by 12+4h stimulations with IL12/18, which could involve the effects of altered bystander cells (as suggested by Figure 6). Therefore, these analyses should be provided upon standard 4h stimulations with IL12/18 and also with PMA/I under BFA. Note: liver and splenic cNK cells look quite different in the chosen histograms in Figures 7 A, B, C, yet there is massive variability in these analyses - is there any systematic/technical problem?</p><p>Response 4: We appreciate the valuable suggestion from the reviewer. Studies have suggested that, at the gene expression or transcriptomic level, liver NK cells exhibit more similarity to splenic NK cells while displaying greater divergence from liver ILC1s. However, we do not think that splenic NK cells or peripheral blood NK cells (which are more abundant in circulation) are entirely indistinguishable from liver NK cells. Notably, there are substantial differences in their maturity levels, with liver NK cells being more mature. Since we are examining the protein levels, a 4-hour stimulation period may not fully capture these distinctions. Even when considering the potential impact of bystander cells, the experimental design specifically targets Prdm1 knockout within NK cells, ensuring that the study accurately elucidates the role of Prdm1 in NK cells. For each experiment, we have implemented control measures, and any variances observed in the figures may be attributed to individual variations among the animals. It is also possible that the MFI values measured by flow cytometry exhibit larger variations than a percentage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Figure 4 H/I - In contrast to NK cells in Fig 4E, F, the KO and WT ILC1s seem to co-cluster largely. Authors should validate differentially expressed genes. How strong is the effect of Blimp1 in ILC1s? Or is Blimp1 a critical TF driving effector differentiation in NK cells, while it has only subtle effects in ILC1 (these may be regulated by Hobit?)? This seems an interesting finding that should at least be discussed. For these types of small differences in ILC1, FACS confirmation analyses should be performed and findings be reevaluated using Cre-expressing controls (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>Response 5: We appreciate the suggestion from the reviewer. As request, we analyze the DEGs in liver cNK cells and ILC1s from our scRNA-seq data (revised Supplemental Figure 8, A and B). There only a few valuable DEGs in ILC1s compared to cNK cells. It’s likely that Prdm1 have more essential effect of cNK cells transcriptional program, while it plays more important role in keep the homeostasis of ILC1s population. We have discussed these points to better inform the readers.

While in our study, cNK cells and liver ILC1s reduced simultaneously in <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> mice, and even more significant in ILC1s. This indicates that while Prdm1 is expressed at lower levels in ILC1s, its role in preserving the quantity of ILC1s may be more crucial. Thus, Prdm1 and Hobit may have parallel program in instructing ILC1s functional development and maturation.”.</p><p>We cannot find valuable surface marker to evaluate the change in ILC1s, as most of changes are intracellular markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: The authors describe and discuss some of Figure 1 and 2 data as if Blimp1 would be involved in alternative NK versus ILC1 fates, but there is no evidence for this.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 6: There is no evidence that Prdm1 could alter the fate decision of the progenitor towards liver cNK or ILC1s. Although some studies reported the conversion between cNK cells and ILC1s in special contexts, it was widely accepted that liver cNK cells and ILC1s originated from different progenitors. While we observed changes in the proportions of liver cNK cells and ILC1 in Prdm1 KO mice, we still lack sufficient evidence to support the relative independence of NK and ILC1 development, as well as evidence to indicate that Prdm1 is exclusively responsible for NK and ILC1.</p><p>Regarding the changes in NK and ILC1 proportions after Prdm1 KO, we believe that both NK and ILC1 cells require Prdm1 to maintain their populations, with ILC1 possibly requiring it to a greater extent. This is the reason for the altered balance between NK and ILC1 cells following Prdm1 KO. We wish to clarify this point to prevent any misconceptions among readers. To address this, we have added the following content to the discussion section (page 25; line 509-516):</p><p>“Furthermore, although both liver NK cells and liver ILC1s require Prdm1 to maintain their quantity, liver ILC1s demonstrate a more pronounced dependency on Prdm1. However, it is currently widely believed that liver NK cells and liver ILC1s originate from different progenitors. It is worth noting that while we observed changes in the NK and ILC1 proportions after <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout, our data does not support the hypothesis that Prdm1 affects progenitor differentiation decisions, thereby influencing the fate selection of NK and ILC1. Further research may be needed to elucidate how Prdm1 regulates the balance between NK cells and ILC1s.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: There are several recent studies suggesting a role for Hobit, homologue of Blimp1, in NK cells and in ILC1, and in the control of liver metastases. The authors should discuss similar and unique functions of Hobit and Blimp1, also in the regulation of gene expression patterns, and should refer to these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 7: We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewer for your insightful comments, which bring forth a critical perspective. In accordance with the reviewer's suggestion, we have updated our discussion to include the diverse functions guided by Hobit and Prdm1 in regulating the development and function of cNK cells and ILC1s (page 27; line 554-561):</p><p>“Previous studies have identified Hobit and Prdm1 as central regulators instructing tissue-dependent programs and retention of diverse tissue-resident lymphocytes (18, 51, 53).

As we used littermates for the experiments and they are compared side by side, so the paired t-test analysis is acceptable. We reanalysis the significance in the results of Figure 1F, and Figure 2H using unpaired t-test. The statistics significance of Figure 1F using unpaired t-test was same as using t-test. However, in Figure 2H, the reduced IFN-γ production not reach statistics significance when used un-paired t-test (Supplemental Figure 12B). It may attribute to the variation between different littermates, but the trend is still under the scope of our conclusion. We believe that employing a paired t-test between littermates could be also meaningful.

Tumor Necrosis Factor Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is also expressed on liver ILC1s, but not on cNK cells (10, 11).”.</p><p>We also describe cNK and ILC1 phenotypes in our scRNA-seq data, as shown in page 13; line 259-261:</p><p>“cNK cells expressed high levels of <italic>Itga2</italic> (CD49b) and Eomes, while ILC1s had high levels expression of <italic>Itga1</italic> (CD49a) and <italic>Tnfsf10</italic> (Supplemental Figure 5, F and G).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 12: In the abstract authors state &quot;The present study unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism of Prdm1 in liver Type 1 ILCs, showing promising potential for developing innovative immune therapy strategies against liver cancer.&quot; - maybe authors should discuss how their findings could be used for therapeutic approaches?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 12: We appreciate comments from the reviewer. As there hasn't been a clear consensus on the role of Prdm1 in NK cells prior to this, some studies have suggested that Prdm1 can inhibit cytokine secretion by NK cells. Particularly, Kallies et al. in their 2011 article in <italic>Blood</italic> found that Prdm1 might suppress NK cell anti-tumor activity. Hence, there hasn't been any immunotherapy targeting Prdm1 in NK cells for cancer treatment. Our research demonstrates the enhancing role of Prdm1 in NK cell anti-tumor activity, providing theoretical support for NK cell therapy targeting Prdm1.</p><p>We added the following content to the discussion section (page 29; line 605-609):</p><p>“Further research may provide deeper insight into the role of PRDM1 in the anti-tumor function of human NK cells, enabling a more direct investigation of its application in cancer therapies.

We have checked the GSEA results, and found no valuable genes in IL-6 production in NK cells. According to the suggestions of another reviewer (Response to Reviewer 2 Comment, Comment 14), it may be prudent to omit this figure.</p><p>IL-17 signaling indicated the plasticity of ILC1s, that may be originated from the differentiation of ILC3, we added more discussion of this part (page 17; line 341-344).</p><p>“Several ILC3 signature genes, such as <italic>Rora</italic>, <italic>Tmem176a,</italic> and <italic>Tmem176b</italic> (45), highly expressed in this cluster (Supplemental Figure 7D).

Our data suggest that the elevated expression of JunB in NK cells may predispose them to exhaustion. Currently, our hypothesis regarding the promotion of NK cell exhaustion by high JunB expression is based on the observed correlation between JunB expression levels and exhaustion phenotypes (at the gene expression and IFN-γ secretion levels) and the findings in reference 67 (Lynn et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2019), where JunB was found to promote T cell exhaustion. However, we have not demonstrated causation between high JunB expression and exhaustion in NK cells. We propose that in NK cells, especially mature NK cells, excessive JunB expression may make them more sensitive to exhaustion inducers. Nevertheless, further research is needed to confirm this. To clarify this, we added the following content in the discussion section (page 26; line 537-543):</p><p>“While our current data is not sufficient to definitively classify these cells as exhausted NK cells, it supports that a subpopulation, referred to <italic>Junbhi</italic> cluster, demonstrates an exhaustion-like phenotype.</p><p>The significant increase in this cell population following <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout in NK cells may potentially be one of the reasons why <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> mice lose their tumor-killing capacity.

The primary reason for classifying this specific cluster of NK cells as tissue-resident is derived from the differential expression genes (DEGs) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, which demonstrate significant chemokine receptor activity within this cluster.</p><p>To make this statement more clearly, we check the expression of the above markers, but only Cd69 had expression in cNK clusters, which was highly expressed in _Junb_hi and _Cxcr3_hi cNK cells (revised Supplemental Figure 6D). We also used top30 DEGs in ILC1s versus cNK to calculate the module score in all cNK clusters, as _Cxcr3_hi cNK had highest score among these clusters (revised Supplemental Figure 6D).

Conversely, previous studies have found that Prdm1 might inhibit the proliferation of NK cells (C. Kucuk, et. al., PNAS, 2011). We acknowledge that there is ongoing debate regarding the precise definition of NK cell exhaustion. In our experiments, no changes were detected in the expression levels of surface markers (TIGIT) associated with exhaustion on NK cells following the knockout of Prdm1. However, we did note a significant reduction in the cytokine secretion capacity and tumor control efficacy of NK cells after Prdm1 knockout. We prefer to say that the consequence of compromised mitochondrial function might be increased exhaustion. As we mentioned in discussion part (line 482-483), mitochondrial fragmentation has been confirmed to be closely associated with NK cell exhaustion in tumor (Zheng et al. <italic>Nature immunology</italic>, 2019). Although the evidence to define the exhausted NK cells in <italic>Prdm1</italic>Δ<italic>Ncr1</italic> was not sufficient, our data may support the compromised mitochondrial functions, at least in part, associated with the exhausted phenotype of <italic>Prdm1</italic>Δ<italic>Ncr1</italic> NK cells in cancer.</p><p>We have discussed these points in our revised manuscript (page 26; line 529-543):</p><p>“Mitochondria are pivotal organelles crucial for cellular metabolism.

Similarly, mitochondrial fragmentation has been closely associated with NK cell exhaustion (67).</p><p>However, the concept of NK cell exhaustion isn't as firmly established as it is for T cells. Exhausted NK cells should primarily exhibit diminished functions. This is characterized by a diminished ability to destroy tumor cells, a reduced capability to activate other components of the immune system, and compromised proliferation and survival rates. Additionally, this reduced functionality is associated with a decline in the expression of molecules responsible for cytotoxic activity, lower production of IFN-γ, and metabolic disturbances that may arise from mitochondrial dysfunction. While our current data is not sufficient to definitively classify these cells as exhausted NK cells, it supports that a subpopulation, referred to _Junb_hi cluster, demonstrates an exhaustion-like phenotype. The significant increase in this cell population following <italic>Prdm1</italic> knockout in NK cells may potentially be one of the reasons why <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> mice lose their tumor-killing capacity.

To confirm these findings, we utilized flow cytometry to define macrophages, including both KCs and MDMs, gating by CD45+Ly6G-F4/80+CD11b+ (Figure 6D).</p><p>Our analysis showed that, following the deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Group 1 ILCs, there is a significant increase in both the proportion and number of macrophages in the liver (Figure 6D).</p><p>According to the transcriptional profile, liver macrophages further clustered and were labeled as “_Ly6c2_hi”; “_Cxcl2_hi”; “_Ear2_hi” MDMs, and “_Mrc1_hi”; “_C1q_hi” KCs (Figure 6A, Supplemental Figure 9, A-E). Increased proportion of MDMs and KCs was observed in <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> cells (Supplemental Figure 9B). Within MDMs clusters, _Ly6c2_hi MDMs mainly compose of <italic>Prdm1+/+</italic> cells, while <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> cells concentrated in _Cxcl2_hi cluster (Figure 6C). The scRNA-seq data reveal that following Prdm1 knockout in NKp46+ cells, there is a decrease in the proportion of KCs within the macrophage population, while the proportion of MDMs increases (Figure 6D). CX3CR1, a chemokine receptor, is extensively utilized to distinguish KCs and MDMs within macrophages. Cells expressing CX3CR1 are identified as MDMs, whereas those without CX3CR1 expression are categorized as KCs (56). Employing flow cytometry and leveraging CX3CR1 expression, we assessed the ratios of KCs and MDMs. However, diverging from the scRNA-seq findings, flow cytometry indicates that post-Prdm1 knockout in group 1 ILCs, there is a minor increase in the proportion of KCs within the total liver macrophages, and a decrease in the proportion of MDMs (Figure 6D; Supplemental Figure 9B). This discrepancy could stem from the different bases of classification: scRNA-seq defines KCs based on gene expression profiles, whereas flow cytometry differentiates between KCs and MDMs using the single surface marker, CX3CR1. Analysis of the macrophage subsets identified by scRNA-seq reveals that, while MDM clusters generally show high CX3CR1 expression, there exists a subset within MDMs, labeled <italic>Mrc1hi</italic>, that also exhibits high levels of CX3CR1 (Supplemental Figure 9C). Consequently, if flow cytometry solely employs CX3CR1 for differentiating between KCs and MDMs, it could result in disparities when compared to scRNA-seq outcomes. Both KCs and MDMs has significantly increased in <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> mice, which was consist with the scRNA-seq data (Supplemental Figure 9, B and F). Despite the decrease in the proportion of <italic>Ly6c2hi</italic> MDMs in <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> mice, the expression levels of <italic>Ly6c2</italic> exhibited minimal variation between WT and <italic>Prdm1ΔNcr1</italic> mice (Supplemental Figure 9D).

This part of the current study aims to investigate whether Prdm1 aids NK cells or ILC1 in resisting the exhaustion induced by malignant tumors. Specifically, we seek to ascertain whether the absence of Prdm1 renders NK cells or ILC1 more susceptible to exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, we will consider the capacity to secrete IFN-γ upon IL-12/IL-18 stimulation as one indicative aspect of exhaustion. It's crucial to emphasize that this assessment serves as only one piece of evidence, not the sole determinant.

It's essential to clarify that our approach does not involve stimulating with tumor cells to evaluate the secretion capacity of IFN-γ by NK cells or ILC1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study offers a significant advancement in understanding liver innate lymphoid cell (ILC) biology by elucidating the role of the transcription factor Prdm1. It shows that Prdm1 is crucial in maintaining the balance between conventional natural killer (cNK) cells and ILC1s in the liver, with knockout models revealing a vital role in cancer defense mechanisms. Despite not affecting direct cytotoxicity, Prdm1 deficiency leads to increased cancer metastasis and reduced secretion of key molecules like IFN-γ, pointing to its importance in immune regulation. The use of single-cell RNA sequencing further underscores Prdm1's role in cellular communication within the liver's immune milieu. This study is a robust contribution to the field, providing insights that could inform new immunotherapy approaches for liver cancer.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study's strength lies in its comprehensive approach, combining the specificity of Prdm1 conditional deletion in Ncr1-cre mice with integrative omics analyses and cutting-edge cytometry to delineate Prdm1's role in liver Type 1 ILC biology and its functional implications in tumor immunity. This multifaceted strategy not only clarifies Prdm1's influence on ILC composition and maturation but also conveys potential therapeutic insights for liver cancer immunotherapy.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your interest and critical assessment of our manuscript.

Furthermore, the absence of direct human data, such as the effects of PRDM1 deletion in human NK cells or stem cells during their differentiation into NK and ILC1, leaves a gap in translating these findings to clinical settings.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1: We appreciate the reviewer for raising these important points, which we see as a unique opportunity for future work to transform our understanding of Prdm1 and its targets as opposed to a weakness of the present study.</p><p>In our revised manuscript, we have discussed these limitations of our study (page 29; line 602-609):</p><p>“While our findings underscore the importance of Prdm1 in liver cNK cells and ILC1s tumor immune surveillance, it does not be validated in human NK cells, whereas previous studies have found that PRDM1 might inhibit the proliferation and function of human NK cells (33, 73). Furthermore, we not provided an in-depth evaluation in multiple tumor models. Further research may provide deeper insight into the role of PRDM1 in the anti-tumor function of human NK cells, enabling a more direct investigation of its application in cancer therapies. Given its important role in preserving liver cNK cells and ILC1s functional heterogeneity, enhancing Prdm1 function in human NK cells could potentially be a strategy to promote NK cell-based immunotherapy for cancer.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p>(Introduction)</p><p>Comment 2: Reference 1 appears slightly misplaced.

As requested, we reanalyzed our data using the refined NK cell signature from Cursons et al. (revised Figure 1 A-C; revised Supplemental Figure 1). Of note, the overall survival of liver cancer (LIHC) patients only reached statistics significance when compared high and low expression of refined PRDM1-NK signature with a median cutoff (Figure 1, A-C).

The answer is below:</p><p>The expression of Cre and the insertion of loxP sequences both have the potential to influence gene expression. This is because the region where loxP is inserted may contain regulatory sequences for the gene of interest. Ncr1-Cre is a frequently used transgenic mouse model in our laboratory. In our prior research, we also had concerns about the possible impact of Cre on NKp46 expression, which could lead to a decline in NK cell function. Therefore, in our previous studies focused on Smad4 expression in NK cells, we conducted similar experiments. In Figure 6 of our published paper in the Journal of Clinical Investigation (Wang et al., <italic>J Clin Invest</italic>, 2018), we compared NKp46iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/WT with NKp46-iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/fl. Although the primary purpose is to establish Smad4's independence from TGF-β, it also allows for a comparison between Smad4fl/fl and Smad4fl/WT in the presence of Cre. In the critical phenotype we assessed, NKp46iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/fl (compared with NKp46-iCreTgfbr2fl/flSmad4fl/WT) exhibited the same phenotype as NKp46-iCreSmad4fl/fl (compared with NKp46WTSmad4fl/fl). This suggests that Cre's influence on NK cells may be within a reasonable and controllable range. Furthermore, in contrast to the decrease in Ncr1 expression caused by Cre, the reduction in the expression levels of genes targeted by Loxp knockout, such as Prdm1 in this study (Figure 1 E), is more significant. Therefore, with the current techniques and research methods, we believe that the data provided in this study can support the role of Prdm1 in NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8: The proportion of ILC1 in wild-type mouse livers is notably higher than standard references. Could you confirm whether liver perfusion was performed before analysis? This procedure was not clearly detailed in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 8: We apologize that we did not provide enough detail regarding this point in our original method. We had performed the liver perfusion before analysis. This has now been clarified in the method section of the revised text (page 30-31; line 630-636):</p><p>“Mice were perfused with 1◊ PBS by portal vein puncture before harvesting tissues. Liver and lung was digested with 0.05% collagenase II for 30 minutes and filtered through 70 µm cell strainers, and mononuclear cells were isolated after subjected to density gradient using 30% and 70% percoll. Spleen were also removed and pressed through 70 µm filterers to obtain splenocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from peripheral blood after lysis of red blood cells (Biolegend, 420301). Flushing femurs and mechanical disruption of inguinal lymph nodes were performed to obtain cells from bone marrow and lymph nodes.”.</p><p>The lymphocyte proportions in mice from different laboratories may exhibit slight variations, possibly due to genetic background disparities. To minimize the influence of genetic backgrounds, paired littermates were used in the current study, wherein one is Prdm1 WT and the other has the Prdm1 gene knocked out in NK cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9: There appears to be inconsistency in reference formatting; for instance, Ref 39 does not match the formatting of other references.

These melanoma cells, with their low expression of MHC-I molecules, evade T cell-mediated immune surveillance, rendering them ideal targets for NK cells. Typically, this experimental melanoma metastasis assay involves tail vein injection, followed by nodules' detection in the lungs. To align with our investigation of liver-resident cNK and ILC1, we've introduced splenic injection (via the portal vein) and evaluated melanoma metastasis in the liver to reflect the anti-tumor capabilities of liver group 1 ILCs. We also explored subcutaneous tumor models, but we believe they may not effectively support Prdm1's role in cNK cells, particularly liver-resident NK cells and ILC1. While we've experimented with models using mouse liver tumor cells like Hepa 1-6, we found them less stable than B16F10 and less conducive to quantification. Should more suitable models or cells line emerge, we remain open to exploring them in future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 13: The absence of in vitro killing assessments against B16F10 and YAC-1 leaves a gap in the NK cell characterisation which would be valuable to address.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 13: Isolating NK cells for ex vivo cytotoxicity assays typically requires stimulation with high concentrations of IL-2. Under such high IL-2 stimulation, many intracellular differences that contribute to difference in cytotoxicity, such as changes in transcription factors, are often masked. Another issue is that current ex vivo NK cell cytotoxicity assays often only isolate NK cells from the spleen. Liver-resident NK cells, on the other hand, are often limited in quantity and isolation methods, making it challenging to conduct ex vivo cytotoxicity assays effectively. If more sensitive detection methods become available, we will also incorporate ex vivo data into our future research endeavors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 14: The suggestion that NK cells produce IL-6 is indeed a bold one, and without additional validation through intracellular cytokine detection or ELISA, it may be prudent to omit these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 14: We have checked the GSEA results, and found no valuable genes in IL-6 production.</p><p>Therefore, we have removed this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 15: The lack of fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls in Figure 3 and Supplementary</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4 is noted; including these would enhance the validity of your gating strategies.</p><p>Response 15: As requested, we add the FMO controls in aforementioned figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 16: There seems to be a minor mix-up in referring to Figure 4A in the scRNAseq results section, perhaps it was intended to refer to Figure 3A?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 16: We have corrected this part (line 247).

Such validation could merit their inclusion in the main figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 19: This is a very good suggestion. Currently, our data offer only limited indications in this context. We have chosen to validate some aspects of Prmd1's influence on cytotoxicity molecules.
