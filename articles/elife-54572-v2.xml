We report a collection of 1200 transgenic zebrafish strains made with the gene-break transposon (GBT) protein trap to simultaneously report and reversibly knockdown the tagged genes. Protein trap-associated mRFP expression shows previously undocumented expression of 35% and 90% of cloned genes at 2 and 4 days post-fertilization, respectively. Further, investigated alleles regularly show 99% gene-specific mRNA knockdown. Homozygous GBT animals in <italic>ryr1b</italic>, <italic>fras1</italic>, <italic>tnnt2a</italic>, <italic>edar</italic> and <italic>hmcn1</italic> phenocopied established mutants. 204 cloned lines trapped diverse proteins, including 64 orthologs of human disease-associated genes with 40 as potential new disease models. Severely reduced skeletal muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in GBT <italic>ryr1b</italic> homozygous animals validated the ability to explore molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases. This GBT system facilitates novel functional genome annotation towards understanding cellular and molecular underpinnings of vertebrate biology and human disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human genome counts over 20,000 genes, which can be turned on and off to create the proteins required for most of life processes. Once produced, proteins need move to specific locations in the cell, where they are able to perform their jobs. Despite striking scientific advances, 90% of human genes are still under-studied; where the proteins they code for go, and what they do remains unknown.</p><p>Zebrafish share many genes with humans, but they are much easier to manipulate genetically. Here, Ichino et al. used various methods in zebrafish to create a detailed ‘catalogue’ of previously poorly understood genes, focusing on where the proteins they coded for ended up and the biological processes they were involved with.</p><p>First, a genetic tool called gene-breaking transposons (GBTs) was used to create over 1,200 strains of genetically altered fish in which a specific protein was both tagged with a luminescent marker and unable to perform its role. Further analysis of 204 of these strains revealed new insight into the role of each protein, with many having unexpected roles and localisations. For example, in one zebrafish strain, the affected gene was similar to a human gene which, when inactivated, causes severe muscle weakness. These fish swam abnormally slowly and also had muscle problems, suggesting that the GBT fish strains could ‘model’ the human disease.</p><p>This work sheds new light on the role of many previously poorly understood genes. In the future, similar collections of GBT fish strains could help researchers to study both normal human biology and disease. They could especially be useful in cases where the genes responsible for certain conditions are still difficult to identify.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein trap</kwd><kwd>gene-break transposon</kwd><kwd>disease model</kwd><kwd>human genetic disorders</kwd><kwd>light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>gene reversion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM63904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA14546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK093399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG006431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Mayo Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Internal</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ekker</surname><given-names>Stephen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN 05389-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Xiao-Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The intramural Reserch Program of the National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHG000183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Shawn M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Roy J.

A more complete understanding of any genetic locus requires knowledge of its expression pattern and its function(s) in subcellular, cellular, and organismal contexts—the compendium of information that can be described as a gene ‘codex’. Despite their importance, the expression patterns and functions of most protein coding genes remain surprisingly uncharacterized. The number of these genes linked to human disease without functional insights into their gene-disease relationships highlights the significance of this knowledge gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kettleborough et al., 2013</xref>). In recent estimates, 80% of rare, undiagnosed diseases are thought to have genetic underpinnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Varga et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wangler et al., 2017</xref>). Tools are therefore needed to identify and annotate the expression and function(s) of these poorly characterized gene products in both biological and pathological processes.</p><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) has emerged as an outstanding model to bridge the gap between sequence and function in the vertebrate genome. Investigations of gene function in zebrafish, from organismal to subcellular, are amenable to both forward and reverse genetic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stoeger et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the natural transparency of developing zebrafish enables live, non-invasive collection of gene expression data at a subcellular resolution on an organismal scale. Therefore, the zebrafish facilitates parallel discovery of gene expression and function towards a comprehensive codex of the vertebrate genome. To begin constructing this vertebrate codex, we previously developed a unique, revertible mutagenesis tool called the gene-break transposon (GBT) with elements that cooperate to report gene sequence, expression pattern, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2011a</xref>). Specifically, when integrated in the sense orientation of a transcriptional unit, the GBT protein trap overrides endogenous splicing and creates a fusion between upstream exons and its start-codon deficient monomeric RFP (mRFP) reporter. Then, the strong internal polyadenylation site and putative border element following the mRFP truncate the gene product. Finally, the GBT construct is flanked by loxP sites on either side to enable excision and subsequent rescue with Cre-recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2011a</xref>).</p><p>Visualization of the start-codon deficient mRFP reporter requires an in-frame integration. In the original GBT protein trap construct, RP2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), this in-frame requirement restricts mRFP expression to a single reading frame and leaves the potential to truncate genes without reporting their expression with mRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2011a</xref>). We therefore developed a new series of GBT protein trap constructs, including versions to trap expression in each of the three potential reading frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Alongside the original, we employed these new vectors in zebrafish to generate and catalog over 800 additional GBT protein trap lines with visible mRFP expression at 2 days post-fertilization (dpf) (end of embryogenesis) or four dpf (larval stage). 147 of these additional GBT lines were cloned, and candidate genes were identified for another 144 GBT lines. mRFP expression in cloned GBT lines showcased novel expression patterns for a population of genes encoding diverse proteins in function and localization, including 64 implicated in human disease. Further, animals homozygous for the GBT allele in <italic>ryr1b</italic> displayed severely dampened skeletal muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, demonstrating the ability to elucidate molecular mechanisms of genetic disorders. Since detailed investigations of mutant phenotypes are vital to functional annotation of the vertebrate genome, the mutagenic reporters in our GBT system provide the basis for this functional annotation to better understand normal biology and human disease.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the RP2 and RP8 gene-break transposon (GBT) system with all three reading frames of AUG-less mRFP reporter.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Schematic of the GBT system, RP2 and RP8 incorporate a protein-trap cassette fused with three reading frames of AUG-less mRFP reporter and a 3’ exon trap cassette with GFP or tagBFP reporters, respectively.

First, effective transcript trapping does not always generate mRFP reporter expression because the RP2.1 plasmid is designed for a single reading frame. Molecular cloning of GFP<sup>+</sup>/mRFP<sup>-</sup> lines demonstrated the requirement to capture an appropriate reading frame to visualize the mRFP reporter. Even though RP2.1 is designed to use one main reading frame, some lines with mRFP expression used an alternate ‘CAG’ five nucleotides downstream of the main splice acceptor which offered a second chance at creating a functional mRFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2011a</xref>). Therefore, to maximize genome coverage of our mutagenesis vectors in this study, we created a series of RP2 constructs to encode functional mRFP in each of the three reading frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, the 3’ exon trap in the RP2 series uses the nearly ubiquitous β-actin promoter to drive expression of GFP (detectable around the seven- to eight-somite-stage similar to ubiquitous GFP expression driven under the <italic>EF1α</italic> enhancer/promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2003</xref>]) which could interfere with another GFP-based reporter system in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2011a</xref>). To overcome this limitation, we engineered a novel, next-generation GBT series called RP8. RP8 constructs possess a new 3’ exon trap cassette that uses the γ-crystalline promoter to drive expression of lens-specific tagBFP instead of the ubiquitous expression GFP with RP2 series vectors. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Additionally, all RP8 series for three reading frames reporting mRFP constructs are built on a smaller vector backbone and include new restriction enzyme sites that render these vectors modular for subsequent genetic engineering. Using all five of these new GBT constructs in zebrafish, we conducted an initial screen for expression of protein trap mRFP and observed that all RP2 and RP8 series constructs readily produced mRFP fusion proteins expressed from their endogenous promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Creation of a GBT-line collection enables illumination of the vertebrate genome</title><p>We then deployed all of these GBT vectors to generate over 800 additional zebrafish GBT lines. A key feature of the protein trap in these lines is the ability to non-invasively image the spatial and temporal expression patterns of the trapped loci. Our initial mRFP<sup>+</sup> lines demonstrated that, using standard methods, this imaging was going to be a major bottleneck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consequently, we utilized both SCORE imaging—a capillary tube placed in a refractive index-matched medium for efficient sample rotation—on an ApoTome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petzold et al., 2010</xref>, and see Materials and methods) or a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 SPIM microscope (see Materials and methods) to enable high throughput fluorescence imaging.

First, fin-clips from four male animals per GBT line were obtained during sperm cryopreservation and used as a source of DNA for cloning the integrated locus. Next, high-throughput sequencing amplified reads with barcodes linked to the source of DNA from the sperm-cryopreserved males. Mapping reads to the genome indicated potential GBT integration loci in each individual. A shared integration locus in multiple individuals from a single GBT line was considered a candidate integrated locus, and we termed a GBT line with at least one candidate integrated locus a ‘GBT-candidate line’. After a candidate was determined using the sequencing pipeline or other manual molecular approaches, such as 5’ RACE, 3’ RACE, iPCR, or TAIL PCR, we used standard PCR to test if the candidate integration locus segregates with mRFP expression.</p><p>At the end of this pipeline, 204 GBT-candidate lines met the highest stringency of confirmed expression linkage and were classified as ‘GBT-confirmed lines’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In this manuscript we broadened GBT genomic coverage through the development of an RP2 construct series to encode functional mRFP in each of the potential reading frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While each individual construct still only integrates in-frame in a subset of introns, the RP2 series potentiates in-frame mRFP for any intron with Tol2-mediated integration. We also desired to increase GBT utility for subsequent genomic engineering applications. As RP2 series constructs were not modularly designed, we iteratively developed a next generation RP8 GBT series. All RP8 constructs include new restriction enzyme sites that render them modular for custom engineering. Additionally, RP8 series constructs use a smaller backbone designed to enhance transgenic efficiency. RP8 vectors most notably possess a new 3’ exon trap cassette that uses the γ-crystalline promoter to drive expression of lens-specific tagBFP instead of the ubiquitous expression of GFP delivered from RP2 vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found this lens-specific tagBFP to be equally useful in screening founders with GBT integrations. While we did not explicitly validate that the RP8 series provides transcriptional effects equivalent to the RP2 series, the major functional change in RP8 lies in its 3’ exon trap. We therefore expect the knockdown to be similar between RP8 and RP2.</p><p>Two additional zebrafish transposon-based protein trap vectors have been established. Dr. Fraser’s group developed the FlipTrap system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trinh et al., 2011</xref>) that is mutagenic in the presence of Cre-recombinase. However, this FlipTrap system is primarily focused on imaging fusion proteins in vivo and addressing cellular dynamics. The Chen lab developed a complementary flipping system called the FT1 system that uses either Cre or Flp recombinase to regulate its alleles depending on the original insertion orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). Our GBT system is highly complementary and non-redundant with these alternative transposon-based protein trap methods. The 5’ protein trap in the GBT system is terminated through an enhanced polyadenylation signal in conjunction with a putative border element and a second splice acceptor in the 3’ exon trap helps eliminate any pass-through. Together these elements achieve higher gene-specific mRNA knockdown than the single splice acceptor and the basic polyadenylation signal in FlipTrap and FT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition to a 5’ protein trap, our GBT system also possesses a 3’ exon trap that serves as a means for screening integrations, reports 3’ sequence, and possesses the ability to trap (without mRFP expression) non-coding RNAs that undergo splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with its mRNA knockdown abilities, the mutagenic efficacy of the GBT system is functionally similar to other genome-wide forward genetic approaches at identifying critical early developmental loci. The GBT system achieved 7% recovery of visible early (through five dpf) developmental phenotypes during an initial forward genetic screen. This recovery is comparable to the 5% recovered visible phenotypes from the Sanger TILLING consortium analysis of truncated zebrafish genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kettleborough et al., 2013</xref>).

While 5’ and 3’ RACE are necessary to confirm the mRNA fusion products, these unannotated coding sequences represent the possibility to annotate novel, protein-coding transcripts in these GBT lines. Therefore, GBT protein trapping can find, illuminate expression, and elucidate in vivo functions of novel genes and/or gene variants in poorly annotated regions of reference genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>GBT protein trapping annotates novel endogenous gene expression</title><p>GBT-based mRFP fusion proteins represent a notable advance over traditional techniques for probing endogenous gene expression (e.g., immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization) that have yielded very little gene expression data at later developmental stages. The truncated mRFP fusion proteins in both RP2 and RP8 series constructs exhibited distinct cellular localizations in our GBT lines throughout development, including two dpf and beyond. Approximately 90% of GBT-confirmed lines showcased novel expression patterns of their annotated genes at four dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>These GBT-based mRFP fusion proteins allow investigation of subcellular localization of these tagged-gene products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), with the exception of cases where the protein localization signal is contained in the C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trinh and Fraser, 2013</xref>). We indeed observed mRFP accumulation in the kidney tubules, white blood cells or developing bones in some GBT lines, likely based upon the remaining signal sequences at the N-terminus of the endogenous protein. Still, visualizing protein expression dynamics of GBT-trapped proteins in most lines should facilitate important initial annotations regarding subcellular localization of uncharacterized proteins to investigate molecular functions in vivo. With ever-improving fluorescence-based imaging tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), our GBT lines have the potential to annotate both cellular and subcellular gene expression at diverse stages on an organismal scale.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Gene-break protein trap library is a rich resource for the community</title><p>Taken together, GBT-based mRFP-reporters demonstrate how much we still have left to understand about the expression patterns of the overall proteome and, ultimately, the complex codex that is our genome. Even at the relatively well-studied 2-dpf stage, nearly 40% of GBT-confirmed lines elucidated novel gene expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Cataloging these expression patterns enables investigators to make collections of lines with expression in their cell/tissue of interest and/or a phenotype. The remaining 144 GBT-candidate lines and over 800 GBT lines represent a rich resource for genomic discoveries. For any GBT-candidate or GBT lines of interest, a similar cloning pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) can be employed to identify the GBT integration locus. In addition, the refinement of the zebrafish genome will enhance our ability to complete the annotation from GBT-line to GBT-confirmed line for any given line with a desired expression profile and/or phenotype. Together, this 1,200+ GBT-line collection is a new contribution for using zebrafish to annotate the vertebrate genome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Future genomic insights using the GBT system</title><p>Although our GBT lines were made with random integration, new targeted integration tools, such as GeneWeld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>), that employ gene editing techniques will empower labs to build custom GBT lines for their gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">El Khoury et al., 2018</xref>). The three reading frames and modularity of the RP8 series are especially well suited to targeted integration approaches. Further, a combination of targeted and random integration may best facilitate discovery. For instance, a targeted approach could integrate a GBT cassette into a well-characterized, process-associated gene. Then, random integration could be used to probe for genes that potentiate or abrogate the disruption in the original process-associated gene. With this approach, GBTs are a powerful tool to investigate multigenic processes, including human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>GBT system offers advantages over frame-shift mutations</title><p>Finally, targeted mutagenic technology, such as CRISPR and TALEN systems, has become the gold standard reverse genetic approach. However, engineered mutant animals using approaches generate targeted indel mutation frequently fail to display overt phenotypes, often explained by genetic compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balciunas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). One mechanism includes cellular increases in transcripts of genes in the same family that can functionally substitute when activated in a mutant background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balciunas, 2018</xref>). Recently, a number of studies using reverse genetics tools have revealed phenotype differences between knockouts (indel mutants), and knockdowns (antisense-treated animals) in multiple model systems including <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, mouse, and human cell lines. This discrepancy is attributed to transcriptomic changes in mutant but not in knockdown animals (Reviewed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). For example, knockdown of <italic>egfl7</italic>, an endothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) gene, induces severe vascular defects, whereas most <italic>egfl7</italic> mutants exhibit no obvious defect, resulting from upregulation of other ECM proteins, especially emilins in <italic>egfl7</italic> mutants, but not in <italic>egfl7</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ronzitti, 2019</xref>). As another mechanism of genetic compensation, mRNA processing—including nonsense-associated exon skipping and the use of alternative start or splice sites to escape nonsense-mediated decay—has been recently demonstrated to hinder loss-of-function approaches in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prykhozhij et al., 2017</xref>), in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lalonde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Winter et al., 2019</xref>) and in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jagannathan and Bradley, 2016</xref>). In contrast, the molecular mechanism of GBT mutagenesis can normally avoid this genetic compensation effect seen with small indel mutations because the strong poly (A)-trapping element in the 5’ exon trap domain of RP cassettes can reduce mRNA to below 1% of the complete wild-type transcript level. This reduction eliminates many sources of transcriptional adaptations triggered by a loss of function mutation, such as alternative transcriptional start sites, splicing, or alternative translation initiation. The GBT can therefore act as a useful validation tool when targeted mutations with other technologies fail to display any phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

For ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> quantitation, a unique F<sub>0</sub> was determined for each Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient event. In the case where a cell exhibited multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient events, these events were treated as technical replicates and were averaged to give a single peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for each cell. In the case where a field contained multiple cells, the peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values for each cell were treated as technical replicates and averaged to give an average response for that animal. Cells or animals were considered biological replicates for analyses of peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and number of responses. For kinetic measurements, only the first peak in from each cell was analyzed and each peak was considered a biological replicate. For cells with only ‘-ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>’ (photo-bleaching) recorded over the course of the trial, ‘0’ was denoted as the peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. Otherwise, the maximum numerical value of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> for each transient was assigned as peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>.

Homogenized samples were replaced to MaXtract High Density tubes (129056, QIAGEN) to separate between the organic solvent (phenol/chloroform) and the nucleic acid-containing aqueous. Total RNA was purified from the nucleic acid-containing aqueous using the RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN). 250 ng of total RNA from the individual larva was used for cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (18064014, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using random hexamer primers. The 16-folds diluted cDNA with deionized water were used as templates and no reverse transcriptase (RT) controls were run parallel to test for genomic DNA contamination. To analyze transcript levels, quantitative PCR was performed using SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX kit (BIO-94005, Bioline) and the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). <italic>eef1a1l1</italic> levels were used as reference. Three technical replicates were run for each sample and three biological replicates for each group and two no RT controls were also run. Data were analyzed through calculation of Delta Ct values.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Building the vertebrate codex using the gene breaking protein trap library&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic> and very sorry for the delay in getting back to you. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then advise further with a formal decision. We fully understand that due to the current situation, it is difficult to predict how long the revisions will actually take, but we would still like to get an estimate of how much time you would need if the circumstances were normal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) No direct evidence for protein trapping is provided.

Some of the collection was generated by improved gene breaking transposons (GBT) that differ from previous published GBT from the group in two ways: 3 vectors that covers all 3 reading frames by the 5' trap and a lens-specific promoter-driven BFP for the 3' trap. One feature of these mutant lines is that each allele carries a mRFP tag allowing live imaging of the expression pattern of the affected gene. The authors have acquired dorsal, ventral, and sagittal images of mRFP signal at 2 and 4 dpf for each allele and uncovered many previous undescribed expression patterns. The images can be accessed on a previously described website. The authors have also cryopreserved each line and deposited one copy of the library at the Zebrafish International Resource Center for distribution. Another feature of these alleles is that they are potentially revertible by Cre. Despite the ease of generating mutations in zebrafish nowadays, these features may still make the collection a useful resource for zebrafish investigators. In addition, these alleles cause &gt;97% reduction of the mRNA and recapitulate published phenotypes in mutant generated using other approaches. Many of the alleles affect genes whose human orthologs have been implicated in diseases. The mutant collection therefore may be a useful resource for human disease modeling and mechanism studies. As an example, the authors characterized muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the ryr1b homozygous mutant and demonstrated substantial decrease of the amplitude and increase of rising time of spike, consistent with its known function in regulating sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In addition, the authors identified a number of novel expressed loci.

To address this issue, Ichino et al. designed and tested several generations of gene trap constructs for probing expression pattern and gene function in the powerful vertebrate model system, the zebrafish. The work presented explains the design of an extremely clever three reading frame, fluorescently tagged and experimentally revertible splice acceptor-based gene trap vector, which they call the gene-break transposon protein trap (&quot;GBT system&quot;). The injection of vector and transposase into zebrafish eggs yielded some 1200 insertion lines in a powerful model system, the zebrafish. Heterozygous insertions yield normal expression pattern through larval development (and potentially beyond); homozygosing these mutagenizing insertions yields mutant fish whose phenotypes yield functional insights. This work lays a powerful foundation for potentially studying the expression patterns and functions of every gene in the vertebrate genome. The results include the discovery of previously unknown expression patterns for 91% of their trapped genes, based on imaging at 4 days post-fertilization. Mutant lines were shown to phenocopy existing mutants, and include models of human genetic disease. Overall, they authors present a compelling basis for consideration of the &quot;vertebrate codex&quot; – a term I find compelling.</p><p>Introduction: The Abstract was well-written, but the last sentence of the Introduction is overstated. Since phenotyping is dependent upon assays that may or may not have been used, it would seem more accurate to say something like, &quot;…this GBT system lays a foundation for functional annotation of the vertebrate genome…&quot; It would also add clarity to community thinking to explicitly note that mutant phenotyping is a key to functional annotation of genes.</p><p>Subsection “GBT protein trapping generates a variety of potential models of human disease”: The consideration of RYR1 in discussion would better be placed in one, not two, sections. The degree of repetition should be reduced.</p><p>Subsection “Gene-break transposon system as a next generation mutagenesis system”: The limitations of the old gene trap lines were already explained in the Results section. Emphasis in the Discussion section should focus on benefits of the new system.</p><p>Subsection “Gene-break transposon system as a next generation mutagenesis system”: The second paragraph seems to repeat what is in the Results section.</p><p>Figure 4: There is a striking degree of overlap in the beeswarm plots. It would be helpful to make the utility of these results more clear or to perhaps detail only the key aspects of the model, enough to be convincing of the focus of the paper – the novelty and utility of the gene-break transposon approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors published a paper describing a protein trap screen in 2011 in which they collected 350 patterns and characterized 40 lines extensively (Table 1 in the 2011 paper). The current manuscript is the expansion of the previous work. In this manuscript, (1) they constructed new protein trap vectors, (2) they collected 1200 lines (patterns) and performed molecular characterization of 213 lines (GBT-confirmed lines), (3) based on the trapped gene information, they grouped the trap lines from views of human diseases, ontology, and subcellular localization, (4) calcium imaging using the ryr1b mutant. This should have been a lot of work and the resources will be useful to the community. However, the advances made since work published in 2011 are unclear.</p><p>1) They constructed RP2 series vectors that contained RFP gene in three frames. Also, the RP8 series vectors have RFP in three frames and the crystalline promoter. I admit this is an interesting idea. However when one of them was used for injection, introns which cannot be targeted by the other vectors may be targeted, but at the same time it cannot target introns which can be targeted by the other vectors. Thus, a set of new vectors may increase coverage of the genome, but I do not think the modifications affect effectiveness of the mutagenesis screen. Also, the number of insertions created by using each vector is too small to evaluate the vectors and their idea. They need to mention such limitations.</p><p>2) In Supplementary file 1, most (nearly all) of the lines were created by using RP2.1. Since the authors reported the other new vectors, they need to evaluate those vectors with actual data (trapping events and efficiencies, etc). They need to show the power of these vectors.</p><p>3) Their indication of &quot;97% knockdown efficiency&quot; was already described in the 2011 paper. In this manuscript, since they constructed new RP8 series, they should measure the efficiencies of these vectors and discuss in comparison with the RP2 series.</p><p>4) In this manuscript, they described the nature of the traps mainly by based on the gene information (in relation to human disease genes, gene ontology (PANTHER), and subcellular localization). The power of this system is visualization of subcellular localization of the trapped protein. The expression patterns can be visualized without the protein trap mechanism. They need to show the data for subcellular localization of a certain number of the trapped proteins (at least more than 10?). They should show co-localization of the fusion protein and endogenous protein if the antibody is available.</p><p>5) ryr1b gene and mutants had been extensively reported by Hirata et al., (2007) and by themselves (Clark et al., 2011). What is new here is calcium imaging of muscle activities in the ryr1b mutant. However, the same result was obtained and described in Hirata et al., (2007) by electrophysiology. Thus, the novelty is poor. They should describe analysis of another gene which was not described previously.</p><p>6) They identified 12 homozygous lethal mutants, but I do not see any data for this. The authors should show the data. 5 mutants they mentioned in the text were already described in the previous manuscript.</p><p>7) In Table 3, they say they identified 12 new previously-unannotated genes. What are those genes? and how they were trapped by the vector? More data should be shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54572.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) No direct evidence for protein trapping is provided.

In our previous work, the subcellular localizations have, in most cases, been consistent with what is expected. These observations lead us to perform the new analyses based upon PANTHER and Human Protein Atlas instead using a high resolution imaging approach. We realize that we did not explicitly state this or cite these previous publications in this section. In the revision, we have added citations to our previous work and our rational for these analyses.</p><p>Similarly, we agree that showing some new protein trapping expression data, especially some that we can relate to our PANTHER and/or Human Protein Atlas analyses, is useful for readers.

However, given the regular questions we have received on this innovative mutagen, we took the opportunity to conduct and present this novel analysis compiling our mutagenicity data and the comparison to other protein trapping methods. We also describe here the first description of the two additional RP2-based vectors with only a single nucleotide difference from RP2.1 to enable the capture in any protein reading frame.</p><p>The RP8 variants were built for two reasons – to avoid the use of GFP as a reporter and to be a modular molecular cassette for others to use (i.e. with non-transposon genetic engineering methods such as GeneWeld targeted integration, (Wierson et al., 2018)). We report that the protein trap component is functioning as expected (and 18 of the GBT-confirmed lines we present contain RP8 integrations). We also included the same 1.6kb poly(A)/presumptive scaffold attachment transcriptional termination cassette we showed to be effective mutagens with the PX and RP2 vectors. Given that the major functional change to RP8 lies in its 3’ exon trap, we expect its mutagenicity to be similar to RP2, but we don’t have the data to confirm that it is the same at this time. We therefore have explicitly acknowledged in the revisions (subsection “Gene-break transposon system as a next generation mutagenesis system”) that we have not performed the analyses of RP8 mutagenicity and kept the RP8 vector description with this caveat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors identified a GBT allele in each of 12 previously unannotated protein coding genes. While novel, the authors did not provide support for these claims with evidence such as expression in WT, expression patterns, gene structure, and integration sites. Only referencing the online materials is insufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest in the previously unannotated transcripts. We have spent additional time analyzing these loci using additional publicly available resources, our own in-house RNA-Seq datasets and GRCz10. We focused on WT embryos at 4 different developmental stages, 36 hpf, 48 hpf, and 4 dpf (Data source: ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/data_files/danio_rerio/ across). The detail of this analysis is described in the revised method section. At the end of this additional work, we were able to resolved 7 lines (GBT0148, GBT0264, GBT0724, GBT1024, GBT1100 and GBT1168) into new cloned loci with likely transcripts (in the revised Supplementary file 1). In total, we resolved 7 out of these 10 unannotated GBT lines (in the revision) and moved this into our main catalog. Since we have informed genomic location of all 204 integration loci in the revised Supplementary file 1, we removed the previous Table 3 with the redundancy. We have also removed the individual section discussing Table 3. Instead, we have added the following text:</p><p>In subsection “Molecular cloning of a subset of GBT lines highlights the genetic diversity of this protein trap collection”, “A small subset of these GBT-confirmed lines mapped to areas in the genome without annotated transcripts. Publicly available RNA-sequencing data revealed reads flanking a majority of these mapped integrations. Some of these reads contained evidence of splicing in the sense orientation of the mRFP reporter (Supplementary file 1)”.</p><p>In subsection “GBT protein trapping provides the basis for annotation of functionally diverse proteins and novel transcripts mapped on poorly assembled genomic regions” it now reads, “We indeed found that 10 population of GBT integrations in the confirmed lines (with mRFP expression) failed to map to any predicted gene. However, RNA sequencing reads in public datasets identified potential unannotated coding sequences aligned with these GBT integration loci (Supplementary file 1). While 5' and 3' RACE are necessary to confirm the mRNA fusion products, these unannotated coding sequences represent the possibility to annotate novel, protein-coding transcripts in these GBT lines. Therefore, GBT protein trapping can find, illuminate expression, and elucidate in vivo functions of novel genes and/or gene variants in poorly annotated regions of reference genomes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The manuscript reports 12 embryonic lethal mutations, yet only mentioned the gene name of 6 published mutants. Phenotypic description of the 6 other embryonic lethal mutations will make them a better resource for the community.</p></disp-quote><p>Phenotypic descriptions definitely make a line particularly valuable for the community. A number of these lines with embryonic phenotypes have been cloned and published following this initial forward genetic screening assessment. Further, additional non-embryonic phenotypes have been discovered in some GBT-confirmed lines. Overall, 17 of our GBT-confirmed lines have been published or characterized to have a phenotype, ranging from embryonic lethal to reduced adult viability to differences in drug susceptibility. We have therefore created a new table (Supplementary file 2 in the revision) that contains the GBT-confirmed line number, zebrafish gene symbol, a description of the phenotype observed, and a reference to the publication where that has been described to make this information readily available to the readers. We added the following text in the Phenotype appearance in GBT lines is comparable to other mutagenic technologies for forward genetic screening section of the results: “To date, 17 of our GBT-confirmed lines have been published with homozygous phenotypes ranging from embryonic lethal, to reduced adult viability, to differences in pharmacological susceptibility (Supplementary file 2). Additional GBT-confirmed lines with homozygous phenotypes will continue to be identified and characterized”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript reports 1200 GBT lines, but only 213 of them have insertion site mapped.</p></disp-quote><p>Mapping confirmation is a technical throughput bottleneck in our work due to its multi-step and the artisanal nature of this process: (1) Initial isolation of a candidate genomic sequence (this was conducted in a parallel molecular screening process).

We take this comment as an opportunity to elaborate on the number of new GBT-confirmed lines that this manuscript offers the community. We thus added text to emphasize the following points. (1) Before this manuscript, we and our collaborators had published 57 total GBT-confirmed lines across five studies. (2) The present study alone provides an additional 147 unique GBT-confirmed lines, including 15 GBT lines that had been used in previous studies without their trapped genes being mapped. Many of these new GBT-confirmed lines stemmed from successful confirmation of GBT-candidate lines mapped with our next-generation sequencing pipeline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since unmapped lines are less interesting, the authors need to propose a way forward. Are the unmapped lines unmappable, or is there a way forward? If there is a way forward, why was this not already done?</p></disp-quote><p>The next-generation sequencing pipeline revealed candidate genes for an additional 144 GBT lines in the revision. These lines have simply not undergone the comprehensive manual confirmation/cloning process but have a full way forward to molecular isolation (as do all of the other hundreds of lines with only a described expression pattern). Indeed, between methods like inverse/splinkerette PCR and 5’ and 3’ RACE, we are confident nearly all protein trap lines can be readily mapped and confirmed. We have added an explicit section with the following description, “Gene-break protein trap library is a rich resource for the community” in the discussion on the road forward for (1) 144 candidate lines and (2) over 800 GBT lines with a novel expression pattern for any member of the zebrafish community. “Taken together, GBT-based mRFP-reporters demonstrate how much we still have left to understand about the expression patterns of the overall proteome and, ultimately, the complex codex that is our genome. Even at the relatively well-studied 2-dpf stage, nearly 40% of GBT-confirmed lines elucidated novel gene expression data (Figure 7). Cataloging these expression patterns enables investigators to make collections of lines with expression in their cell/tissue of interest and/or a phenotype. The remaining 144 GBT-candidate lines and over 800 GBT lines represent a rich resource for genomic discoveries. For any GBT-candidate or GBT lines of interest, a similar cloning pipeline (Figure 2) can be employed to identify the GBT integration locus. In addition, the refinement of the zebrafish genome will enhance our ability to complete the annotation from GBT-line to GBT-confirmed line for any given line with a desired expression profile and/or phenotype. Together, this 1,200+ GBT-line collection is a new contribution for using zebrafish to annotate the vertebrate genome.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Results section, it is difficult for the readers to distinguish published results from unpublished results.

We realize in our compendium mindset and the nature of how we wrote this paper as an overview that we made it very difficult to distinguish published data from novel results. We appreciate the opportunity to focus on highlighting the new data that we present. We have therefore prioritized clear separation of published and unpublished results. We have taken the following actions in a revised manuscript to better assist readers in finding new data in this manuscript:</p><p>1) At the beginning of the third paragraph of the Introduction, we changed the wording from “with a single GBT protein trap construct” to “In the original GBT protein trap construct” to signal to previous work that we have published. We also denoted RP2.1 as the “original” GBT protein trap construct in the remainder of the paper.</p><p>2) In the middle of the third paragraph of the Introduction, we modified the sentence to include the word “new” when referring to the constructs generated in this paper. In the same sentence, we changed from stating “over 1200” to “over 800 additional” to acknowledge the cumulative nature of the project while highlighting the new numbers in this paper as follows: “Alongside the original, we employed these new vectors in zebrafish to generate and catalog over 800 additional GBT protein trap lines with visible mRFP expression at 2 dpf (end of embryogenesis) or 4 dpf (larval stage)”. We also employ “over 800 additional” instead of “over 1200” when first describing the creation of the collection of the GBT lines in this manuscript.</p><p>3) In the last half of the third paragraph of the Introduction, we only highlight new analyses and data presented in this manuscript and remove any reference to data that has been previously published to give readers and overview to focus on the novel work in this paper.</p><p>4) We added a key citation to (Clark et al., 2011) in the middle of the second paragraph of subsection “GBT vector series RP2 and RP8 illuminate all three vertebrate proteomic reading frames” that provides the motivation to develop GBT constructs that trap expression in all three reading frames and to develop RP8 with a new 3’ exon trap.</p><p>5) We revised the end of the second paragraph of subsection “GBT vector series RP2 and RP8 to illuminate all three vertebrate proteomic reading frames” to be consistent with Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and only demonstrate the new expression off of RP2.2, RP2.3 and the RP8 series as follows: “Using all five of these new GBT constructs in zebrafish, we conducted an initial screen for expression of protein trap mRFP and observed that all RP2 and RP8 series constructs readily produced mRFP fusion proteins expressed from their endogenous promoters (Figure 1—figure supplement 1)”.</p><p>6) We specified how many of the GBT-confirmed lines in the 200+ collection are newly published as confirmed lines in this manuscript at the beginning of the subsection “Molecular cloning of a subset of GBT lines highlights the genetic diversity of this protein trap collection” as follows: “147 of these GBT-confirmed lines are newly characterized in this manuscript and were selected for confirmation based upon their expression pattern and/or homozygous phenotype (Supplementary file 1)”.</p><p>7) Under subsection “RP2.1 induces high knockdown efficiency of endogenous transcripts in GBT-confirmed lines” , we clarified that this section is the result of data compilation from previous publications with one additional dataset in the RP2.1 group as follows: “We wanted to know the knockdown efficacy of the GBT system as a quantitative assessment of mutagenicity. We therefore compiled qRT-PCR data to compare wild-type and truncated, mRFP-fused transcript levels for all 26 RP2.1-derived GBT-confirmed lines that we and others have tested (Clark et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2016), GBT0235 (RP2.1)—this manuscript). This compilation determined at minimum 97% knockdown in animals homozygous for the RP2.1 alleles”.</p><p>8) We now point out data that has been published before that is being reported in the Results section using words such as “published”, “compiled”, “initial”, “original”, “previously”, “reported”, and “previous study”.</p><p>9) Where unpublished data is juxtaposed with published data, we explicitly point out the unpublished data using words such as “new”, “additional”, “novel”, “in this study”, and “novel approach”.</p><p>10) While Figure 5 and Figure 6 do include some previously published GBT-confirmed lines, the analysis of human disease-associated genes, PANTHER classification, and subcellular localization via Human Protein Atlas are all new for this manuscript.</p><p>11) Figure 7 also represents a compilation of the entire GBT-confirmed line collection.

At the end of this additional work, we were able to resolved 7 lines (GBT0148, GBT0264, GBT0724, GBT1024, GBT1100 and GBT1168) into new cloned loci with likely transcripts (in the revised Supplementary file 1). In total, we resolved 7 out of these 10 unannotated GBT lines (in the revision) and moved this into our main catalog. Since we have informed genomic location of all 204 integration loci in the revised Supplementary file 1, we removed the previous Table 3 with the redundancy. We have also removed the individual section discussing Table 3. Instead, we have added the following text:</p><p>In subsection “Molecular cloning of a subset of GBT lines highlights the genetic diversity of this protein trap collection”, “A small subset of these GBT-confirmed lines mapped to areas in the genome without annotated transcripts. Publicly available RNA-sequencing data revealed reads flanking a majority of these mapped integrations. Some of these reads contained evidence of splicing in the sense orientation of the mRFP reporter (Supplementary file 1)”.</p><p>In subsection “GBT protein trapping provides the basis for annotation of functionally diverse proteins and novel transcripts mapped on poorly assembled genomic regions” it now reads, “We indeed found that 10 population of GBT integrations in the confirmed lines (with mRFP expression) failed to map to any predicted gene. However, RNA sequencing reads in public datasets identified potential unannotated coding sequences aligned with these GBT integration loci (Supplementary file 1). While 5' and 3' RACE are necessary to confirm the mRNA fusion products, these unannotated coding sequences represent the possibility to annotate novel, protein-coding transcripts in these GBT lines. Therefore, GBT protein trapping can find, illuminate expression, and elucidate in vivo functions of novel genes and/or gene variants in poorly annotated regions of reference genomes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Nine out of every 10 human genes has yet to be functionally characterized. To address this issue, Ichino et al. designed and tested several generations of gene trap constructs for probing expression pattern and gene function in the powerful vertebrate model system, the zebrafish. The work presented explains the design of an extremely clever three reading frame, fluorescently tagged and experimentally revertible splice acceptor-based gene trap vector, which they call the gene-break transposon protein trap (&quot;GBT system&quot;). The injection of vector and transposase into zebrafish eggs yielded some 1200 insertion lines in a powerful model system, the zebrafish. Heterozygous insertions yield normal expression pattern through larval development (and potentially beyond); homozygosing these mutagenizing insertions yields mutant fish whose phenotypes yield functional insights. This work lays a powerful foundation for potentially studying the expression patterns and functions of every gene in the vertebrate genome. The results include the discovery of previously unknown expression patterns for 91% of their trapped genes, based on imaging at 4 days post-fertilization. Mutant lines were shown to phenocopy existing mutants, and include models of human genetic disease. Overall, they authors present a compelling basis for consideration of the &quot;vertebrate codex&quot; – a term I find compelling.</p><p>Introduction: The Abstract was well-written, but the last sentence of the Introduction is overstated. Since phenotyping is dependent upon assays that may or may not have been used, it would seem more accurate to say something like, &quot;…this GBT system lays a foundation for functional annotation of the vertebrate genome…&quot; It would also add clarity to community thinking to explicitly note that mutant phenotyping is a key to functional annotation of genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the last sentence of the Introduction to state, “Since detailed investigations of mutant phenotypes are vital to functional annotation of the vertebrate genome, the mutagenic reporters in our GBT system provide the basis for this functional annotation to better understand normal biology and human disease”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “GBT protein trapping generates a variety of potential models of human disease”: The consideration of RYR1 in the Discussion section would better be placed in one, not two, sections.

The current manuscript is the expansion of the previous work. In this manuscript, (1) they constructed new protein trap vectors, (2) they collected 1200 lines (patterns) and performed molecular characterization of 213 lines (GBT-confirmed lines), (3) based on the trapped gene information, they grouped the trap lines from views of human diseases, ontology, and subcellular localization, (4) calcium imaging using the ryr1b mutant. This should have been a lot of work and the resources will be useful to the community. However, the advances made since work published in 2011 are unclear.</p><p>1) They constructed RP2 series vectors that contained RFP gene in three frames. Also, the RP8 series vectors have RFP in three frames and the crystalline promoter. I admit this is an interesting idea. However when one of them was used for injection, introns which cannot be targeted by the other vectors may be targeted, but at the same time it cannot target introns which can be targeted by the other vectors. Thus, a set of new vectors may increase coverage of the genome, but I do not think the modifications affect effectiveness of the mutagenesis screen. Also, the number of insertions created by using each vector is too small to evaluate the vectors and their idea. They need to mention such limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that a single vector cannot be a one size fits all solution for all introns. We have added a sentence in the Discussion section to explicitly point out that each vector can only target a subset of introns as follows, “While each individual construct still only integrates in-frame in a subset of introns, the RP2 series potentiates in-frame mRFP for any intron with Tol2-mediated integration”. We also explicitly highlight that having all three reading frames available offers the highest utility for future targeted integration approaches using RP8 as follows, “The three reading frames and modularity of the RP8 series are especially well suited to targeted integration approaches”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Supplementary file 1, most (nearly all) of the lines were created by using RP2.1. Since the authors reported the other new vectors, they need to evaluate those vectors with actual data (trapping events and efficiencies, etc). They need to show the power of these vectors.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that nearly all lines were made using RP2.1 and all of the mutagenicity data conducted using RP2.1. We also describe here the first description of the two additional RP2-based vectors with only a single nucleotide difference from RP2.1 to enable the capture in any protein reading frame. We show effective protein trapping with all RP2 series and RP8 series vectors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Their indication of &quot;97% knockdown efficiency&quot; was already described in the 2011 paper. In this manuscript, since they constructed new RP8 series, they should measure the efficiencies of these vectors and discuss in comparison with the RP2 series.</p></disp-quote><p>The RP8 variants were built for two reasons – to avoid the use of GFP as a reporter and to be a modular molecular cassette for others to use (i.e. with non-transposon genetic engineering methods such as GeneWeld targeted integration, (Wierson et al., 2018)). We report that the protein trap component is functioning as expected (and 18 of the GBT-confirmed lines we present contain RP8 integrations). We also included the same 1.6kb poly(A)/presumptive scaffold attachment transcriptional termination cassette we showed to be effective mutagens with the PX and RP2 vectors. Given that the major functional change to RP8 lies in its 3’ exon trap, we expect its mutagenicity to be similar to RP2, but we don’t have the data to confirm that it is the same at this time. We therefore have explicitly acknowledged in subsection “Gene-break transposon system as a next generation mutagenesis system” that we have not performed the analyses of RP8 mutagenicity and kept the RP8 vector description with this caveat.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In this manuscript, they described the nature of the traps mainly by based on the gene information (in relation to human disease genes, gene ontology (PANTHER), and subcellular localization). The power of this system is visualization of subcellular localization of the trapped protein. The expression patterns can be visualized without the protein trap mechanism. They need to show the data for subcellular localization of a certain number of the trapped proteins (at least more than 10?). They should show co-localization of the fusion protein and endogenous protein if the antibody is available.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly appreciate the concern about subcellular localization data gained through GBT protein trapping. In our previous work, the subcellular localizations have, in most cases, been consistent with what is expected. These observations lead us to perform the new analyses based upon PANTHER and Human Protein Atlas instead using a high resolution imaging approach. We realize that we did not explicitly state this or cite these previous publications in this section. In the revision, we have added citations to our previous work and our rational for these analyses.</p><p>Similarly, we agree that showing some new protein trapping expression data, especially some that we can relate to our PANTHER and/or Human Protein Atlas analyses, is useful for readers. We have therefore included confocal images of the GBT-confirmed lines GBT0235 (<italic>lrpprc</italic>) and GBT0348 (<italic>ryr1b</italic>) to highlight distinctive subcellular localization patterns at the top of the revised Figure 6. The human ortholog of <italic>lrpprc</italic> maps to mitochondria in Human Protein Atlas, but fails to map to a PANTHER class. The human ortholog of <italic>ryr1b</italic> maps to the cytosol, Golgi, and vesicles in Human Protein Atlas and is classified as a transporter in PANTHER analysis. We have also added additional confocal images that show distinct subcellular localizations in GBT-candidate lines and GBT lines to further demonstrate protein trapping in these lines in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) ryr1b gene and mutants had been extensively reported by Hirata et al., (2007) and by themselves (Clark et al., 2011). What is new here is calcium imaging of muscle activities in the ryr1b mutant. However, the same result was obtained and described in Hirata et al., (2007) by electrophysiology. Thus, the novelty is poor. They should describe analysis of another gene which was not described previously.</p></disp-quote><p>The inadvertent omission to the prior and excellent Hirata paper has been corrected. Hirata et al., 2007 did a calcium imaging approach to assess the muscle specific phenotype but only quantified peak amplitude.(Hirata et al., 2007) We additionally quantified kinetic parameters in our calcium imaging data. Further, we have re-emphasized these experiments primarily serving as validation study rather than bringing substantial novel data to the table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) They identified 12 homozygous lethal mutants, but I do not see any data for this. The authors should show the data. 5 mutants they mentioned in the text were already described in the previous manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have developed a table (Supplementary file 2 in the revision) characterizing all published mutants generated with the GBT system to date.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Table 3, they say they identified 12 new previously-unannotated genes. What are those genes? and how they were trapped by the vector? More data should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest in the previously unannotated transcripts. We have spent additional time analyzing these loci using additional publicly available resources, our own in-house RNA-Seq datasets and GRCz10.
