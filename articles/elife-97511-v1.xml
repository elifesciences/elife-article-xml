In prokaryotic cells, there are only two types of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) that are Zn<sup>2+</sup>- or NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent. In this study, we reported a protein, AhCobQ, in <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 that presents NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent KDAC activity. Furthermore, its KDAC activity is located in an unidentified domain (from 195 to 245 aa). Interestingly, AhCobQ has no homology with current known KDACs, and no homologous protein was found in eukaryotic cells. A protein substrate analysis showed that AhCobQ has specific protein substrates in common with other known KDACs, indicating that these KDACs can dynamically co-regulate the states of Kac proteins. Microbiological methods employed in this study affirmed AhCobQ’s positive regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) enzymatic activity at the K388 site, implicating AhCobQ in the modulation of bacterial enzymatic activities. In summary, our findings present compelling evidence that AhCobQ represents a distinctive type of KDAC with significant roles in bacterial biological functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, due to the development of specific antibody enrichment technologies and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the research on protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) is increasing dramatically, and it provides a new platform for the study of bacterial function and regulation. PTMs refer to small molecular moieties that dynamically affect the structure and function of proteins through chemical modification of specific amino acid residues, so as to regulate many important biological processes, including cell metabolism, DNA transcription and replication, host infection, and stress resistance, therefore, play an important role in almost all physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carabetta et al., 2019</xref>). Among them, the Kac modification on protein is widely found in bacteria and participates in almost all key biological processes in bacterial life activities and is attracting the attention of microbiologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Although there are many reports on the identification of acetylation modification patterns of bacterial protein lysine residues in recent years, two fundamental questions have not been solved: how do these acetylation modifications arise (acetylation modifiers; writers) and how are they removed (deacetylation modifiers; erasers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang and Cole, 2020a</xref>). On the one hand, acetyl groups can be transferred to the target protein by acetyltransferases or non-enzymatic (chemical) mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">VanDrisse and Escalante-Semerena, 2019</xref>; on the other hand, proteins need to remove acetyl groups from modified proteins to reversibly regulate the function of target proteins. At present, the research on the functions and types of lysine deacetylases (KDACs) has been well-documented in eukaryotes, and most of them are histone deacetylases (HDACs). There are currently at least 18 types of HDACs in four classes (I–IV) in mammals and four plant-specific histone deacetylase 2 (HD2) members in the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yoshida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Of these, HDAC types I, II, and IV are Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, while type III deacetylases are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuins. Moreover, sirtuins can be divided into seven types (SIRT 1–7), which are distributed in different compartments of eukaryotic cells and perform important biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Narita et al., 2019</xref>). Besides these, ABHD14B, a novel KDAC, was reported to deacetylate non-histone substrates and influence glucose metabolism in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rajendran et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rajendran et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The currently known KDACs in bacteria include Zn<sup>2 +</sup>-dependent RpLdaA or Kdac1 (homologous to eukaryotic type II KDACs), Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent AcuC (homologous to type I), and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent sirtuin (homologous to type III) family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Watson and Christianson, 2023</xref>). Sirtuins, represented by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CobB, are the most widely distributed KDACs in many bacterial species and are involved in the regulation of a variety of important physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burckhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>). However, since the first report of the deacetylase function of CobB in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> in 1998, only two types (three classes) of KDACs have been confirmed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tsang and Escalante-Semerena, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Macek et al., 2019</xref>). The reasons that hinder new KDAC discovery in bacteria may be the following: (1) due to the in-depth study of KDACs in eukaryotes, almost all the current research on bacterial deacetylases are based on the characteristics of their homologous proteins in eukaryotes, but less attention is paid to bacteria-specific KDACs, and (2) the deacetylation process between protein substrates and KDACs may be a transient and reversible weak interaction. Moreover, there are thousands of lysine acetylation modification sites in cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2022</xref>); so, it is difficult to speculate the characteristics of their specific binding deacetylase, which makes the efficiency of enriching specific KDACs by common protein-protein interaction methods, such as co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down technologies, challenging. As a result, the identification and mechanism of new deacetylases in prokaryotic cells are lagging. Therefore, the screening and identification of new deacetylases, especially for new types of KDACs that may not depend on NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup>, have been a bottleneck limiting the research on the regulatory mechanisms of bacterial acetylation/deacetylation modifications.</p><p>In this study, we fortuitously identified the protein AhCobQ in <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 (UniProt ID A0KI27, gene ID <italic>AHA_1389</italic>) that presents NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein lysine deacetylase activity. Interestingly, although this protein is described as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein in the UniProt database, it is homologous with cobyric acid synthase in other bacterial species but shares no homology with CobB sirtuin family proteins. In addition to deacetylating lysine-acetylated sites common to AhCobB (UniProt ID A0KKN9, gene ID <italic>AHA_2317</italic>) sirtuin and another deacetylase AhAcuC (UniProt ID A0KLZ2, gene ID <italic>AHA_2788</italic>) in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, we also confirmed that AhCobQ deacetylated specific lysine-acetylated sites as did other KDACs, even in the same protein. In general, our results demonstrated a new type of bacterial KDAC, which shares no homology with currently known lysine deacetylases, including those in eukaryotic cells, and extends our understanding of the complicated regulatory mechanism of bacterial lysine acetylation modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The physiological phenotypes of AhCobQ are different from those of AhCobB</title><p>This project proceeded from the misunderstanding that AhCobQ and AhCobB may be homologous proteins because AhCobQ is annotated as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein in the UniProt database. Therefore, we constructed <italic>ahcobB</italic> and <italic>ahcobQ</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and compared their general physiological phenotypes. When compared to the wild-type strain (WT), the deletion of <italic>ahcobB</italic> did not affect the hemolytic or swarming ability of <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>. Notably, <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> did not affect the hemolytic ability either but significantly increased the swarming ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most interestingly, <italic>ΔahcobB</italic> sharply increased, while <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> significantly decreased, the bacterial biofilm formation ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To our surprise, we found that the proteins belong to different protein families. AhCobB (UniProt ID A0KKN9) belongs to a well-known NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacylase sirtuin family and shares a highly homologous SIR2 domain with CobB sirtuins in many bacterial species, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (NPD_ECOLI), <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (NPD_SALTY), <italic>Pseudomonas nitroreducens</italic> (A0A246F352_9PSED), and even seven types of sirtuins in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), which aroused our interest as to whether AhCobQ is a lysine deacetylase or not. To test this possibility, we purified AhCobQ, AhAcuC, and AhCobB proteins and incubated them in vitro with lysine acetylated-bovine serum albumin (Kac-BSA) as a protein substrate with and without NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). As a positive control, AhCobB and AhAcuC significantly deacetylated Kac-BSA in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn2 <sup>+</sup> buffer, which met our expectations. However, AhCobQ clearly deacetylated Kac-BSA regardless of whether NAD<sup>+</sup> or Zn2<sup>+</sup> were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>). Moreover, the KDAC activity of AhCobB was inhibited when the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) was added, but this did not affect the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, the introduction of the metal ion chelator, EDTA, had no discernible effect on the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results strongly indicate that AhCobQ is an NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent protein deacetylase. Additionally, since AhCobQ has an ATPase domain at the N-terminal, we also tested its deacetylase activity with or without ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).

The results showed that the MS intensities of at least 15 Kac peptides in BSA were significantly decreased after AhCobQ treatment. To further validate the KDAC characteristics of AhCobQ and exclude the possibility that AhCobQ may hydrolyze Kac peptides or switch the lysine acetylation to other unknown PTMs, we selected and synthetized an acetylated peptide sequence (YNGVFQECCQAEDK<sup>ac</sup>GACLLPK) with its unacetylated peptide as negative control and subjected them to additional deacetylation assays. The synthetized acetylated (STD*<sup>Kac</sup>) and deacetylated (STD) peptides were incubated with AhCobB and AhCobQ and then identified by LC MS/MS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the masses of the STD*<sup>Kac</sup> and STD peptides were 786.35538 (3+) and 772.35175 (3+), respectively. When the STD*<sup>Kac</sup> peptide was incubated with AhCobB or AhCobQ, the corresponding retention time in the C18 chromatography and the MS1 peak of the deacetylated peptide were found in both treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Moreover, the deacetylated and acetylated peptides were further validated in MS2 by LC MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

We divided and purified recombinant AhCobQ protein into two truncated protein fragments of 1–179 aa and 179–264 aa and then tested their deacetylase activities. To our surprise, the 179–264 aa protein fragment but not the 1–179 aa fragment showed NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent deacetylase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To better understand the deacetylase domain of AhCobQ, a total of 12 truncated protein fragments were constructed and purified, and their deacetylase activities were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the 1–179 aa, 200–255 aa, and 189–240 aa shortened proteins disrupted the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ to some extent, whereas the 179–264 aa, 189–264 aa, 199–264 aa, 195–264 aa, 195–255 aa, 189–245 aa, 189–250 aa, 189–255 aa, and 189–264 aa shortened proteins did not, indicating that the deacetylase activity may be in the 195–245 aa range. Interestingly, although the full amino acid sequence of AhCobQ (1–254 aa) is homologous with Soj protein (A0KQYT), site-determining protein (A0KI19 and A0KK56), and ParA family protein (A0KQG8) in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, the KDAC activity domain (195–245 aa) does not share homology with these proteins, which suggests the different biological roles among them.

This was ideal for excluding signal interference from the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, site-specific lysine acetylation of the target protein substrates was constructed using a two-plasmid-based system of genetically encoded N<sup>Ɛ</sup>-acetyllysine, which was purified and incubated with AhCobQ, AhCobB, and AhAcuC for western blot analysis against anti-lysine acetylation antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Moreover, K26 in ArcA-2 was reduced in both AhCobB and AhCobQ incubations.

Normally, reversibility and dynamicity are necessary characteristics of lysine acetylation. The regulatory mechanism of deacetylation has received as much attention as that of acetylation. In different bacterial species, there are hundreds to thousands of protein lysine acetylation modification sites, which are theoretically unlikely to be regulated by one or a few deacetylases, and there must be some unknown deacetylases in bacteria that act on specific protein substrates to maintain the normal physiological function of cells. Therefore, finding new bacterial deacetylases and identifying their modified protein substrates, so as to better understand the molecular mechanism of their regulation, are important in the research on protein acetylation modification regulation.</p><p>Here, we reported that the CobQ protein in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> is an NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent deacetylase, and it is very different from currently known deacetylases. We were first interested in the function of AhCobQ based on its annotation as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein in the UniProt database. The deacetylation assay suggested that AhCobQ deacetylated Kac-BSA in the same manner as AhCobB. To our surprise, AhCobQ does not share homology with any prokaryotic sirtuin CobB or currently known eukaryotic deacetylases. We then asked why this was the case since both proteins appeared to belong to the same protein family. Actually, CobB has a conflicting naming phenomenon in the UniProt annotation. There are two distinct CobB annotations in the UniProt database: one is the well-known NAD-dependent protein deacylase, such as NPD_ECOLI in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the other is the ATP-dependent a,c-diamide synthase, such as CobB_SINSX <italic>in Sinorhizobium sp</italic>. that plays an important role in cobalamin biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galperin and Grishin, 2000</xref>). In some bacterial species, a,c-diamide synthase is also annotated as CbiA (such as CBIA_SALTY, for example), indicating the controversial assignment of CobB. Interestingly, there is not an a,c-diamide synthase homologous protein in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966, and the CobB annotation in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 is specific for NAD-dependent protein deacylase. In general, the CobQ protein is annotated as cobyric acid synthase and belongs to a,c-diamide synthase (CobB or CbiA) but not the sirtuin protein (CobB) family. The role of AhCobQ is unknown to date because <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> may import rather than synthesize cobalamin (vitamin B12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Seshadri et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The LC MS/MS analysis of synthesized Kac peptides treated by AhCobQ further validated that this protein is a deacetylase and excluded the possibility of it being a hydrolase. Surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of AhCobB was not affected by NAD<sup>+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, or the sirtuin inhibitor NAM. Given that AhCobQ was reported to be an ATP-dependent cobyric acid synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galperin and Grishin, 2000</xref>), we also tested the effect of ATP on deacetylase activity but obtained negative results. Thus, the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ was determined to be NAD<sup>+</sup>-, Zn<sup>2+</sup>-, and ATP-independent. Subsequent assays showed that the deacetylase activity of AhCobQ was mediated by an unknown C-terminal domain in the 195–245 aa range that was downstream of the predicted ATPase domain, suggesting a new domain was responsible for deacetylation. However, the intrinsic enzymatic mechanism needs to be further investigated.</p><p>We then further asked whether the protein substrates of AhCobQ were the same as the unknown bacterial KDAC homologs in <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, AhCobB, and AhAcuC. Although the CobB substrates were identified in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the AcuC substrates and their comparison with the CobB substrates at a high throughput level had not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kuhn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weinert et al., 2017</xref>). The characteristics of Kac sites regulated by CobB and AcuC are not yet known. Here, we compared the differential expression of Kac proteins and sites among <italic>ahcobQ</italic>, <italic>ahcobB</italic>, and <italic>ahacuC</italic> mutant and wild-type strains using a quantitative proteomics method. We only focused on the high abundance of Kac proteins or sites (fold change &gt;1.5) when comparing the mutant and WT strains. The results showed that 9.9% of the acetylated proteins (312/3164 Kac protein) were regulated by <italic>ahcobB</italic>, which is consistent with the proportion in the <italic>E. coli cobB</italic> mutant and the previous conclusion that CobB is the predominate deacetylase in some bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weinert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AbouElfetouh et al., 2015</xref>). We also found 47 and 186 significantly enriched Kac proteins in <italic>ΔahcobQ</italic> and <italic>ΔahacuC</italic>, respectively. Interestingly, there were unique and overlapping Kac substrates among three KDACs, indicating that these KDACs may construct a complicated network for the co-regulation of acetylation proteins. Furthermore, although the enriched GO terms and related substrates were different, all the KDACs appeared to be involved in metabolic pathways.</p><p>To further validate our proteomics results, plasmid-based site-specific acetylation was introduced as a target of the recombinant proteins, and the deacetylase activity of the KDACs was determined in vitro. The behavior of the three KDACs on 4 target site-specific acetylated proteins was consistent with our proteomics results. AhCobQ regulated certain proteins at specific Kac sites, which implied that it is involved in specific biological functions. Moreover, AhCobQ and AhCobB also co-regulated the same Kac sites on ArcA-2 (Arginine deiminase), indicating that the cooperation of these KDACs may play an important role during the maintenance of cellular acetylation homeostasis. Most importantly, our results also showed that AhCobQ deacetylated different Kac sites on the same protein as AhCobB or AhAcuC. For example, the bacterial topoisomerase DNA gyrase GyrB is an essential enzyme that controls the topological state of DNA during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tari et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies reported the important role of GyrB in bacterial fluoroquinolone resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chauffour et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2022</xref>). The 3D structure prediction showed that GyrB K331 is located in the ATPase domain that is responsible for supercoiling DNA, whereas K449 is located in the Toprim domain that is required for the interaction with GyrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brino et al., 2000</xref>). Our current data showed that K331 and K449 were deacetylated by AhCobQ and AhCobB, respectively, indicating the delicate regulatory mechanisms in both functional domains. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that different KDACs regulate the Kac level at specific sites of the same protein and that they may be involved in differential biological functions in prokaryotic cells. To our knowledge, it is the first evidence that different KADCs regulates the Kac level at specific-site of one protein and that may involve in differential biological functions in prokaryotic cell. We then further wondered the role of AhCobQ in bacterial biological functions. ICD is a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, and also affects bacterial biofilm formation and virulence in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Venkat et al., 2018</xref>). Diverse Kac sites of bacterial ICD have been well identified. In <italic>E. coli</italic> K12, there are at least 15 Kac sites on ICD, and the Kac at K55 and K350 have been determined to play crucial roles on the enzymatic activity by a positively regulatory manner, while Kac at K100, K230, and K235 in a negatively regulatory manner. However, only four Kac sites including K55, K142, K177, and K350 have been proved to be deacetylated by CobB sirtuin obviously. In our quantitative MS data, there are at least ten Kac sites in ICD protein, while only the Kac level of ICD K388 was AhCobQ regulated and others were not altered in KADCs deleted strains. The following assay confirmed that the enzymatic activity of ICD was negatively regulated in a dose-dependent manner by deaectylated ICD K388 site by AhCobQ, whereas not affected by AhCobB and AhAcuC. These results indicate the important role of AhCobQ in bacterial metabolic regulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, here, we identified a novel NAD<sup>+</sup>- and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-independent deacetylase, AhCobQ, in prokaryotic cells, which does not share homology with current known deacetylases and is unique in prokaryotes. The deacetylase activity of this KDAC is through an unknown domain. Moreover, AhCobQ acetylates at least 47 protein substrates involved in many biological processes, especially metabolic pathways. We provide evidences that AhCobQ negatively regulates the enzymatic activity of bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenase at K388 site. These results indicate that AhCobQ has an important regulatory role in bacterial metabolic pathways. AhCobQ is a novel deacetylase in prokaryotic cells and its biological functions need to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Ni-NTA agarose beads were purchased from Yeasen Biotechnology; C18 ZipTips from Millipore Corporation; water and acetonitrile from Thermo Fisher Scientific; and formic acid (FA), dithiothreitol, acetone, and iodoacetamide from Sigma Aldrich.

Then, equal amounts of pTECH-MbAcK3RS (IPYE) and recombinant pET-21b plasmid were co-transfected into competent <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) on agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol. After culturing for 5 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm, the successful PCR products were confirmed with DNA sequencing.</p><p>The successfully site-specific acetylated mutants were cultured overnight in 5 mL of LB medium and then transferred to 200 mL of fresh LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 30 μg/mL chloramphenicol and incubated at 200 rpm and 37 °C. To express the acetyl proteins, 2 mM N-acetyllysine and 20 mM NAM were added to the medium at 37 °C and vortexed at 200 rpm until the OD at 600 nm reached about 0.8. Then, 200 μL of 1 M IPTG was added to the medium, and the cells were cultured at 16 °C and vortexed at 200 rpm for 18 h to express the proteins. The procedure of site-specific Kac protein purification was the same as the method described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Bioinformatics and data analysis</title><p>Amino acid sequences were obtained from the UniProt database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot">https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot</ext-link>).

Here is an example for this effort. Yuqian Wang et al. studied a novel Zn2+- and NAD+-independent KDAC protein, AhCobQ, in Aeromonas hydrophila. They studied the biological function of AhCobQ by using biochemistry method and MS identification technology to confirm it. These results extended our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of bacterial lysine acetylation modifications. However, I find this conclusion is a little speculative, and unfortunately it also doesn't totally support the conclusion as the authors provided.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>-It is a little arbitrary to come to the title &quot;Aeromonas hydrophila CobQ is a new type of NAD+- and Zn2+-independent protein lysine deacetylase in prokaryotes.&quot; It should be modified to delete the &quot;in the prokaryotes&quot; except that the authors get new more evidence in the other prokaryotes for the existence of the AhCobQ.</p><p>-I was confused about the arrangement of the supplementary results. Because there are no citations for Figures S9-S19.</p><p>-Same to the above, there are no data about Tables S1-S6.</p><p>-All the load control is not integrated. Please provide all of the load controls with whole PAGE gel or whole membrane western blot results.

This protein is annotated as a CobQ/CobB/MinD/ParA family protein and does not show similarity with known NAD+-dependent or Zn2+-dependent KDACs. The authors showed that AhCobQ has NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity with acetylated BSA by western blot and MS analyses. They also provided evidence that the 195-245 aa region of AhCobQ is responsible for the deacetylase activity, which is conserved in some marine prokaryotes and has no similarity with eukaryotic proteins. They identified target proteins of AhCobQ deacetylase by proteomic analysis and verified the deacetylase activity using site-specific Kac proteins. Finally, they showed that AhCobQ activates isocitrate dehydrogenase by deacetylation at K388.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The finding of a new type of KDAC has a valuable impact on the field of protein acetylation. The characters (NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity in an unknown domain) shown in this study are very unexpected.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The characters (NAD+ and Zn2+-independent deacetylase activity in an unknown domain) shown in this study are very unexpected. To convince readers, MSMS data must be necessary to accurately detect (de)acetylation at the target site in the deacetylase activity assay. The authors showed the MSMS data in assays with acetylated BSA, but other assays only rely on western blot.</p><p>(2) They prepared site-specific Kac proteins and used them in deacetylase activity assays. Incorporation of acetyllysine at the target site should be confirmed by MSMS and shown as supplementary data.</p><p>(3) The authors imply that the 195-245 aa region of AhCobQ may represent a new domain responsible for deacetylase activity. The feature of the region would be of interest but is not sufficiently described in Figure 5. The amino acid sequence alignments with representative proteins with conserved residues would be informative. It would be also informative if the modeled structure predicted by AlphaFold is shown and the structural similarity with known deacetylases is discussed.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The problem I raised has been well resolved.

The Coomassie Blue R-350 staining outcomes from the PVDF membranes. That is a good control for the experiment. However, I still have several questions about it:</p><p>(1) The first is the quality of these Western blot. Why all the bands of these Western blot is so ugly? To tell the truth, it is very difficult to come to a conclusion from these poor western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your feedback regarding the quality of the Western blots presented in Figure 7. We believe the “ugly bands” you referred to reflect our results validating the functions of CobQ through the use of recombinant site-specific Kac protein substrates.</p><p>In our study, we meticulously engineered these recombinant site-specific Kac proteins using a two-plasmid system, based on foundational research published in Nature Chemical Biology (2017, 13(12): 1253-1260), which introduced the genetic encoding of Nε-acetyllysine into recombinant proteins. However, we faced a common challenge: protein truncation due to premature translation termination at the reassigned codon. This issue not only hampers protein yields, as discussed in ChemBioChem (2017, 18(20): 1973-1983), but also contributes to the suboptimal appearance of the Western blot results.</p><p>Despite conducting at least two independent repetitions for the Western blot analysis of the site-specific Kac proteins, which yielded consistent results, we recognize that the overall quality remains less than ideal. This variability is inherently related to the characteristics of the target proteins. Nevertheless, the primary aim of our manuscript is to validate the novel deacetylase activity of CobQ. We have provided multiple lines of evidence, including mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and Western blot analyses, to substantiate this claim. In response to your comments, we have decided to remove the ambiguous Western blot results from Figure 7, retaining only four figures that demonstrate significant differences across at least two independent replicates (Author response images 1-5). Additionally, we have included four biological replicates of the Western blot results for ICD Kac388 + CobQ in the supplementary materials (Author response image 5) to further validate the deacetylase function of CobQ.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Western blot validation of the Kac26 AcrA-2 protein substrates regulated by the three KDACs in two biological replicates.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Western blot validation of the Kac48 Sun protein substrates regulated by the three KDACs in two biological replicates.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Western blot validation of the Kac103 Sun protein substrates regulated by the three KDACs in two biological replicates.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Western blot validation of the Kac195 Eno protein substrates regulated by the three KDACs in three biological replicates.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Western blot validation of the Kac388 ICD protein substrates regulated by AhCobQ in this study.</title><p>Each sample was independently repeated at least three time.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The second is why some of the results are not from the same PVDF by comparing the Coommassie staining with the WB results just as authors responded. For example, the HrpA-K816 (ac), Eno-K195 (ac), ArcA-2-K26 (ac), ArcA-2-K26 (ac), IscS-K93(ac), A0KJ75-K81(ac), GyrB-K331(ac), GyrB-K449(ac), FtsA-K320(ac), FtsA-K409(ac), RecA-K279(ac), and the RecA-K306(ac). All of them are clearly not from the same staining results of PVDF membrane but from a new PVDF membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We assure you that the R-350 stained PVDF membranes originate from the same Western blot membranes. However, we acknowledge that visual discrepancies may arise due to differences in imaging techniques. The Western blot results were scanned using a ChemiDoc MP (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), while the Coomassie R-350 stained PVDF membranes were captured using a standard camera. These differences can create a misleading appearance, making it seem as though they come from different membranes.</p><p>It is also important to note that the intensity of the protein marker cannot be directly compared between the two imaging methods. As illustrated in Author response image 6, the protein marker at 70 kDa is clearly detectable in the Coomassie R-350 image, whereas it may not be as apparent in the Western blot result due to inherent differences in detection sensitivity.</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>The comparison of Western blotting and R-350 strained results of same protein marker in the same PVDF membrane.</title><p>The protein marker located at 70 kDa can be detected easily in Coomassie R-350, while is difficult to display in WB result.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, we have removed some of the so-called &quot;ugly&quot; Western blot results in the updated manuscript and provided the original full film of the relevant images as an attachment. This documentation demonstrates that all the data you referenced originate from the same film, as shown in Figures 1-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The third is why there is no replication for all these WB results. We should draw a conclusion with serious attitude, but not from the only one repeat, even say nothing about the poor results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In the second version of the manuscript, we have included the original full film of the relevant images. While we previously explained the reasons behind the &quot;ugly&quot; Western blot results, we have decided to remove some, or even all, of these results from Figure 7 in the updated version. The related images will be updated in the supplementary materials (Figures 1-5 in responding letter and Figure 7 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Furthermore, we have provided a more detailed discussion regarding the poor results in the updated manuscript to ensure clarity and transparency. We appreciate your understanding and hope these changes meet your expectations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Questions to response of &quot; L174-187, L795 (Please show the whole membrane (or PAGE gel) of the loading control of CobB, and CobQ, except for the Kac-BSA)&quot;.</p><p>(1) As we all educated that there is no control, and no biology. Where is the band of CobQ? Why do not stain the same PVDF membrane with R-350 staining but with a new membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful feedback. As noted in our previous response, the absence of visible bands for AhCobQ and AhCobB on the Coomassie R-350 stained PVDF membrane is primarily due to the low loading amounts and protein loss during the Western blotting process.</p><p>To reinforce our findings, we repeated the analysis of the protein samples via SDS-PAGE, using the same loading quantity as in the previous Western blot shown in Figure 2 of the manuscript. As illustrated in Author response image 7, the bands for CobB and CobQ are discernible, albeit with significantly lower intensities compared to the Kac-BSA bands. Upon examining the full Coomassie R-350 stained PVDF membranes provided in Supplementary Material 1, we observe that the CobB and CobQ bands are not easily visible. This aligns with your observations and can be attributed to potential protein loss during the transfer from SDS-PAGE to the PVDF membrane.</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>The SDS-PAGE gel displayed the loading amounts of Kac-BSA and CobB/CobQ.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To enhance the visibility of the CobQ/CobB bands, we increased the loading of CobQ/CobB in a new Western blot experiment, using 2 µg of Kac-BSA in combination with 0.8 µg of CobQ/CobB. As shown in Figure 8, while the increasing amounts of Kac-BSA resulted in a more blurred signal, the bands for the recombinant CobQ and CobB proteins were clearly detectable. This indicates that both proteins were indeed involved in the in vitro protein deacetylation assay.</p><fig id="sa3fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>Western blot verified the deacetylase activity assay of AhCobQ and AhCobB on Kac-BSA.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97511-sa3-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Furthermore, we conducted a mass spectrometry analysis comparing Kac-BSA and Kac-BSA incubated with CobQ, as well as BSA without acetylation, against the <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> database with a cut-off of unique matched peptides &gt;1.

Our findings revealed that CobQ has the highest number of unique matched peptides (Author response table 1), while contaminants such as AHA_3036, AHA_0497, AHA_1279, and valS could be excluded, as they were present in Kac-BSA or BSA samples. Additionally, Tuf1, RplQ, GroEL, RpsF, RpsU, RpsB, RpsO, and RpsJ are known ribosomal subunits or chaperonins that are abundantly expressed in cells and may interact with various proteins, leading to

dehydrogenase E1 component, theoretically possesses deacetylase activity, this possibility is low. First, in the SDS-PAGE gel of the purified recombinant protein, CobQ is the major band, with other proteins present at very low levels (less than 1/10 of CobQ). This suggests that significant deacetylation by contaminants is unlikely. Second, we purified His-tagged AhCobQ and GST-fused AhCobQ separately and tested their deacetylase activities. As shown in Figure S4 of the updated manuscript, both purified AhCobQ proteins exhibited deacetylase activity, while the negative control (purified GST protein only) did not, further supporting our conclusion that enzyme activity is not attributable to contaminating proteins (Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Without the CobB and CobQ bands, it is impossible to say the function of CobQ is a new deacetylase. To avoid this confusion, it is easy to run a new gel and stain it with anti-His antibody to show these deacetylases.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have performed the experiment in the comment (1) as your suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The explanation about the CobB/CobQ bands are not visible is not acceptable. Because the molecular weight of the CobB and CobQ is smaller than that of BSA, it is impossible that these bands will be loss during membrane transfer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. I completely agree that the loss of CobB and CobQ proteins during membrane transfer is unlikely due to their smaller molecular weight compared to BSA. As shown in Figure 7, the bands for CobB and CobQ are detectable in the SDS-PAGE gel but not visible on the Coomassie R-350 stained PVDF membrane.</p><p>Several factors could contribute to this issue. One possibility is that the detection sensitivity of Coomassie R-350 may be lower than that of Coomassie R-250 used in the gel. Additionally, the Western blot results using an anti-His antibody further indicate low loading amounts of CobB and CobQ proteins on the PVDF membrane (Figure 8). This suggests that the observed low levels may indeed be due to protein loss during the membrane transfer process, despite their relatively small size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I found Tables S1 and S2 in the revised manuscript. It is strange to me that the intensity of Kac-BSA+CobQ is zero, completely nothing. Typically, a portion of the acetylated peptide remains after the deacetylation reaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your observation. When we report an intensity of zero, it does not imply a complete absence of signal; rather, it indicates that the signal for the target peptide is below the detectable threshold. This is likely due to the minimum cut-off setting in the MaxQuant (MQ) software, which is determined by parameters like &quot;peptide_mass_tolerance&quot; (as discussed in MQ user groups online, though it may not be explicitly listed in the parameters file).</p><p>In our study, we performed a deacetylase assay that demonstrated CobQ's rapid activity; for instance, it can deacetylate ICD-K388ac within just four minutes. This leads me to hypothesize that the CobQ + Kac-BSA sample may have undergone near-complete enzymatic hydrolysis during the reaction.</p><p>Furthermore, Table S1 in manuscript presents only a selection of the mass spectrometry results to illustrate CobQ's activity. In addition to the 15 acetylated peptides shown, there are many more (27 peptides) that exhibit significantly reduced acetylation levels without reaching zero intensity. The overall acetylation level of BSA peptides incubated with CobQ is calculated to be only 0.13 times that of Kac-BSA (Diagnostic peak: yes, peptide score: &gt;100, Localization probability: &gt;0.95) (Author response image 9).</p><p>Based on these findings, we believe our mass spectrometry results are reliable and effectively support our conclusions.

In the <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> ATCC 7966 dataset, there are indeed two distinct proteins referred to as ArcA: ArcA-1, which functions as an aerobic respiration control protein, and ArcA-2, which acts as an arginine deiminase. Importantly, these two proteins do not share any sequence homology; they are only similarly named due to their acronyms. While we believe this distinction does not require extensive explanation in the current study, we appreciate your input. Additionally, in response to Reviewer 2’s feedback, we have decided to remove the Western blot result for ArcA-2 due to its poor quality in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 409-416.

However, the data did not convince me that K388 is acetylated. In the figure, two b-ion peaks are detected, 285.1557 and 386.2034, which may correspond to NK (theoretical mass, 260.15) and NKT (theoretical mass, 361.20) peptides, respectively. If K388 is acetylated, an increase in the mass of 42 should be observed, but the difference between the detected and theoretical mass is 25.
