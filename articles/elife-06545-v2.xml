This arrangement is the result of coordinated cell movements, cell shape changes, and the organisation of pigment cells during metamorphosis. Iridophores play a crucial part in this process by switching between the dense form of the light stripes and the loose form of the dark stripes. Adult <italic>schachbrett</italic> (<italic>sbr</italic>) mutants exhibit delayed changes in iridophore shape and organisation caused by truncations in Tight Junction Protein 1a (ZO-1a). In <italic>sbr</italic> mutants, the dark stripes are interrupted by dense iridophores invading as coherent sheets. Immuno-labelling and chimeric analyses indicate that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores but down-regulated in the loose form. Tjp1a is a novel regulator of cell shape changes during colour pattern formation and the first cytoplasmic protein implicated in this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06545.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06545.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06545.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The striking horizontal striped pattern of the zebrafish makes it a decorative addition to many home aquariums. The stripes are a result of three different pigment cells interacting with each other, and first begin to emerge when the animal is two to three weeks old. At that time, iridescent cells called iridophores begin to multiply and spread in the skin. In the light-coloured stripes, the iridophores are compact and ‘dense’; in the dark stripes the cells change into a ‘loose’ shape and organisation. Black-pigmented cells fill in the dark stripes, and a third cell type with a yellow hue condenses over the light stripes. How the three types of cell work together to make the striped pattern is not fully understood.</p><p>Fadeev et al. examined a zebrafish variant with a genetic mutation that disrupts the function of a protein called Tight Junction Protein 1a (or Tjp1a)—a fish variant of a mammalian protein called ZO-1. This protein helps cells to interact with each other. The mutant fish appear spotted rather than striped, because light regions containing sheets of the dense iridophores interrupt the dark stripes.</p><p>Experiments using fluorescent markers showed that Tjp1a is produced in much lower amounts in the loose iridophores in the dark stripes than in the dense iridophores of the light stripes. This led Fadeev et al. to suggest that the transition from the dense to the loose shape is dependent on the presence of Tjp1a in the cell.</p><p>Tjp1a is likely to regulate how colour patterns form by controlling how iridophores interact with other types of pigment cell. The Tjp1a mutant fish provides the first glimpse into the machinery inside cells that underlies colour pattern formation, and will help to identify other components and cues responsible for cell interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06545.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06545.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>iridophores</kwd><kwd>colour pattern formation</kwd><kwd>Tight Junction Protein</kwd><kwd>ZO-1</kwd><kwd>chromatophores</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nüsslein-Volhard</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission (EC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZF-HEALTH grant (Project number 242048)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nüsslein-Volhard</surname><given-names>Christiane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The changes in shape of iridophores that underlie adult colour pattern formation in zebrafish depend on the levels of Tight Junction Protein 1a in these cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most fascinating features of vertebrates is their display of remarkable colour patterns in skin, fur, or plumage, frequently varying strikingly between closely related species. Teleost fish exhibit a particularly high diversity of patterns formed by several types of pigment cells distributed in a multilayered arrangement in the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singh and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2015</xref>). Adult zebrafish display a conspicuous pattern of alternating dark and light stripes; remarkably different from a relatively simple larval pattern, which is generated directly from neural crest cells migrating during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelsh et al., 1996</xref>). The adult pattern is formed from neural crest-derived progenitors during metamorphosis (3–6 weeks of development). Metamorphic iridophores (silvery cells containing reflective guanine platelets) and melanophores (dark cells containing the black pigment melanin) arise from neural crest-derived stem cells associated with the peripheral nervous system, whereas metamorphic xanthophores (yellow–orange cells containing pteridine based pigments) originate from proliferating larval xanthophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dooley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahalwar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). Several adult viable zebrafish mutants displaying abnormal adult pigment patterns have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kelsh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lister et al., 1999</xref>). One class of genes primarily affects the formation of one of the three cell types. For example <italic>nacre/mitfa</italic> mutants lack melanophores, <italic>pfeffer/csf1ra/fms</italic> mutants lack xanthophores, and in <italic>shady/ltk</italic> iridophores are compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lister et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parichy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2008</xref>). Genetic analyses and regeneration studies revealed that interactions between all three cell types are necessary for proper stripe formation in the trunk of the fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maderspacher and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamasu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frohnhöfer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Long-term in vivo imaging has shown that stripe formation involves intricate cell shape and density changes of metamorphic pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahalwar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). Iridophores take a lead in stripe formation: they appear along the horizontal myoseptum, proliferate and spread as a dense sheet in the skin to form the first light stripe. At the margins of this first light stripe, the dense iridophores undergo a transition into a loose form and spread over the dark stripe region. Past the presumptive dark stripe, they change into the dense form again and aggregate into sheets forming new light stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). The first two dark stripes form dorsally and ventrally of the first light stripe by melanoblasts migrating along spinal nerves into the skin in the presumptive dark stripe region. They initially appear as stellate cells with the pigment located in the centre of the cells but later expand into the stationary rounded form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dooley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). Metamorphic xanthophores originate from larval xanthophores, they compact over the dense iridophores of the light stripe and change into a pale stellate shape above the loose iridophores and melanophores of the dark stripe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mahalwar et al., 2014</xref>). A different type of iridophores—L-iridophores—underlie the melanophores of the dark stripe. L-iridophores appear only after the first two dark stripes are formed and do not participate in laying out the pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frohnhöfer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirata et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2005</xref>). Interestingly, iridophore-deficient mutants are not affected in the stripe pattern of the fins, suggesting differences in the mechanisms involved in patterning of the trunk and fins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frohnhöfer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mutants in which all three chromatophore types develop, but stripe formation is impaired, are of particular interest, as they can provide insights in the molecular mechanisms of cell–cell interactions underlying stripe formation. Several mutants have been described in which dark stripes are broken into spots. <italic>leopard/Cx 41.9</italic>, <italic>luchs/Cx39.4</italic> encode components of gap junctions involved in cell–cell communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maderspacher and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irion et al., 2014</xref>). In the absence of <italic>leo</italic> or <italic>luc</italic>, iridophores fail to change to the loose form and suppress melanophores. <italic>leo</italic> and <italic>luc</italic> presumably form heteromeric gap junctions among and between melanophores and xanthophores, instructing iridophores to change shape in a spatially controlled manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irion et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we present the mutant <italic>schachbrett</italic> (<italic>sbr</italic>) (German for checkerboard) that exhibits interruptions in dark stripes by light stripe regions. <italic>sbr</italic> encodes Tight Junction Protein 1a (Tjp1a/ZO-1). Immunostaining revealed that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores but neither in loose iridophores nor any other pigment cell type. Analysis of double mutants and chimeras shows that <italic>sbr</italic> is cell-autonomously required in iridophores. During metamorphosis, dense iridophores invade the dark stripe regions and temporarily suppress the expansion of melanophores, suggesting that Tjp1a is required to regulate the transition of dense iridophores into the loose shape and their organisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>schachbrett</italic> encodes Tight Junction Protein 1a</title><p>Adult <italic>sbr</italic> fish display an unchanged arrangement and approximately normal width of stripes, however, the dark stripes are interrupted and undulating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The allele <italic>sbr</italic><sup><italic>tnh009b</italic></sup> was isolated during a screen for ENU-induced recessive, homozygous viable mutants affecting adult pattern formation. The mutation was mapped to the region 29.6–32.5 Mb of chromosome 7 (Ensembl Zebrafish release 72) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using a candidate approach, we sequenced <italic>tjp1a</italic> cDNA of <italic>sbr</italic><sup><italic>tnh009b</italic></sup> and detected a nonsense mutation leading to Y1143Stop change in the C-terminal part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm the suggestion that this mutation is causative for the <italic>sbr</italic> phenotype, we performed a screen for additional alleles. ENU-mutagenized Tü males were crossed to <italic>sbr</italic><sup><italic>tnh009b</italic></sup> females; the progeny was raised to the adulthood and screened for the <italic>sbr</italic> phenotype. Four new alleles not complementing the original allele were isolated. We identified novel stop codons in positions of the <italic>tjp1a</italic> gene corresponding to the N-terminal part of the protein in all four new alleles. The phenotype is variable, and no qualitative differences between the alleles could be recognized. Individual fish of the <italic>sbr</italic><sup><italic>tnh009b</italic></sup> allele with the C-terminal truncation may show a weaker phenotype not seen in the other alleles, therefore, we cannot exclude that it may have residual function. In subsequent crosses, we never observed a segregation of the <italic>sbr</italic> phenotype and the <italic>tjp1a</italic> mutant alleles.

Repeated photography of individual fish revealed that mutants can be distinguished from wild-type siblings at stage 7.5 mm SL (Standard Length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parichy et al., 2009</xref>]) (about 4 weeks post fertilisation) shortly after the first metamorphic melanophores appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At this and following stages, melanophores in the mutants appear as small dots when compared to melanophores of wild type, giving the metamorphic fish a pale appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, 9.0–10.2 mm). Later (11 mm SL), the melanophores acquire a shape similar to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, 11.6 mm). The melanophore numbers in mutant and wild-type fish do not differ significantly until 10 mm SL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), when the pale phenotype is already established.

To allow a more detailed visualisation of the cell shapes, we imaged fish carrying the <italic>Tg(TDL358:GFP)</italic> transgene (labelling iridophores and glia with cytosolic GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levesque et al., 2013</xref>]) alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or together with a second transgene, <italic>Tg(sox10:mRFP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which labels neural crest derivatives with membrane-bound mRFP.

In wild type, iridophores proceeded to define the edge of the light stripe, there they delaminated and formed loose iridophores, which spread dorsally and ventrally over the dark stripe regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 8.9 mm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2014</xref>).

In <italic>sbr</italic> mutants, dense iridophores of the light stripe spread during metamorphosis as a coherent sheet invading dark stripes rather than loosening up and dispersing. Melanophore expansion into the stationary rounded form is temporarily suppressed. However, clustered melanophores later expand and seem to repulse iridophores in a process, which is similar to the one involved in smoothening of stripe boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frohnhöfer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). The location of the interruptions seems to be random. Genetic mosaics, double mutant analysis, as well as immunostaining indicate that Tjp1a is expressed and required in dense iridophores but not in melanophores or xanthophores. We show that, surprisingly, Tjp1a-deficient iridophores do display a dense shape and organisation, however, intriguingly, they fail to undergo the transition to the loose shape. This suggests that the cell shape of loose iridophores is not determined by the absence of Tjp1a per se. In contrast, a reduction in the levels of Tjp1a may be read by iridophores as a trigger for the transition or the cell shape change might result in a down-regulation of Tjp1a. In the absence of Tjp1a, other Tjps might take over the role in cell compaction but may not be able to properly respond to cues guiding the transition to the loose shape.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gene duplication and redundancy of Tjps functions in zebrafish</title><p>One surprising finding of this study is that Tjp1a-deficient zebrafish are viable unlike embryonic lethal Tjp1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katsuno et al., 2008</xref>). There are three <italic>tjp</italic> genes (1–3) in mammals and five in zebrafish (1a–b, 2a–b, 3), due to the whole genome duplication in teleosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amores et al., 1998</xref>). The lack of Tjp1a function in epithelial cells in <italic>sbr</italic> mutants might be compensated for by other Tjps, for example, Tjp1b, which does not exist in mammals.

This suggests that Tjp1b and Tjp1a have redundant functions at least in the vasculature epithelial cells. This notion is supported by experiments with mammalian cell cultures showing that absence of ZO-1 leads to increased recruitment of ZO-2 to cell membranes, which is suggested to compensate for the absence of ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Umeda et al., 2004</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06545-media1-v2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06545.020</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>50 hpf wild type embryo.</title><p>Note normal blood flow.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06545.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06545.020</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-06545-media2-v2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06545.021</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>50 hpf wild type embryo injected with morpholino against Tjp1b.</title><p>Note normal blood flow (N = 53/53).

In wild type, dense iridophores normally stay restricted to developing light stripes, but occasionally spread into the prospective dark stripe areas. This irregularity is usually corrected and sharp stripe boundaries are formed. However, in <italic>sbr</italic>, the invasion of dense iridophores occurs along the whole length of stripes. Not all dense iridophores persist in dark stripe regions in <italic>sbr</italic> mutants. In summary, we hypothesize that the loss of Tjp1a impairs the ability of iridophores to recognise the (as yet unknown) cues defining the dark stripe areas or their ability to react to them efficiently. So far, only a rather small number of molecules have been identified, which are involved in the various interactions between chromatophores. Tjp1a is the first for which a molecular distribution and cell type specific expression has been shown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tjp1a might interact with connexins/gap junctions</title><p>Several zebrafish mutants including <italic>leopard</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haffter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>luchs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irion et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>seurat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eom et al., 2012</xref>) exhibit a spotted pattern formed by ingressions of iridophores into the dark stripe area. <italic>luc</italic> and <italic>leo</italic> encode Connexin41.8 (Cx41.8) and Connexin39.4 (Cx39.4), respectively, which are, in contrast to <italic>sbr</italic>, required in melanophores and xanthophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maderspacher and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irion et al., 2014</xref>). Irion et al. suggest that Cx39.4 and Cx41.8 form heteromeric gap junctions, promoting interactions of melanophores and xanthophores that result in the appropriate patterning of iridophores. In the absence of xanthophores or melanophores, dense iridophore regions are expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frohnhöfer et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that Tjp1a in iridophores may be involved in cell communication with xanthophores and/or melanophores. However, the downstream cytoplasmic partners of the transmembrane proteins shown to be involved in patterning in melanophores and xanthophores are unknown as well as transmembrane molecules in iridophores that are responsible for the interactions. Another mutant displaying a spotted pattern is <italic>seurat</italic>, encoding the transmembrane protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 11 (Igsf11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eom et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, Cx41.8 and Igsf11 are possible interacting partners of Tjps since they have putative PDZ-binding motifs on their extreme C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hung and Sheng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suzu et al., 2002</xref>). The multiple protein–protein interacting domains in Tjps allow for many interacting partners and facilitate formation of large complexes in proximity of cell membranes that are associated with tight, adherens, and gap junctions. These provide a link between transmembrane proteins and the cytoskeleton and were shown to participate in regulation of many cellular processes such as junction assembly, cell proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balda and Matter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">González-Mariscal et al., 2014</xref>). Our results show that <italic>sbr</italic> enhances the phenotypes of both <italic>luc</italic> and <italic>leo</italic> mutants. This suggests that Tjp1a and connexins do not act in a linear pathway to regulate pattern formation, but most likely work through different mechanisms. One possible explanation is that Tjp1a is required for spatially and temporally controlled reaction of iridophores in response to melanophores (directly or through xanthophores). Absence or truncation of Tjp1a results in a delayed switch to the loose form, which in turn forces melanophores to reorganize according to the presence of dense iridophores in normally iridophore-free regions. In <italic>luchs</italic> and <italic>leopard</italic>, the melanophore and xanthophore autonomous mutations also affect patterning of iridophores, likely due to the failure to properly guide iridophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irion et al., 2014</xref>). The combined effect of failure of melanophores and xanthophores to provide cues to iridophores, and the delayed reaction of iridophores might be responsible for the enhanced phenotypes in the double mutants.</p><p>Interestingly, Tjp1a and Cx39.4 and Cx41.8 can interact in a yeast 2-hybrid assay<italic>. As in the fish they are required in different pigment cell types,</italic> this may point to the existence of other, as yet unknown, connexins, similar to the Cx41.8 and Cx39.4, that are expressed in iridophores and interact with Tjp1a. ZO-1 was shown to regulate gap junction assembly, localization, and regulate plaque size in mammalian cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhett et al., 2011</xref>). Defective Tjp1a in <italic>sbr</italic> might affect proper interaction of iridophore connexins with their counterparts in melanophores and xanthophores, compromising cell–cell communication and recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Tjp1a as a regulator of cell shape</title><p>Iridophore-specific connexins or other molecules, responsible for communication between pigment cells, might also transmit signals via Tjp1a, controlling iridophore migration or shape change in a spatiotemporally appropriate manner. Immunostainings show that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores, but not in loose iridophores. Intriguingly, the absence of Tjp1a does not obviously affect the morphology of dense iridophores, which display normal shape and organisation. In vitro studies of the past decade have demonstrated a function of ZO-1 in organisation of confluent cell layers. Counterintuitively, ZO-1 −/− Eph4 cells polarize and form tight junctions morphologically indistinguishable from those of ZO-1 +/+ cells, but the formation is delayed. These cells do not exhibit abnormal growth or motility in scratch assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Umeda et al., 2004</xref>). However, knockdown of endogenous ZO-1 in COS-7 cells hampers delamination and migration of cells to fill the wound area in scratch assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huo et al., 2011</xref>). These data suggest that epithelial cells of different origin may react differently to the absence of ZO-1. Our Tjp1aN antibody shows that the non-functional truncated protein is at least partially retained and normally localized in <italic>sbr</italic><sup><italic>tnh009n</italic></sup> mutants, suggesting that the missing domains (ZU-5 and possibly parts of afadin- and actin-binding regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2010</xref>]) are crucial for the function of Tjp1a in iridophores. It was shown that absence of the ZU5 domain of ZO-1causes defective delamination and migration of COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huo et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, mis-expression of truncated ZO-1 in the presence of the wild-type protein in CE culture leads to the expression of mesenchymal markers and to an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryeom et al., 2000</xref>). Taken together with our findings, these data suggest a role of ZO-1 in regulating and fine-tuning of cell shape and state.</p><p>We show that transitions in cell shape and organisation are crucial for the arrangement of pigment cells in stripes and identify Tjp1a as a regulator of this process. It appears that the presence of Tjp1a allows iridophores to change into the loose form at the appropriate positions. This suggests that Tjp1a is required for interaction of iridophores with other pigment cells (for example through controlling assembly of gap junctions) and/or appropriate reaction of iridophores to perceived cues (through control of delamination and cell shape). The spatial and temporal regulation of iridophore shape transitions by Tjp1a might underlie the generation of a variety of patterns observed in teleosts. Moreover, the viability of <italic>sbr</italic> mutants presents exciting opportunities for studying the behaviour of Tjp1 deficient cells in vivo<italic>.</italic></p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish maintenance</title><p>Fish were bred and maintained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nüsslein-Volhard and Dahm, 2002</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors study the functions of the tight junction protein, Tjp1a, in pigment cell development in zebrafish. Multiple mutant alleles of Tjp1a clearly demonstrate an essential function in metamorphic stripe formation. Loss of Tjp1a leads to ectopic spreading of dense iridophores and interruptions in melanophore stripes. Both expression of Tjp1a in iridophores and the ability of wild-type iridophores to restore stripe formation in Tjp1a mutants indicate a function in iridophores for interactions with other pigment cell types. Identification of a novel role for a tight junction protein in pigment cell development is interesting and suggests similar roles in cell-cell communication in other contexts. However, the paper requires further discussion and experiments to make the results more mechanistic and less descriptive. In particular, it is critical to add experiments to show an interaction between Tjp1a and the connexins.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Several previously published mutants (<italic>luc</italic>, <italic>leo</italic>) with similar pigment stripe defects disrupt connexins associated with gap junctions in pigment cells (though not specifically in iridophores), and in the Discussion the authors speculate that these may interact with Tjp1a. However, there are no experiments in the paper to address this hypothesis, such as tests of genetic interactions in <italic>sbr</italic>;<italic>luc</italic> and <italic>sbr</italic>;<italic>leo</italic> double mutants, evidence for physical interactions between proteins, or assays for functional gap junctions. Any evidence for (or against) the idea that loss of Tjp1a function disrupts gap junctions would greatly increase the paper's impact. The authors briefly mention that a reduction in Tjp1a may trigger iridophores to undergo the transition from dense to loose and more migratory behaviors. Would gap junctional communication likely influence this transition and if not what alternative types of cell-cell interactions might be involved?</p><p>2) Much of the data is shown at low magnification and lacks cellular resolution: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> melanophores appear smaller in Tjp1a mutants, which could account for altered behaviors of iridophores.

Would gap junctional communication likely influence this transition and if not what alternative types of cell-cell interactions might be involved?</italic></p><p>Tjp1a, which is known to interact with connexins in a specific fashion, is participating in the regulation of pattern formation as well. We included in the manuscript data from a yeast 2-hybrid experiment, which suggests that Tjp1a can interact with connexins39.4 and 41.8. However, both <italic>luc</italic> and <italic>leo</italic> connexins function in melanophores and xanthophores, but not in iridophores; this suggests that a direct interaction is unlikely, since Tjp1a is a cytoplasmic protein in iridophores. Hence we propose the existence of iridophore-specific membrane proteins, interacting with <italic>luc</italic> and <italic>leo</italic> connexins. This interaction would require Tjp1a in order to transmit a signal necessary for iridophore positioning and specification. As suggested, we included in the article data on double mutants. In both cases the phenotypes of double mutants are stronger than the ones of single mutants, suggesting that these genes are not forming a linear pathway in order to control pigmentation.</p><p>It was shown that many patterning mutants affect the capability of cells for homo- or heterotypic interactions and as a result their ability to aggregate (Inaba et al, Science, 2012; Maderspacher and Nüsslein-Volhard, Development, 2003; Eom et al, PLOS Genetics, 2013). Most of these studies investigated aggregation and dispersion behaviour of pigment cells. The mechanisms by which pigment cells mutually influence specification, differentiation and migration only recently became a focus of attention (Irion, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2014). Depolarization was suggested as a possible mechanism for interactions involving gap junctions (Inaba et al, Science, 2012). However, Tjp1a might also be involved in other as yet unknown mechanisms of cellular interactions.</p><p><italic>2) Much of the data is shown at low magnification and lacks cellular resolution: In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> <italic>melanophores appear smaller in Tjp1a mutants, which could account for altered behaviors of iridophores.

Mutant melanophores also appear smaller in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref><italic>.</italic></p><p>Thank you for pointing to us a possible misunderstanding. With the data presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> we argue that melanin is concentrated in the centre of <italic>sbr</italic> melanophores, which appear as dots. This is due to the prolonged retention of their stellate, migratory shape, which can be seen in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. However such a statement is indeed premature for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. This was corrected. The difference in shapes however, of course does not necessarily correlate with size, and we did not try to measure the sizes.</p><p><italic>Individual iridophores/xanthophores are also difficult to see in these figures</italic>.</p><p><italic>Interpretations of iridophore behaviors depend on the ability to follow individual cells, such as TDL358:GFP+ cells in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref><italic>.

If not, some apparent cell movements may instead reflect changes in transgene expression or iridophore differentiation</italic>.</p><p>The imaging shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> covers long times: about two weeks or longer (time varies from individual to individual, we use the size of the fish as a better measure of development). The figures were produced by imaging the individual fish once a day. Imaging sessions had to be very short (1-2 minutes) as the fish had to be completely paralyzed. Hence, we cannot provide more detailed images since it requires longer scanning times. We changed “time lapse” to “repeated imaging” in the text, as it was already referred to in the Materials and methods. Such imaging allows in some cases to follow individual melanophores, but due to the homogeneous appearance of iridophores, tracking of them is not possible. Naturally, we do not state that abnormal cell movement is the only possible cause of the iridophores invasion into dark stripe areas. Indeed, aberrant iridophore specification, namely compromised change from dense to loose form, is a more likely reason for that. We added more in-depth discussion on this subject to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>The supposed lack of immunostaining for Tjp1a in loose iridophores in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> <italic>is unclear and difficult to distinguish from protein localized in surrounding epithelial cells</italic>.</p><p>The image was changed to a more appropriate one.</p><p><italic>3) The information about the ultimate mechanism is a bit speculative.
