haploid and diploid life forms is a defining feature of most plant and algal life cycles, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern these transitions remain unclear. Here, we explore the dynamic relationship between chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications during life form transitions in Arabidopsis. The diploid-to-haploid life form transition is governed by the loss of H3K9me2 and DNA demethylation of transposon-associated <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. This event is associated with dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional reprogramming. In contrast, the global loss of H3K27me3 in the haploid form shapes a chromatin accessibility landscape that is poised to re-initiate the transition back to diploid life after fertilisation. Hence, distinct epigenetic reprogramming events rewire transcription through major reorganisation of the regulatory epigenome to guide the alternation of generations in flowering plants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each pollen grain from a flowering plant houses sperm, which contain half of the genes needed to make a new plant, and a companion or vegetative cell (VC) that serves to deliver sperm to the egg. The genes in the vegetative cell and those in the sperm are identical to the genes of the plant they come from, so how can this set of identical genetic information produce such different cells?</p><p>Both DNA and histones, the proteins that pack and order DNA, can be chemically modified locally through a process called methylation. The location of these modifications can affect how genetic information in the DNA is read to make different types of cells. The use of processes like methylation to regulate whether genes are switched on or off is called epigenetics. So what role does epigenetics play in plant pollen?</p><p>To answer this question, Borg et al. examined the epigenetics of pollen in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a widely studied plant and common weed. In vegetative cells, DNA methylation is lost together with a different methylation mark (H3K9me2), which unlocks several genes needed for pollen to transport sperm. By contrast, sperm loses an entirely different methylation mark, called H3K27me3, which unlocks a different set of genes that help to prepare development of a new plant once sperm fertilizes the egg. Through these different set of epigenetic changes, activity increases at different groups of genes that are important for shaping the function of each pollen cell type.</p><p>These results reveal how the loss of DNA and histone methylation are important for plants to reproduce sexually via pollen. This offers insights into the evolution of plants and other related life forms. Learning about plant reproduction may also help to increase food production by improving crop yields.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>life cycle</kwd><kwd>alternation of generations</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>pollen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P26887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I 4258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I2163-B16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M1818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borg</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC 637888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nodine</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I011269/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Twell</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N005090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Twell</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Epigenetic reprogramming of the distinct repressive marks H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 guides the transition between the haploid and diploid life forms that encompass the life cycle of land plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epigenetic reprogramming refers to the global erasure and remodelling of epigenetic marks during development. DNA and histone methylation are reprogrammed during germline differentiation and after fertilisation to reconfigure transcription in the mammalian embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hajkova, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reik et al., 2001</xref>). In plants and algae, meiosis marks the transition from the diploid sporophyte to haploid gamete-producing gametophytes, while the union of gametes at fertilisation re-initiates the transition back to the diploid phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hackenberg and Twell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haig, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hisanaga et al., 2019</xref>). The marked differences in development, morphology, and gene expression between the gametophyte and sporophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Couceiro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dickinson and Grant-Downton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heesch et al., 2019</xref>) suggest that epigenetic patterns are reprogrammed between these two life forms. Nevertheless, the nature of epigenetic reprogramming and its influence on transcriptional activity during the alternation of generations remain poorly understood.</p><p>Ancestral land plants represented by extant bryophytes typically have a dominant haploid gametophytic phase and require Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) activity to repress precocious sporophyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Okano et al., 2009</xref>). DNA methylation also undergoes extensive reprogramming between the haploid and diploid phase in bryophytes, although it remains unclear whether this is required for the transitions between the two life forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ikeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schmid et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yaari et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, flowering plants have a dominant diploid sporophytic phase that culminates with the production of meiotic spores from somatic tissue within the flower. Haploid spores develop into multicellular male or female gametophytes depending on whether they originate in the anther or ovary, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dickinson and Grant-Downton, 2009</xref>). The female gametophyte in flowering plants is comprised of an embryo sac containing the egg and accessory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Erbasol Serbes et al., 2019</xref>). Pollen represents the male gametophyte. It develops from asymmetric division of the haploid microspore, which produces a germ cell that becomes engulfed in the cytoplasm of its sister vegetative cell (VC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borg et al., 2009</xref>). The germ cell represents the male germline initial cell and undergoes a distinct developmental programme to divide and differentiate into two sperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borg et al., 2009</xref>). Sperm differentiation is intricately linked with epigenetic reprogramming of sperm chromatin in Arabidopsis. Targeted removal of repressive H3K27me3 marks from histone-based sperm chromatin facilitates the transcription of genes required for sperm differentiation, which are normally silenced by H3K27me3 during sporophytic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borg et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chromatin accessibility is extensively reprogrammed in pollen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Arabidopsis pollen development.

VC differentiation involves acquiring the competency to grow a pollen tube for the delivery of sperm to the embryo sac, where fertilisation of the egg cell re-initiates diploid sporophyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamamura et al., 2012</xref>). Asymmetric microspore division is essential for pollen patterning since chemically induced symmetry results in two daughter cells with VC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eady et al., 1995</xref>), suggesting that VC specification is the default developmental fate in the male gametophyte. VC nuclear (VN) chromatin organisation is highly diffuse compared to sperm nuclei (SN) and somatic cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borg and Berger, 2015</xref>). This is caused by the decondensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin, which involves the depletion of linker histone H1 and H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mérai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schoft et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slotkin et al., 2009</xref>). Heterochromatin decondensation licenses the active demethylation of pericentromeric DNA sequences by the gametophyte-specific DNA glycosylase DEMETER (DME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreuzza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schoft et al., 2011</xref>), which stimulates transcription of transposable elements (TEs) and epigenetically activated small RNA (easiRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Creasey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slotkin et al., 2009</xref>). Despite the large-scale nature of these epigenetic reconfigurations, it remains unclear if and how these might relate to differentiation of the VC, which ultimately embodies the paternal sporophyte-to-gametophyte transition in flowering plants.</p><p>Here, we assess chromatin and transcriptional reprogramming during the sporophyte-to-gametophyte transition in developing Arabidopsis pollen. We reveal widespread reprogramming of accessible chromatin across this transition and map hundreds of loci that gain accessibility in each pollen cell type. We demonstrate how the rewiring of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity is intricately linked with the differential reprogramming of repressive epigenetic marks after microspore division. In the VC, accessible chromatin is shaped by the loss of constitutive heterochromatin and active cytosine demethylation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions that are predicted to be bound by pollen-expressed transcription factors (TFs) involved in VC differentiation. In contrast, chromatin accessibility in sperm is shaped by the loss of H3K27me3, resulting in a chromatin state that forecasts the re-initiation of sporophyte development in the next generation. Our findings thus reveal how epigenetic reprogramming orchestrates the rewiring of transcription during haploid–diploid life form transitions in flowering plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pollen cell types have highly distinct transcriptional output</title><p>As sperm cells are embedded within the VC cytoplasm, existing Arabidopsis whole pollen transcriptomes represent a composite profile derived from both cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Honys and Twell, 2004</xref>). To circumvent this issue, we generated an RNA-seq profile from highly pure fractions of the VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and compared this with the transcriptome of isolated sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borges et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with most pollen RNA deriving from the VC, the VN transcriptome strongly correlated with that of whole pollen but was poorly correlated with that of sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). This supported the VN transcriptome as a suitable proxy for VC-specific gene expression, as shown for nuclear transcriptomes from other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deal and Henikoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Slane et al., 2015</xref>). A principal component analysis illustrates how the transcriptomes of two cells constituting mature pollen are highly distinct from each other and from transcriptomes of sporophytic cell types and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Gene expression in haploid microspores was more related to diploid tissues of the sporophyte than to the two differentiated pollen cell types. This indicates that major transcriptional reprogramming establishes distinct regulatory controls after unequal division of the microspore to specify the sperm and the VC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mapping accessible chromatin during pollen development</title><p>To assess chromatin reprogramming in the male gametophyte, we profiled chromatin accessibility in the distinct cell types of the developing Arabidopsis pollen lineage using Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We isolated highly pure fractions of SN and VN using a combination of cell-type specific markers and fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), while microspores were isolated based on their size and auto-fluorescent properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borges et al., 2012</xref>). To isolate germ cell nuclei (GN), we developed a tailored marker line that is active solely in the germ cell and performed FANS with nuclei isolated from developing spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>). For each cell type, we generated at least two ATAC-seq biological replicates and validated our profiles in several ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). First, biological replicates for each stage were highly correlated, while modest cross-correlation between tissues indicated distinct chromatin landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Second, ATAC-seq peaks were highly enriched at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Third, highly transcribed genes showed higher accessibility around transcription start sites (TSSs) than genes with low expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Fourth, ATAC-seq profiles in SN and VN had characteristic periodicity arising from polynucleosome fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Although no periodicity was evident in profiles from microspore nuclei (MN) and GN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), we observed substantial overlap with profiles from other cell types as well as strong correlation of chromatin accessibility with active genes in the microspore and sperm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Our ATAC-seq profiles thus map distinct chromatin accessibility landscapes that span the inception and development of the male gametophyte.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromatin accessibility is extensively reprogrammed in pollen</title><p>We first examined differences in chromatin accessibility between the microspore, sperm, and vegetative cell. We identified a total of 20,634 ATAC-seq peaks covering over 15 Mb of the Arabidopsis genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We defined peak regions recovered by ATAC-seq as accessible chromatin regions (ACRs). Chromatin accessibility in microspores, differentiated pollen cell types, and seedlings strongly overlapped (15,982 peaks, 77.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). These common peaks were associated with genes involved in core housekeeping functions that maintain expression across the entire life cycle, such as mRNA metabolism, protein transport, cell cycle control, and osmotic stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). A set of sporophyte-specific ACRs (6.7%; 1375 peaks) remained accessible between seedlings and MN, had reduced accessibility in the GN, but later lost accessibility in the SN and VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These occurred at genes involved in photosynthesis and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>), which are dispensable in the short-lived haploid gametophyte since it derives resources from the host parental sporophyte. Our analysis did not reveal de novo gains in chromatin accessibility in GN compared with MN but rather a gradual loss in accessibility among sporophytic-specific ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Pairwise comparisons between the pollen cell types revealed a gradual increase in differential accessibility across pollen development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These differences were most pronounced at the mature pollen stage, with 6.8% (1400 peaks) and 9.1% (1877 peaks) cell type-specific ACRs unique to SN or VN, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Heatmaps centred on ATAC-seq peaks illustrate the cell type-specificity of SN-specific and VN-specific ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). VN-specific ACRs were strongly associated with functions unique to pollen biology such as pollination, cell tip growth, and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). In sperm, we observed high promoter accessibility at genes directly regulated by DUO POLLEN 1 (DUO1), an essential R2R3-type MYB TF that controls sperm differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brownfield et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rotman et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, the relative accessibility of promoter regions was positively correlated (<italic>R</italic> = 0.61) with differential expression of the associated genes between sperm and the VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), consistent with the distinct transcriptional state of each cell type. SN-specific and VN-specific ACRs were less prevalent at promoters but had an increased incidence within distal intergenic regions compared with common ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Transcribed genes most proximal to these intergenic ACRs were differentially expressed in a cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>), suggesting distal regulatory influence. VN-specific ACRs were also highly enriched at transcriptional termination sites (TTSs) compared to other ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In summary, ATAC-seq has revealed hundreds of unique ACRs specific to the sperm or VC, which likely encompass putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that modulate transcription and differentiation of each pollen cell type. These <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions are distributed between proximal promoters and distal regions, suggesting the involvement of long-range chromatin interactions in the regulation of pollen gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pericentromeric sequences gain chromatin accessibility in the male gametophyte</title><p>In Arabidopsis, condensed heterochromatin is organised into chromocenters and is comprised of pericentromeric sequences enriched in H3K9me2 and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng and Michaels, 2015</xref>). These repressive epigenetic marks silence TEs that accumulate within pericentromeric regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng and Michaels, 2015</xref>). Because pericentromeric heterochromatin is lost in the VN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schoft et al., 2009</xref>), we explored how this might impact the landscape of accessible chromatin. ATAC-seq peak density was reduced within pericentromeric regions compared to the arms of each of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also noted a slight but consistent increase in ATAC-seq peak density within pericentromeric regions of the VN compared to SN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with this, and unlike common or SN-specific ACRs, VN-specific ACRs were relatively enriched for H3K9me2 in somatic tissues but depleted for active H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks, with just over one-third (36.5%; 686 peaks) marked by H3K9me2 in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, almost one-third of VN-specific ACRs significantly overlapped with a TE insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>), with DNA/MuDR and LINE/L1 elements notably over-represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

DME activity is thus unlikely to stimulate a gain in chromatin accessibility alone, at least at common ACRs, but rather modulates differential DNA methylation levels within these shared open chromatin sites.

We used a set of experimentally derived DNA binding motifs generated by DAP-seq, an in vitro binding assay of the sequence specificity of TF-genomic DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>). Fifty TFs expressed in the VN were present in the DAP-seq database, of which two-thirds (36 of 50; 72.0%) had significantly enriched motifs within DME-targeted ACRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These included motifs bound by MYB101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), a pollen-specific TF that acts redundantly with MYB97 and MYB120 to regulate pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leydon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). The binding affinity of most TFs in Arabidopsis is strongly inhibited by DNA methylation, which was determined by performing the DAP-seq assay with methylated (DAP) or non-methylated (ampDAP) DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>). Of the 36 TFs predicted to bind within DME-targeted ACRs, 25 had been assessed in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>), half of which (14 of 25; 56.0%) were inhibited by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This suggests that DNA demethylation by DME facilitates the binding of several methylation-sensitive TFs within DME-targeted ACRs. Consistently, the predicted binding sites for these methylation-sensitive TFs were substantially hypo-methylated in VN from WT pollen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–J</xref>).

These observations further delimit DME-mediated demethylation to motifs targeted by TFs expressed in the VN, which include several that are unable to bind efficiently in the presence of DNA methylation. In summary, we propose that a substantial portion of genomic regions that become preferentially or specifically accessible in the VN undergo DME-mediated DNA demethylation, which likely licenses the binding of several VN-expressed TFs involved in regulating the sporophyte-to-gametophyte transition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DNA demethylation by DME regulates the expression of pollen-tube related genes</title><p>DME-targeted ACRs clustered into two groups distinguished by a relative enrichment or depletion of H3K9me2, H3K27me1, and histone H1 in sporophytic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Thus, sperm chromatin is highly derived from the gametophytic state observed in the VN, since it is distinguished by accessible chromatin that forecasts the sporophytic transition in the next generation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we assess the landscape of accessible chromatin in the developing Arabidopsis male gametophyte and reveal major chromatin reprogramming at the transition between haploid and diploid life. Importantly, we show how the reprogramming of accessible chromatin and haploid gene expression is intricately linked with the differential erasure of distinct repressive epigenetic marks – H3K27me3 and H3K9me2-associated DNA methylation. Once microspore division is complete, the programmed removal of H3K9 and DNA methylation in the VC facilitates the expression of a fraction of the genes required for somatic haploid development. In parallel, H3K27me3 removal in sperm exposes <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions at developmental genes required to initiate transition back to diploid life after fertilisation. While substantial differences in ACRs have been observed across sporophytic Arabidopsis tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>), more closely related cell types appear to show few specific open chromatin sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dorrity et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maher et al., 2018</xref>). Despite being separated by a single cell division, thousands of differential ACRs distinguish the SN and VN, which is the result of the epigenetic reprogramming that occur across the male sporophyte-to-gametophyte transition. Future cell type-specific analysis of the sporophyte and female gametophyte promises to reveal whether the extent of transcriptional rewiring in the male haploid phase is shared during other major developmental transitions in the plant life cycle.</p><p>The epigenetic reprogramming events underlying the male haploid transition likely trace back to ancient, conserved mechanisms that accompany life form transitions in early land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ikeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Okano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schmid et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yaari et al., 2015</xref>). Alternating haploid–diploid life forms in eukaryotes are likely derived from the dominant haploid phase of ancestral unicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Niklas et al., 2014</xref>). Multicellularity is proposed to have evolved in these haploid organisms first and was then followed by meiosis to mitigate spontaneous whole-genome duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lenormand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Niklas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilkins and Holliday, 2009</xref>). Such events are likely to have initiated the first haploid–diploid life cycles during eukaryotic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Niklas et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequent evolution of sexual reproduction through the innovation of gametes and fertilisation would have differentiated diploid development from that in the haploid phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Niklas et al., 2014</xref>). In light of this, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that were likely adopted to control life form transitions during eukaryotic evolution. H3K27me3 likely evolved in unicellular eukaryotes prior to the repressive feedback loop that couples DNA with H3K9 methylation in land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bewick et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that H3K27me3 reprogramming at the haploid-to-diploid transition might be a remnant of an ancestral role in the first haplo-diplo phasic life cycles. We also postulate that the DNA-H3K9 methylation feedback loop, which is normally associated with transposon silencing in flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng and Michaels, 2015</xref>), might have been co-opted to control diploid-to-haploid life form transitions during early land plant evolution. Importantly, our findings implicate H3K9 methylation in the transcriptional repression of not only transposons but also lineage specification in flowering plants, which has developmental relevance during early mouse organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nicetto et al., 2019</xref>) but likely also in the specification of the female gametophyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The vegetative cell represents the somatic cell of the male gametophyte and undergoes loss of constitutive heterochromatin, which facilitates active DNA demethylation by DME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mérai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schoft et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schoft et al., 2011</xref>). Chromatin accessibility in the VN supports the expression of TEs and easiRNAs caused by this epigenetic reconfiguration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slotkin et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings suggest that the reprogramming and demethylation of pericentromeric heterochromatin are primarily required for VC differentiation. We identify several putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements actively demethylated by DME in the VN, many of which are silenced by constitutive heterochromatin in the sporophyte and are predicted to be bound by pollen-expressed TFs strongly repelled by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Malley et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>DME</italic> is essential for pollen viability and pollen tube germination in certain Arabidopsis ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schoft et al., 2011</xref>), which is consistent with our findings that DME regulates the expression of several pollen tube-related genes. Intriguingly, the 3’ end of highly transcribed genes show prominent chromatin accessibility specifically in the VN. Physical proximity of the promoter and terminator through intragenic looping often facilitates rapid re-initiation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grzechnik et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, these regions might be occupied by insulating proteins that prevent transcriptional read-through into neighbouring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">West et al., 2002</xref>). Either mechanism would contribute to the high levels of transcription that are likely required to fuel rapid pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>DME-dependent demethylation preferentially targets short AT-rich TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that gametophytic development is at least partly specified through de-repression of TE-associated <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences. Rewiring of gene expression by transposons and endogenous retroviruses is proposed to have contributed to the evolution and diversification of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Johnson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lynch et al., 2011</xref>). During early embryogenesis in mice and humans, accessible chromatin is widely shaped by fixed TE insertions that strongly associate with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Novel TE and endovirus integrations can create novel promoters or TF binding sites that alter the regulation of nearby or even distant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rebollo et al., 2012</xref>). We speculate whether TE integrations have imposed repression on the gametophytic programme during diploid life, which in turn could have facilitated the evolution of haploid–diploid life cycles in land plants. This hypothesis supports the general proposal that the fixation and selection of transposon-derived <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements marks specific periods of evolution within a lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>).

the global epigenomic and transcriptomic changes that occur during Arabidopsis pollen development and provide a first glimpse of the genomic changes associated with the diploid-to-haploid transition in plants. This paper will be of particular interest to scientists working on plant reproduction, but also to a wider audience in the context of studies of sexual reproduction.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Distinct epigenetic reprogramming events rewire transcription during life cycle transitions in Arabidopsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard Amasino as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing Editor have discussed the work with one another. Your paper is a high-quality study that addresses the important question of cell-type specific differences in gene expression using differential accessibility as a probe. However, there are some major issues that would need to be addressed for this work to be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>One is to define the changes in chromatin accessibility during pollen development by including ATAC-seq data from bicellular microspores rather than focusing on comparisons with sister somatic cells.</p><p>The second is to perform chromatin accessibility assays in cells from dme2/+ pollen because the role of DME in rendering accessible the regulatory regions of genes that regulate pollen tube growth is currently based on correlations not supported by any experimental data.</p><p>The third is that the interpretations often extend beyond what is warranted by the data.</p><p>Below we provide more details on these issues, and we hope you find the efforts of the reviewers helpful.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study is incomplete as the most critical stage in pollen development – the bicellular microspore stage (which encapsulates the initials of the two germ cell lineages), has not been included in this analysis. This is surprising considering that this stage is critical for male gamete and pollen development (as the authors also state in the manuscript), and that this experiment is technically feasible.</p><p>2) Comparing chromatin dynamics between two epidermal root cells and two pollen cells is not a valid argument to support the view that &quot;haploid development&quot; is not a result of cell differentiation. To address this point, authors should conduct a detailed analysis of all cell types at the three stages of pollen development.</p><p>3) The role of DME in poising accessible regulatory regions for the transcriptional events that regulate pollen tube growth should be validated experimentally. Authors should also perform chromatin accessibility assays in VN and SN using dme2/+ plants to confirm their hypothesis.</p><p>Similarly, the impact of DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites that overlap with DME targeted ACRs should also be experimentally tested. Some of the correlations are weak and without experimental validation, their hypotheses are largely speculative.</p><p>4) The most significant comment is the conclusion that &quot;epigenetic reprogramming&quot; is deterministic instead of differentiation. The evidence to support this claim is that thousands of differential ACRs are identified in the VN, MN or the SN, but not between root hair and non-hair datasets. This is a strawman argument, that is built upon a negative result. Although it is true that the &quot;hair&quot; and &quot;non-hair&quot; datasets do not show differences in accessibility, it is likely a reflection of the lack of purity of these cells. Two recent single cell ATAC-seq studies using Arabidopsis somatic tissues were published on bioRxiv (Dorrity et al., 2020 and Farmer et al., 2020) and both show substantial variation of cell type specific differential accessibility. Furthermore, published studies comparing maize tissues from a couple of labs have shown thousands of regions of differential accessibility. Therefore, selecting to compare root hair and non-hair to support this major claim in the study is not advised. I believe focusing on what the data do show is actually significant enough for publication, without overinterpreting the results.</p><p>5) The evidence that regions that become accessible in the VN lose H3K9me2, siRNAs and DNA methylation requires additional analysis. Currently, the data are averaged for all regions. How many VN ACRs have H3k9me2, siRNAs, DNA methylation in somatic cells? What proportion of these actually lose H3k9me2, siRNAs and/or DNA methylation. One way to show this result is to take Figure 2C and create a heatmap where all the VN ACRs are rows and the columns are data for H3K9me2, CG, CHG, CHH, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 nt siRNAs. This would allow the reader to evaluate how many actual regions are enriched for these data.</p><p>6) Figure S2A does show high reproducibility, but correlations of 1.0 should not exist. These correlations show that read coverage per window is the same. If the windows are large enough the actual peaks do not have much influence over the result. For all replicates, please report the number of ACRs identified and their overlap of ACRs between each replicate. You could also consider using IDR.</p><p>7) The y-axis for enrichment in 2C is very small indicating enrichment is not as prevalent at these loci as the authors have presented.</p><p>8) The pollen data in 2G doesn't show enrichment of siRNAs. 20 nt siRNAs are not known to have a function, yet they are accumulating to greater levels than 22-24 nt siRNAs.</p><p>9) Evaluate if the siRNAs are siRNAs and not mRNA degradation products. This can be done be showing the siRNAs from individual regions are aligning to both strands of DNA instead of being derived from a single strand. This would explain the lack of enrichment of expected siRNA sizes and the over enrichment of classes that are not known to have function (20 and 25 nt siRNAs).</p><p>10) I really like the section of TF motif enrichment in these cell type specific ACRs. Given the purity and high-quality nature of the data, the authors should consider using DNA footprint analysis, which usually plagues bulk tissue data. It might provide more specificity that using the entire ACRs.</p><p>11) What are the negative controls used to identify TF motif enrichment in ACRs?</p><p>12) Figure 5A needs to control for gene length. Long genes will show more discrete H3K4me3, whereas short genes will short more enrichment over gene bodies.</p><p>13) The idea that chromatin accessibility in sperm is poised for sporophyte development has been previously proposed by the authors (Borg et al.,2020) but the data presented in this manuscript does not provide direct evidence to support this hypothesis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised manuscript of your work entitled &quot;Distinct epigenetic reprogramming events rewire transcription during life cycle transitions in Arabidopsis&quot; that addresses most of the issues raised in the first submission. There are a few more items from the review of your revised manuscript, that we would like for you and your co-authors to consider and respond to.</p><p>It would be a more useful contribution to literature if you would provide the Venn diagrams of ACRs between the individual samples prior to merging the replicate data. Your reason for not showing this was that the Spearman correlations were so high that it was unnecessary. However, adding the data for each replicate would permit the reader to appreciate the variability in the data. The addition of the FRIP scores in Figure S3 shows quite a bit of variation between samples. Although this doesn't invalidate the major conclusions of this study, the variability should be better acknowledged. Showing overlap of ACRs from individual replicates with and between samples is one way to do so.</p><p>The addition of the heatmap to Figure 2 is much appreciated. However, it shows that the majority of ACRs do not possess H3K9me2 and/or siRNAs in leaf tissue. This result does not invalidate conclusions, but this is important to note in the main text. In particular, note how many ACRs overlap and H3K9me2 region and make it clear to the reader that only a minor number of ACRs in the VN are affected.</p><p>The conclusion that there are thousands of differential ACRs during this developmental progression as compared to somatic tissues based on published ATAC-seq data is not likely to hold up over time. Published studies are limited in their data analyses preventing accurate identification of cell-type-specific ACRs. The limits of other published studies are in contrast to your work and perhaps you do not want to appear critical of other studies, but your work would be a better contribution to the field if it was made clear that the major rewiring of cis-regulatory elements that you have observed in the haploid phase of the life cycle may very well occur in other phases of development when cell-type-specific methods and more sophisticated data analyses are applied.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61894.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The study is incomplete as the most critical stage in pollen development – the bicellular microspore stage (which encapsulates the initials of the two germ cell lineages), has not been included in this analysis.

The bicellular pollen stage encapsulates the stage after microspore division, where the germ (or generative) cell becomes engulfed in the cytoplasm of its sister vegetative cell. The germ cell is present during a very narrow and transient window during pollen development, with no specific molecular markers available. Bicellular pollen remains embedded within unopened floral buds, making this a technically very challenging developmental stage to isolate, and it is not a routine procedure as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>To address this, we generated a tailored marker line that specifically and transiently marks germ cell nuclei using a ProDUO1:MDB-NTF construct. NTF is a nuclear envelope targeted GFP marker, while MDB denotes the CYCB1;1 destruction box. The construct is driven with the DUO1 promoter, which is active solely in germ cells and sperm cells (Borg et al., 2014). MDB-NTF is susceptible to degradation by APC/C outside of the G2/M-phase (Borg et al., 2014). See Figure 1—figure supplement 1H for details. In pollen at mid-bicellular stage, the GFP signal in the germ cell nucleus shows signal similar to autofluorescence background in the pollen cell wall. In late bicellular pollen, germ cells enter late G2 phase and MDB-NTF accumulate to high levels well-above background autofluorescence. As germ cells exit mitosis, APC/C is reactivated leading to progressive turnover of the NTF marker in the resulting two sperm, which only show a cytoplasmic signal barely above autofluorescence. We devised sorting parameters that allowed to isolate germ cell nuclei from pollen at late bicellular stage (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I).</p><p>We isolated germ cell nuclei from this marker line to perform ATAC-seq profiling (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-B). Like microspores, we observed no clear nucleosome laddering (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C). Nonetheless, we observed strong overlap with other ATAC-seq libraries, suggesting it is still useable to support the major interpretations of this study. Our analysis did not reveal de novo gains in chromatin accessibility in germ cells compared with microspores but rather a gradual loss in accessibility among the class of sporophytic-specific peaks (Figure 1C and D). Incidentally, H3K27me3 in germ cell nuclei also remains comparable to levels in microspores (Borg et al., 2020) but is specifically lost in divided sperm, further supporting our observation that major reorganization of chromatin accessibility in sperm coincides with H3K27me3 reprogramming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comparing chromatin dynamics between two epidermal root cells and two pollen cells is not a valid argument to support the view that &quot;haploid development&quot; is not a result of cell differentiation. To address this point, authors should conduct a detailed analysis of all cell types at the three stages of pollen development.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a nice suggestion from the reviewers and as requested, we have performed pairwise comparisons (now described in Figure 1—figure supplement 3D) between the four stages of pollen development we profiled. Because the SN and VN represent the culmination of chromatin accessibility reprogramming in pollen, we focused on the ACRs recovered from the SN vs VN comparison together with a set of sporophyte-specific ACRs. These 20,634 ACRs represent the master peak set in our pairwise analyses.</p><p>These comparisons reveal the progressive accumulation of differential ACRs during pollen development, which remain modest in more closely related cell types (ex. MSP vs GN, GN vs SN) but reach a maximum at the latest stage of pollen development (i.e. between the SN and VN). These data are now presented in a new main figure panel (Figure 1F).</p><p>We realize that some confusion has arisen in regard to the differences we highlight between haploid and diploid development. We show that extensive chromatin accessibility changes in pollen are a result of unique and major waves of epigenetic reprogramming that only occur in the haploid gametophyte generation. Thus, 1000s of regulatory regions that are inactive and repressed in somatic tissues lose repressive marks in pollen, and in turn become active and gain chromatin accessibility. It thus stands to reason that these reprogramming events serve to establish and distinguish the haploid gametophytic program from the diploid program. Importantly, the genome-wide loss of repressive marks occurs after a single cell division, which in turn allows for extensive and rapid rewiring of transcriptional activity. Nonetheless, we agree that our discussion point might have led to the impression that &quot;haploid development is not a result of cell differentiation<italic>”</italic>. Please see the response to major comment 4 for more clarification on these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The role of DME in poising accessible regulatory regions for the transcriptional events that regulate pollen tube growth should be validated experimentally. Authors should also perform chromatin accessibility assays in VN and SN using dme2/+ plants to confirm their hypothesis. Similarly, the impact of DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites that overlap with DME targeted ACRs should also be experimentally tested. Some of the correlations are weak and without experimental validation, their hypotheses are largely speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers comment that the impact of DNA methylation at the TF binding sites should be tested experimentally. in vitro assays have already been performed in the DAP-seq dataset used in our analysis (O’Malley et al., 2016). Additional approaches would require ChIP-seq analysis of TF binding in pollen, or in vitro in gel shift assays with methylated and unmethylated DNA. We believe that such experiments extend far beyond the aims of this study, which focuses on delivering a genomic level perspective of how chromatin accessibility is reprogrammed during the alternation of generations.</p><p>To validate the DME-targeted ACRs, we performed RNA-seq profiling of <italic>dme-2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> pollen and could confirm a direct association with at least 27 of the genes mis-regulated in <italic>dme-2</italic> – this is highly significant and statistically supported (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E; <italic>p</italic> = 2.6 x 10<sup>-8</sup>) – even when working within the limitations of using <italic>dme-2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> plants. We doubt that in the context of our analysis presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4, ATAC-seq profiling of <italic>dme-2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> would be more insightful than the RNA-seq profiling we have already performed. Isolating <italic>dme</italic> mutant pollen from WT pollen produced by <italic>dme-2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> plants would also require tailored fluorescent marker lines that as-yet do not exist. Moreover, the use of SYBR-green dye to isolate the VN and SN from a mixed population (which is a common approach to separate the two cells) is not recommended for ATAC-seq analysis, since DNA intercalating dyes are known to strongly disrupt chromatin structure (please see https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027640311-Can-I-sort-nuclei-for-Single-Cell-ATAC-sequencing-or-Single-Cell-Multiome-ATAC-GEX-).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The most significant comment is the conclusion that &quot;epigenetic reprogramming&quot; is deterministic instead of differentiation. The evidence to support this claim is that thousands of differential ACRs are identified in the VN, MN or the SN, but not between root hair and non-hair datasets. This is a strawman argument, that is built upon a negative result. Although it is true that the &quot;hair&quot; and &quot;non-hair&quot; datasets do not show differences in accessibility, it is likely a reflection of the lack of purity of these cells. Two recent single cell ATAC-seq studies using Arabidopsis somatic tissues were published on bioRxiv (Dorrity et al., 2020 and Farmer et al., 2020) and both show substantial variation of cell type specific differential accessibility. Furthermore, published studies comparing maize tissues from a couple of labs have shown thousands of regions of differential accessibility. Therefore, selecting to compare root hair and non-hair to support this major claim in the study is not advised. I believe focusing on what the data do show is actually significant enough for publication, without overinterpreting the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concerns raised. As we clarified in our response to point 3, our reasoning is that epigenetic reprogramming is deterministic for the establishment of the haploid gametophyte programs, which in turn facilitates sperm and vegetative cell differentiation. These two processes are clearly inter-connected, and we do not imply that reprogramming is deterministic <italic>instead of</italic> differentiation.</p><p>Despite being separated by what is essentially a single cell division, we observe 1000s of unique ACRs between the sperm and vegetative cell. We have performed a similar comparison with sister cells of root epidermis to emphasize the scale of these changes. During the review process, we were referred to recent papers of scATAC-seq profiling of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root cells. We quote findings from Dorrity et al., 2020 below:</p><p>&quot;For each cell type, the median number of genes with tissue-specific accessibility was 20 (range 5 to 53) (Figure 1C). This small number of genes is consistent with earlier studies that show few open chromatin sites that define cell type identity in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.<sup>7, 23</sup> Although thousands of differentially accessible sites have been found across tissue types,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.204792v1.full#ref-7"><bold><sup>7</sup></bold></ext-link>accessibility differences between more closely related cell types remains largely unexplored, with the exception of root hair vs non-hair, in which very few differences were found.<sup><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.204792v1.full#ref-7"><bold>7</bold></ext-link>,<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.17.204792v1.full#ref-11"><bold>11</bold></ext-link></sup> &quot;</p><p>Thus, the findings from Dorrity et al., appear to support our reasoning since differentiation between closely-related sporophytic cell types involves less than 50 ACRs. This contrasts strongly with the 1000s of changes in the haploid generation between two closely-related cell types – which importantly are only separated by a single cell division. We have now revised this section by removing the pairwise comparison between the root epidermis cell types and toned down our conclusions on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The evidence that regions that become accessible in the VN lose H3K9me2, siRNAs and DNA methylation requires additional analysis. Currently, the data are averaged for all regions. How many VN ACRs have H3k9me2, siRNAs, DNA methylation in somatic cells? What proportion of these actually lose H3k9me2, siRNAs and/or DNA methylation. One way to show this result is to take Figure 2C and create a heatmap where all the VN ACRs are rows and the columns are data for H3K9me2, CG, CHG, CHH, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 nt siRNAs. This would allow the reader to evaluate how many actual regions are enriched for these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very thankful for this useful suggestion from the reviewers. As requested, we have added a new heatmap to Figure 2 that summarizes the levels of H3K9me2, DNA methylation and siRNAs in sporophytic leaf tissue for all VN-specific ACRs. This heatmap has now replaced the bar chart previously occupying Figure 2G. The heatmap is grouped by whether the ACRs are targeted by DME or not. The heatmap nicely illustrates how VN-specific ACRs are highly enriched for H3K9me2 and DNA methylation in the sporophyte, as well as the stimulation of pollen siRNAs from regions that are not observed in sporophytic tissue. This is consistent with our peak overlap enrichment test shown in Figure 2C. This adds further evidence that the VN-specific gain of accessible chromatin in the gametophyte generation stimulates transcription of genomic regions normally silenced in sporophytic tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure S2A does show high reproducibility, but correlations of 1.0 should not exist. These correlations show that read coverage per window is the same. If the windows are large enough the actual peaks do not have much influence over the result.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this very valid point. After some consideration, we realize that a Spearman correlation is likely more appropriate here since ATAC-seq data by definition is not normally distributed. We have thus re-analysed the correlation between our datasets alongside our newly added germ cell nucleus profiles and report a Spearman correlation matrix (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For all replicates, please report the number of ACRs identified and their overlap of ACRs between each replicate. You could also consider using IDR.</p></disp-quote><p>Because our ATAC-seq replicates showed such high genome-wide correlation (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B), we merged replicates for our differential analysis of ATAC-seq profiles. We reasoned that this would increase read complexity and improve peak detection, with which we then generated a master peak set for pairwise comparisons. This was then used in a DESeq2 comparison with the individual replicates to statistically assess chromatin accessibility within these regions – this has now been clarified with a new schematic diagram (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The y-axis for enrichment in 2C is very small indicating enrichment is not as prevalent at these loci as the authors have presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have improved the heatmap legend to present a more gradual gradient between the green and grey colors. These values represent the log<sub>2</sub> fold-change of observed overlaps for our ACR peaks groups against those expected from 10,000 permuted overlaps with random genomic regions. The positive enrichment values (in green), which are only observed for VN-specific ACRs, all range between a log<sub>2</sub> fold-change of 0.6 to 2.1 – the inverse log of which equates to 1.6x to 5.5x the frequency of overlaps expected by chance. Importantly, all of the overlap tests we performed were statistically significant, as indicated by <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 below the heatmap legend. In contrast, common and SN-specific ACRs were all significantly depleted for these features, highlighting the association of VN-specific ACRs with heterochromatic features known to be altered during pollen development. We hope that our explanation clarifies this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The pollen data in 2G doesn't show enrichment of siRNAs. 20 nt siRNAs are not known to have a function, yet they are accumulating to greater levels than 22-24 nt siRNAs.</p><p>9) Evaluate if the siRNAs are siRNAs and not mRNA degradation products. This can be done be showing the siRNAs from individual regions are aligning to both strands of DNA instead of being derived from a single strand. This would explain the lack of enrichment of expected siRNA sizes and the over enrichment of classes that are not known to have function (20 and 25 nt siRNAs).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for raising this point. We have replaced previous panel Figure 2G with a new heatmap in Figure 2C, which assesses the mean level of siRNAs over the ACRs including ±10bp upstream and downstream. As requested, we have also assessed the strand bias for 20nt, 21-22nt and 23-24nt siRNAs. As the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows, pollen siRNAs align equally to both the + and – strand, confirming that all size classes are not simply mRNA degradation products. We have not included this quality control plot as part of the revised manuscript since we are using already published and robustly analysed pollen siRNA data (Borges et al., 2018). The reviewer is correct in saying that no clear function has been assigned to 20nt siRNAs. However, the specific enrichment of 20-22nt siRNAs in pollen has already been reported, with 21-22nt siRNAs having been shown to regulate paternal genome dosage in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (Martinez et al., 2018). We have corrected our statement in the revised version to refer to 21-22nt siRNAs to avoid confusion and cited this important study.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61894-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) I really like the section of TF motif enrichment in these cell type specific ACRs. Given the purity and high-quality nature of the data, the authors should consider using DNA footprint analysis, which usually plagues bulk tissue data. It might provide more specificity that using the entire ACRs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comment about our analysis of TF motif enrichment. As suggested, we have performed DNA footprinting analysis with HINT-ATAC, which assesses TF activity through bias corrected cleavage analysis. Increased HINT-ATAC signals over TF motifs implies increased TF activity in a cell (Li et al., 2019), which was evident for several TFs enriched within DME-targeted ACRs, including the methylation-sensitive TFs (Figure 3K-N; Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This suggests active TF occupancy at the predicted binding sites that become accessible through the epigenetic reprogramming of constitutive heterochromatin in the VN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) What are the negative controls used to identify TF motif enrichment in ACRs?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission. We now mention that to perform motif enrichment, we used the complete set of pollen ACRs recovered in our study as negative control for the Analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME) tool in MEME.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 5A needs to control for gene length. Long genes will show more discrete H3K4me3, whereas short genes will short more enrichment over gene bodies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this as a highly valid point since the averaging we performed had been scaled to a consistent length over the whole gene body. The metaplots in Figure 5A have been replotted and are now averaged upstream and downstream of the transcription start site to control for gene body length. This has been simplified into two clusters – one with and without H3K4me3 (i.e primed and un-primed), with the primed cluster specifically characterized by increased promoter accessibility that is followed by H3K4me3 accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The idea that chromatin accessibility in sperm is poised for sporophyte development has been previously proposed by the authors (Borg et al.,2020) but the data presented in this manuscript does not provide direct evidence to support this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We use the term “poised” to refer to the transcriptionally-primed states that we report in sperm chromatin, which specifically targets genes expressed during the earliest phases of embryogenesis and which is corroborated with both chromatin accessibility (this study) and active H3K4me3 marks (Borg et al. 2020). We have revised our use of the term “poised” and replaced this with “primed” or “forecast” throughout the revised manuscript. How sperm chromatin state influences transcriptional events after fertilization are indeed very interesting questions. Building on these important observations with further studies would allow one to explore the direct transgenerational impacts of reprogramming and any potential paternal effects. These would be such novel findings that they necessitate further investigations in the framework of a new and in-depth study. Such studies would require highly technical isolation of very early zygotes for gene expression profiling, which is by no means a straightforward experiment and would require new collaborations. We hope that the reviewers realize and agree that addressing these points go far beyond the scope of the present study, which reports the first example of how transcription is reprogrammed during the alternation of generations, and for which we show compelling evidence that chromatin accessibility, and by extension the binding of TFs to active <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, is largely regulated through epigenetic reprogramming of H3K27me3 in sperm.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It would be a more useful contribution to literature if you would provide the Venn diagrams of ACRs between the individual samples prior to merging the replicate data. Your reason for not showing this was that the Spearman correlations were so high that it was unnecessary. However, adding the data for each replicate would permit the reader to appreciate the variability in the data. The addition of the FRIP scores in Figure S3 shows quite a bit of variation between samples. Although this doesn't invalidate the major conclusions of this study, the variability should be better acknowledged. Showing overlap of ACRs from individual replicates with and between samples is one way to do so.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now added pie charts of ACR overlaps between among the replicates for each sample. This is indeed a useful addition to help the reader identify any variability, which we acknowledge is present in our data. As clarified in our revised manuscript, we control for this by merging replicates prior to peak calling, then using the replicates later to statistically assess differential chromatin accessibility within these regions using DESeq2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The addition of the heatmap to Figure 2 is much appreciated. However, it shows that the majority of ACRs do not possess H3K9me2 and/or siRNAs in leaf tissue. This result does not invalidate conclusions, but this is important to note in the main text. In particular, note how many ACRs overlap and H3K9me2 region and make it clear to the reader that only a minor number of ACRs in the VN are affected.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now explicitly state the number of VNsp ACRs that overlap with H3K9me2 as follows: “just over one-third (36.5%; 686 peaks) are marked by leaf H3K9me2”. This proportion is not minor, but we acknowledge that selection of VC expressed genes is not only the product of removal of marks of constitutive heterochromatin in the discussion “Once microspore division is complete, the programmed removal of H3K9 and DNA methylation in the VC facilitates the expression of a fraction of the genes required for somatic haploid development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion that there are thousands of differential ACRs during this developmental progression as compared to somatic tissues based on published ATAC-seq data is not likely to hold up over time. Published studies are limited in their data analyses preventing accurate identification of cell-type-specific ACRs. The limits of other published studies are in contrast to your work and perhaps you do not want to appear critical of other studies, but your work would be a better contribution to the field if it was made clear that the major rewiring of cis-regulatory elements that you have observed in the haploid phase of the life cycle may very well occur in other phases of development when cell-type-specific methods and more sophisticated data analyses are applied.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved our small discussion points from the Results section to the beginning paragraph of the Discussion section and added the following sentence: “Future cell type-specific analysis of the sporophyte and female gametophyte promises to reveal whether the extent of transcriptional rewiring in the male haploid phase is shared during other major developmental transitions in the plant life cycle.” Still, we maintain that our data shows that transitions between life forms are the product of epigenetic mechanisms distinct in scale and identity from cell differentiation</p></body></sub-article></article>
