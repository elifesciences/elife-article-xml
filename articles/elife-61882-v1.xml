chromosome-linked disease associated with severe intellectual disabilities. Previous studies using the <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout (KO) mouse, an FXS mouse model, have attributed behavioral deficits to synaptic dysfunctions. However, how functional deficits at neural network level lead to abnormal behavioral learning remains unexplored. Here, we show that the efficacy of hippocampal engram reactivation is reduced in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice performing contextual fear memory recall. Experiencing an enriched environment (EE) prior to learning improved the engram reactivation efficacy and rescued memory recall in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. In addition, chemogenetically inhibiting EE-engaged neurons in CA1 reverses the rescue effect of EE on memory recall. Thus, our results suggest that inappropriate engram reactivation underlies cognitive deficits in FXS, and enriched environment may rescue cognitive deficits by improving network activation accuracy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fragile X syndrome</kwd><kwd>hippocampal engram</kwd><kwd>engram reactivation</kwd><kwd>enriched environment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH086403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD084215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS11566001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P50HD104458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Maternal and Child Health Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activity-dependent genetic labeling during behavioral learning shows Fragile-X syndrome model mice exhibit impaired hippocampal engram reactivation, and that enriched environment experience improves fear memory retrieval by enhancing engram reactivation efficacy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with intellectual disability and a leading genetic cause of syndromic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Santoro et al., 2012</xref>). FXS is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (<italic>FMR1</italic>) gene, which encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verkerk et al., 1991</xref>). The most common cause of FXS is the expansion of CGG trinucleotide repeats within the 5′ untranslated region of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, which triggers hypermethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region and subsequent silencing of the <italic>FMR1</italic> gene, resulting in the loss of FMRP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 1991</xref>). Other loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>FMR1</italic> coding region have also been identified in rare cases of FXS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suhl and Warren, 2015</xref>). As an RNA-binding protein, FMRP interacts with and regulates the translation of a large number of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in regulation of neuronal morphology and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ascano et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, in the absence of FMRP, dysregulated protein synthesis affects multiple neuronal pathways, generating behavioral phenotypes displayed by FXS patients, such as repetitive behavior and impaired cognitive functions and social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagni et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A FXS mouse model with constitutive deletion of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> gene (<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO) has been used extensively to study neural mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments of FXS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakker et al., 1994</xref>). Although results and conclusions from some of the behavioral tests conducted in these animals remain controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazdoba et al., 2014</xref>), the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse nonetheless recapitulates most of the behavioral characteristics displayed by FXS patients, including deficits in learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krueger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2014</xref>). Synaptic plasticity changes are often found to underly learning deficits in animal models of neurological diseases. Indeed, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit various synaptic dysfunctions associated with FMRP deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Contractor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</xref>), including excessive group 1 mGluR-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>), abnormal long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paradee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2017</xref>), and impaired homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>). Some of these findings, such as impaired homeostatic synaptic plasticity, has been validated in human neurons differentiated from FXS patient iPS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that they are translationally relevant. These results provide a strong correlation between altered synaptic function and memory deficits in FXS and predict that network activation patterns relevant to memory formation may be affected by synaptic dysfunction, thus contributing to learning deficits exhibited in behaving animals. In this study, we test this hypothesis by directly examining neural ensemble activation during learning and its reactivation during memory recall, and how accuracy of memory engram activation correlates with behavioral performance in normal and FXS mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FMRP expression in hippocampal CA1 is required for contextual memory formation</title><p>Intellectual impairment is one of the behavioral features observed in FXS patients.

CA1-specific FMRP deletion was achieved with stereotaxic injection of Cre recombinase-expressing adeno-associated viruses (AAV-Syn-Cre-GFP) into the CA1 region of <italic>Fmr1</italic> conditional knockout (cKO) mice hippocampus 2–3 weeks before fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>). AAVs expressing an inactive truncated form of Cre (mCre) were used as a control. The CA1-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice showed normal performance during and after training of conventional fear conditioning paradigm (one session of three tone-foot shock pairs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), but exhibited contextual memory deficits tested one day after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). No deficit on pain perception, working memory, locomotion, anxiety, and object recognition memory were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that normal expression of FMRP in hippocampal CA1 is required for contextual memory formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Engram reactivation is impaired in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice</title><p>The selective impairment of freezing during memory recall but not immediately after training in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice prompted us to explore whether reactivation of memory-encoding engram cell ensembles during memory recall is altered. We utilized an activity-dependent tagging virus AAV-<italic>Fos</italic>-ER<sup>T2</sup>-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup>-PEST (AAV-<italic>Fos</italic>-TRAP, a viral version of ‘targeted recombination in active populations’ [TRAP]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ye et al., 2016</xref>), which drives Cre expression under the control of the <italic>Fos</italic> promoter and in the presence of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Injection of the AAV-<italic>Fos</italic>-TRAP in the tdTomato reporter mice Ai9 enables labeling of populations of neurons activated by a particular experience within a defined time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This genetic labeling method is highly specific and sensitive. Mice received vehicle injection showed minimal labeling, suggesting minimal expression leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Moreover, a 4 hr experience of an enriched environment (EE) (with a single dose of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) at the beginning of EE) significantly increased tdTomato-labeled neurons in CA1 compared to control mice that were maintained in the home cage with basal neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), indicating successful capturing of activated neuronal population by our method. Additional analysis indicates that majority of AAV-<italic>Fos</italic>-TRAP labeled neurons within the CA1 pyramidal layer are excitatory neurons as greater than 94% of them are positive for CaMKII staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>Having validated the labeling method, we next sought to examine engram reactivation in hippocampal CA1 during fear memory recall. Learning-activated neurons were labeled with 4-OHT injection. Since the effective time window of 4-OHT is around 6 hr after injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>), and the intensive training protocol spans more than 6 hr, we performed two 4-OHT injections at the beginning of the first and third training sessions to ensure sufficient labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Contextual fear memory was tested 3 days after training to allow sufficient time for tdTomato expression. Hippocampal tissues were collected 1 hr after memory recall and processed for FOS immunohistochemistry staining to label recall-activated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Both fear conditioning training and memory recall activated comparable numbers of neurons in CA1 in both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, indicated by similar percentage of tdTomato-expressing (training-activated) and FOS-positive (memory recall-activated) neurons in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Additionally, compared to tdTomato-negative neurons, a significantly higher portion of the tdTomato-positive neurons expressed FOS in both WT and KO mice, suggesting that learning-labeled memory engrams were preferentially reactivated during memory recall, consistent with their predicted roles in memory encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, compared to WT, this preferential reactivation is significantly reduced in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that reactivation efficacy is decreased in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Further, the Pearson correlation analysis of individual animal’s freezing levels during recall and their CA1 engram reactivation efficacy showed a significant correlation between the two measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that CA1 engram reactivation efficacy is positively correlated with animal’s performance during context memory test.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reduced engram reactivation efficacy is correlated with impaired contextual fear memory in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol for activity-dependent genetic labeling of neural ensembles.

In addition, EE combined with targeted treatment has been reported to promote cognitive improvements in FXS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winarni et al., 2012</xref>), although the mechanism is not clear. We decided to explore this question by investigating how activating neurons during EE influences their behavior in subsequent learning. Our EE protocol consists a daily 4–6 hr exposure of EE for a consecutive 10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). To label EE-activated neurons, we injected 4-OHT right before EE experience on day 1 to capture all EE-activated neurons during the first day EE experience when we expected maximum activation due to novelty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To maximize capturing, we performed two more follow-up injections on days 2 and 3 of EE, each right before the EE experience. EE extensively activated neurons in CA1, as roughly 25% neurons were labeled by tdTomato in both WT and KO groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Immunolabeling with FOS showed comparable degrees of neuronal activation in CA1 by 1 hr and 10 day EE experience in WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), indicating that absence of FMRP does not affect neuron engagement during EE. After 10 days of EE, we trained the mice with conventional fear conditioning paradigm (to allow more precise FOS labeling of learning-activated neurons as the intensive training paradigm spans more than six hours) and examined CA1 engagement during learning with FOS staining. Overall CA1 engagement during fear learning was similar (~20%) between both WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Interestingly, compared to tdTomato- neurons (not engaged in EE), which had very low FOS expression (~10%), tdTomato+ neurons (EE-activated) showed a four-fold increase in FOS expression, indicating that fear learning preferentially recruited EE-activated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

To answer this question, we applied a chemogenetic approach to specifically inhibit EE-activated CA1 neurons during fear conditioning learning. AAV-DJ-EF1a-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry was co-injected with AAV-<italic>Fos</italic>-TRAP to the CA1 region of Ai9 mice (WT or <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO), and 4-OHT was injected during EE to label and to express the inhibitory DREADD in EE-activated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). CNO (5 mg/kg) was injected 1 hr prior to the fear conditioning training to specifically suppress activities of EE-activated neurons. Control mice received exact same treatment including CNO injections except no DREADD-expressing AAVs were injected. As expected, DREADD expression did not affect tdTomato labeling of EE-activated neurons in either WT or <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

Neural ensemble theory proposed by Donald O. Hebb hypothesized that learned associations are stored in a population of neurons, which is achieved through synaptic plasticity development during and after learning. Reactivation of these neurons in the ensemble, often referred to as the engram cells, elicits memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>). Validation of the neural ensemble theory was made possible by the development of activity-dependent neuronal labeling technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowansage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guenthner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>).

In this study, we applied these approaches to investigate the mechanism underlying cognition deficits in the FXS mouse model. We show that successful reactivation of CA1 engram during memory recall test, which is essential for normal fear memory retrieval, is impaired in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and that the recall efficacy is positively correlated with behavioral performances. Importantly, experiencing an enriched environment prior to learning improves engram reactivation efficacy and rescues memory recall in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p><p>Both behavioral deficits and synaptic dysfunctions in the FXS animal models have been extensively investigated over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bostrom et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melancia and Trezza, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains unclear how altered synaptic plasticity, examined in ex-vivo systems (e.g. brain slices or cultured neurons), contributes to impaired memory encoding processes measured in behaving animals. In this study, we aim to further understand how network level changes, in particular, altered activation patterns of neuronal population during memory recall, contributes to memory deficits in the FXS mouse. Using well-established activity-dependent genetic labeling method, we showed that learning-activated neurons in hippocampal CA1 are indeed preferentially reactivated during memory recall, and that the efficacy of this engram reactivation is positively correlated with behavioral performances. In the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, reduced efficacy of neuronal ensemble reactivation correlates with reduced performance levels in fear memory recall test. What mechanism may contribute to the impaired neural ensemble reactivation in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice? Memory formation requires persistent changes at synapses that often involve new protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). Given FMRP’s function as an RNA-binding protein that regulates the synthesis of many synaptic plasticity-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darnell and Klann, 2013</xref>), and altered protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity is a signature phenotype in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2002</xref>), it is conceivable that the cognitive deficit observed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice is due to defective transformation of transient learning-induced neuronal activation into lasting memory traces. Indeed, our results show that despite the normal performance during learning, measured as freezing levels during and immediately after fear conditioning training and total number of neurons activated during learning and memory recall, <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice show impaired engram reactivation during memory recall. Thus, we concluded that the deficits in memory recall most likely occur during the period of memory consolidation after learning, when development of synaptic plasticity supports changes in network connectivity and memory trace formation. This is consistent with findings from a previous study showing that during spatial exploration, although hippocampal CA1 places cells in WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibit similar firing rates, those in FXS mice showed reduced specificity and impaired stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbab et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>How does EE experience improve fear memory formation in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice? Our results showed that not only EE rescued fear memory recall in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, but also restored engram reactivation accuracy in these mice, suggesting that the memory consolidation process was restored after EE. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed that may contribute to EE-mediated memory improvement, including enhanced neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kempermann et al., 1997</xref>), increased dendritic density and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faherty et al., 2003</xref>), changes in synaptic protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hüttenrauch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nithianantharajah et al., 2004</xref>) and neurotrophic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2011</xref>). These changes may, directly or indirectly, lead to enhanced network function and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, enhanced sensory, motor and social experience during EE may support prolonged behaviorally meaningful patterns of neural activity, which may shift Hebbian plasticity rules. Deficits in Hebbian plasticity have been widely reported in FXS models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>). mGluR-dependent LTD are enhanced, but not absent, in both hippocampus and cerebellum of <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koekkoek et al., 2005</xref>). Studies investigating hippocampal and cortical LTP in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice showed that LTP impairment depends on the age and strain of mice, and is induction protocol-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lauterborn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paradee et al., 1999</xref>), largely suggesting that the LTP expression mechanism is intact in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, and that the observed deficits reflect an altered threshold for LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meredith et al., 2007</xref>). The fact that EE can rescue fear conditioning performance in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice supports the notion that basic signaling mechanisms underlying some forms of Hebbian plasticity (e.g. LTP) essential for fear memory encoding may be intact, but that the induction rules for these essential forms of plasticity have been changed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KOs due to altered non-Hebbian plasticity (i.e. homeostatic synaptic plasticity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that animals raised in an EE environment exhibit enhanced Hebbian plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duffy et al., 2001</xref>). The short EE protocol used in this study has also been shown to alter Hebbian plasticity threshold in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, when the activity of EE-engaged neurons is dampened chemogenetically, the improvement in both engram activation accuracy and fear memory recall is abolished. Taken together, our results suggest that neuronal activation during EE experience is instrumental toward facilitating learning-dependent development of synaptic plasticity through modification of synaptic states and/or circuit properties.</p><p>One intriguing observation in this study is the preferential recruitment of EE-engaged neurons to fear memory-encoding ensembles, both in WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Neuronal excitability has been shown as a key factor in memory allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>), EE-activated neurons may have higher excitability due to their engagement in EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malik and Chattarji, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Valero-Aracama et al., 2015</xref>), and thus are more likely to participate in subsequent learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sekeres et al., 2010</xref>). It is interesting that EE-induced bias in neuronal activation during learning is very similar between WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, suggesting that this process is independent of FMRP expression. How does this biased activation of neurons in learning improve memory encoding in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse? We can envision two possibilities. First, through a cell-autonomous process, repeated and behaviorally relevant activation during EE induces changes in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO neurons that facilitates development of synaptic plasticity during learning, allowing normal memory consolidation to occur. A second possibility is based on the observation that CA1 pyramidal neurons are heterogeneous in their development, gene expression patterns, anatomy, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mizuseki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soltesz and Losonczy, 2018</xref>). Thus, EE experience, due to its nature in promoting spatial navigation among other features, may preferentially activate a subset of CA1 neurons that are more effective in contextual memory encoding. Given our observation that EE-activated neurons are more likely to participate in subsequent learning, EE experience in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice may result in a significant shift in the subtypes of CA1 neurons recruited during learning toward better contextual memory encoding, thus improving memory recall in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice. Further detailed analysis (i.e. transcriptome profiling) of EE-activated neurons are required to further distinguish these possibilities.</p><p>Memory engram allocation and reactivation are key areas under intense investigation in the field of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>). It is generally agreed that memory recall requires accessing the neural ensembles that constitute the memory engrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frankland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>). Agreeing with many studies conducted in several brain regions including hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakazawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tayler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zelikowsky et al., 2014</xref>), our data support the notion that memory engram reactivation is a non-random process that occurs significantly above chance level of neural ensemble reactivation. However, these studies, including ours, also show that the overall reactivation percentage never approaches 100% (roughly 10–40%, depending on the region, labeling approaches and behavioral paradigms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tayler et al., 2013</xref>). Just as Hebb predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hebb, 1949</xref>), reactivation of a fraction of memory ensemble is sufficient to produce full memory recall. Two possibilities may underly this seemingly ‘imperfect’ reactivation of memory engram. First, memory engram is flexible and dynamic. There is potential built-in redundancy in the mechanism to ensure full memory recall by a partial presentation of cues (or partial usage of available cues). Such redundancy ensures reliable behavioral responses in face of the less reliable sensory world (e.g. seasonal changes of scenery in the same location of the woods), thus increasing the chance of survival for the animals. Understanding how this redundancy is encoded without compromising memory specificity is one of the key questions in the field. A recent study examining the different aspects of hippocampal memory engram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) provides an excellent example in which two different IEG-labeled ensembles act in a push-and-pull manner to ensure a balance between memory discrimination and generalization. A second possibility is that imperfect genetic labeling may contribute (at least partly) to the perceived imperfection of memory engram reactivation. So far, the immediate early gene promoters are the main approach to label engram cells. With a relatively broad labeling time window (ranging from a few hours to several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeNardo and Luo, 2017</xref>]) and varied IEGs induction profiles in different cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cruz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), the current IEG promoter approach may ‘over-tag’ or ‘under-tag’ the engrams, contributing to imperfect alignment between neural ensemble activation during learning and its reactivation during memory recall. Nonetheless, these tools provide unprecedented opportunities for accessing memory engrams. Future studies with improved tools will bring us better understandings of the mechanisms underlying memory formation and recall.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

A tone (20 s, 85 dB, 2 kHz) was turned on at 180 s, 260 s, 340 s, and 420 s, each of which was co-terminated with a foot shock (2 s, 0.75 mA). After the third training trial, the mouse was returned to its home cage. Three days after training, the mouse was placed back to the original conditioning chamber for 5 min. The behavior of the mice was recorded with the FreezeFrame software and analyzed with the FreezeView software (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA). Motionless bouts lasting more than 1 s were considered as freeze. On the training day, the freezing percentages across the training period and after the third foot shock were summarized as an indication of fear memory acquisition.</p><p>Conventional fear conditioning training paradigm: on the training day, mice were placed in the fear conditioning chamber and allowed to explore it for 2 min. After exploration period, a tone (30 s, 85 dB, 2 kHz) was turned on at 120 s, 210 s, and 300 s, each of which was co-terminated with a foot shock (2 s, 0,75 mA). The mouse remained in the training chamber for another 30 s before being returned to the home cages. The next day after fear training, mice were placed back into the original conditioning chamber for 5 min. Mouse behavior recording and data analysis was the same as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Open field test</title><p>Mice were individually placed into the center of a 40 cm (L) x 40 cm (W) x 40 cm (H) open field chamber. Locomotor activity was recorded for 30 min using an overhead digital camera and tracked using Viewer III tracking system (Biobserve, Bonn, Germany). The center area was defined as the 20 by 20 cm central section of the chambers and the ratio of track length in the center area was used to estimate the anxiety level in the open field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Spontaneous alternation Y-maze</title><p>A light gray plastic Y-maze (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) was used to evaluate spatial working memory. Individual mice were placed in the center of the Y-maze and allowed to freely explore for 5 min. The sequences and total numbers of arm entries were recorded and analyzed with the Viewer III tracking system. Visiting all three different arms consecutively was termed a ‘correct’ trial and visiting one arm twice or more than three consecutive entries was termed a ‘wrong’ trial. Spontaneous alternation was calculated as the percentage of the ‘correct’ trial to the total trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>The gray-painted maze had four 30 × 8 cm<sup>2</sup> arms. Two of them were open arms without walls and the other two were enclosed by 10 cm high walls. The maze was elevated 40 cm over the floor. At the beginning of the tests, mice were individually placed at the junction of an open and a closed arm, facing the closed arm. Then, the mice were allowed to freely move in the whole maze for 5 min. The time mice spent in the open versus the closed arms was recorded and analyzed with the Viewer III tracking system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Novel object recognition</title><p>The novel object recognition test was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leger et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, mice were given 10 min of habituation time individually in an empty box on day 1. On day 2, mice were individually placed in the box for 10 min with two identical objects, they are either T75 cell culture flask filled with bedding material or blocks of LEGO. On day 3, one object was replaced with a novel object. Object location in the chamber was randomized. Exploration behavior was recorded and analyzed with the Viewer III tracking system. The recognition index was defined as the time spent on the novel object divided by the time spent on both objects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Passive avoidance test</title><p>Passive avoidance test was performed using MED-PC IV software in a shuttle box (Med Associates, Fairfax, VT). The shuttle box was equipped with a metal grid floor and a door separating the box into equal halves. One half of the box was kept in the dark and the other half was exposed to a bright light. The mice were placed in the bright chamber and allowed to explore for 30 s, then the door was raised to allow the mice to enter the dark chamber. Once the mouse entered the dark chamber, the door was closed to prevent the mouse from escaping. After 3 s delay, a mild foot shock (0.3 mA) with 4 s duration was administered. Then the door was open, and the second training trial begins. The sequence was repeated until the mouse remained in the bright chamber for 180 s. The mice were given a single recall trial 24 hr after training. In the recall trials, the mice were placed in the lighted chamber for 180 s and the latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>Hot plate test</title><p>Hot plate test was performed using a hot plate with custom floorless Plexiglas chamber (TAP Plastic, Mountain View, CA). The mice were placed on the hot plate maintained at 55°C, the latency to elicit a nocifensive behavior (e.g. hind paw withdrawal or licking) was recorded and the animal was promptly removed from the container. The maximum latency was set to 30 s to prevent tissue injury.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were deep anesthetized and perfused with 15 ml PBS followed by 15 ml ice cold fixative (4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS). The brains were postfixed in 4°C overnight and then immersed in 30% sucrose solution for 48 hr before being sectioned at 30 μm thicknesses on a cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). For immunocytochemistry, free-floating mouse brain sections were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 hr, then blocked for 1 hr in blocking buffer (5% FBS, 0.3% Triton X-100). Slices were subsequently incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, followed by 3 × 10 min washes in PBS and 2 hr incubation with corresponding fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies in blocking buffer. The primary antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal anti-c-FOS (Millipore, Burlington, MA), mouse monoclonal anti-FMRP (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa, IA), and mouse monoclonal anti-CaMKII (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibody included Goat polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), Cy2-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and Cy3-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Slices were then labeled with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in PBS for 15 min, washed 3 × 10 min and mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging</title><p>All images were acquired using a Nikon A1 Eclipse Ti confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 20x objective, operated by NIS-Elements AR acquisition software. Laser intensities and acquisition settings were established for individual channels using optimal LUT settings and applied to entire experimental replicates. Images of three to five slices were taken per animal. Image analysis was conducted using Nikon Elements and all imaging and analyses were performed blind to the experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were conducted with the experimenters being ‘blind’ to the genotypes and treatment parameters. Sample sizes (n number of independent biological replicates) were first determined based on similar experiments performed and published by our lab and others in the same field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Titley et al., 2017</xref>). After experiments were completed, post hoc power analysis were performed to ensure minimal power of 0.8 is achieved at α value of 0.05. Additionally, to ensure reproducibility, each experiment was performed in at least three independent litters (N number), with multiple animals per litter. For non-behavioral experiments (e.g. histology), a minimum of three technical duplicates were analyzed and results averaged to generate a single data point for that particular animal. All samples in each group were analyzed without exclusions with one exception: if the injection site was found inaccurate during end-point histological verification, all data from that particular animal were excluded. The n/N (number of mice/number of independent litters) for each experiment are indicated in figure legends.</p><p>All results are presented as mean ± SEM, and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism six software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The distribution of data in each set of experiments was tested for normality using D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. Two-tailed unpaired <italic>t</italic> test (for parametric test) or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests (for nonparametric test) was applied for two groups comparisons. For multiple groups comparisons, one-way ANOVA (for parametric test) or Kruskal-Wallis test (for nonparametric test) were applied, followed by appropriate post hoc tests (as indicated in figure legends). Animals in the same litter were randomly assigned to different treatment groups and blinded to experimenters. Injection sites and viral expression were confirmed for all animals, mice with incorrect injections sites were excluded from the data analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

engram&quot; of contextual fear conditioning in <italic>Fmr1</italic> knockout mice. The authors find memory consolidation is impaired with the loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic> and this impairment is associated with a reduction in the re-activation of the hippocampal engram. This finding provides a circuit-level link for previous research on the synaptic impacts and behavioral deficits causes by loss of <italic>Fmr1</italic>. The authors further demonstrate that environmental enrichment is an effective way to restore the cognitive function of the mutant mice, and this restoration is accompanied by the restoration of the reactivation of the hippocampal engram.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Defective memory engram reactivation underlies impaired fear memory recall in Fragile X syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeansok Kim (Reviewer #2); Anton Maximov (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>There was strong enthusiasm for the study reporting the reactivation of hippocampal CA1 engram cells essential for normal fear memory retrieval is impaired in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse model. The reviewers request further explanation on the data as to freezing to tone and the interpretation of behavioral results. The reviewers also commented on further mechanistic insights into the overlap between EE-activated neurons and memory engrams (e.g. add electrophysiology experiments), however this is not required and a further elaboration of potential mechanisms would also be acceptable. We ask that you address the following comments listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both intensive fear conditioning and conventional fear conditioning training procedures comprised of 12 tone-shock pairings and 3 tone-shock pairings, respectively. However, only contextual freezing data are presented. Some explanation is needed as to why tone freezing data are not included. Also, the authors may want to consider the possibility that the reduced contextual freezing behavior observed in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice may not necessarily reflect impaired contextual fear memory but rather stronger discriminative fear conditioning to the tone CS, which is explicitly paired with the shock US. In other words, if the tone CS accrued more associative strength, the context fear will become weaker.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the authors offer potential explanations for an intriguing recruitment of EE-activated cells for subsequent memory coding but, at the end, the underlying mechanism remains mysterious. While extensive molecular and structural characterization of these cells goes beyond the scope of the present study, the hypothesis that EE-activated cells are more excitable could be easily tested via current-clamp recordings in acute brain slices.</p><p>3) In Figure 2B, considerable numbers of cFos-positive neurons appear to be GABAergic interneurons as their somas reside outside of CA1sp.

The term HC is confusing (home cage?), and there seems to be a discrepancy between Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1D in terms of percentages of recombined neurons.</p><p>5) The rationale for multiple injections of 4-OHT is unclear.</p><p>6) The study clearly shows that only ~40% of neurons recombined during learning become cFos-positive after memory recall, suggesting that engram ensembles are flexible.

We adopted the conventional delayed fear conditioning paradigm in our study for the purpose of relating our study to the vast literature, which includes both contextual and cued fear conditioning components. We did not test the tone-freezing in our original experiments because we needed the FOS labeling to reflect neuronal activation during contextual fear memory recall. However, we want to mention that in our original experiments using CA1-specific <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice, we did also measure the cued fear memory in response to tone and found that it was also impaired. This data is now shown <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A and B</xref>. To further specifically address this concern in the constitutive <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mouse, we have performed another set of experiments in three independent cohorts where cued fear memories were measured. Similar to our previous experiments, both the WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice exhibited normal learning curve during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C and D</xref>). By contrast, the cued memory to tone examined three days after learning was significantly impaired in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1E and F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that cued fear memory is also impaired in <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</p><p>The equally impaired tone freezing response partially addressed the second point raised by this reviewer in that the weaker context fear is not the result of discriminative fear conditioning because the tone fear memory is not stronger or normal. To further address this point with a more direct approach, we trained another three independent cohorts of mice with a modified intensive training protocol by leaving out the tone CS. Again, both WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice learned normally during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1G</xref> and H). However, contextual fear memory is still impaired in the <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1I</xref>), indicating that independent of the presence of tone CS, contextual fear memory is indeed impaired in FXS mouse model. This result is not unexpected as <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice also exhibited impairment in passive avoidance test, which is similar to contextual fear memory (please refer to manuscript Figures 1C and D).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cued fear memory and contextual fear memory are both impaired in CA1-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice and constitutive <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.</title><p>(A and B) Altered context test and cued fear memory test in CA1-<italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice.

While extensive molecular and structural characterization of these cells goes beyond the scope of the present study, the hypothesis that EE-activated cells are more excitable could be easily tested via current-clamp recordings in acute brain slices.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and agree it would be interesting to further investigate the underlying mechanism that drives recruitment of EE-activated cells. Excitability changes are indeed one of the potential mechanisms that biases the recruitment toward EE-activated cells. In agreement with the hypothesis this reviewer brought up, previous studies performed in acute brain slices have already shown that EE experience increases intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 cells (Malik and Chattarji, 2012; Valero-Aracama, Sauvage, and Yoshida, 2015), although it was not examined specifically in EE engaged neurons. Considering the phenomenon that neurons with relatively higher intrinsic excitability win the allocation competition to become engram cells (Lisman et al., 2018; Sekeres et al., 2010), we believe neuronal excitability increases resulting from EE experience could largely contribute to the subsequent memory engram allocation. To investigate this mechanism further with comprehensive electrophysiology analysis in acute brain slices is indeed our goal for the next step. In addition to excitability changes, we would also examine synaptic strength and synaptic plasticity changes induced by EE experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2B, considerable numbers of cFos-positive neurons appear to be GABAergic interneurons as their somas reside outside of CA1sp. This seems inconsistent with quantifications of the overlap between cFos- and CamkII-immunoreactive cells, as assessed with a different reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her astute observations and apologize for accidently choosing a non-representative image in Figure 2B. Our quantification indeed shows that more than 94% of FOS-positive cells (shown as tdTomato reporter in the new experiment mentioned below) are CaMKII-positive non-GABAergic cells. We have replaced the images with another example that better represents this quantification.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern of characterizing engram cell types using different reporters, we re-performed this experiment using Ai9 reporter mouse line so that the engram cells were labelled with the same reporter (tdTomato). The results of CaMKII immunostaining in these hippocampal slices are now shown in updated Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F. The percentages of CaMKII-positive neurons in tdTomato-labeled engram cells are 94.8% and 96.2% in WT and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO groups, respectively, which are consistent to our previous results using EYFP as the reporter, and the other report using a similar labeling approach (Guenthner et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should improve the presentation and labeling of data shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. The term HC is confusing (home cage?), and there seems to be a discrepancy between Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1D in terms of percentages of recombined neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the unintended confusion. We have replaced the ‘HC’ labeling in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 with ‘basal activity’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The rationale for multiple injections of 4-OHT is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following explanation to the main text to further elaborate on the rationale behind our multiple 4-OHT injection for both learning activated engram labeling and EE engaged neurons labeling.</p><p>“Learning-activated neurons were labeled with 4-OHT injection. Since the effective time window of 4-OHT is around 6 hours after injection (Guenthner et al., 2013), and the intensive training protocol spans more than six hours, we performed two 4-OHT injections at the beginning of the first and third training sessions to ensure sufficient labeling (Figure 2A).”</p><p>“To label EE-activated neurons, we injected 4-OHT right before EE experience on day 1 to capture all EE-activated neurons during the first day EE experience when we expected maximum activation due to novelty (Figure 4A). To maximize capturing, we performed two more follow-up injections on day 2 and 3 of EE, each right before the EE experience”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The study clearly shows that only ~40% of neurons recombined during learning become cFos-positive after memory recall, suggesting that engram ensembles are flexible. The authors should further emphasize this point in the Discussion. Also, they should discuss recent studies demonstrating that cFos and cFos-based TRAP systems may not label the full spectrum of neurons essential for memory storage (see Sun et al., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer brought up a very interesting point, which we too have been pondering about. Agreeing with many studies conducted in several brain regions including hippocampus (Denny et al., 2014; Kitamura et al., 2017; Nakazawa et al., 2016; Tanaka et al., 2014; Tayler et al., 2013; Zelikowsky et al., 2014), our data support the notion that memory engram reactivation is a non-random process that occurs significantly above chance level of neural ensemble activation. However, these studies, including ours, also show that the overall reactivation percentage never approaches 100% (roughly 10-40%, depending on the region, labeling approaches and behavioral paradigms) (Tanaka et al., 2014; Tayler et al., 2013). Just as Hebb predicted (Hebb, 1949), reactivation of a fraction of memory ensemble is sufficient to produce full memory recall.</p><p>What may underlie this seemingly ‘imperfect’ reactivation of memory engram? We consider two possibilities. First, imperfect genetic labeling may contribute to the perceived imperfection of memory engram reactivation. So far, the immediate early gene promoters are the main approach to label engram cells. With a relatively broad labeling time window (ranging from a few hours to several days (DeNardo and Luo, 2017)) and varied IEGs induction profiles in different cell-types (Cruz et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2020), the current IEG promoter approach may ‘over-tagging’ or ‘under-tagging’ the engrams during training or testing. Additionally, IEG promoter-driven Cre expression may not lead to expression of reporters in all cells where this IEG is activated, contributing to imperfect alignment between genetic labelling and direct IEG staining. Second, as the reviewer alluded to, memory engram is flexible and dynamic. There is potential built-in redundancy in the mechanism to ensure full memory recall by a partial presentation of cues (or partial usage of available cues). Such redundancy ensures reliable behavioral responses in face of the less reliable sensory world (e.g., seasonal changes of scenery in the same part of the woods), thus protecting the survival of the animals. Understanding how this redundancy is encoded without compromising memory specificity is one of the key questions in the field. The study by Sun et al., 2020, is an excellent example in which two different IEG-labeled ensembles act in a push-and-pull manner to ensure a balance between memory discrimination and generalization.</p><p>We have added the above-mentioned points in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is important to explain why only male mice were used in the main text since many readers may not be familiar with sex-related differences in the manifestation of FXS.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
