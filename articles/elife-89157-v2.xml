Whilst Mtb elicits NOD-2 activation through host recognition of its peptidoglycan-derived muramyl dipeptide (MDP), it masks the endogenous NOD-1 ligand through amidation of glutamate at the second position in peptidoglycan side-chains. As the current BCG vaccine is derived from pathogenic mycobacteria, a similar situation prevails. To alleviate this masking ability and to potentially improve efficacy of the BCG vaccine, we used CRISPRi to inhibit expression of the essential enzyme pair, MurT-GatD, implicated in amidation of peptidoglycan side-chains. We demonstrate that depletion of these enzymes results in reduced growth, cell wall defects, increased susceptibility to antibiotics, altered spatial localization of new peptidoglycan and increased NOD-1 expression in macrophages. In cell culture experiments, training of a human monocyte cell line with this recombinant BCG yielded improved control of Mtb growth. In the murine model of TB infection, we demonstrate that depletion of MurT-GatD in BCG, which is expected to unmask the D-glutamate diaminopimelate (iE-DAP) NOD-1 ligand, yields superior prevention of TB disease compared to the standard BCG vaccine. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in this study demonstrate the feasibility of gene regulation platforms such as CRISPRi to alter antigen presentation in BCG in a bespoke manner that tunes immunity towards more effective protection against TB disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide, partially due to a lack of access to drug treatments in certain countries where the disease is common. The only available tuberculosis vaccine – known as the BCG vaccine – is useful for preventing cases in young children, but is ineffective in teenagers and adults. So, there is a need to develop new vaccines that offer better, and longer lasting, durable protection in people of all ages.</p><p>During an infection, our immune system recognizes markers known as PAMPs on the surface of bacteria, viruses or other disease-causing pathogens. The recognition of PAMPs by the immune system enables the body to distinguish foreign invading organisms from its own cells and tissues, thus triggering a response that fights the infection. If the body encounters the infectious agent again in the future, the immune system is able to quickly recognize and eliminate it before it can cause disease. Vaccines protect us by mimicking the appearance of the pathogen to trigger the first immune response without causing the illness.</p><p>The BCG vaccine contains live bacteria that are closely related to the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis called <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Both <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and the live bacteria used in the BCG vaccine are able to hide an important PAMP, known as the NOD-1 ligand, from the immune system, making it harder for the body to detect them. The NOD-1 ligand forms part of the bacterial cell wall and modifying the BCG bacterium so it cannot disguise this PAMP may lead to a new, more effective vaccine.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, Shaku et al. used a gene editing approach to develop a modified version of the BCG bacterium which is unable to hide its NOD-1 ligand when treated with a specific drug. Immune cells trained with the modified BCG vaccine were more effective at controlling the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> than macrophages trained using the original vaccine. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with the modified BCG vaccine were better able to limit <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth in their lungs than mice that had received the original vaccine.</p><p>These findings offer a new candidate vaccine in the fight against tuberculosis. Further studies will be needed to modify the vaccine for use in humans. More broadly, this work demonstrates that gene editing can be used to expose a specific PAMP present in a live vaccine. This may help develop more effective vaccines for other diseases in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mycobacterium</kwd><kwd>recombinant BCG vaccine</kwd><kwd>tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>amidation</kwd><kwd>NOD1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HHMI000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001322</institution-id><institution>South African Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaku</surname><given-names>Moagi Tube</given-names></name><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kana</surname><given-names>Bavesh D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH AI 155346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bishai</surname><given-names>William R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The new vaccine candidate for tuberculosis displays superior protection against disease when compared the currently available vaccine, and can potentially provide new options for global childhood vaccination programs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) remains a leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">WHO, 2022</xref>). Despite the availability of the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) TB vaccine, approximately 2 billion people worldwide are latently infected with Mtb and represent a reservoir of future active disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trunz et al., 2006</xref>). BCG is the only licensed TB vaccine and has been in use since the 1920 s, with close to 100 million infants vaccinated annually worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trunz et al., 2006</xref>). BCG protects against TB meningitis and miliary TB in children, but lacks efficacy against pulmonary TB in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez et al., 2022</xref>); hence, improved TB vaccines remain an urgent public health priority.</p><p>Innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have evolved to sense unique pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are often essential components of infecting organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Wu, 2021</xref>). Bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) is one such PAMP, and it is detected by the PRRs NOD-1, which recognizes the D-isoglutamate diaminopimelate (iE-DAP) segment of PG, and NOD-2 which detects the related muramyl dipeptide (MDP) portion of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li and Wu, 2021</xref>). Activation of NOD-1 triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and similarly, NOD-2 activation leads to upregulation of NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While many gram-negative pathogens express abundant levels of the NOD-1 ligand iE-DAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caruso et al., 2014</xref>), pathogenic mycobacteria including Mtb, <italic>M. bovis</italic>, and the <italic>M. bovis</italic>-derived BCG strains possess an immune subversion system which enzymatically masks NOD-1 antigenic structure through amidation, thereby enabling escape from NOD-1 mediated immune containment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maitra et al., 2019</xref>). The enzyme pair encoded by the <italic>murT</italic> (Mb3739, in <italic>M. bovis</italic>)-<italic>gatD</italic> (Mb3740) operon forms a glutaminase and an amidotransferase complex, which amidates iE-DAP to form iQ-DAP, thus avoiding NOD-1 detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As amidation of D-isoglutamate to D-isoglutamine during PG maturation in mycobacteria is required for subsequent PG cross-linking, MurT and GatD are important for mycobacterial cell wall integrity and genetic screens have confirmed their essentiality for <italic>in vitro</italic> survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Wet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maitra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaku et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that depletion of MurT-GatD in BCG would result in increased abundance of the NOD-1 ligand (iE-DAP), thus enabling enhanced immunogenicity of the recombinant vaccine strain. We used a CRISPRi platform for targeted inhibition of transcription of the amidotransferase complex - MurT-GatD essential for PG amidation in mycobacteria (i.e. modification of iE-DAP to iQ-DAP) to develop a recombinant BCG vaccine (rBCG::iE-DAP) engineered to activate NOD-1 during vaccination. CRISPRi mediated genetic manipulation showed that MurT-GatD levels can be conditionally depleted in BCG without complete loss of viability. Compared to the wildtype (WT) BCG, vaccination of mice with the MurT-GatD-depleted rBCG gives superior containment of Mtb proliferation in lungs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of rBCG::iE-DAP</title><p>Using the CRISPRi gene expression knockdown system, we generated a derivative of plasmid pLRJ965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rock et al., 2017</xref>) that conditionally expresses dCas9 from <italic>Streptococcus thermophiles</italic> and a 17 base short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence that targets the <italic>murT-gatD</italic> operon upon exposure to anhydrotetracycline (ATc) or doxycycline (Dox) to create plasmid PLRJ965 +<italic>murT</italic>sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>).

Consistent with this, TEM revealed a typical multi-layered mycobacterial cell wall outline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahapatra et al., 2008</xref>), with visible layers in WT BCG in comparison to the defective cell wall structure in rBCG::iE-DAP, without a clear cell wall outline as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.

Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, MurT-GatD knockdown was associated with a 2- to 16-fold decrease in the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the recombinant strain for amoxicillin-clavulanate, meropenem, vancomycin, and ethionamide, each of which targets either PG biosynthesis or PG-dependent accessory glycolipids. To further confirm the reduced levels of PG cross-linking, we stained MurT-GatD depleted rBCG::iE-DAP cells with BODIPY-FL vancomycin—a fluorescent probe which specifically labels uncrosslinked PG. As shown in the confocal fluorescence micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, BODIPY-FL vancomycin displayed complete cell wall labeling of the rBCG::iE-DAP cells, in contrast, only the poles of WT BCG cells were labeled.

This amidated, D-Gln-containing probe is incorporated into mycobacterial PG by the activity of PG cross-linking L,D-transpeptidases which require the amidation modification on one of the PG stem peptides to form the cross-link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pidgeon et al., 2019</xref>). The deficient cross-linking in the cell wall due to MurT-GatD depletion led us to speculate that more of the amidated probe will be incorporated into existing PG. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, labeling of the MurT-GatD depleted cells showed a greater incorporation of the tetrapeptide fluorophore than in WT BCG. We further assessed this reduced amidation by labeling of PG extracted from WT BCG and rBCG::iE-DAP with an amine reactive fluorescent dye, which binds amine (NH<sub>2</sub>) groups. This revealed decreased amidation of PG upon MurT-GatD depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), thus confirming that rBCG::iE-DAP displayed greater exposure of the iE-DAP, NOD-1 antigenic structure. To investigate the involvement of NOD-1 in macrophages, we next assessed the ability of rBCG::iE-DAP to induce increased expression of the NOD PRRs by infecting interferon-gamma (IFNγ) activated THP-1 macrophages at an MOI of 1. This was followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure expression of both <italic>nod-1</italic> and <italic>nod-2</italic> in comparison to the wildtype parental strain (WT BCG) 12 hr post infection. We also infected the macrophages with <italic>E. coli</italic>, which naturally expresses the NOD-1 ligand iE-DAP in its PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girardin et al., 2003</xref>).

Infection with rBCG::iE-DAP led to an ~15-fold increase in NOD-2 expression in IFNγ-activated macrophages, an ~55-fold and ~200-fold increase in <italic>nod-1</italic> expression in both non-activated and IFNγ-activated THP-1 macrophages, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i, j</xref>).

This was done to assess activation of the CRISPRi system <italic>ex vivo</italic> and also to compare growth to WT BCG infected cells. The growth of the strains was recorded by plating for colony forming unit (CFU) counts at day 3 and day 5 post-infection. At day 3, bacterial containment was observed for all strains but was most prominent for rBCG::iE-DAP strains treated with ATc. Dose-dependent inhibition of growth of rBCG::iE-DAP was observed at day 5, with 500 ng/ml ATc (the maximum concentration used) resulting in an ~three fold difference in growth inhibition of rBCG::iE-DAP in comparison to WT BCG and rBCG::iE-DAP without ATc supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Secondly, we performed ELISA experiments to assess the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα as rBCG::iE-DAP is designed to express the NOD-1 ligand iE-DAP, potentially increasing the pro-inflammatory response. Activation of rBCG::iE-DAP by supplementation of growth media with ATc resulted in a dose-dependent increase in TNFα expression in comparison to WT BCG in IFNγ-activated BMDMs. However, this was statistically insignificant between strains, while TNFα expression remained low for both WT BCG and rBCG::iE-DAP strains when used for infection of unactivated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, BCG does not provide protection against TB infection in adults and has failed to eradicate the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dockrell and Butkeviciute, 2022</xref>). This has spurred the need to develop novel TB vaccine candidates with varying modes of action to replace or boost BCG, which still remains the gold-standard for next generation TB vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is still unknown which mycobacterial antigens (either in Mtb or BCG) are able to induce effective protective anti-mycobacterial immunity. Also, there is evidence that BCG possesses several immune evasion mechanisms similar to those used by Mtb during infection to avoid immune killing that limit its efficacy as a vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guinn and Rubin, 2017</xref>). For example, rBCG strains further attenuated by deletion of immune evasion genes such as <italic>sapM</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Festjens et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>nuoG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gengenbacher et al., 2016</xref>), or <italic>zmp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sander et al., 2015</xref>) among others, have been developed and these show enhanced immunogenicity and efficacy against Mtb infection in animal models.</p><p>Immune evasion genes that are also essential for BCG viability are attractive targets to be studied for development of next generation rBCGs with enhanced efficacy. For example, genes encoding essential enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of potent immune-modulating cell wall lipids such as trehalose dimycolate (TDM), di- and tri-acylglycerols, pthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) are potential targets of gene regulation platforms to study their role in limiting BCG efficacy. Selective chemical removal of these lipids from BCG (i.e. delipidation of BCG) has shown the ability to enhance BCG efficacy in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moliva et al., 2019</xref>). Gene regulation platforms, including CRISPRi are ideal platforms to study the effect of such essential immunomodulatory enzymes that can be targeted to enhance BCG efficacy. Indeed, recently a CRISPRi based rBCG (rBCG::CRISPRi-AftC) designed for the truncation of the anti-inflammatory cell wall associated lipoglycan – lipoarabinomannan (LAM) into the pro-inflammatory lipomannan derivative (LM) upon CRISPRi mediated depletion of the enzyme arabinofuranosyltransferase C (AftC, required for addition of D-arabinan branches on LM) was shown to enhance the immunogenicity of BCG by upregulating the expression of TNFα, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Madduri et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While previous approaches to modify BCG involved overexpression of protein antigens from Mtb in BCG to induce a long-lived type 1 helper T cell adaptive response, recent approaches that proved to be successful include improving the self-adjuvancy of BCG by re-engineering it to express innate immune cell activating antigens/adjuvants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelidou et al., 2020</xref>). These include for example overexpression of the STING agonist c-di-AMP in BCG or expression of the LTAK63 adjuvant in BCG which resulted in improved protection compared to standard BCG in a guinea pig model and a mouse model, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvalho Dos Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dey et al., 2020</xref>). We used the recently developed CRISPRi platform in BCG to target essential genes (<italic>murT-gatD</italic>) required for PG amidation implicated in immune evasion by masking the iE-DAP antigen, which has been shown to possess adjuvant potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girardin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreno and Gatheral, 2013</xref>). iE-DAP activates the NOD-1 PRR and several studies have shown the importance of this pathway in contributing to the onset of adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fritz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mekonnen et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, NOD-2 has been shown to be the top upregulated gene in alveolar macrophages post subcutaneous vaccination with BCG in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mai et al., 2024</xref>), thus we hypothesized that induction of NOD-1 activity would improve BCG efficacy.</p><p>Phenotypic characterization of rBCG::iE-DAP post CRISPRi activation, with SEM and TEM displayed changes in the outer cell wall surface in rBCG::iE-DAP respectively, consistent with the essentiality of MurT-GatD for PG crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaku et al., 2023</xref>). These defects were also associated with increased sensitivity to cell wall targeting antibiotics, confirming the essentiality of MurT-GatD mediated amidation of PG fragments for cell wall biosynthesis as previously described in other bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Münch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maitra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaku et al., 2023</xref>). As PG amidation by the MurT-GatD complex is required for PG cross-linking by L,D-transpeptidases in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ngadjeua et al., 2018</xref>), we further analysed the level of PG cross-linking in rBCG::iE-DAP by labeling the cells with BODIPY-FL vancomycin, a fluorescent vancomycin derivative binding uncross-linked nascent PG monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miao et al., 2020</xref>). We found that transcriptional repression of MurT-GatD expression in rBCG::iE-DAP was associated with complete cell wall labeling with this probe indicative of reduced PG cross-linking in rBCG::iE-DAP, due to lack of MurT-GatD enzymatic activity. To probe specifically for the reduction of PG amidation in rBCG::iE-DAP, we used a previously developed amidation reporter probe, TetraFl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pidgeon et al., 2019</xref>), to label MurT-GatD depleted cells and this showed increased labeling in rBCG::iE-DAP, indicative of reduced amidation upon transcriptional repression of MurT-GatD expression. Mechanistically, this modification results in reduced growth of mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaku et al., 2023</xref>), and could also allow the recombinant BCG strain to persist during vaccination – a phenotype which has been suggested to enhance antigen presentation by BCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaveh et al., 2014</xref>). As rBCG::iE-DAP is designed to activate the NOD-1 PRR by expression of the iE-DAP ligand, we performed qPCR analysis of <italic>nod-1</italic> expression in macrophages infected with rBCG::iE-DAP. We also assessed <italic>nod-2</italic> expression as mycobacteria also activate NOD-2 with <italic>N</italic>-glycolylated PG fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coulombe et al., 2009</xref>). rBCG::iE-DAP induced substantially increased expression of both <italic>nod-1</italic> and <italic>nod-2</italic> in IFNγ activated macrophages and only significantly increased <italic>nod-1</italic> expression in unactivated macrophages. As <italic>murT-gatD</italic> depletion also causes cell wall defects, phagosomal killing of rBCG::iE-DAP could be causing efficient delivery of ligands such as iE-DAP to activate cytoplasmic PRRs like the NOD receptors. This indicated that while BCG is attenuated, further increasing its self-adjuvancy by activating expression of cell wall associated PRR ligands could be an ideal strategy to improve its efficacy.</p><p>We first tested rBCG::iE-DAP in an <italic>in vitro</italic> monocyte training assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkering et al., 2016</xref>) to assess the efficacy of this strain in training innate responses of macrophages. BCG induces a NOD-2-dependent trained immunity in monocytes resulting in epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of monocytes which differentiate into macrophages with increased bactericidal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blok et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore tested rBCG::iE-DAP trained macrophages for their <italic>in vitro</italic> Mtb killing ability and found that in contrast to WT BCG trained macrophages, rBCG::iE-DAP trained macrophages displayed enhanced Mtb killing ability as measured by CFU counts 24 hr post infection. These results show that targeting innate immune responses with a modified live attenuated vaccine such as the rBCG::iE-DAP strain would enhance development of anti-mycobacterial immunity. We further show that rBCG::iE-DAP is responsive to activation in BMDMs using ATc and also in a mouse aerosol infection model using a minimal Dox dose, as Dox was previously shown to have immunomodulatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miow et al., 2021</xref>). Activation of rBCG::iE-DAP in BMDMs resulted in a trend of increased TNFα expression measured by ELISA providing evidence that expression of iE-DAP in rBCG::iE-DAP could enhance immunogenecity of BCG. These results bolstered our enthusiasm for investigation of rBCG::iE-DAP <italic>in vivo</italic> as a potential TB vaccine candidate.</p><p>We demonstrated that intradermal vaccination of mice with rBCG::iE-DAP, followed by administration of Dox for 6 weeks for CRISPRi mediated repression of MurT-GatD expression, resulted in superior protection from Mtb challenge in the lungs of the immunized mice compared to the WT BCG vaccine. Our vaccination experiments also included a WT BCG+Dox control group to rule out the role of Dox mediated immunomodulatory effects in enhancing WT BCG vaccine efficacy post Mtb challenge. Administration of Dox to WT BCG vaccinated mice (i.e. WT BCG+Dox group) did not enhance WT BCG vaccine efficacy against Mtb challenge when compared to the WT BCG without Dox control group, while rBCG::iE-DAP+Dox shows increased protection at both 4 and 8 weeks post Mtb challenge. We also observed a waning efficacy of the WT BCG vaccine at week 8 post Mtb infection, which has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henao-Tamayo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dwivedi et al., 2022</xref>), however, interestingly vaccination with rBCG::iE-DAP+Dox remained effective at this time point.</p><p>Histopathological analysis of lung sections from the immunized and Mtb challenged mice shows that rBCG::iE-DAP+Dox induces early immune infiltration to the lung compared to WT BCG+Dox and this is maintained at least until 8 weeks post infection, providing early and sustained protection against Mtb challenge. Although increased inflammation in the lung could be detrimental to control of TB disease at a later stage, it has been suggested that an early balanced induction of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is required for optimal protection against Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, this was observed during host directed immunotherapy inducing early immune infiltration to the lung and this was correlated with improved protection against TB in a murine model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gress et al., 2023</xref>). The immune correlates of protection induced by rBCG::iE-DAP are the subject of our future studies and will indicate whether increased inflammation at early time points of infection is important for vaccine mediated protection. As a CRISPRi based knockdown strategy was used in this study to create rBCG::iE-DAP, next steps will include construction of gene knockout mutants of rBCG::iE-DAP to generate a strain that is not based on CRISPRi as a TB vaccine candidate. Collectively, our work demonstrates that MurT-GatD can be targeted in BCG to develop a new TB vaccine candidate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background<break/><italic>(Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG pasteur)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WT BCG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Dr Peter Sander<break/>(Institute of Medical Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BCG Pasteur SmR</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background<break/>(recombinant BCG::iE-DAP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">rBCG::iE-DAP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">rBCG::iE-DAP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mtb H37RvS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Centre of Excellence for Biomedical TB Research (Wits University, Johannesburg)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mtb H37RvS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mtb H37Rv</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Center for Tuberculosis Research (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mtb H37Rv</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line<break/>(THP-1 monocytes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">THP-1 monocytes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Dr Janine Scholefield (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, South Africa)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cells authenticated by the supplier by morphology.<break/>Mycoplasma contamination test: negative</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">cell line<break/>(U937 promonocytes)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U937 monocytes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from Dr Janine Scholefield (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria, South Africa)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cells authenticated by the supplier by morphology.<break/>Mycoplasma contamination test: negative</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background<break/>(BALB/c mice)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BALB/c mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson laboratory (USA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BALB/cJ strain #000651</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000651">IMSR_JAX:000651</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">strain, strain background<break/>(BALB/c SCID mice)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BALB/c SCID mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson laboratory (USA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CBySmn.Cg-Prkdc<sup>scid</sup>/J strain#: 001803</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:001803">IMSR_JAX:001803</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Growth conditions for <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and derivative strains</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and derivative strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) or on Luria-Bertani agar (LA) at 37⁰C with supplementation of the media with appropriate antibiotics.

The cell lines (U937 and THP-1 monocytes) were authenticated by the manufacturer. The cell lines (U937 and THP-1 monocytes) were tested for mycoplasma contamination using the LookOut Mycoplasma PCR detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich) and both cell lines tested negative. BMDMs extracted from the bone marrow (BM) of 6–8 weeks old female wildtype BALB/c mice were cultivated in a similar manner. BMDMs were generated as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toda et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, for differentiation of BM cells into macrophages, BM cells were seeded in BMDM differentiation media (RPMI-Glutamax supplemented with 10% FBS and 10% L929-conditioned media) and differentiated for 6 days.

Briefly, U937 monocytes (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> /mL) were transferred into a 24-well plate and cells were incubated with either culture medium only as a negative control or MDP, LPS, heat killed WT BCG or heat killed rBCG::iE-DAP at 37 °C, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 24 hr. Cells were washed twice with 1 mL of warm PBS and then incubated for 2 days in RPMI with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin in the presence of 25 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (which can induce the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages). After washing twice with 1 mL of warm PBS, the differentiated macrophages were infected with Mtb H37Rv at MOI:1 and incubated for 24 hr.

Similarly, 6–8 weeks-old female BALB/c SCID mice were infected using the aerosol route as low dose aerosol infections with WT BCG lead to mouse lethality with a comparable time-to-death and offers highly uniform CFU lung implantations for each mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Um et al., 2023</xref>). The inoculum implanted in the lungs at day 1 (n = 3 mice per group) in female BALB/c mice was determined by plating the whole-lung homogenate on 7H11-selective plates containing carbenicillin (50 mg/ml), Trimethoprim (20 mg/ml), Polymyxin B (25 mg/ml) and Cycloheximide (10 mg/ml). Doxycycline was administered at determined doses for CRISPRi activation by daily oral gavage and following infection, mice lungs were harvested (n = 5 animals/group), homogenized in sterile PBS and plated on 7H11-selective plates at different dilutions. The 7H11-selective plates were incubated at 37 °C and single colonies were enumerated after 4 weeks for the 10 days aerosol infection experiment, and also after 4 weeks for the 8 weeks aerosol infection experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mouse immunization and determination of protective efficacy against Mtb infection</title><p>Animal studies were performed as per the guidelines prescribed by the animal care and use committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (protocol number: MO20M20). To test the efficacy of rBCG::iE-DAP as a vaccine candidate, BALB/c mice (n=10 per group) were immunized intradermally with 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/100 µL of WT BCG or rBCG::iE-DAP strains.

Mice were weighed every week to monitor the effect of Dox administration on the health of the mice. Mice were challenged with ~100 CFU of Mtb H37Rv strain by the aerosol route 6 weeks post immunization in a Glasscol inhalation exposure system (Glasscol). Lungs and spleens from infected animals were harvested at week 4 and week 8 post Mtb infection for analysis of lung bacterial burden by plating the whole-lung homogenate on 7H11-selective plates containing carbenicillin (50 mg/ml), Trimethoprim (20 mg/ml), Polymyxin B (25 mg/ml), and Cycloheximide (10 mg/ml) and lung pathology was assessed after hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histopathology</title><p>Half of the left lung/mouse was cut and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded, sectioned, and H&amp;E stained.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A modified BCG with depletion of enzymes associated with peptidoglycan amidation induces enhanced protection against tuberculosis in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. There are no data to show that any protection or attenuation observed is due to increased signaling through NOD-1, given how pleiotropic the knockdown effect appears to be. Without a specific assay for NOD-1 involvement in the better protection, the authors should be careful to not draw this conclusion (i.e. Line 175, etc).</p><p>2. Lines 191-192 is not supported by the data given that the differences are not significantly different.</p><p>3. Lines 179-181: &quot;At day 3 bacterial containment was observed for all strains but was most prominent for rBCG::iE-DAP strains treated with ATc.&quot;. Although the data is fairly clear (assuming this is referring to figure 2A), a statistical comparison would be helpful to support the interpretation of which strain is better controlled (and to support statement that the difference at 3 days is significant in the figure legend).</p><p>4. The authors confirm that they can induce attenuation of rBCG::iE-DAP by infecting via aerosol, but the protection experiment is done in vivo with intradermal administration. The authors could test knock down following intradermal administration because if this is not occurring efficiently it could explain the minimal significant effects in vivo.</p><p>5. Lines 250-253: This sentence does not reflect the data in the manuscript, and it is important to add more information in terms of time point and comparator. Specifically, only at a single time point is the WT BCG Dox group lower in lung weight and only compared to saline Dox. The rBCG::iE-DAP Dox group also never looks higher in lung weight, and if saline + Dox is not the comparator, what is? This also relates to Lines 257-259, where then the authors state that the lung weight is less, which is true based on their data, but contradictory to the prior statement. Then in the histology, the authors comment that there is more inflammation in the lungs of rBCG::iE-DAP Dox mice at 8 wpi, which raises the question of what the decreased lung weight is actually reflective of. In general, the biggest trend in the animal data is that the WT BCG with Dox is an outlier in terms of lower inflammation. The authors should confirm that the animal experiments were performed twice to make sure this is reproducible.</p><p>6. Lines 257- These experiments do not specifically look at dissemination to the spleen, any differences observed in the spleen may be due to reduced replication/fitness in the spleen.</p><p>7. In the Introduction the authors claim that close to 100 million infants have been vaccinated with BCG.

There is some data presented to support that the murT-gatD KD strain may be more protective in the animal model, but most comparisons made are not significant and some interpretations stated in the Results section do not reflect the data in the figures. It seems that the most important comparisons are between WT BCG+Dox and rBCG+Dox, and the manuscript would be clearer if this comparison was focused on specifically. As it is written, it is often difficult to understand what is being compared to what and for which time point, especially because the manuscript jumps around quite a bit between timepoints.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1. There is no data to show that any protection or attenuation observed is due to increased signaling through NOD-1 given how pleiotropic the knockdown effect appears to be.

The authors confirm that they can induce attenuation of rBCG::iE-DAP by infecting via aerosol, but the protection experiment is done in vivo with intradermal administration.

Lines 250-253: This sentence does not reflect the data in the manuscript, and it is important to add more information in terms of time points and comparator. Specifically, only at a single time point is the WT BCG Dox group lower in lung weight and only compared to saline Dox. The rBCG::iE-DAP Dox group also never looks higher in lung weight, and if saline + Dox is not the comparator, what is? This also relates to Lines 257-259, where then the authors state that the lung weight is less, which is true based on their data, but contradictory to the prior statement. Then in the histology, the authors comment that there is more inflammation in the lungs of rBCG::iE-DAP Dox mice at 8 wpi, which raises the question of what the decreased lung weight is actually reflective of. In general, the biggest trend in the animal data is that the WT BCG with Dox is an outlier in terms of lower inflammation.

We tried to address this by assessing expression of the genes encoding the NOD1 receptor, in macrophages, in response to exposure to our recombinant BCG compared to the parental.

These data are provided in in figure 1j and figure S6b for macrophages infected with rBCG::iE-DAP showing substantially increased NOD-1 transcription after 12 hours post infection.

The authors confirm that they can induce attenuation of rBCG::iE-DAP by infecting via aerosol, but the protection experiment is done in vivo with intradermal administration.

To best of our knowledge, such an approach is not widely used in the field as the bacteria do not necessarily remain at the vaccination site after administration. Rather they are taken up by immune cells and can traffic to other parts of the body. This is in contrast to aerosol infection where, at least early during infection, the bacteria are primarily located in the lung, prior to dissemination elsewhere. Hence, we kept the duration of this experiment very short (10 days) where measured the ability to activate the strain. To show that recombinant BCG is stable over time in mice, we performed a long-term experiment (for durations of 4 and 8 weeks, as per our challenge model) where mice were infected with the recombinant strain and bacteria sampled over time to confirm presence of the CRISPR plasmid, as measured by a reduction of colony size in the presence of DOX and the presence of CRISPR-dCAS9 as detected by PCR. The data for week 8 are given in Figure 2I and the data for 4 weeks are given in Figure S8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We are currently generating knockout mutants of MurT and confirming the genetic details of this strain which will be eligible for human use. In line 423-425, we also indicate that the CRISPRi system only allowed us to probe this pathway however the next steps would be to generate MurT knockout strains and to study the correlates of protection induced by this modified Rbcg.</p><p>NOD-1 activation during infection is necessary for induction of anti-bacterial immune responses (PMID: 17433730) and several studies have demonstrated a role for NOD-1 mediated immune responses in defense against TB infection (PMID: 29868226). Our hypothesis was that activation of NOD-1 with a modified BCG during vaccination would enhance the immunogenicity of the rBCG strain. We provide new data in Figure 1i and 1j demonstrating increased nod-1 transcription in rBCG::iE-DAP infected macrophages and In line 354-356 we further elaborate on why activation of the NOD-1 pathway with a recombinant BCG strain would be beneficial for development of anti-myobacterial immunity.</p><p>We further provide data previously left out (now Figure 3) where we tested the attenuation or virulence of rBCG::iEDAP compared to wildtype BCG in SCID mice. This data shows that in an aerosol infection model of SCID mice, rBCG::iE-DAP+DOX is similarly attenuated as WT BCG and not causing increased death of the infected SCID mice. Although 8 weeks post-infection of vaccinated WT Balb/C mice with Mtb we observed slightly increased inflammation in the lungs of rBCG::iE-DAP+DOX vaccinated mice compared to WT BCG+DOX (Figure 4C, right panel), we observed no significant difference in WT BCG without DOX. This data suggests that the observed slight increase in inflammation could be representative of immune responses that allowed for bacterial clearance as observed in Figure 4C (right section). In line 416-419, we expand on the findings of the histopathology of the mouse lungs and indicate that “Although increased inflammation could be detrimental to control of disease, it has been suggested that a balanced induction of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses is required for optimal protection against Mtb infection”.</p><p>In line 349-350, we further comment on the fact that this modification (i.e expression of the iE-DAP antigen) induces immune responses fine-tuned for a bacterial infection and as BCG possesses similar antigens to Mtb, this results in a general self-adjuvanting effect towards Mtb infection.</p><p>We do not expect MurT-GatD to be nonactive in later stages of Mtb infection. In the model organism M. smegmatis we have found that this enzyme pair is essential for viability (doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2023.1205829).</p><p>We cannot ruleout that increasing the self-adjuvancy of BCG would result in enhanced responses for other bacterial / viral infections as BCG has been shown to induce trained innate immune responses against non-specific bacterial or viral infections. However, without the evidence that rBCG::iE-DAP can induce such nonspecific immune responses we choose not to comment on this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

The TAMRA-labelling effect is rather modest or the MurT-GatD-depleted cells? How about muropeptide analyses? Can muroppetide analysis reveal changes in glutamate amidation?</p></disp-quote><p>Experiment performed and added: We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have struggled to establish an appropriate protocol for MS detection of the amide modification in mycobacterial PG. In our initial submission, we chose to use the synthetic probe (TetraFl-1 [PMID: 31487148]) to label MurT-GatD depleted cells as this is a non-invasive way to assess cell wall biochemistry. This probe has been chemically engineered to specifically interrogate the requirement for glutamate amidation at position 2 in the stem peptide. In earlier work from our lab (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1205829), we used variations of this probe where position 2 of probe was modified to carry either a glutamate or a glutamine (which carries the amine modification). Using this approach, we were able to demonstrate that only the probe carrying glutamine was incorporated into mycobacterial PG. This confirmed the requirement for amidation at position 2 (on the receiving side-chain) for PG crosslinking. Hence, we hypothesized that if this amidation modification was reduced on the receiving side chain, the PG biosynthetic machinery will become more reliant on the donor peptide (in the fluorescent probe) for crosslinking and will hence incorporate more probe. We agree that this effect was marginal. To further confirm the reduction in amidation at position 2 of the receiving stem peptide in our recombinant BCG strain, we now assess the level of PG amidation by assessing labeling with an amine reactive dye. We previously demonstrated (https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1205829) that it reports on the level of PG amidation in bacteria. Labeling of PG extracted from WT BCG vs PG extracted from MurT-GatD depleted rBCG::iE-DAP revealed reduced labelling of the rBCG, thus confirming reduced amidation (see figure S5). These data are now reported in lines 175-178.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed.
