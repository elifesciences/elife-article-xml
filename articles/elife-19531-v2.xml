This triggers a sophisticated suite of defenses in the plant that can either deter feeding by the insects, or help the plants endure the attack. The elicitors stimulate the rapid accumulation of a plant hormone called jasmonic acid, which in turn activates the defense responses. However, high levels of jasmonic acid can also reduce the ability of the plants to survive and reproduce by activating plant defenses when they are not needed. Therefore, plants need to regulate the signaling networks that control defense so that jasmonic acid only accumulates when the benefit of fighting the insect outweighs the cost of producing the defenses.</p><p>The costs and benefits of defense responses vary among different insects and environmental conditions, which has made it difficult to study how plants regulate defense signaling networks. To address this question, Zhou et al. investigated the activities of genes in six species of tobacco plant after they have been exposed to different insect elicitors.</p><p>The experiments identified a network of genes that is activated in response to elicitors and acts largely independent of jasmonic acid signaling. A newly identified gene in this network called NaLRRK1 and jasmonic acid suppress each other, suggesting that NaLRRK1 helps to regulate jasmonic acid levels. Further analysis shows that a process called genome duplication, in which all the genes in an organism are copied, has shaped the evolution of early defense signaling in <italic>Nicotiana.</italic> Many of the duplicated genes have adopted new roles and been retained in the plants. This highlights the importance of genome duplications in helping plants to adapt to their environment.</p><p>The next challenge following on from this work would be to identify what specific roles these genes play in the plants, and how they affect the ability of plants to survive insect attacks in their native habitats.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19531.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19531.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Nicotiana</italic></kwd><kwd>herbivore-induced defense</kwd><kwd>genome duplication</kwd><kwd>jasmonic acid</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PEBZP3-142886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shuqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>328935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shuqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Wenwu</given-names></name><name><surname>Brockmöller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Ling</surname><given-names>Zhihao</given-names></name><name><surname>Omdahl</surname><given-names>Ashton</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldwin</surname><given-names>Ian T</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shuqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sutter-Stötner-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shuqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals the molecular basis and evolution of herbivore-associated early defense signaling in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Induced defense is widespread in plants and can improve the fitness of plants under herbivore attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kessler et al., 2004</xref>). Many plants recognize and distinguish the damage caused by feeding insects from mechanical damage by perceiving herbivore-associated elicitors (HAE) to induce rapid early defense signaling (EDS) that includes the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivatives, phytohormones that play a central role in the activation of induced defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Howe and Jander, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). Increases or decreases in leaf JA concentrations can directly activate or impair induced anti-herbivore defenses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farmer and Ryan, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kessler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>), highlighting the importance of JA accumulation for induced defenses. However, increased JA levels can also reduce plant fitness due to the physiological and ecological costs of defense elicitation when defenses are not needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldwin and Hamilton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glawe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heil and Baldwin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van Dam and Baldwin, 1998</xref>). For example, in <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic>, an increase in endogenous JA levels by supplying methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA) reduced plant fitness by 26% when plants were protected from herbivore attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin, 1998</xref>). Thus induced JA accumulations can result in net fitness gains or losses depending on the cost/benefit ratio of induced defenses, which varies among attacking herbivore species and environmental conditions. Therefore, a robust and complex signaling network that regulates and fine-tunes induced JA biosynthesis, metabolism and JA-dependent induced downstream defenses is essential for plants to realize their fitness optima.</p><p>Using reverse genetics, such as RNA-inference (RNAi) and virus induced gene silencing (VIGS), several genes that are rapidly induced by HAE were found to regulate JA biosynthesis and metabolism in plants, particularly in the wild tobacco <italic>Nicotiana attenuata</italic> which has been established as an ecological model system for plant-herbivore interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). The HAE-regulated signaling network includes: protein kinases, such as the wounding induced protein kinase (<italic>NaWIPK</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2007</xref>) and calcium-dependent protein kinases (<italic>NaCDPK4/5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), which positively and negatively regulate HAE-induced JA accumulations, respectively; transcription factors, such as <italic>NaWRKY3/6</italic>, which positively regulate HAE-induced JA accumulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Skibbe et al., 2008</xref>); and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and perception genes (<italic>NaETR1, NaACO</italic> and <italic>NaACS</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">von Dahl et al., 2007</xref>), which crosstalk with JA-regulated downstream defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Onkokesung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Voelckel et al., 2001</xref>), such as nicotine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shoji et al., 2000</xref>). While these studies have provided mechanistic insights into induced defenses, they also revealed the complexity of the HAE-induced EDS network. A systematic investigation of its complete genetic architecture is essential to understanding the molecular mechanisms and evolution of HAE-induced EDS.</p><p>Gene duplications play a key role in network evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pastor-Satorras et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teichmann and Babu, 2004</xref>). Duplicated genes can either be retained in the same network to increase network complexity and robustness or evolve to function in new networks through subfunctionalization and/or neofunctionalization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duarte et al., 2006</xref>) that can be detected from changes in the spatiotemporal expression or protein interaction patterns of the duplicated genes. Although both gene expression and protein-protein interaction divergences between duplicated genes increase over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping, 2011</xref>), several factors, such as the type of duplication and the functionality of the genes, affect the rate and extent of those divergences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rizzon et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, expression divergences between duplicated genes involved in stress responses tend to be greater than those of duplicated genes involved in developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ha et al., 2007</xref>). While studies based on the analysis of gene ontologies and genome-wide duplications suggest that linage-specific duplication (LD) followed by expression divergence are important for the evolution of stress responses in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rizzon et al., 2006</xref>), whole genome duplications (WGD) events, which are prominent in the plant kingdom, provide a major source of duplicated genes and contribute significantly to the evolution of cellular networks, such as gene regulatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blanc and Wolfe, 2004</xref>), protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping, 2011</xref>) and metabolic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gachon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hofberger et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, duplicated copies from WGD events are more likely to be retained in a network than those from LD, especially for genes that are dosage-sensitive, such as transcription factors, and protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birchler and Veitia, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casneuf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edger and Pires, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeling, 2009</xref>). However, the relative contribution of WGD and LD to the evolution of HAE-induced EDS networks and the patterns of expression divergence between duplicated genes in these networks have not been studied.</p><p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms and evolution of HAE-induced EDS requires the identification of the genome-wide HAE-induced EDS networks. Because functionally related genes tend to be transcriptionally coordinated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Persson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stuart et al., 2003</xref>), co-expression network analysis has been widely used to infer the function of genes and uncover biological pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Usadel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yonekura-Sakakibara et al., 2008</xref>). Distinct from ‘classical’ gene expression analysis using genome-wide expression profiling of control and treated samples to identify ‘up’ or ‘down’ regulated genes, co-expression network analysis uses expression measurements from a large number of samples that vary in their genotype, treatment, tissue or sampling time to enhance the statistical power of the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>). However, due to the high specificity among tissues and treatments and the speed of the HAE-elicited responses (within 30 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gulati et al., 2014</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), the general co-expression network approach that uses gene expression data from different tissues or time course experiments are not particularly useful. One solution to overcome this specificity issue is to use natural variation, such as occurs amongst closely related species or different genotypes within species, to identify co-expressed gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ardlie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delker et al., 2010</xref>). In the identification of HAE-induced EDS networks, the comparison of closely related species has at least two advantages over the use of different genotypes within a species: (1) their greater genetic and phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) which increases the power of detecting co-expressed genes; (2) their divergence times are over several millions of years which allows for the identification of evolutionarily conserved co-expression networks that are likely functionally important.</p><p>Closely-related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species within the clade of <italic>Petunioides</italic> show highly specific HAE-induced defenses and thus provide an ideal system for identifying HAE-induced EDS networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous study revealed that a single HAE, such as the fatty acid-amino acid conjugate C18:3-Glu (FAC) – the most active elicitor found in the oral secretions of the Solanaceae specialist herbivore <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (OS<italic><sub>Ms</sub></italic>) larvae – elicits diverse defense responses among closely related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species when added to standardized puncture wounds. In addition, a single <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species, such as <italic>N. pauciflora,</italic> showed distinct defense responses to the FAC, OS<italic><sub>Ms</sub></italic> and oral secretions from the generalist herbivore <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (OS<italic><sub>Sl</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Here we sequenced the leaf transcriptomes of six closely-related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species from the <italic>Petunioides</italic> clade (<italic>N. obtusifolia, N. linearis, N. acuminata, N. pauciflora, N. miersii</italic> and <italic>N. attenuata</italic>) that had been induced by three different HAEs or simply wounded (induced by wounding plus water) to characterize the HAE-induced EDS networks in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. We compared HAE-induced transcriptomic responses among the six species and identified a co-expression gene network that represents the HAE-induced EDS in <italic>Nicotiana</italic> based on three independent lines of evidence: (1) the induction of the network correlates with variation in JA accumulations both among species treated with the same HAE and within species treated with different HAEs; (2) the induction of genes in this network that are largely not dependent on induced JA accumulations; (3) the consequences of silencing a hub gene in this network for HAE-induced JA metabolism and defenses. Analysis of the evolutionary history of all genes in the EDS network revealed that preferential gene retention after the Solanaceae whole genome triplication (WGT) event shaped the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FAC-induced early leaf transcriptomic responses are highly variable among closely related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species</title><p>Closely related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species showed highly divergent early transcriptomic responses within 30 min of FAC elicitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), consistent with observations from metabolomic and insect performance studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Two species, <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> and <italic>N. miersii</italic>, which did not respond to FAC-treatments by amplifying their wound-induced accumulations of jasmonic acid (JA) within 2 hr, showed overall little induced transcriptomic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the other four species, FAC elicitation induced both high levels of JA and significant transcriptomic changes. The variation in FAC-induced transcriptomic responses largely resulted from the up-regulation of genes. Among all the species, FAC elicitation up-regulated more genes (1149.3 ± 667.8; mean ± standard deviation) than it down-regulated (353.2 ± 278.9). To validate the expression changes observed from the RNA-seq analysis, we quantified the transcript abundance of 12 <italic>N. attenuata</italic> genes that were found to be up-regulated by FAC using qPCR. Although two genes only showed marginally significant increases in their transcript levels (p=0.08, likely due to their large variation in expression among replicates), all 12 genes showed consistent FAC-induced up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting an overall high reliability of the RNA-seq results. Interestingly, despite the large variation in FAC-induced transcriptomic responses among the species, 34 genes were induced by FAC in all six species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) which likely represent the conserved FAC-induced stress response genes. Among them, eight are transcription factors from the WRKY (3), AP2/ERF (2) TT2 (1) and PLATZ (1) families, and two are E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase-like proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Taken together, the data suggest that while the induction of only a few genes are conserved after FAC elicitation, the overall FAC-induced early transcriptomic responses are highly variable among closely related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19531.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FAC elicits divergent transcriptome responses among closely related <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) FAC-induced JA responses among six <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species.

We identified FAC-induced gene co-expression networks using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method (see details in Materials and Methods). In total, five gene modules (M1-M5) were identified using control (wounding + water) and FAC-induced gene expression profiles from all six species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Among these five modules, module M4 showed the highest correlation with HAE-induced JA accumulations, a marker of induced defense signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In all four species that showed FAC-induced JA accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), the majority of M4 module genes were also significantly induced by FAC (p&lt;0.05 and fold change greater than 1.5, exact negative binomial test). In contrast, in the two species, <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> and <italic>N. miersii</italic>, which did not show FAC-induced JA accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), less than 22% of the M4 module genes were induced. The intra-modular connectivity of the M4 module, a parameter that indicates the degree of co-expression among 3genes in a network, was significantly higher in FAC-induced samples than in control samples (p=0.0002, Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test), consistent with the observation that FAC elicits co-expression among genes in the M4 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Furthermore, the expression kinetic analysis of the M4 module genes using a previously published microarray dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) revealed that most of the M4 module genes were largely transiently expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) after HAE-elicitation.

The expression of <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> was co-upregulated with induced JA signaling among the six <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Measuring <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> transcripts in leaves treated with different HAEs and one pathogen-associated elicitor, flg22, revealed that <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> is specifically induced by HAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). We investigated whether HAE-induced JA signaling regulates the expression of <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> using two different jasmonate deficient transgenic plants, in which steps in JA signaling and perception were individually silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Consistent with the microarray results, <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> was still significantly induced by FAC 30 min after elicitation in both of the JA-signaling deficient genotypes, revealing that JA is not required for the up-regulation of <italic>NaLRRK1</italic>. Interestingly, compared to WT plants at 1 hr, <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> transcript levels were higher in <italic>irAOC</italic> plants – in which JA-Ile levels remain at basal levels - but were lower in <italic>irCOI</italic> plants, in which JA-Ile levels are constitutively high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paschold et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e and f</xref>). This indicates that JA-Ile levels may suppress the accumulation of <italic>NaLRRK1 </italic>transcripts. To test this hypothesis, we compared <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> transcript accumulations in leaves in which the levels of JA-Ile were elevated by adding different amounts of JA-Ile to wounded leaves together with FAC. The results revealed that increased JA-Ile levels indeed decreased the levels of <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). Furthermore, in the transgenic plants 35S-<italic>jmt</italic>/ir-<italic>mje</italic>, in which endogenous JA levels are redirected to MeJA resulting in lower levels of induced JA-Ile and abrogated JA-signaling compared to WT plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stitz et al., 2011</xref>), HAE-induced <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> transcript accumulation was higher than in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For this, we first analyzed the most recent duplication event for each <italic>N. attenuata</italic> gene using the species reconciliation approach (Materials and Methods). Among all M4 module genes, 79.5% were retained in the genome of <italic>Nicotiana</italic> and <italic>Solanum</italic> after at least one round of duplication since the divergence of eudicots from monocots; this percentage retention is significantly higher than the genome-wide average (odd ratio = 1.96, p&lt;2.2E-16, exact binomial test, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that gene duplications played a significant role in the evolution of the HAE-induced EDS network. Because Solanaceae taxa experienced a whole genome triplication (WGT) event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sato et al., 2012</xref>), we compared the contributions of the Solanaceae WGT event with <italic>Nicotiana</italic>-specific lineage duplications (LD) to the evolution of the M4 module genes. A majority of the most recent duplication events of the M4 module genes occurred in the Solanaceae branch (51.5%), likely due to the WGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sato et al., 2012</xref>). This percentage is significantly higher than the genome-wide average (odd ratio = 1.46, p=1.79E-10, exact binomial test, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Because our phylogenomic approach can not specifically distinguish the ancient segmental duplications from the WGT events, we further identified a subset of genes that is located in the syntenic blocks that resulted from the Solanaceae WGT. These genes are consistently significantly enriched in the EDS network (odd ratio = 1.40, p=2.4E-7). In contrast, only ~8.0% of the genes originated from <italic>Nicotiana</italic> lineage species duplications, which is not different from the genome-wide level (odd ratio=0.84, p=0.12, exact binomial test, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

Because the complete EDS network before the Solanaceae WGT is unknown, it is difficult to directly test the preferential gene retention hypothesis. Instead, we examined a prediction that would result from the preferential gene retention scenario: for a given gene pair, the observed number of gene pairs that are both found in the EDS is higher than the number of two genes found in the EDS by chance. To test this prediction, we identified a subset of gene pairs (4292 pairs including 8584 genes) that resulted from the Solanaceae WGT (duplications on the Solanaceae branch) in which at least two of the three original copies were retained in the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> genome and expressed in leaves. Because both members of these gene pairs were both retained in the genome, we specifically examined the process of preferential gene recruitment to the M4 module.

This is significantly higher than the expected number from the null model which assumes independent recruitment of two duplicated copies in the M4 module (p&lt;2.2E-16, χ<sup>2</sup><sub>-</sub>test), consistent with the prediction that duplicated genes were preferentially retained in the M4 module.

Therefore HAE-induced early defenses signaling that allows a plant to distinguish herbivore attack from wounding plays an important role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonaventure et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Howe and Jander, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). However, identifying herbivore induced EDS is challenging, due to its specificity among different tissues, time points, treatments and overall complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Howe and Jander, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). In this study, we took a novel comparative transcriptomic and co-expression network analysis approach using the leaf transcriptome data from six closely related species that were treated with different HAE, which resulted in the identification of a co-expression network that represents the HAE-induced EDS in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. This approach assumes that if two genes are functionally connected (co-expressed), the expression changes of one gene will also affect the other one during evolution, thus increasing the statistical power for detecting co-expressed gene modules. Although this assumption cannot be applied to species specific co-expression modules, it can be used to identify gene co-expression modules that are conserved among the studied species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), which likely are functionally important.</p><p>Using comparative transcriptomic and network analysis, we identified a co-expressed gene network (module M4), in which 782 genes represent the conserved HAE-induced EDS in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. Large numbers of transcription factors and protein kinases were found in this network, suggesting rapid transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations induced by HAE, which then likely led to the re-configuration of whole-plant metabolism to allow for the production of defense responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gulati et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, among these 782 genes in the HAE-induced EDS, of which only 28.2% and 11.7% in <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> and <italic>N. miersii</italic> were elicited by FAC, respectively, at least 67.6% were induced by OS<italic><sub>Sl</sub></italic> in each of these two species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results suggest that the signaling network, while not elicited by FAC, remains intact in these two species, likely due to changes in FAC-perception. These results are also consistent with the analysis of module conservation which suggested that the M4 module is highly conserved among different <italic>Nicotiana</italic> species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Molecular signaling cascades often involve negative and positive feedback loops and form circuits. The M4 module is always co-activated and likely upstream or parallel to the activation of JA signaling, indicating that M4 module and JA signaling are likely involved in such circuits. We found <italic>NaLRRK1</italic>, a FAC-induced hub gene from the M4 module, and jasmonate signaling form negative feedback loops and are co-activated by HAE elicitation among different species that diverged several millions of years ago. The conserved co-activation between jasmonate signaling and <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> by HAE and its negative effect on insect performance suggests that the identified feedback loops are important for plant fitness in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. Although increased expression of <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> after HAE elicitation may lower anti-herbivore defenses, it may increase the net fitness by reducing fitness costs associated with induced jasmonate signaling, such as the changes in primary metabolites that are important for a plant’s tolerance of tissue removal and regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Machado et al., 2013b</xref>). Clearly more components are involved in the <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> and jasmonate signaling negative feedback loops, such as transcription factors and other protein kinases, which are also likely present in the M4 modules. Future molecular studies that identify direct interacting components with <italic>NaLRRK1</italic> will shed light on the mechanisms of the <italic>NaLRRK1-</italic> JA feedback loops. The challenge will be to quantitatively analyze both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of candidate genes at different time points after elicitation, since their interactions might be highly specific.</p><p>Analyzing the gene duplication history of the genes in the M4 module suggested that preferential gene retention after the WGT shared among <italic>Nicotiana spp.</italic> and <italic>Solanum spp.</italic> likely have contributed to the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>. We found that more than 30.8% of duplicated pairs that resulted from the Solanaceae WGT, of which both copies were retained in the M4 module, are either transcription factors or protein kinases. This proportion is significantly higher than by chance (p&lt;2.2E-16), consistent with the dosage compensation hypothesis, which predicts that dosage-sensitive genes, of which transcription factors and protein kinases are examples, are more likely to be retained in the signaling network after genome-wide duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edger and Pires, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Freeling, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hakes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maere et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wapinski et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Duplicated genes retained in the same network were often considered as evidence of functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Veron et al., 2007</xref>); however, genetic redundancy is often evolutionarily unstable and is unlikely to be maintained over long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</xref>). The Solanaceae WGT event can be dated to 91–52 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sato et al., 2012</xref>), yet many of the duplicated gene pairs remain co-expressed after HAE-elicitation. This suggests that retaining these duplicated copies in the same network has been beneficial to plants, likely as a result of increased network complexity and robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Smet and Van de Peer, 2012</xref>). This is consistent with the results of studies on examining the function of <italic>NaCDPK4/5</italic> and <italic>NaJAR4/6</italic> by simultaneously silencing either member of both copies in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). When <italic>NaCDPK4</italic> and <italic>NaCDPK5</italic> were individually silenced, HAE-induced JA accumulations were not affected; silencing both copies increased JA accumulation upwards of 3-fold, which resulted in significant negative fitness effects when plants were not attacked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, retaining both <italic>NaCDPK4</italic> and <italic>NaCDPK5</italic> in the network may increase the robustness against the negative fitness effects resulted from null mutations in the gene itself or its regulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, the duplicated gene pair, <italic>NaJAR4/6</italic>, which catalyzes the formation of JA-Ile, showed additive effects on HAE-induced JA-Ile accumulations, since silencing each individual copy both resulted in reduced JA-Ile levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Staswick et al., 2002</xref>) and reductions in the activation of downstream defense responses. Thus, retaining both copies in the network resulted in higher level of HAE-induced JA-Ile and defense responses.</p><p>In addition to gene duplications, expansions of transposable elements (TEs) can also contribute to the evolution of induced signaling networks. For example, in rice, the <italic>mPing</italic>, a miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITE) family, rapidly expanded in specific strains and its insertions into the 5’ flanking region rendered adjacent genes inducible by abiotic stresses by introducing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and/or epigenetic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Naito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yasuda et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, we observed that insertions of the DTT-NIC1, a Solanaceae specific MITEs family that contains a stress inducible <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element, the W-box, into 5’ regulatory regions of genes are significantly enriched among genes of the HAE-induced EDS network in <italic>Nicotiana (</italic>p=0.00049, Appendix 1). We speculate that the genome-wide expansions of DTT-NIC1 may have facilitated gene recruitment into the <italic>Nicotiana</italic> EDS network by introducing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements into the 5’ flanking regions of <italic>Nicotiana</italic> genes. However, several other mechanisms could also result in the same observation; for example, biotic stresses may mobilize TEs, which are more likely to insert into genes with open chromatin under stressed conditions. Future studies that measure the contribution of DTT-NIC1 insertions in the inducibility of the identified EDS genes by manipulating the DTT-NIC1 insertions sites are needed to examine these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection and RNA-sequencing</title><p>Plant material was collected as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).

In brief, fragments of ~300 bp of target genes were amplified by PCR with primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>. PCR fragments were recovered by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using a gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and subsequently digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and <italic>Sal</italic>I and inserted into plasmid, pTV00 (RNA1). After sequencing to validate the constructs, pTV-fragment-VIGS constructs and pTV00 (empty vector), together with RNA2, were transformed into <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> for the VIGS procedure.</p><p>At 21 days after <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> inoculation, rosette-stage plants were wounded with a pattern wheel and 20 μL of 1:5 diluted FAC (138 ng μL<sup>−1</sup> C18:3-Glu before dilution) or water was added to the puncture wounds. All samples were collected at 1 hr after elicitation with mid-veins excised, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until analysis. Silencing efficiency was quantified by qPCR. Overall, more than 88% of the target transcripts were silenced by VIGS.</p><p>Phytohormones were analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, ~100 mg frozen leaf was homogenized in a Genogrinder with 0.8 mL ethylacetate spiked with [9,10-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>]-dihydro-JA and [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-JA-Ile. Homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4°C and the organic phase was collected and evaporated to dryness, which were subsequently reconstituted in 300 mL of 70% (v/v) methanol/water for analysis on an advance UPLC (Bruker), equipped with column ZORBAX eclipse XDB (Agilent) and quantified on an EVOQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Bruker) using the MRM transitions described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schäfer et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Secondary metabolites analysis and bioassay in VIGS plants</title><p>To quantify secondary metabolites that were known to function defensively in <italic>N. attenuata</italic>, leaves of VIGS-EV and VIGS-<italic>NaLRRK1</italic> (n=8) plants were treated with W+FAC for 24 hr, harvested and ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis.</p><p>Trypsin proteinase inhibitor (TPI) assay was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van Dam et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, 100 mg of ground powder (n=6) was extracted in a protein extraction buffer.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Machado et al., 2013a</xref>). Briefly, soluble sugars were extracted from plant tissue (n=6) using 80% (v/v) ethanol, followed by an incubation step (20 min at 80°C). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (15 min, 11,000 g, °C). Pellets were re-extracted twice with 50% (v/v) ethanol. Supernatants from all extraction steps were pooled and enzymatically quantified for sucrose, glucose and fructose. The remaining pellets were used for an enzymatic determination of starch.</p><p>To evaluate the performance of the specialist herbivore <italic>M. sexta</italic> on transformed plants, neonates were allowed to feed on EV and transformed plants (n=28) and their masses were measured at 0, 6, 10 and 14 d after transfer to experimental plants. To ensure that all larvae were at a similar developmental stage and had similar body mass at the start of the bioassay, newly hatched neonates were placed on untreated WT leaves for 48 hr and weighed. The neonates with similar size were selected for the bioassays.</p><p>35S-<italic>jmt/ir-mje: N. attenuata</italic> transgenic plants ectopically expressing <italic>Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) jasmonic acid O-methyltransferase (35S-<italic>jmt</italic>) and with <italic>N. attenuata</italic> methyl jasmonate esterase silenced with RNAi.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank T Krügel and the glasshouse team of the MPICOE for taking care of plants, P Langfelder for suggestions on data analysis, S Pottinger for help with sample collections, VIGS experiments and measure gene expression with qPCR, M Schäfer and M Kallenbach for setting up methods for the phytohormone analysis, R Li for helping with the cellular localization experiments and K Gase for helping with the RNA-seq data submission to NCBI.

To examine this potential mechanism, we performed de novo identifications of enriched transcription factor binding motifs from regulatory regions among HAE-induced EDS genes. Within the 1kb upstream region sequences, seven significantly enriched motifs (p&lt;1E-10) were found among the M4 module genes in comparison to the genome-wide background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). Among them, two W-box motifs (W-box1: AGTCAACG and W-box2: TTGACCWT) were the most statistically significant. These conserved motifs are known to be bound by WRKY transcription factors that are induced by biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). W-box1 and W-box2 box were found in the 1kb upstream regions of more than 60.5% and 69.0% of M4 module genes, respectively. A similar pattern was also found for the EDS genes that were induced by FAC in all three FAC-responding species.</p><p>Interestingly, at the genome-wide level, the distribution of the W-box1 motif in the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> genome is significantly associated with the insertions of DTT-NIC1 (p&lt;0.001, based on 1000 permutation test). Analyzing the consensus sequence of the DTT-NIC1 in <italic>N. attenuata</italic> also showed that DTT-NIC1 contains the W-box1 motif. Further comparisons of insertion sites of DTT-NIC1 and motif locations in the 1kb upstream region of <italic>N. attenuata</italic> HAE-induced EDS genes revealed that at least 44.4% of the DTT-NIC1 insertions introduced W-box1 to the regulatory region of adjacent genes. These results suggest that DTT-NIC1 mediated W-box insertions into the regulatory region of genes might have contributed to the recruitment of genes to the HAE-induced EDS network in <italic>Nicotiana</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s26"><title>Method</title><p>We performed <italic>de novo</italic> motif identification using HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>), which identifies motifs that are significantly enriched in the test dataset in comparison to background datasets. The genes from the M4 module and leaf expressed genes that were not involved in the M4 module were used as positive and negative datasets, respectively. To reduce false positives, we performed additional analysis by identifying enriched motifs from 100 randomly selected subsets of genes from the negative dataset. These were then compared with the enriched motifs in the M4 module. We considered all of the enriched motifs from the M4 module that occurred in more than 5% of motifs identified from the random selected dataset as noise and removed them from downstream analysis. Using this approach, we identified seven 8 bp motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="A1-tbl2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>) that are significantly enriched in the regulatory region of M4 genes (p&lt;1e-10). The presence and absence of the identified W-box motif in the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> genome were analyzed using the ‘scanMotifGenomeWide’ function from the HOMER package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Insertions sites of DTT-NIC1 to the regulatory region of genes were identified as described in (Xu et al, submitted). In brief, using all of the MITE consensus sequences as a library, we searched the 1kp upstream region of genes with RepeatMasker. The parameters '-nolow -no_is -s -cutoff 250' were used. The enrichment analysis of MITEs in 1kb upstream region of M4 module genes and associations between the MITEs and identified motifs were analyzed using permutation tests. For this, we randomly shuffled the insertion sites of MITEs 1000 times using the ‘shuffle’ function from the BEDTOOLS package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). We then calculated the null models of MITEs insertion sites and overlaps between MITEs insertions and motif locations in the <italic>N. attenuata</italic> genome. These null models were then used to determine the enrichment significance of observed insertions of MITEs families in the 1 kb upstream region of M4 module genes as well as observed associations between locations of MITEs families and motifs.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19531.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bohlmann</surname><given-names>Joerg</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff id="aff4"><institution>University of British Columbia</institution>, <country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

The authors use a comparative approach to identify well-conserved expression networks by examining expression patterns in multiple related Nicotiana species. The advantage of this approach is that it makes it possible to remove a great deal of noise. The authors demonstrate that one module, M4, is both highly conserved and is induced prior to JA induction. They also show that genes recruited to this module are much more likely to be retained following an ancient whole genome triplication in the Solanaceae, and are more likely to be associated with insertions of a particular transposable element in the region upstream of the gene. Overall, the expression analysis, along with associated hypothesis testing is impressive.</p><p>The reviewers were concerned with the analysis of duplicate genes and transposon insertions. While the first section of the paper represented a concise and carefully constructed set of experiments, the second section was far more speculative, somewhat internally contradictory and sometimes appeared to confuse correlation with causation. It read as if two very different papers had been combined into a single manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found weaknesses with the interpretation of the TE analysis, especially on a gene-by-gene basis, although the correlation claim is relatively reliable on a genome-wide scale. Specifically, the causation claim seemed questionable. While targeted intervention experiments, such as removal/addition of a TE to could show the regulatory effect, such intervention experiments are unlikely to be feasible in a reasonable timescale. Another alternative would be natural variation between lines or closely related species, showing altered expression associated with the presence/absence of TEs, but this would require high quality genome sequences of suitable relatives, and these resources which may not exist.</p><p>The reviewers and editor recommend removal of the last Results section dealing with the TE analysis, and recommend that the authors paraphrase some of these results as speculation in the Discussion, along with the appropriate revision of title, Abstract etc.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19531.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers were concerned with the analysis of duplicate genes and transposon insertions.
