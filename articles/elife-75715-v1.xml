This is particularly well illustrated with the RAS family of small GTPases, comprised of KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS. Focusing on KRAS, the most commonly mutated of the three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prior et al., 2020</xref>), single-point mutations at one of three hotpot positions (G12, G13, and Q61) result in six possible substitutions that inhibit the intrinsic or extrinsic GTPase activity of the protein. These mutations render KRAS constitutively GTP-bound and active, which is well known to be oncogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>). Although this amounts to 18 possible oncogenic mutations, specific subsets tend to be found in different cancer types. For example, the most common oncogenic KRAS mutation is G12C in non-small cell lung cancer but Q61H in plasma cell myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prior et al., 2020</xref>). Mice similarly exhibit a bias of specific oncogenic Kras mutations towards different cancer types as different mutant <italic>Kras</italic> alleles have different tumorigenic potential when activated in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poulin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zafra et al., 2020</xref>). Different oncogenic mutations also affect the ability of Nras to induce tumorigenesis in mice, as do the same mutations in different RAS isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haigis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy et al., 2022</xref>). While this tissue ‘tropism’ of cancers towards specific RAS mutations has been appreciated for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bos, 1989</xref>), the underlying mechanism is unclear.</p><p>Variation in the ability of specific KRAS mutants to be tumorigenic (or not) in different tissues ostensibly results from differences in oncogenic signaling between mutants and the response of normal cells thereof. Generally speaking, oncogenic signaling is a product of the amplitude of the signal (quantitative signaling) and/or the pathways engaged (qualitative signaling). In terms of quantitative signaling, different mutations can exhibit different degrees of activation (GTP-loading) and/or different sensitivities to positive (Ras GTP exchange factors [RasGEFs]) or negative (RAS GTPase activating proteins [RasGAPs]) regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gebregiworgis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Munoz-Maldonado et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>). Various methods to manipulate quantitative Kras signaling, such as through modulating recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2021</xref>), homozygous expression of the mutant allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), changing codon usage to increase protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pershing et al., 2015</xref>), additional pharmacological activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cicchini et al., 2017</xref>), and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>), all affect tumorigenesis. On the other hand, perhaps one of the best examples of qualitative differences in KRAS signaling is the G12R mutant. Unlike the more canonical G12D mutation, the G12R mutant exhibits reduced the RAS effector PI3Kα binding and PI3K/AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hobbs et al., 2020</xref>). Activating an inducible <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12R</sup></italic> allele in the pancreas led to fewer early premalignant lesions compared to the much more tumorigenic <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zafra et al., 2020</xref>). Despite an appreciation that different KRAS mutations can manifest in quantitative or qualitative signaling differences, how each contributes to the mutational patterns of this oncogene in cancer is unclear.</p><p>KRAS mutations are often initiating, being sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in mice and truncal in many human cancers. Thus, the bias of specific cancers towards distinct KRAS mutations could arise from potential tissue-specific differences of normal cells in the mutagenic process or repair capacity and/or in their responses to the nature of the signaling imparted by specific KRAS mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In regard to the latter, determining the immediate response of normal cells to different KRAS mutations in vivo may help elucidate the mutational patterning of this oncogene. Identifying an oncogenic mutation arising in the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene from the cell-of-origin prior to becoming a tumor is challenging in humans. Mice, on the other hand, provide an ideal model system to experimentally explore this phenomenon as the point of tumor initiation can be precisely defined using inducible oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> alleles. To therefore explore why different cancer types have a bias towards specific KRAS mutations, we created four novel inducible murine <italic>Kras</italic> alleles with different oncogenic mutations that were expressed at either low or high levels. In this way, we hypothesize that tissues in which tumor initiation is driven by the level of oncogenic signaling would preferentially develop tumors at higher protein levels while those driven by a specific mutant would preferentially develop tumors with just one of the two mutants.</p><p>We chose two completely different oncogenic mutations for these alleles, G12D and Q61R. G12D places a negatively-charged headgroup into the catalytic cleft of RAS and blocks extrinsic (RasGAP-mediated) GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, Q61R replaces the catalytic amino acid with one that has a positively-charged headgroup, disrupting the position of the active site water molecule necessary for intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buhrman et al., 2010</xref>). Q61 is also essential for extrinsic GTP hydrolysis, as it stabilizes the transition state via hydrogen bonds to the γ-phosphate and nucleophilic water while providing another hydrogen bond to the RasGAP arginine finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grigorenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kötting et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rabara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scheffzek et al., 1997</xref>). Comparing these two mutants directly reveals Q61R to have significantly lower GTP exchange and hydrolysis rates than G12D in Nras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burd et al., 2014</xref>) and reduced RasGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis rates in Kras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rabara et al., 2019</xref>), akin to other substitutions at these two positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gebregiworgis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In those few cases in which the tumorigenic potential of the G12D and Q61R mutants of the same Ras isoform has been directly compared in mice, tissue-specific expression of the G12D mutant was less oncogenic than Q61R in both Nras-induced melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burd et al., 2014</xref>) and Kras-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To alter the expression of these two mutants, the first three coding exons of <italic>Kras</italic> were fused and encoded by either their native rare codons, which is known to retard Kras protein expression, or common codons to increase Kras protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pershing et al., 2015</xref>). We chose the novel approach of altering mammalian codon usage to modulate protein expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Counter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pershing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasine et al., 2018</xref>) as no additional elements are required to change protein levels, providing a simple, reproducible, and uniform way of modulating <italic>Kras</italic> levels in mice and derived cell lines.</p><p>These four alleles were activated and immediately thereafter the in vivo transcriptome was determined in the lungs. This revealed that while these four alleles certainly shared similarities, each also induced unique transcriptional responses. Increased expression shifted the transcriptional hallmarks from those indicative of an expansion of multipotent cells to that of hyperproliferation and oncogenic stress. Changing the mutation type shifted the hallmark of estrogen response in the G12D mutant to that of the p53 pathway and DNA repair in the Q61R mutant. All four alleles were then globally activated, revealing that hematolymphopoietic lesions were permissive to the level of active oncoprotein, squamous tumors were preferentially permissive to the G12D mutant, while carcinomas tended to be permissive to both these changes. These findings support tissue-specific responses to the degree and type of signaling imparted by different oncogenic mutations molds the tissue tropism of cancers towards specific oncogenic KRAS mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A panel of <bold>inducible oncogenic</bold> <italic>Kras</italic> alleles designed to separate the effects of mutation type from the activity level of the oncoprotein</title><p>To explore how specific cancers are driven by distinct KRAS mutations, we reasoned that effects unique to a mutation could be separated from those imparted by activation level by simply comparing two different oncogenic mutants expressed at high or low levels.

We identified similar expression patterns to the transcriptome signature in the hallmarks of TNFα Signaling via NFκβ and Interferon-γ, which increase with Kras activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>), and EMT and Myogenesis, as these hallmarks were enriched in G12D mutants but depleted in Q61R mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>To probe these transcriptomes for evidence of an orchestrated response of normal cells to different Kras mutants, we repeated transcriptome analysis of lung tissue on the two extreme cases, namely, <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> versus <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> (GSE181627).

Namely, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) hallmarks indicative of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT, TGFβ Signaling, Wnt/βcatenin Signaling, Notch Signaling, Apical Junction, Apical Surface, and Estrogen Response Early) and multiple cell lineages (Adipogenesis, Myogenesis, Hedgehog Signaling, and Pancreas β Cells). Conversely, activation of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele had all features of a potent oncogenic signaling leading to hyperproliferation and oncogenic-induced stress. Namely, GSEA hallmarks indicative of high oncogenic signaling (KRAS Signaling UP) and unrestrained proliferation (MYC Targets V1, and E2F Targets), leading to reactive oxygen species (Oxidative Phosphorylation, and Reactive Oxygen Species Pathway) and a DNA damage response (DNA Repair, P53 Pathway, and G2M Checkpoint) followed by apoptosis (Apoptosis) and inflammation (Inflammatory Response, IL6 JAK STAT3 Signaling, TNFα Signaling via NF-κβ, and Allograft Rejection).</p><p>To assess the response of cells at the protein level, we performed RPPA analysis of lung tissue from these same two genotypes.

We suggest that this allelic set moves the response of normal lung cells from an expansion of multipotent cells to one of extreme oncogenic signaling and stress, with the type of oncogenic mutation potentially further modulating these responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Tissue sensitivities to the different oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> alleles</title><p>We next addressed the ‘tropism’ of tissues towards specific Kras mutants by determining the tumor landscape upon globally activating each allele. As each allele is expected to have a different oncogenic potential, we opted for a moribundity endpoint, as opposed to a fixed endpoint, to identify the tissues most permissive to tumorigenic conversion in a competition-based approach. To this end, each allele was again activated by tamoxifen using the aforementioned ubiquitous Cre driver <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup><italic>CreERT2</italic></sup>. Mice were regularly monitored for moribundity endpoints, indicative of ensuing mortality due to cancer, at which time the animals were euthanized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a control to rule out a tumor phenotype being a product of variations in gene activation, we validated Cre-mediated recombination between all four alleles across 14 diverse tissues seven days after tamoxifen injection. Only the ovary displayed reduced recombination, and hence was not included in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Plotting the percent survival for each of the four genotypes by the Kaplan–Meier approach revealed that the median life span of mice progressively increased from 14 days upon activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele to 150 days upon activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Thus, with this proviso, we suggest that hematolymphopoietic neoplasia are sensitive to the level of oncogenic activity, being induced at the lowest level of active Kras and progressively becoming more aggressive with increased activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Tissues sensitive to Kras mutation type</title><p>Proliferative lesions of forestomach and oral squamous epithelium were preferentially induced by the oncogenic G12D mutant of Kras encoded by either native or common codons. In the case of the forestomach tumors, pathological analysis performed as above revealed that activation of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> allele induced squamous hyperplasia as well as mild and moderate grades of ‘atypical’ or dysplastic squamous lesions in the forestomach mucosa. Conversely, we did not detect any squamous proliferative changes upon activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natQ61R</italic></sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4 supp5">Supplementary files 4 and 5</xref>), despite the previously detected higher activity of the Kras<sup>natQ61R</sup> oncoprotein in MEFs and lung tissue. The same trend was observed when <italic>Kras</italic> was encoded with common codons, except the difference was less extreme between the two mutants, and shifted towards more aggressive disease. Specifically, activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comG12D</italic></sup> allele induced more severe grades of forestomach squamous lesions while activation of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele now induced lesions that were of moderate grades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Similar analysis of oral tumors revealed that activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> allele induced minimal to mild grade squamous lesions, while activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natQ61R</italic></sup> allele was not tumorigenic. Again, when Kras was encoded with common codons there was a shift to a more aggressive disease. Namely, activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comG12D</italic></sup> allele induced severe squamous papilloma in all mice, while activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele induced a mixture of moderate and severe grade squamous papillomas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). As such, in these two organs, the G12D mutant is associated with more severe phenotypes than the Q61R mutant, and changing codon usage to increase expression shifts this difference to a more advanced stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Tissues sensitive to both Kras oncogenic activity and mutation type</title><p>Pathological analysis performed as above in the lung revealed that the G12D mutation consistently induced more AAH and/or adenomas than the Q61R mutation when Kras was encoded with either common or native rare codons, both in terms of the number of animals with these lesions and the total number of these lesions per animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5 fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 5; 6A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). As was the case with forestomach and oral lesions, converting rare codons to common amplified the severity of lesions detected, which was particularly evident in the confluence of large peripheral AAH lesions induced preferentially by the<italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comG12D</italic></sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5 fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 5; 6B</xref>). However, no BH lesions were induced by either mutant when <italic>Kras</italic> was encoded with native rare codons and instead were only prevalent when <italic>Kras</italic> was encoded with common codons.

Assuming that AAH and BH lesions represent different types of tumors (and not different stages of the same tumor type), we suggest that tumorigenesis in the lung is influenced by both the degree of Kras activation and the mutation type, although temporal analysis argues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that the level of Kras activation nevertheless dominates tumorigenesis in this tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Tissues resistant to oncogenic Kras</title><p>Despite widespread tumorigenesis, we note that no overt proliferative lesions were detected at necropsy or by histopathological analysis in the pancreas, kidney, or liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). A gross survey of other organs such as the colon, intestine, heart, skin, and mammary glands similarly failed to reveal macroscopically detectable tumors (not shown). In agreement, many of these same tissues, including pancreatic, were reported to be refractory to tumorigenesis upon activating a <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-G12D</italic></sup> allele in the adult mice by CreER expressed from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parikh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van der Weyden et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>CK19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ray et al., 2011</xref>), or <italic>Ubc9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matkar et al., 2011</xref>) loci. Thus, many organs appear to be intrinsically resistant to the tumorigenic effects of oncogenic Kras, regardless of the mutation type or expression levels tested, at least within the time frame of this study and in the tested <italic>Rosa26<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> background.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we describe the effect of activating four inducible oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> alleles encoding two very different mutants in a native rare versus common codon background to explore the mechanisms underlying the bias of specific oncogenic KRAS mutations towards distinct cancer types. We suggest that the unique tumor patterns arising from each of these mutant alleles implies that tissues differ in their sensitivities to quantitative and/or qualitative RAS signaling, both as a product of oncoprotein signaling and the cellular response thereof. We acknowledge four caveats to this approach. First, these four alleles were generated by fusing the first three coding exons, an artificial gene architecture, and hence can only be compared to themselves and not to other types of <italic>Kras</italic> alleles. Second, these alleles were induced by an injection of tamoxifen to activate CreER expressed from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus. Admittedly, this is an unnatural situation whereby oncogenic Kras is expressed all at once in a multitude of tissues, potentially perturbing homeostasis in the whole animal. Nevertheless, as the identical design was applied to all four alleles, comparisons can be made within this allelic set. Third, Kras activity of this allelic set was defined in MEFs and lung tissue. We therefore acknowledge that cell-type differences in regulatory feedback pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) or codon-dependent expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterson et al., 2020</xref>) could result in different levels of Kras expression, activation, or signaling compared to that observed in MEF cultures and lung tissue, which were used to define the activity of each Kras oncoprotein. Fourth, by the nature of the experimental design, tissue types with slower tumor progression are underrepresented, and hence may respond differently to activation of the different <italic>Kras</italic> alleles when assessed more specifically.</p><p>With these limitations in mind, transcriptome analysis shortly after activating these alleles revealed similarities between the four, but also distinct transcriptional changes. This began with activation of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> allele, which induced EMT and differentiation hallmarks. EMT is known to promote stem cell-like fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Floor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mani et al., 2008</xref>) and activation of oncogenic Kras in the murine lung generates tumors with many tissue lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tata et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, we suggest that the transcriptional signature induced by the Kras<sup>natG12D</sup> oncoprotein reflects either reprogramming towards or an expansion of cells with multipotent characteristics. In support, single-cell transcriptome profiling of lung tumors induced by targeted delivery of AAV-Cre in an <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-G12D/+</italic></sup><italic>;Trp53</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> background identified a distinct population with a mixed cellular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marjanovic et al., 2020</xref>). At the other end of the spectrum, activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele induced transcriptional hallmarks consistent with overt oncogenic signaling. Thus, as the level of Kras biochemical activity increased, so did the transcriptional signatures of RAS signaling, which at its crescendo resulted in transcriptional signatures indicative of hyperproliferation and oncogenic stress. Nevertheless, within this overarching pattern of increased signaling we also find evidence for both mutation- and codon (expression)-specific transcriptional responses.</p><p>Globally activating these four alleles revealed four tumorigenic patterns. First, hematolymphopoietic neoplasias appeared to be largely driven by the amount of active Kras, as defined by RBD pull-down in both MEFs and lung tissue, as well as qRT-PCR of <italic>Kras</italic> target genes, transcriptome analysis, and RPPA analysis in lung tissue. Namely, these neoplasias were induced at the lowest level of oncogenic activity and increased in aggressiveness with increased Kras activity. To independently validate this result, we found that globally activating a ‘super-rare’ version of <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-rareG12D</italic></sup> allele encoded by the rarest codons induced hematolymphopoietic neoplasias, although in a much-protracted time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This further supports hematolymphopoietic tissues as being more permissive to oncogenic Ras activity, suggestive of a dependency on quantitative signaling. Second, proliferative lesions of forestomach and oral squamous epithelium were preferentially induced by G12D-mutant alleles. Such a finding points towards qualitative signaling differences potentially driving these tumors, with higher expression shifting the effects to more aggressive grades. Equally plausible, however, perhaps either a RasGEF or RasGAP is uniquely expressed in these tissues that preferentially interacts with or affects signaling of only one of these mutants, implying quantitative signaling unique to the G12D mutant in these specific tissues. In support, GEF-mediated GTP exchange is more rapid with a Q61L versus G12V mutant of Kras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2013</xref>), the RasGEF SOS1 is inactive toward KRAS<sup>G12R</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hobbs et al., 2020</xref>), and KRAS<sup>Q61H</sup> has diminished sensitivity to SHP2 inhibitors when compared to G12 or G13 mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gebregiworgis et al., 2021</xref>). Third, the lung was sensitive to both the activation level and mutation type, with the G12D mutants favoring AAH and adenomas while high Ras activity favored BH lesions, perhaps reflecting a different cell-of-origin for these different lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sutherland et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). AAH lesions may also speak to mutation-specific signaling, as here is a case in which we document Q61R mutants are more active, yet G12D mutants are more tumorigenic. With the caveat that Kras-GTP levels were determined in the entire lung, which may not reflect the actual levels in the cell-of-origin for AAH lesion, this implies qualitative differences may underlie these specific lesions. Fourth, many organs failed to develop lesions. We acknowledge that the short life span of some of the tested mice may very well prevent longer latency tumors from developing, and even though <italic>Rosa26</italic>-restricted Cre expression activated the four inducible oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> alleles in tissues that did not form tumors, Cre may not be expressed in the tumor cell-of-origin within these tissues. With these caveats mind, these data suggest that many tissue are intrinsically resistant to the tumorigenic effects of oncogenic Kras. Instead, the hematopoietic system, lungs, forestomach, and oral mucosa are unique in being permissive to the tumorigenic potential of Kras oncoproteins, again, however, within the confines of the experimental design. Interestingly, these tissue sensitivities share some similarity to that of humans, namely, both species have RAS-associated cancers in the lung, mouth, and hematopoietic system but not in the mammary gland, skin, central nervous system, and so forth, but there is also some discordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prior et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>How these different alleles drive the observed tumor patterns remains to be determined. However, comparing the two extreme cases – activation of the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> versus the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> alleles in the lung – reveals transcription factors linked to the unique transcriptional responses of these two alleles. Specifically, we cross-referenced the transcriptome with a curated eukaryotic transcription factor database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matys et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matys et al., 2006</xref>), identifying a set of upregulated transcription factors that tracked with the GSEA hallmarks of each oncoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Namely, transcription factors tracking with GSEA hallmarks EMT, Estrogen Response Early, KRAS Signaling DN, and Apical Junction in the case of activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> allele in the lung, and GSEA hallmarks TNFα Signaling via NFκβ, Complement, P53 Pathway, KRAS Signaling UP, and Inflammatory Response in the case of activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele, again in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Further, our finding that oncogenic RAS mutations are not identical in terms of activity (GTP-loading), oncogenic potential (induction of lung tumors), and cellular response (transcriptome and RPPA analysis) suggests the intriguing possibility that different initiating RAS mutations may have different therapeutic sensitivities. Indeed, again censoring the GSEA hallmarks in these two extreme cases for pharmacological targets already drugged in the clinic identified FLT4/PDGFRB/KIT, EGFR, and ABL1/SRC as specific to an activated <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> allele, while AKT1/2, PI3KCA/CD/CG, SYK, RAF1, JAK2, TGFBR1, and CDK1/2/9 were specific to an activated <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome analysis predicts unique pharmacological vulnerabilities.</title><p>Druggable kinases positively enriched in GSEA hallmarks identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (blue <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D/+</italic></sup>, red <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R/+</italic></sup>). * Adjusted p<italic>-</italic>value&lt;5%.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75715-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Differential expression of known transcription factors of genes enriched in the GSEA hallmarks identified in the transcriptome of lung tissue upon activating the <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup> and <italic>Kras</italic><sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> alleles.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Mean ± SEM of log<sub>2</sub> fold change (Log2FC) differential expression of genes (<italic>Kras</italic> <sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> versus <italic>Kras</italic> <sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup>) activated by transcription factors enriched in GSEA hallmarks of (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Kras</italic> <sup><italic>LSL-natG12D</italic></sup>, and (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>Kras</italic> <sup><italic>LSL-comQ61R</italic></sup> transcriptome (adjusted p-value less than 5%). +, genes common to more than one GSEA hallmark.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75715-fig5-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>In summary, we suggest that tissues differ in their sensitivities to quantitative and/or qualitative RAS signaling both as a product of oncoprotein signaling and the cellular response thereof. We find that the level of oncogenic activity favors hematolymphopoietic neoplasias, the G12D mutant uniquely gives rise to oral and forestomach squamous tumors, while lung adenocarcinomas are sensitive to both mutation type and expression levels. The unique signaling dependencies of these tissues may, in turn, be capitalized upon to identify new therapeutic opportunities to target early tumorigenesis, when the tumors are particularly vulnerable, perhaps either as an early intervention or as a preventative measure in high-risk populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cell pellets were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer provided in the Active Ras Detection Kit (Cell Signaling, #8821) supplemented with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher, 78430). The DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, 5000112) was used to measure protein concentration and 20 μg protein of each sample was used to immunoblot for total cell lysates. To measure biochemical activity of the endogenous Kras, 500 μg or 200 μg of each cell lysate was immediately assayed with the Active Ras Detection Kit (Cell Signaling, #8821) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, except that incubation of lysates with RBD peptide was performed at 4°C overnight. Total cell lysates and lysates after RBD pull-down were resolved by 18% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad, 1704273), blocked in 5% milk, and immunoblotted by the following antibodies in 5% BSA (Sigma, A7906-500G): KRAS (Santa Cruz, SC-30; diluted 1:500) and ß-Tubulin (Sigma, T5201; diluted 1:10,000).

Tissue lysis and RNA extraction steps were performed in a chemical hood, and all instruments and tools were sprayed with RNaseZAP (Sigma, R2020) to prevent RNA degradation. Isolated lungs were immediately stored in RNA stabilizing solution RNAlater (Sigma, R0901) at 4°C overnight and then transferred to –80°C for long-term storage. Lung tissues were thawed, weighed, and pulverized with mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. RNA extraction was performed immediately thereafter using RNAeasy Kit (QIAGEN, 74104) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tissue lysates were prepared according to the kit instructions and tissue clumps were removed using QIAshredder columns (QIAGEN, 79654). Cleared lysates were applied to RNeasy silica columns and on-column DNase digestion was performed using RNase-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN, 79254) to remove DNA in silica membrane. Following wash steps, RNA was eluted in RNase-free water that was treated with RNAsecure RNase Inactivation Reagent (Thermo Fisher, AM7005) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted total RNA quality and concentration were assessed on Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) and Qubit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), respectively. Samples with RIN less than 7 were not sequenced. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the commercially available KAPA Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit (Roche). In brief, mRNA transcripts were captured from 500 ng of total RNA using magnetic oligo-dT bead. The mRNA was then fragmented using heat and magnesium, and reverse transcribed using random priming. During second-strand synthesis, the cDNA:RNA hybrid was converted into to double-stranded cDNA (dscDNA) and dUTP was incorporated into the second cDNA strand, effectively marking this strand. Illumina sequencing adapters were ligated to the dscDNA fragments and amplified to produce the final RNA-seq library. The strand marked with dUTP was not amplified, allowing for strand-specific sequencing. Libraries were indexed using a dual-indexing approach allowing for all the libraries to be pooled and sequenced on the same sequencing run. Before pooling and sequencing, fragment length distribution for each library was first assessed on a Fragment Analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were also quantified using Qubit. Molarity of each library was calculated based on Qubit concentration and average library size. All libraries were then pooled in equimolar ratio and sequenced. Sequencing was done on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer. The pooled libraries were sequenced on one lane of an S-Prime flow cell at 50 bp paired-end. Once generated, sequence data was demultiplexed and Fastq files generated using bcl2fastq v2.20.0.422 file converter from Illumina.

Five sections of 8 μm were cut, mounted on uncoated glass slides, and stored at −80°C until lysed. Whole-tissue lysates were obtained directly from the glass slides after sections were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with deionized water, stained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, H9627, CAS# 517-28-2) and Scott’s Tap Water (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 2607006), and dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol (70, 95, and 100%). Solutions were supplemented with cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, 11836153001) to avoid proteins and phosphorylated residues degradation. Stained tissues were lysed in a 1:1 solution of Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce, 78510) and 2× Tris-Glycine SDS Sample buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies, LC2676) supplemented with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, M3148, CAS# 60-24-2).

Reference standard curves for internal quality control were arrayed along with the tissue lysates along with a bovine serum albumin serial dilution curve to quantify total protein amount on each sample.

Reblot Antibody Stripping solution (Chemicon, 2500) was used to treat the remaining arrays for 15 min at room temperature before antibody staining. Arrays were subsequently washed with PBS and incubated for at least 4 hrs in I-block reagent (Tropix, T2015). Using an automated system (Dako Cytomation), arrays were probed with selected antibodies targeting total proteins and post-translationally modified epitopes of kinases and their downstream substrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For their use on the array, antibodies were validated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Signore et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan Chernoff (Reviewer #1); Aaron Hobbs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on their discussion, the reviewers are in agreement that use of some method is required to demonstrate that the RNA changes documented in the study result in real changes in protein-level expression of key signaling molecules. The reviewers indicate this could be addressed using various approaches, including 1) total proteome analysis; 2) immunoblots for proteins that are important to the analysis; or 3) RPPA. However, some method of evaluating protein changes must be applied, and the results integrated into the analysis.</p><p>2) In addition, each of the three reviewers made some suggestions regarding phrasing and interpretation. The authors are strongly encouraged to address these.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors try to establish biological differences between commonly encountered KRAS mutants. Distinct mutations exhibit tissue tropism (e.g., KRAS G12C in lung, G12D and G12R in pancreas, etc), but the reasons for these distributions have never been fully clarified. By establishing mouse models in which the type of KRAS mutant and its level of expression can be readily controlled, the authors hope to establish whether the type of amount of KRAS mutant expressed will result in distinct outcomes.</p><p>Major strengths include the extensive body of work from the Counter lab regarding the key role of codon usage in KRAS oncogenicity, the generation of several sets of matched mouse models (two of which are studied in detail, but the others are also of value), and the examination of KRAS effects in many tissues.</p><p>Weaknesses include the fact (acknowledged by the authors) that the system is highly artificial, in that KRAS is being induced globally at one point in time, that its expression levels are artificially boosted by codon changes that would not occur in vivo (though perhaps might happen if the KRAS gene were amplified, as sometimes happens), and a lack of any protein level data to corroborate the RNA profiling performed in the study.</p><p>It would strengthen the work if the authors would back up some of the key RNA signatures with western blots of RPPA-type data.</p><p>It could be instructive if the authors performed exon sequencing on some of their tumors. They saw no pancreatic tumors, which is a bit surprising, though it was perhaps because tp53 was not also mutated. One wonder what mutations might have occurred in those tissues where tumors were seen, such as lung.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Within this manuscript, the authors utilize mouse genetic approaches to modulate both which Kras mutation is expressed and how much of that Kras mutant is expressed. By utilizing different codons, they can have the same Kras mutation expressed at either a low level (due to rare codon utilization) or at a higher level (through common codon utilization). This is a clever strategy that this group pioneered for studying RAS signaling, and by now comparing two different Kras mutants (G12D and Q61R) they can also introduce additional quantitative and qualitative variation.</p><p>The authors define quantitative variation as variation in the intensity of active Kras-GTP, and qualitative variation as how the Kras-GTP may activate different downstream effector proteins. This is a well-defined concept that helps provide a structure to their analysis.</p><p>The genetic approach, and the setting of definitions, are major strengths as the authors dissect this complicated problem in a logical, systematic manner. Additional strengths include studying how the different Kras strains differ for different tissue phenotypes.</p><p>However, there are a few weaknesses to the manuscript in its current form. Although the authors' hypotheses about quantitative and qualitative variation are likely true, at times the authors appear to interpret their data more strongly than the data seem to permit. In many of these cases, a rephrasing that describes their findings objectively would be valuable because the data – at minimum – highlight the need for these quantitative and qualitative factors to be better considered within the field.</p><p>One seemingly striking weakness is that the allelic series does not seem to be sufficiently well demonstrated to have the progressive increase in mutant strengths. Another, and partially overlapping weakness, is that the authors seem to invoke tissue-specific differences when convenient and to ignore them when convenient.</p><p>The field of RAS biology has made great progress ignoring the potential effects of signal intensity and mutant-to-mutant variation, but the reinvigoration of the field in recent years has revealed important mutant-to-mutant specific differences and instances where intensity matters. A deeper understanding of these factors, and improved tools to study these differences, are both important to the field. The authors are here advancing tools and approaches that could be used in future studies and are providing a foundation for future studies. Thus, the work is likely to be impactful and influential.</p><p>One concern is the demonstration of the progressive quantitative strength of the allelic series. Even though a mouse genetic approach is utilized for the manuscript, the comparisons of Kras mutant strength is made with transiently transfected HEK-HT cells. Could the authors not do this in the MEFs they utilize, which would be endogenous expression from these cells derived from the genetically engineered mice?</p><p>The authors later claim, and acknowledge, tissue differences in factors that can contribute to the overall activation of Kras, and the authors also acknowledge qualitative differences. It seems reasonable to consider that there could be tissue-specific differences in which GEFs are activated, and that active GEFs might act upon the G12D and Q61R mutants differently – just as effector proteins may bind the mutants differently. The authors seem to be assuming the relative strengths observed are invariant between cell/tissue types and that their observations are either reflective of these quantitative differences, or that if they differ, that they must be qualitative. But why can't there be qualitative upstream differences that impact the quantity of Kras-GTP? In other words – quantitative and qualitative influences still seem to be intertwined in this system. The authors may want to state that these are strong (and unproven) assumptions, and that their interpretations are based upon these assumptions.</p><p>The authors refer to &quot;normal cells&quot; in the introduction; they appear to be referring to HEK-HT cells. It seems misleading to refer to them as &quot;normal&quot;. The authors should be more precise.</p><p>The title seems to be too strongly stated. Mutation patterns also arise from the mutagens (cigarette smoking in lung causing G12C, etc.). Additionally, the authors do not show this or prove this – this is a speculation down the road from their findings, by my interpretation of their study. A more objective title would be more appropriate.</p><p>The authors state &quot;determining the immediate response of normal cells to different Kras mutations in vivo thus holds the key to understanding the mutational patterning of this oncogene&quot;. The logic to make such a strong conclusion is not apparent. This rather seems to be a hypothesis, that studying the immediate response may offer some insight into mutational patterning. Several specific details in the sentence appear overly strong. Can this be rephrased?</p><p>The sentence &quot;In this way, tissues sensitive to quantitative signaling…&quot;. This is important, as it highlights the authors interpretation of their data (and possible flaws with this assumption are mentioned above). Could the authors rephrase this a bit more mildly to describe that the authors interpret their data to indicate quantitative signaling when… and qualitative signaling when…</p><p>Mention of NRAS G12D and KRAS G12D does not mention the study by Haigis et al., Nat Genetics, 2008. Is that study not relevant?</p><p>When discussing Figure 3A and Figure 3 —figure supplement 2-5, the authors describe a progressive change. Do they simply mean more genes that are significantly different? Or do the identities of genes progressively change? IT is difficult to dissect finer details on the genes from the plot.</p><p>In general, increased clarity would be helpful, and more objective descriptions of findings without stronger conclusions than are justified would be helpful.</p><p>The main experiment this reviewer would like to see is measurements of RAS-GTP in the MEFs, and – if possible (very likely not) – in specific tissues. (Are mouse macrophages or immune cells not isolatable for measurement?) Would western blots of RAF, MEK, or ERK phosphorylation not be useful to assess signaling? Qualitative differences are of course possible between G12D and Q61R, but it would seem that one could at least evaluate if natural and common codons alter expression of Kras enough to result in changes to signaling downstream from the same mutant (G12D or Q61R).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Erdogan et al., asks a straightforward question and tightly focusses on answering that question. Further, this manuscript benefits from being very well written and clearly stating the limitations of this study. The authors ask whether the mutational prevalence of KRAS mutations observed in human tumors is due to qualitative (which pathways are engaged) or quantitative (the amplitude of signal) signaling. The authors chose to use a variation on a mouse model that the Counter Lab has previously utilized to approach this question. By using genetically engineered mouse models that have had the first three coding exons of the KRAS locus exchanged to use only rare or common codons to regulate KRAS protein expression levels, and by using two distinct mutations, the common G12D and the rare Q61R, under control of the Rosa26 promoter, this system allowed for mutant protein expression in a broad range of tissues. By measuring the overall GTP-bound levels, a measure of RAS activity, the authors achieved their goal of driving a step-wise increase of total GTP-bound KRAS in the four different models. They reason that quantitative signaling can be observed by changing the expression levels of the same mutant while quantitative signaling is observed by expression of two different mutants that have similar activity levels (KrasnatQ61R vs KrascomG12D).</p><p>One limitation to this study is the use of mouse models where the Kras locus has been heavily modified. Further, the use of rare and common codons could have tissue specific effects. However, the authors reason that each mouse has been subjected to the same types of manipulations and RAS function was verified in lung tissue. Because of these limitations, the authors do caution that the degree of signaling cannot be readily compared to previous studies but that these mice can be compared to each other.</p><p>It is accepted that the KRAS Q61R mutation has greater overall GTP activity compared to G12D. This was shown in this manuscript using GTP pulldown assays and an ELISA based luciferase assay, showing increased GTP loading in the Q61R mutant relative to G12D and increased expression resulted in increased GTP-bound KRAS. A CRAF RBD pulldown confirmed increased GTP loading. While RBD-pulldowns can be affected by the binding affinity of the RAS mutants to the RBD domain, the use of two distinct assays helps alleviate that concern.</p><p>After confirming the model system was behaving as expected, the authors looked at lung tumors and found that increasing activity directly correlated with increasing tumorigenesis, in support of quantitative signaling playing a significant role in tumor formation. However, they also observed that the type of lesions that developed were dependent on the specific KRAS mutation, indicating that qualitative signaling also dictates tumorigenic potential.</p><p>The authors performed bulk RNAseq on the total lung tissue to determine how each KRAS allele altered gene transcription levels. Here, the authors found that a number of transcripts involved in numerous connected pathways, analyzed by GSEA analysis, were modulated by the RAS mutants. Importantly, the total number of upregulated genes correlated with total RAS activity levels, indicating that quantitative signaling drives different transcription programs. It is surprising that there is not more overlap between the different mutant RAS constructs in this system. It would be reasonable to expect active RAS to have a core set of effectors that are independent of quantitative and qualitative signaling. However, the extent to which there is any overlap between RAS mutants or by degree of expression is not broadly discussed.</p><p>While the active RAS GTP levels appeared to be dependent on both the KRAS mutation and expression levels, the overall survival of the mice expressing the natural codons of both KRASG12D and Q61R were similar. While survival is a global readout of total oncogenic activity, this result does imply that a certain degree of quantitative signaling is necessary to overcome differences in qualitative signaling, a conclusion that the author's also state. Further, looking at tumorigenesis in 8 different tissue types, the authors observed that in some tissue types, quantitative signaling appears to drive the overall malignancy (hematopoietic), while in others (forestomach), qualitative signaling is a larger driver of malignancy.</p><p>In conclusion, this study supports the possibility that qualitative signaling preferences of KRAS mutants may drive tumor initiation, in agreement with several recent studies showing mutation-specific signaling, such as KRAS A146T and KRAS G12R. While this study is limited to only two KRAS mutations, the authors suggest that these differences could drive differential inhibitor sensitivities. However, one hallmark of many RAS mutant cancers is the development of increased RAS activity during tumor development, which implies that quantitative signaling may require greater consideration for therapeutic intervention of established tumors. Further, this result leads one to question how successful mutation-specific therapeutics may be in the clinic in qualitative signaling can be masked by quantitative signaling. However, these results also shed light on tumor initiation, which may be useful in determining early detection markers that may be mutation dependent.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript has a central theme and the authors do not deviate from this theme. This results in a highly focused paper that clearly draws its main points while being very aware of the limitations of the approach. With these limitations in mind, this manuscript clearly demonstrates mutation specific signaling in an in vivo model, demonstrating yet again that all KRAS mutations are not created equal.</p><p>1. Overall, I note very few problems with this text. However, Figure 1 C needs additional clarification. The methods state that the abcam RAS GTPase ELISA kit was used. The product manual states that this kit detects activated H and KRAS human and HRAS rodent samples, if employed per the manufacturer's kit. Was a different primary used? According to the methods, the FLAG-tagged constructs were Kras, which implies a murine system. Given that the empty vector increases with increasing protein extract, it is likely that this system is detecting the endogenous human GTPases and not the ectopically expressed murine construct. While the supplemental data do agree with the expected results based on the published literature, this figure could possibly be improved.</p><p>2. In figure 1, supplement 4 panel B, the KrasnatG12D/+ bar does not match the legend.</p><p>3. In Figure 5, the gene name for the PI3Ks are incorrect. The correct gene names for p110 isoforms are PIK3CA, PIK3CD and PIK3CG.</p><p>4. While not necessary but could improve Figure 5, could testing which inhibitor class on overall survival in the common codon mutants add improve survival? If done in the Q61 mutant, it could be quick to validate the specificity between the classes of inhibitors.</p><p>5. Is it possible that expression levels may alter mutant-specific (qualitative) signaling as well? Would this appear as quantitative? More specifically, what was the degree of overlap within the RAS mutants when changing from natural to rare codons? Were all of the hits observed in the natural codon mice detected in the common codon mice? This might be a more useful figure than the STRING analysis.</p><p>6. On page 4, it is mentioned that Q61R has slower GTP exchange and hydrolysis rates than G12D. It is worth pointing out that the Burd et al., reference is NRAS while the Rabara et al., reference compared GAP-mediated hydrolysis. However, G12D is interesting because its GTP exchange rate has been reported to be elevated (PMID 8955068 and PMID 24224811), being faster than G13D in biochemical studies, yet this is never discussed. Thus, the author is not wrong in their statement, but additional references and clarification could be useful.</p><p>7. On page 6, the authors wrote “special control of gene expression” although I believe they meant “special control”.</p><p>8. On page 9, first full paragraph. Discussing RNAseq data as a direct proxy for protein signaling is not entirely valid. RNA levels, which do indicate transcript levels, do not necessarily mean that signaling in those pathways is elevated.</p><p>9. On page 11, first paragraph. “Of note, median survival was significantly decreased in mice with either of the Krascom alleles or with either of the Q61R mutants.” This sentence is not entirely clear. Median survival was decreased compared to what? And didn’t the Q61Rnat and G12Dnat have similar survival rates? Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75715.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Based on their discussion, the reviewers are in agreement that use of some method is required to demonstrate that the RNA changes documented in the study result in real changes in protein-level expression of key signaling molecules. The reviewers indicate this could be addressed using various approaches, including 1) total proteome analysis; 2) immunoblots for proteins that are important to the analysis; or 3) RPPA. However, some method of evaluating protein changes must be applied, and the results integrated into the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we validate the major finds that the four LSL-Kras alleles generate different levels of active Kras (as assessed by RBD affinity capture) that imparts distinct cellular responses at the protein level (as assessed by RPPA) at the endogenous level and in MEF cultures in vitro and/or actual lung tissue a mere days after oncogene activation in vivo, as summarized below:</p><p>1. Confirmed a stepwise increase in activation of the Kras oncoprotein in the allelic LSL-Kras set at the endogenous level by Ras Binding Domain (RBD) affinity capture in MEF cultures in vitro. We generated immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) from two independent embryos (i.e. two biological replicates) from each of the genotypes LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+, LSL-Kras<sup>natQ61R</sup>/+, LSL-Kras<sup>comG12D</sup>/+, and LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+. All eight cell lines were then stably infected with a Cre-expressing retrovirus and successful recombination confirmed by genomic PCR. Two independent immortalized MEF cell lines derived from LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+ mice but not expressing Cre recombinase were cultured in parallel as a control. Duplicate cultures of each of the ten MEF cell lines were serum-starved overnight and the next day one plate was collected as the serum-starved condition to assay basal Kras activity and another plate was treated with serum for 5 minutes before lysates were collected to assess the effect of serum stimulation. Protein lysates were prepared from these 20 samples, protein concentrations were determined, and equal amount of total protein was subjected to affinity capture with a Ras Binding Domain (RBD) polypeptide. Total and RBD pull-down protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-KRAS antibody. This analysis confirmed our previous results from HEK-HT cells (now Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 1—source data 1), namely that changing rare codons to common increases the total amount of Kras protein detected, and that the Q61R mutant leads to higher levels of Kras-GTP than the G12D mutant. This resulted in a stepwise increase in endogenous Kras-GTP levels, beginning with the control cells lacking detectable GTP-Kras, followed in order of increasing activity, the Cre-activated LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+, LSL-Kras<sup>natQ61R</sup>/+, LSL-Kras<sup>comG12D</sup>/+, and finally LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+ MEF cultures, which was observed in both the serum-starved and serum-stimulated conditions. These new data are provided in the new panel Figure 1C and Figure 1—source data 3. To ensure reproducibility and rigor, we repeated this experiment (i.e. two technical replicates). These new data are provided as the new Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 1—source data 3.</p><p>2. Confirmed a stepwise increase in activation of the Kras oncoprotein in the allelic LSL-Kras set at the endogenous level by Ras Binding Domain (RBD) affinity capture in lung tissue in vivo. We also performed the above analysis from lung tissue isolated from the same allelic set. Namely, we crossed the LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+, LSL-Kras<sup>natQ61R</sup>/+, LSL-Kras<sup>comG12D</sup>/+, and LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+ genotypes into a Rosa26-CreERT2 background. Two adult mice from each of the four derived cohorts, as well as the control strain (Rosa26-CreERT2/+), were injected with tamoxifen and seven days later humanely euthanized, their lungs removed, and duplicate samples of derived protein lysates were subjected to RBD affinity capture followed by immunoblot (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A). As in the case of MEF cultures described above, we again observed a stepwise increase in Kras activity consistent with the codon usage and oncogenic mutation in vivo. These new data are provided in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 5B,C and Figure 1—source data 4.</p><p>3. Confirmed increased activation of each protein in the MAPK pathway in the two most phenotypically different alleles, LSL-Kras<sup>natG12</sup> versus LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>, at the endogenous level by RPPA in lung tissue in vivo. Cohorts of three Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+ versus three Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+ (and as a control, Rosa26::CreERT2/+;Kras+/+) mice comprised of an equal distribution of males and females were injected with tamoxifen at 6 to 8 weeks of age to induce recombination and activation of these inducible Kras alleles. We chose these two genotypes as they exhibit the greatest difference in transcriptional profiles (see Figure 3A,B) and tumorigenesis (see Figures 2,4) and encompass both differences in codon usage and mutation type. Seven days later, all mice were humanely euthanized and the lungs removed at the time of necropsy. We chose the lung both because it was the same tissue for which we previously performed RNAseq analysis (see Figure 3) and because this organ exhibits evidence of both the individual mutations as well as codon bias influencing tumor initiation (see Figure 4F). We chose seven days post-injection for this analysis, both because it is earliest point that we validate robust recombination of the LSL-Kras alleles in order to capture the response of normal cells to the oncoprotein (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2) and, again, because this is the same timepoint we previously performed RNAseq analysis (see Figure 3). Protein lysates were then isolated from lung sections and subjected to RPPA analysis. To ensure reproducibility and rigor, lungs from all mice (three biological replicates) were tested in triplicate (three technical replicates). We note that originally we had four mice in the Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+ cohort, but one sample was censored as it had a completely different RPPA profile compared to the other three mice in this cohort. RPPA was performed on 140 proteins/phosphoproteins representative of pathways altered the most in the two extreme transcriptional profiles, namely derived from the lungs of LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup>(nat) versus LSL-Kras<sup>Q61R</sup>(com) mice shortly after recombination was induced. Focusing on the MAPK pathway, we report increased phosphorylation of the proteins of this pathway in the Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+ murine lung tissue. Again, in complete concordance with the immunoblot analysis of Kras-GTP levels in MEFs and/or lung tissue, as well as the transcriptome analysis of lung tissue. These new data are provided in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1.</p><p>4. Confirmed that the transcriptomes manifest in differences at the protein level in the two most different alleles, LSL-Kras<sup>natG12</sup> versus LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>, at the endogenous level by RPPA in lung tissue in vivo. As noted, our RPPA analysis focused on proteins representative of pathways altered in the two extreme transcriptional profiles. Specifically, proteins within the RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Growth, IL/Jak/Stat, DNA repair, Apoptosis, Autophagy, and Senescence pathways (see Figure 3B,C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). We report concordance between the transcriptional and proteomic profiles, namely an upregulation in proteins in the MAPK pathway, those involved in stress response and DNA damage, and cytokine activation. These new data are provided in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 9 and Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, each of the three reviewers made some suggestions regarding phrasing and interpretation.

Distinct mutations exhibit tissue tropism (e.g., KRAS G12C in lung, G12D and G12R in pancreas, etc), but the reasons for these distributions have never been fully clarified. By establishing mouse models in which the type of KRAS mutant and its level of expression can be readily controlled, the authors hope to establish whether the type of amount of KRAS mutant expressed will result in distinct outcomes.</p><p>Major strengths include the extensive body of work from the Counter lab regarding the key role of codon usage in KRAS oncogenicity, the generation of several sets of matched mouse models (two of which are studied in detail, but the others are also of value), and the examination of KRAS effects in many tissues.</p><p>Weaknesses include the fact (acknowledged by the authors) that the system is highly artificial, in that KRAS is being induced globally at one point in time, that its expression levels are artificially boosted by codon changes that would not occur in vivo (though perhaps might happen if the KRAS gene were amplified, as sometimes happens), and a lack of any protein level data to corroborate the RNA profiling performed in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for both their encouraging review and thoughtful suggestions. We note here that while admittedly artificial, whole-body activation of each of the four novel <italic>LSL-Kras</italic> alleles was key to identify the sensitivities of different tissues to each mutant. We also note here that changing rare codons to common is essentially a hypermorphic allele, which is a staple of mouse genetics. Nevertheless, we see your point, so if there are specific recommendations to the text beyond what we have already included to better describe the limitations of these two genetic approaches, we would be glad to include them- we want to get this right!

These new data are provided in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 7 and Supplementary file 1. Additionally, we also included analysis of proteins/phosphoproteins from pathways that transcriptome analysis identified as being upregulated in the lung upon activation of the Kras<sup>comQ61</sup> compared to the Kras<sup>natG12D</sup> allele. Bulk transcriptome analysis revealed that activation of the Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup> allele had all features of a potent oncogenic signaling leading to hyperproliferation and oncogenic-induced stress. Namely, GSEA hallmarks indicative of high oncogenic signaling (KRAS Signaling UP) and unrestrained proliferation (MYC Targets V1, E2F Targets), leading to reactive oxygen species (Oxidative Phosphorylation, Reactive Oxygen Species Pathway) and a DNA damage response (DNA Repair, P53 Pathway, G2M Checkpoint) followed by apoptosis (Apoptosis) and inflammation (Inflammatory Response, IL6 JAK STAT3 Signaling, TNFa Signaling via NF-kb, Allograft Rejection) (see Figure 3). Comparing the level of proteins/phosphoprotein by RPPA of Kras<sup>natG12D</sup> to Kras<sup>comQ61</sup> (normalized to the control strain) revealed a clear increase in the latter in RAS/MAPK (as already noted), PI3K/AKT, Growth, DNA repair, senescence/autophagy/apoptosis, and IL/Jak/Stat, thereby validating the transcriptome analysis.

They saw no pancreatic tumors, which is a bit surprising, though it was perhaps because tp53 was not also mutated. One wonder what mutations might have occurred in those tissues where tumors were seen, such as lung.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a really great suggestion, and one that we will most certainly perform in the future as it would be ever-so-interesting to see if the type of foundational Kras mutation influences the nature of mutations selected to drive tumor progression. However, since the current study focuses on tumor initiation and exploring this new idea will be a major undertaking to do correctly, we propose to address this new concept in the future. Thank you for this idea! With regards to why pancreatic tumors fail to develop in the genetic backgrounds we employed in this study, we are not the first to observe this. Indeed, we now clarify in the revised text that Parikh, <italic>et al.,</italic> (PMID: 22532587) and Van der Weyden, <italic>et al.,</italic> (PMID:21381032) both published that inducing recombination of an <italic>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> allele in the identical <italic>Rosa26-CreERT2</italic> background in adult mice did <italic>not</italic> generate pancreatic tumors. Instead, we note here that an oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> allele induces pancreatic tumors if activated either during development or in adult when accompanied by either pancreatitis or loss of tumor suppressors (Guerra and Barbacid, Mol Oncol, 2013, PMID: 23506980), but not in adults without further perturbations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Within this manuscript, the authors utilize mouse genetic approaches to modulate both which Kras mutation is expressed and how much of that Kras mutant is expressed. By utilizing different codons, they can have the same Kras mutation expressed at either a low level (due to rare codon utilization) or at a higher level (through common codon utilization). This is a clever strategy that this group pioneered for studying RAS signaling, and by now comparing two different Kras mutants (G12D and Q61R) they can also introduce additional quantitative and qualitative variation.</p><p>The authors define quantitative variation as variation in the intensity of active Kras-GTP, and qualitative variation as how the Kras-GTP may activate different downstream effector proteins. This is a well-defined concept that helps provide a structure to their analysis.</p><p>The genetic approach, and the setting of definitions, are major strengths as the authors dissect this complicated problem in a logical, systematic manner. Additional strengths include studying how the different Kras strains differ for different tissue phenotypes.</p><p>However, there are a few weaknesses to the manuscript in its current form. Although the authors' hypotheses about quantitative and qualitative variation are likely true, at times the authors appear to interpret their data more strongly than the data seem to permit. In many of these cases, a rephrasing that describes their findings objectively would be valuable because the data – at minimum – highlight the need for these quantitative and qualitative factors to be better considered within the field.</p><p>One seemingly striking weakness is that the allelic series does not seem to be sufficiently well demonstrated to have the progressive increase in mutant strengths. Another, and partially overlapping weakness, is that the authors seem to invoke tissue-specific differences when convenient and to ignore them when convenient.</p><p>The field of RAS biology has made great progress ignoring the potential effects of signal intensity and mutant-to-mutant variation, but the reinvigoration of the field in recent years has revealed important mutant-to-mutant specific differences and instances where intensity matters. A deeper understanding of these factors, and improved tools to study these differences, are both important to the field. The authors are here advancing tools and approaches that could be used in future studies and are providing a foundation for future studies.

It seems reasonable to consider that there could be tissue-specific differences in which GEFs are activated, and that active GEFs might act upon the G12D and Q61R mutants differently – just as effector proteins may bind the mutants differently. The authors seem to be assuming the relative strengths observed are invariant between cell/tissue types and that their observations are either reflective of these quantitative differences, or that if they differ, that they must be qualitative. But why can't there be qualitative upstream differences that impact the quantity of Kras-GTP? In other words – quantitative and qualitative influences still seem to be intertwined in this system.

Two adult mice from each of the four derived cohorts, as well as the control strain (Rosa26-CreERT2/+), were injected with tamoxifen and seven days later humanely euthanized, their lungs removed, and duplicate samples of derived protein lysates were subjected to RBD affinity capture followed by immunoblot (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A). As in the case of MEF cultures, we again observed a stepwise increase in Kras activity consistent with the codon usage and oncogenic mutation in vivo. These new data are provided in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 5 and Figure 1—source data 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would western blots of RAF, MEK, or ERK phosphorylation not be useful to assess signaling? Qualitative differences are of course possible between G12D and Q61R, but it would seem that one could at least evaluate if natural and common codons alter expression of Kras enough to result in changes to signaling downstream from the same mutant (G12D or Q61R).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, cohorts of three Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+ versus three Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+ (and as a control, Rosa26::CreERT2/+;Kras+/+) mice comprised of an equal distribution of males and females were injected with tamoxifen at 6 to 8 weeks of age to induce recombination and activation of these inducible Kras alleles. We chose these two genotypes as they exhibit the greatest difference in transcriptional profiles (see Figure 3A,B) and tumorigenesis (see Figures 2,4) as well as encompass differences in both codon usage and mutation type. Seven days later, all mice were humanely euthanized and the lungs removed at the time of necropsy. We chose the lung both because it was the same tissue for which we previously performed RNAseq analysis (see Figure 3) and because this organ exhibits evidence of both the individual mutations as well as codon bias influencing tumor initiation (see Figure 4F). We chose seven days post-injection for this analysis, both because it is earliest point that we validate robust recombination of the LSL-Kras alleles in order to capture the response of normal cells to the oncoprotein (see Figure 4—figure supplement 2) and, again, because this is the same timepoint we previously performed RNAseq analysis (see Figure 3). Protein lysates were then isolated from lung sections and subjected to RPPA analysis. To ensure reproducibility and rigor, lungs from all mice (three biological replicates) were tested in triplicate (three technical replicates). We note that originally we had four mice in the Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+ cohort, but one sample was censored as it had a completely different RPPA profile compared to the other three mice in this cohort. RPPA was performed on 140 proteins/phosphoproteins representative of pathways altered the most in the two extreme transcriptional profiles, namely derived from the lungs of LSL-Kras<sup>G12D</sup>(nat) versus LSL-Kras<sup>Q61R</sup>(com) mice shortly after recombination was induced. Focusing on the MAPK pathway proteins in this analysis, we report increased phosphorylation of the proteins of this pathway in the Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>comQ61R</sup>/+ compared to the Rosa26::CreERT2/+;LSL-Kras<sup>natG12D</sup>/+ mice lung tissue. Again, in complete concordance with the immunoblot analysis of Kras-GTP levels in MEFs and lung tissue, as well as the transcriptome of these cells. These new data are provided in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 7 and Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Erdogan et al., asks a straightforward question and tightly focusses on answering that question. Further, this manuscript benefits from being very well written and clearly stating the limitations of this study. The authors ask whether the mutational prevalence of KRAS mutations observed in human tumors is due to qualitative (which pathways are engaged) or quantitative (the amplitude of signal) signaling. The authors chose to use a variation on a mouse model that the Counter Lab has previously utilized to approach this question. By using genetically engineered mouse models that have had the first three coding exons of the KRAS locus exchanged to use only rare or common codons to regulate KRAS protein expression levels, and by using two distinct mutations, the common G12D and the rare Q61R, under control of the Rosa26 promoter, this system allowed for mutant protein expression in a broad range of tissues. By measuring the overall GTP-bound levels, a measure of RAS activity, the authors achieved their goal of driving a step-wise increase of total GTP-bound KRAS in the four different models. They reason that quantitative signaling can be observed by changing the expression levels of the same mutant while quantitative signaling is observed by expression of two different mutants that have similar activity levels (KrasnatQ61R vs KrascomG12D).</p><p>One limitation to this study is the use of mouse models where the Kras locus has been heavily modified. Further, the use of rare and common codons could have tissue specific effects. However, the authors reason that each mouse has been subjected to the same types of manipulations and RAS function was verified in lung tissue. Because of these limitations, the authors do caution that the degree of signaling cannot be readily compared to previous studies but that these mice can be compared to each other.</p><p>It is accepted that the KRAS Q61R mutation has greater overall GTP activity compared to G12D. This was shown in this manuscript using GTP pulldown assays and an ELISA based luciferase assay, showing increased GTP loading in the Q61R mutant relative to G12D and increased expression resulted in increased GTP-bound KRAS. A CRAF RBD pulldown confirmed increased GTP loading. While RBD-pulldowns can be affected by the binding affinity of the RAS mutants to the RBD domain, the use of two distinct assays helps alleviate that concern.</p><p>After confirming the model system was behaving as expected, the authors looked at lung tumors and found that increasing activity directly correlated with increasing tumorigenesis, in support of quantitative signaling playing a significant role in tumor formation. However, they also observed that the type of lesions that developed were dependent on the specific KRAS mutation, indicating that qualitative signaling also dictates tumorigenic potential.</p><p>The authors performed bulk RNAseq on the total lung tissue to determine how each KRAS allele altered gene transcription levels. Here, the authors found that a number of transcripts involved in numerous connected pathways, analyzed by GSEA analysis, were modulated by the RAS mutants. Importantly, the total number of upregulated genes correlated with total RAS activity levels, indicating that quantitative signaling drives different transcription programs. It is surprising that there is not more overlap between the different mutant RAS constructs in this system. It would be reasonable to expect active RAS to have a core set of effectors that are independent of quantitative and qualitative signaling. However, the extent to which there is any overlap between RAS mutants or by degree of expression is not broadly discussed.</p><p>While the active RAS GTP levels appeared to be dependent on both the KRAS mutation and expression levels, the overall survival of the mice expressing the natural codons of both KRASG12D and Q61R were similar. While survival is a global readout of total oncogenic activity, this result does imply that a certain degree of quantitative signaling is necessary to overcome differences in qualitative signaling, a conclusion that the author's also state. Further, looking at tumorigenesis in 8 different tissue types, the authors observed that in some tissue types, quantitative signaling appears to drive the overall malignancy (hematopoietic), while in others (forestomach), qualitative signaling is a larger driver of malignancy.</p><p>In conclusion, this study supports the possibility that qualitative signaling preferences of KRAS mutants may drive tumor initiation, in agreement with several recent studies showing mutation-specific signaling, such as KRAS A146T and KRAS G12R. While this study is limited to only two KRAS mutations, the authors suggest that these differences could drive differential inhibitor sensitivities. However, one hallmark of many RAS mutant cancers is the development of increased RAS activity during tumor development, which implies that quantitative signaling may require greater consideration for therapeutic intervention of established tumors. Further, this result leads one to question how successful mutation-specific therapeutics may be in the clinic in qualitative signaling can be masked by quantitative signaling. However, these results also shed light on tumor initiation, which may be useful in determining early detection markers that may be mutation dependent.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript has a central theme and the authors do not deviate from this theme. This results in a highly focused paper that clearly draws its main points while being very aware of the limitations of the approach. With these limitations in mind, this manuscript clearly demonstrates mutation specific signaling in an in vivo model, demonstrating yet again that all KRAS mutations are not created equal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for both their encouraging review and thoughtful suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Overall, I note very few problems with this text. However, Figure 1 C needs additional clarification. The methods state that the abcam RAS GTPase ELISA kit was used. The product manual states that this kit detects activated H and KRAS human and HRAS rodent samples, if employed per the manufacturer's kit. Was a different primary used? According to the methods, the FLAG-tagged constructs were Kras, which implies a murine system. Given that the empty vector increases with increasing protein extract, it is likely that this system is detecting the endogenous human GTPases and not the ectopically expressed murine construct. While the supplemental data do agree with the expected results based on the published literature, this figure could possibly be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we clarify in the Materials and methods the specific antibody used (which was not a different antibody than that provided by this kit). As requested, we clarify in text that the ectopic Kras expressed in HEK-HT cells was derived from a FLAG-tagged murine Kras cDNA. As requested, we note here that the manufacturer indicated that this kit was validated with full-length human Kras/Hras and murine Hras, but not murine Kras. Given this, we tested and found that this kit captured FLAG-tagged murine Kras ectopically expressed in HEK-HT cells, while no signal was present in the vector control cells. This finding is consistent with the kit detecting the over-expressed murine Kras protein in the GTP-bound state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

On page 4, it is mentioned that Q61R has slower GTP exchange and hydrolysis rates than G12D. It is worth pointing out that the Burd et al., reference is NRAS while the Rabara et al., reference compared GAP-mediated hydrolysis. However, G12D is interesting because its GTP exchange rate has been reported to be elevated (PMID 8955068 and PMID 24224811), being faster than G13D in biochemical studies, yet this is never discussed.
