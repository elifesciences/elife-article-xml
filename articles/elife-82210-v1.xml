preclinical models. Epidemiologic studies in humans parallel these findings, indicating favorable effects of metformin on longevity and on reducing the incidence and morbidity associated with aging-related diseases. Despite this promise, the full spectrum of molecular effectors responsible for these health benefits remains elusive. Through unbiased screening in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we uncovered a role for genes necessary for ether lipid biosynthesis in the favorable effects of biguanides. We demonstrate that biguanides prompt lifespan extension by stimulating ether lipid biogenesis. Loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery also mitigates lifespan extension attributable to dietary restriction, target of rapamycin (TOR) inhibition, and mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition. A possible mechanistic explanation for this finding is that ether lipids are required for activation of longevity-promoting, metabolic stress defenses downstream of the conserved transcription factor <italic>skn-1</italic>/Nrf. In alignment with these findings, overexpression of a single, key, ether lipid biosynthetic enzyme, <italic>fard-1</italic>/FAR1, is sufficient to promote lifespan extension. These findings illuminate the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery as a novel therapeutic target to promote healthy aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Metformin is the drug most prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes around the world and has been in clinical use since 1950. The drug belongs to a family of compounds known as biguanides which reduce blood sugar, making them an effective treatment against type 2 diabetes.</p><p>More recently, biguanides have been found to have other health benefits, including limiting the growth of various cancer cells and improving the lifespan and long-term health of several model organisms. Epidemiologic studies also suggest that metformin may increase the lifespan of humans and reduce the incidence of age-related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and dementia. Given the safety and effectiveness of metformin, understanding how it exerts these desirable effects may allow scientists to discover new mechanisms to promote healthy aging.</p><p>The roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an ideal organism for studying the lifespan-extending effects of metformin. It has an average lifespan of two weeks, a genome that is relatively easy to manipulate, and a transparent body that enables scientists to observe cellular and molecular events in living worms.</p><p>To discover the genes that enable metformin’s lifespan-extending properties, Cedillo, Ahsan et al. systematically switched off the expression of about 1,000 genes involved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> metabolism. They then screened for genes which impaired the action of biguanides when inactivated. This ultimately led to the identification of a set of genes involved in promoting a longer lifespan. Cedillo, Ahsan et al. then evaluated how these genes impacted other well-described pathways involved in longevity and stress responses.</p><p>The analysis indicated that a biguanide drug called phenformin (which is similar to metformin) increases the synthesis of ether lipids, a class of fats that are critical components of cellular membranes. Indeed, genetically mutating the three major enzymes required for ether lipid production stopped the biguanide from extending the worms’ lifespans. Critically, inactivating these genes also prevented lifespan extension through other known strategies, such as dietary restriction and inhibiting the cellular organelle responsible for producing energy. Cedillo, Ahsan et al. also showed that increasing ether lipid production alters the activity of a well-known longevity and stress response factor called SKN-1, and this change alone is enough to extend the lifespan of worms.</p><p>These findings suggest that promoting the production of ether lipids could lead to healthier aging. However, further studies, including clinical trials, will be required to determine whether this is a viable approach to promote longevity and health in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group

the first line therapy for type 2 diabetes and the most frequently prescribed oral hypoglycemic medication worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inzucchi et al., 2012</xref>). Human epidemiologic studies note an association between metformin use and decreased incidence of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, metformin extends lifespan in invertebrate and vertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>), and therefore may reduce aging-related diseases in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barzilai et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, our understanding of the molecular pathways governing the health-promoting effects of metformin is only just beginning to emerge. Our previous work identified a conserved signaling axis connecting mitochondria, the nuclear pore complex, and mTORC1 inhibition that is required for metformin-mediated extension of lifespan in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and inhibition of growth in worms and human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is not necessary for metformin-induced growth inhibition in <italic>C. elegans</italic> but is required for the drug’s pro-longevity effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, mechanistic studies indicate that the longevity-promoting transcription factor SKN-1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf) is required for biguanide-mediated lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>). The relationship of these metformin longevity response elements to each other and their hierarchy in the biological response to biguanides remains unknown. Thus, the mechanisms by which metformin exacts its beneficial effects on health are likely to be branching and complex.</p><p>The importance of ether lipids, a major structural component of cell membranes, to aging and longevity is not fully established. Ether lipids are involved in the maintenance of general membrane fluidity and in the formation of lipid rafts within microdomains, which are important for promotion of membrane fusion and cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glaser and Gross, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Komljenovic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marrink and Mark, 2004</xref>). Ether lipids have broad roles in the regulation of cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Facciotti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodemer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Teigler et al., 2009</xref>), cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thukkani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2003</xref>), and reduction of oxidative stress through their action as antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morand et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zoeller et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reiss et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maeba et al., 2002</xref>). Humans deficient in ether lipid biogenesis suffer from rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP), a rare genetic disorder, which results in skeletal and facial abnormalities, psychomotor retardation, and is uniformly fatal typically before patients reach their teenage years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 2003</xref>).

Ether lipid precursors are first synthesized by enzymes associated with the membranes of peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh and Hajra, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardeman and van den Bosch, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singh et al., 1993</xref>.) The main enzymes involved in ether lipid biosynthesis within the peroxisomal matrix are glyceronephosphate <italic>O</italic>-acyltransferase (GNPAT) and alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS). Fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 (FAR1) supplies most of the fatty alcohols used to generate the ether linkage in the precursor, 1-<italic>O</italic>-alkyl-glycerol-3-phosphate. This precursor is then trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for acyl chain remodeling to produce various ether lipid products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hua et al., 2017</xref>).

Worms and human cells deficient in ether lipids exhibit compensatory changes in phospholipid species, including increases in phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylcholines containing saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodemer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2013</xref>). However, in contrast to humans, ether lipid deficient nematodes develop to adulthood at a normal rate, providing an opportunity to determine the biological roles of ether lipids in aging and longevity without pleiotropies associated with developmental rate.</p><p>Here, we show that the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery is necessary for lifespan extension stimulated by metformin or the related biguanide phenformin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Metabolomic analysis indicates that phenformin treatment drives increases in multiple phosphatidylethanolamine-containing ether lipids through direct biguanide action on <italic>C. elegans</italic> rather than on the bacterial food source. Interestingly, requirement for the ether lipid biosynthetic genes extends to multiple genetic longevity paradigms, including defective mitochondrial electron transport function (<italic>isp-1</italic>)<italic>,</italic> defective pharyngeal pumping/caloric restriction (<italic>eat-2</italic>), and compromises in mTOR complex 1 activation (<italic>raga-1</italic>). We show that overexpressing <italic>fard-1</italic>, the enzyme that produces fatty alcohols for ether lipid biogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, extends lifespan, supportive of the idea that alterations in the ether lipid landscape alone is sufficient to promote healthy aging. Mechanistically, ether lipids promote longevity downstream of biguanide action through activation of metabolic stress defenses and somatic lipid redistribution driven by the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf. These data suggest that a heretofore unappreciated role for ether lipids is to enable organismal-level, longevity-promoting stress defenses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genes responsible for ether lipid biosynthesis are necessary for biguanide-induced lifespan extension</title><p>A prior screen of ~1000 metabolic genes for RNA interference (RNAi) knockdowns that interfere with the growth-inhibitory properties of a high, 160 mM dose of metformin in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (utilized to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of our assay to identify true epistatic candidates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), yielded <italic>fard-1</italic> and <italic>acl-7</italic>, which are required for ether lipid biosynthesis.

However, as with peroxisomes, phenformin does not alter the number of lipid droplets that are surrounded by FARD-1 or its distribution around lipid droplets (data not shown). Finally, FARD-1::RFP localizes into web-like structures in the <italic>fard-1(oe3)</italic> reporter that may represent smooth ER versus another cellular tubular vesicular network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>), and this localization is also not altered by biguanide treatment.

Our results show that the biguanide phenformin promotes lifespan extension by stimulating biogenesis of ether lipids through direct action in the nematode, prompting longevity-promoting metabolic stress defenses mediated by <italic>skn-1</italic>. The broad importance of ether lipids is demonstrated by their requirement in multiple diverse paradigms of lifespan extension. Our findings also indicate that ether lipid modulation through overexpression of <italic>fard-1</italic> is also sufficient to promote longevity. Thus, ether lipids form a heretofore unappreciated lynchpin of lifespan modulation and are sufficient to support healthy aging through multiple central longevity effectors, including <italic>skn-1</italic>.</p><p>Differences in ether lipid abundance and composition are correlated with diseases of aging. The uniform lethality associated with human genetic ether lipid deficiency, as in the case of patients diagnosed with RCDP and Zellweger syndrome, has made it difficult to study the role of ether lipids in aging and aging-associated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braverman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Motley et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Purdue et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Itzkovitz et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, observational studies demonstrate decreases in certain plasmalogen species in Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting a probable link between ether lipids and aging-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodenowe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2001</xref>). Ether lipids have conflicting roles in cancer; while loss of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery profits cancer cell survival by enhancing resistance to ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zou et al., 2020</xref>), in other contexts, ether lipid deficiency results in impaired pathogenicity in various human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez et al., 2020</xref>). Cancer cells generally have higher levels of ether lipids compared to normal cells, leading others to suggest that ether lipids confer pro-survival benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert and Anderson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Snyder and Wood, 1969</xref>). However, certain ether lipid species have also been reported to have anti-tumor properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaffrès et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur and Bittman, 2014</xref>). Thus, in line with the results we present here, it is critical to understand ether lipids in context. Future work will need to focus on the impact of specific ether lipid species rather than the whole class en masse to understand which may play a beneficial versus detrimental role in health.</p><p>Studies in long-lived animal models suggest that there is an association between ether lipid content and animal longevity, such as in the naked mole-rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>) and the mud clam <italic>Arctica islandica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Munro and Blier, 2012</xref>). Higher plasmalogen levels in naked mole-rat tissues versus mice are speculated to contribute to protection of cellular membranes via a reduction of oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, exceptionally long-lived humans harbor higher levels of phosphatidylcholine-derived, short chained alkyl ether lipids and a lower levels of phosphatidylethanolamine-derived longer chained plasmalogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pradas et al., 2019</xref>), but these associations are of unclear functional significance. Although it is clear from work presented here that ether lipid deficiency in <italic>C. elegans</italic> prevents longevity downstream of mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction, mTOR deficiency, caloric restriction, and biguanides alike, the precise lipid(s) conferring this activity remains unknown. Each of these longevity paradigms has features of nutrient deficiency, energy stress, or nutrient sensing, so it is possible that ether lipids are at least part of the common effector arm conferring benefit in aging to various forms of metabolic stress. It is particularly interesting that <italic>daf-2</italic> loss-of-function does not require ether lipid biosynthetic machinery and yet has a clear requirement for <italic>skn-1.</italic> These observations suggest the very likely possibilities that (1) it is possible to activate <italic>skn-1</italic> through multiple, parallel mechanisms, only some of which require ether lipids and (2) that there are multiple modes of <italic>skn-1</italic> activation that promote longevity, each of which has distinct transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castillo-Quan et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that unsaturated fatty acids and phosphatidylethanolamine ether lipids are essential to the health-promoting effects of biguanides. Although we see major shifts in abundance of alkenyl ether lipids, evidence of the necessity of specific ether lipids in biguanide-induced longevity and for promoting healthy aging awaits the ability to modulate the level of specific ether lipids. Additionally, disruption of ether lipid biosynthesis has been shown to increase the proportion of stearate (18:0) and other saturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, at this time, we cannot rule out the possibility that biguanide-stimulated alterations in ether lipid biosynthesis serves to divert accumulation of lipid species that are detrimental to lifespan, for instance, saturated fatty acids. Nonetheless, considering our finding that ether lipids prompt metabolic stress defenses, this alternative mechanism is less likely. Definitive proof will require a deeper understanding of the regulation of specific steps dictating the synthesis and modification of ether lipids of different fatty alcohol and fatty acid composition.</p><p>Based upon our findings, ether lipid synthesis is likely to be regulated post-translationally by biguanide treatment. The demonstrated increases in plasmalogens and specific ether lipids are both consistent with increases in activity of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery. While we do not understand the mechanism for the increased activity of ether lipid synthesizing enzymes, the decreases in mRNAs for <italic>acl-7</italic>, <italic>ads-1</italic>, and <italic>fard-1</italic> prompted by phenformin treatment and by overexpression of <italic>fard-1</italic> alike invoke negative feedback of the end product(s) of ether lipid biogenesis on transcription of genes encoding ether lipid biosynthetic enzymes. It should be noted that this possibility is consistent with previous work showing that higher levels of ether lipids promote proteasomal degradation of peroxisomal Far1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Honsho et al., 2010</xref>). Colocalization of the fatty alcohol reductase, FARD-1, with both peroxisomes and lipid droplets is similarly not impacted by biguanides. We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that the exogenous, overexpressed nature of FARD-1::RFP in these experiments may result in a hyperactivated ether lipid biosynthesis state, thereby locking FARD-1::RFP localization in an activated configuration that cannot be further induced with biguanide treatment. Future studies leveraging endogenously tagged FARD-1 animals will be required to resolve this caveat. Finally, further investigation into the precise molecular interactions between FARD-1 protein and other organelles will be required to further understand how FARD-1 and the other ether lipid biosynthetic enzymes are regulated by biguanides and in aging.</p><p>Strikingly, our data demonstrate for the first time that ether lipids are required for phenformin to activate metabolic defenses downstream of the stress- and metabolism-responsive transcription factor <italic>skn-1</italic>/Nrf. Phenformin drives age-dependent somatic depletion of fat (Asdf), a phenotype we previously reported upon genetic activation of <italic>skn-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lynn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nhan et al., 2019</xref>). Based upon our own work, biguanides do not stimulate canonical <italic>skn-1</italic> antioxidant defenses such as <italic>gst-4</italic> expression, in contrast to the subtle effects seen in the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>). Indeed, we observe a significant decrease in <italic>gst-4</italic> expression with phenformin treatment, reciprocally balanced by increased innate immune <italic>dod-24</italic> expression in a manner dependent upon <italic>skn-1</italic> and the ether lipid machinery. We suggest that <italic>skn-1</italic> is uniquely required for metabolic stress defenses downstream of metformin such as Asdf, rather than canonical oxidative or proteostatic defenses. Thus, the requirement for ether lipids in Asdf activation by phenformin confirm that this class of lipids plays a heretofore unappreciated role in a distinct form of <italic>skn-1</italic> activation mimicked by genetic forms of <italic>skn-1</italic> activation that we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lynn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nhan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Lifespan extension resulting from overexpression of <italic>fard-1</italic> shows mechanistic similarities and dissimilarities from biguanide action in longevity. Curiously, and concordant with the idea that ether lipids participate in the activation of <italic>skn-1</italic>, <italic>fard-1</italic> overexpression requires intact <italic>skn-1</italic> and AMPK action. Discordantly, biguanides do not require <italic>daf-16</italic>/FoxO, but <italic>fard-1</italic> overexpression does. There are many possible explanations for this. It could be that <italic>fard-1</italic> overexpression alters the ether lipid landscape in a manner not analogous to biguanide treatment, either in distinct tissues or with regard to different ether lipid molecular species, and that these differences have distinct molecular effectors. Second, the degree of ether lipid alteration may be different following biguanide treatment vs. <italic>fard-1</italic> overexpression. We have not explored whether overexpression of <italic>acl-7</italic> and/or <italic>ads-1</italic> similarly extend lifespan. Further work will be needed to determine the lifespan benefit attributable to augmentation of peroxisomal <italic>acl-7</italic> or <italic>ads-1</italic> activity, and whether any benefit is mechanistically similar to <italic>fard-1</italic> overexpression. Finally, it is highly likely based upon the myriad potential direct and indirect sites of action of biguanides in aging, including but not limited to mitochondria, lysosomes, the nuclear pore complex, mTOR, and AMPK that distinct effector mechanisms are required by biguanides versus <italic>fard-1</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabreiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pryor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wheaton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onken and Driscoll, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Espada et al., 2020</xref>). In spite of the complexity of the biological responses to ether lipids, an opportunity lies ahead: further study of ether lipid roles in aging can provide insights into the full spectrum of signals that favorably impact positive effectors of longevity.</p><p>In aggregate, data presented here indicate that ether lipid biosynthesis plays a broader role in aging than previously described. The necessity of the ether lipid machinery in metformin- and phenformin-stimulated lifespan extension and in multiple longevity paradigms indicates that ether lipids serve as a lynchpin through which lifespan is modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Our demonstration that overexpression of <italic>fard-1</italic> alone results in lifespan extension provides an exciting opportunity to identify ether lipids that promote health and the effector mechanisms through which they act. Finally, these results support the exciting possibility that modulation of ether lipids pharmacologically or even dietarily may provide a new potential therapeutic target in aging and aging-related diseases.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation for the role of the ether lipid biosynthetic machinery in multiple pro-longevity paradigms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of ether lipid action in biguanide-prompted lifespan extension.

RNAi clones were grown for 15 hr in Luria Broth (LB) containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin with shaking at 37°C. The stationary phase culture was then collected, concentrated through centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in LB to 20% of the original culture volume; 250 μL of each RNAi clone concentrate was added to RNAi plates and allowed to dry at least 24 hr prior to adding biguanide.

Briefly, synchronized L1 animals were seeded onto NGM (for mutant treatment) or RNAi plates (for RNAi) and allowed to grow until the L4 to YA transition stage. On day 0 of adulthood as indexed in the figure legend, ~50–60 L4/YA worms per plate (unless otherwise noted) were transferred onto fresh NGM or RNAi plates. These NGM and RNAi plates were supplemented with 30 μM and 100 μM FUdR to suppress progeny production, respectively. For biguanide treatment, about ~55–60 synchronized L1 animals (unless otherwise noted) were seeded onto plates containing 50 mM metformin or 4.5 mM phenformin. Based upon power calculations for log-rank analysis, minimum N of 50 (per group) was chosen to satisfy α=0.05, β=0.2, and effect size = 20% difference in lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petrascheck and Miller, 2017</xref>). At the L4/YA stage, these worms were transferred to plates containing biguanide treatment and FUdR for the remainder of their life. For experiments performed without the use of FUdR, animals were transferred to freshly seeded RNAi and drug supplemented plates every 2 days between day 0 and day 10 of adulthood, ensuring no crossover contamination of progeny or laid eggs on the lifespan plates until the animals cease the reproductive stage. Dead worms were counted every other day, and scoring investigators were blinded as to the experimental group/treatment until the conclusion of each experiment. All lifespans performed include same-day N2 wild-type (wt) controls examined simultaneously with experimental test animals in each study. Statistical analysis was performed with online OASIS2 resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Body size determination of <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We measured worm body size in response to biguanide treatment by imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).

Briefly, 5000 synchronous mid-L4 animals were sonicated with a probe sonicator on high intensity in a microfuge tube in 100–250 µL total volume. Following sonication, lipids were extracted in 3:1 methanol:methylene chloride following the addition of acetyl chloride in sealed borosilicate glass tubes, which were then incubated in a 75°C water bath for 1 hr. Derivatized fatty acids and fatty alcohols were neutralized with 7% potassium carbonate, extracted with hexane, and washed with acetonitrile prior to evaporation under nitrogen. Lipids were resuspended in 200 µL of hexane and analyzed on an Agilent GC/MS equipped with a Supelcowax-10 column as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pino and Soukas, 2020</xref>). Fatty acids and alcohols are indicated as the normalized peak area of the total of derivatized fatty acids and alcohols detected in the sample. Based upon power calculation for pairwise comparison, a minimum n of 3 biological replicates (per group) was chosen to satisfy α=0.05, β=0.2, and effect size = 50% with σ=20%.

Briefly, collection for LC/MS-MS processing comprised of three replicates of these four strains that were independently treated with vehicle (ddH<sub>2</sub>O) and 4.5 mM phenformin on 10 cm NGM plates. Based upon power calculations, as for GC/MS, a minimum n of 3 biological replicates (per group) was chosen to satisfy α=0.05, β=0.2, and effect size = 50% with σ=20%, though the power is only expected to hold for the first significant difference detected. Analyses were blinded to the investigator conducting the experiment and mass spectrometry calculations until the conclusion of each experiment when aggregate statistics were computed. A total of ~6000 animals (2×10 cm plates, 3000 worms per plate) were utilized per sample. These worms were washed with M9 (4×), concentrated into 200 μL of M9, and then flash frozen with liquid nitrogen in 1.5 mL Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes. Worm pellets were transferred to 2 mL impact resistant homogenization tubes containing 300 mg of 1 mm zirconium beads and 1 mL of 90:10 ethanol:water. Using a Precellys 24 tissue homogenizer, samples were homogenized in three 10 s cycles at 6400 Hz followed by 2 min of sonication. Samples were then placed at –20°C for 1 hr to facilitate protein precipitation. Samples were transferred to 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C.

Lipidomic data was acquired by injecting 20 μL of sample onto a Phenomenex Kinetex F5 2.6 μm (2.1×100 mm) column at 40°C and flowing at 0.35 mL/min. Metabolites were eluted using (A) water containing 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile:isopropanol (50:50) containing 0.1% formic acid using the following gradient: 0% B from 0 to 1 min, 0–50% B from 1 to 6 min, 50–100% B from 6 to 17 min, and 100% B hold from 17 to 20 min. Compounds were detected using a Thermo Scientific QExactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source operating in positive and negative ion mode with the following source parameters: sheath gas flow of 40 units, aux gas flow of 15 units, sweep gas flow of 2 units, spray voltage of ±3.5 kV, capillary temperature of 265°C, aux gas temp of 350°C, S-lens RF at 45. Data was collected using an MS1 scan event followed by four DDA scan events using an isolation window of 1.0 m/z and a normalized collision energy of 30 arbitrary units. For MS1 scan events, scan range of m/z 100–1500, mass resolution of 17.5K, AGC of 1e<sup>6</sup> and inject time of 50 ms was used. For tandem MS acquisition, mass resolution of 17.5K, AGC 5e<sup>5</sup> and inject time of 80 ms was used.

Missing and zero values in the data matrix were imputed via replacement with 1/5th of the minimum positive value for each variable. Abundance values were subsequently filtered based on interquartile range (reducing the compound list to the 2500 most variable compounds), and log<sub>10</sub> transformed. Quantile normalization was then performed, followed with division by the standard deviation of each variable (auto-scaling). Normalized abundance values for each metabolite were then extracted based upon MS/MS signatures for phosphatidylethanolamine ether lipids and assessed for statistical significance via one-way ANOVA followed by false discovery rate (FDR) control using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Post hoc testing was then performed using Fisher’s LSD to evaluate pairwise comparison significance. Metabolites were considered differentially abundant in any one condition with an FDR controlled p-value &lt;0.05. The top 25 metabolites across treatment (ranked by ANOVA f statistic and FDR value) were visualized using a heatmap of Euclidean distance measurements, with Ward clustering of samples and normalized compound abundances included.

The longevity data here all appear to have been collected in the background of the fertility inhibitor FuDR. Although the use of FuDR is common in the field and justified, synergistic effects have been documented. The authors should address the question as to whether the key finding of ether lipid requirements for biguanide-mediated longevity is independent of the presence of FuDR.</p><p>– The authors state that biguanides do not stimulate expression of the skn-1 antioxidant defense effector gst-4 (Discussion, lines 580 – 582), and cite Cabreiro et al. 2013 and Onken and Driscoll, 2010 to support this – in fact, both these papers demonstrate the opposite, showing that biguanide treatment does result in increased gst-4 expression. This calls into question the author's suggestion that biguanides activate ether lipid biosynthesis and skn-1 signaling to trigger metabolic stress defenses rather than canonical oxidative stress pathways.</p><p>Minimally, this needs to be straightened out in terms of accurate citation and discussion.</p><p>Better, the argument might be addressed by looking at daf-16 and skn-1 downstream target expression with biguanide treatment or in fard-1(oe) mutants with and without ether lipid biosynthesis gene disruptions. Resistance to oxidative stress could be tested under similar conditions.</p><p>Less critical points that should be addressed:</p><p>The paper would benefit from just a little bit more description of the original genetic screen, although published in Wu 2016. The endpoint of the original screen was for growth/body size changes in high metformin; how did data translate to the longevity endpoint focus here?</p><p>Metformin is used in the clinic, phenformin is much less prescribed due to side effect complications. The authors do address reasons they chose to use phenformin in most studies, but the clinical differences between metformin and phenformin underscore how interesting it is to ask the question as to what the metabolic differences might be. A complete analysis is beyond this paper's scope, but simple testing for key findings, even simple lipid droplet impact and fat distribution using metformin (as in Figure 6) could define lipid distribution outcomes as a common feature; or possibly identify a difference.</p><p>One naturally wonders whether the over-expression of enzymes ads-1 and/or acl-7 would also be bioactive. I do not think these are essential studies to add, but if the authors have the information they should add it to the paper.</p><p>– Figure 1-B-D; E-G seems to share the same WT control for all presented data, authors should indicate that all tests run in the same control experiment if this is the case, and should confirm in methods that same-day WT controls are run in the same experimental test of each study.</p><p>– ads-1 and acl-7 mutants exhibit modest increases in longevity with metformin treatment; acl-7 + phen might be different at end stages. Authors do comment that the response is blunted but some note that not all impact of the drug is eliminated should be added.</p><p>– Although the text suggests fard-1, ads-1, acl-7 mutants are null or reduction of function, the assignment as to whether a particular locus is null, missense is not clear; please add a comment in methods.</p><p>In Figure 2 —figure supplement 2, the authors examine the localization of exogenously expressed FARD-1, and state that the localization of FARD-1 is not regulated by biguanide treatment (Results, lines 286 – 304). As FARD-1 is likely overexpressed in these experiments (as the authors themselves point out in later lifespan experiments using the fard-1 (oe1) construct, Figure 5A), it is possible that the localization pattern here is the result of an &quot;activated&quot; ether biosynthesis pathway state, and that further stimulation with biguanide treatment might not impact FARD-1 localization.</p><p>This caveat should be discussed; better for the authors to examine localization with FARD-1 expressed at endogenous levels with and without phenformin treatment.</p><p>The authors show that expression of ether lipid biosynthesis genes does not increase with biguanide treatment (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2; Results lines 305 – 313), and FARD-1::RFP levels decrease with phenformin treatment (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2M) and suggest that &quot;post-translational negative feedback of ether lipids on the ether lipid biosynthetic pathway, as has been previously reported&quot; (Results lines 311 – 313)--a citation for these results should be added.</p><p>These data argue against phenformin and fard-1 overexpression triggering downstream pathways in the same way. Although fard-1 oe increases lifespan in a manner that is not additive with phenformin treatment (Figure 5 A and B), fard-1 overexpression evidently does not trigger the same negative feedback mechanism, as overexpressed FARD-1 levels shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 M appear to be high in vehicle controls, and are lowered with phenformin treatment. If both fard-1 overexpression and phenformin treatment signal similarly to trigger a post-translational negative feedback mechanism (which would presumably be important for lifespan extension), one would expect similar FARD-1 levels in fard-1 oe animals with and without phenformin treatment. It is possible that fard-1 overexpression simply overwhelms – or is insufficient to trigger – negative feedback mechanisms. Data showing overexpressed fard-1 mRNA and FARD-1 protein levels vs. endogenously expressed fard-1 and FARD-1, with and without biguanide treatment, would help clarify these seemingly paradoxical results.</p><p>Figure 3D (D-H) RNAi of three fatty acid desaturases (D-F) two fatty acid elongases (G and H) …blunt phenformin-mediated lifespan extension in wild type worms.</p><p>fat-1 RNAi extends lifespan, phen treatment brings this close to wt +phen, and there is no significant difference wt+phen vs. fat-1(RNAi) + phen; it might be technically reasonable to indicate the response is blunted (percent increase) but fat-1 does not appear to be all that impactful on longevity. These data do not impress regarding the importance of fat-1 in phenformin outcome; the discussion should be toned down or eliminated.</p><p>Page 439 Figure 6 legend Asdf in 3, independent ether..comma not needed.</p><p>In Figure 6, the authors show that phenformin inhibits fat accumulation in young adults in a manner that requires ether lipid biosynthesis gene expression. As a skn-1 gain-of-function mutant has a similar fat reduction phenotype that does not appear to be additive with phenformin treatment, and because lifespan extension with phenformin and lipid ether biosynthesis gene fard-1 overexpression requires skn-1, the authors suggest that biguanides increase ether lipid biosynthesis to trigger a low-fat, pro-longevity metabolic state through skn-1. To support this model, the authors could further explore the link between phenformin, ether lipid biosynthesis, and skn-1: is skn-1 expression required for the low-fat phenotype seen with phenformin treatment? Is the expression of ether lipid biosynthesis genes needed for the low-fat phenotype seen in skn-1 gf mutants? Do fard-1(oe) mutants display a similar low-fat phenotype? What is the state of ether lipid levels in skn-1 gf mutants (as compared to phenformin-treated animals in Figure 2E and fard-1 overexpressors in Figure 5G)?</p><p>Figure 5C-text suggests all three kds disrupt, not just ads-1, why not include data for other kds in the main figures?</p><p>Figure 7B model: Dietary restriction executed is really one type of a complex response, so it is a bit of an over-extension to extend to DR in general; this can be addressed by indicating eat-2 DR in the box. Comments on DR would be more compelling if a second model of DR-associated longevity were tested.</p><p>daf-16 is not needed for biguanide-associated longevity, but it is for fard-1(oe)-mediated longevity -either explain why the dashed lines are used for daf-16 in the legend or better adjust the figure to visually reflect this complexity.</p><p>Discussion line 499 start. Our results show that the biguanides metformin and phenformin promote lifespan extension by stimulating the biogenesis of ether lipids, prompting longevity promoting, metabolic stress defenses mediated by skn-1.</p><p>Data relate to phenformin action but not necessarily metformin. Please adjust.</p><p>Possible point for additional discussion. Metformin has been documented to intersect with the bacterial food source to influence longevity PMID: 23540700. This manuscript does not engage that story, but I would encourage authors to add a small statement regarding their take on the interface of the &quot;microbiome&quot; or bacterial influence on biguanide action and possibly ether lipid synthesis.</p><p>Finally, as the authors point out, identification of the specific lipids necessary for promoting healthy aging is not feasible here; with which I totally agree. The actual mechanism by which ether lipid synthesizing enzymes modulate extended survival for the isp-1, eat-2, and raga-1 backgrounds or +phenformin is not really defined by this work. Still, the highlight of a critical biosynthetic pathway in biguanide outcomes and the implication of SKN-1/NRF2 in the biology is of sufficient importance in the field to merit high-profile publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Key points to address:</p><p>– Address the impact of biguanides on bacterial growth (OP50, HT115) experimentally e.g. bacterial growth, the impact of heat-killed bacteria on key biguanide phenotypes, and their relationship to ether lipids. The impact of biguanide concentration should also be considered in this regard.</p><p>– Address whether different amounts of biguanide cause the same effect on ether lipids.</p><p>– Address the direct genetic connections between skn-1 and fard-1 (etc) e.g. by creating a fard-1; skn-1 gof double and examining fat +/- Phenformin. Alternatively, could this be examined using fat measurements from aak-2 and daf-16 +/- fard-1? It would be interesting to see if the mechanism is the same for all of these longevity processes and make the study of even broader relevance.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>– Are the error bars in Figure 1 S1A correct? The data is normalised to 1. I am also unclear of the logic here. Metformin makes the worms smaller, but fard-1 and acl-7 RNAi reverse this? Is this the same with the mutants?</p><p>– Line 283 – 'the' missing? + other punctuation errors scattered about.</p><p>– The theory that the web-like structures marked by FARD-1::RFP are the ER is intriguing. What magnification are these images taken at in Figure 2 S2? Readers would need that information to decipher this.</p><p>– The authors mention that a pathway of negative feedback on ether lipid biosynthesis has been reported please could you supply that reference as it is currently missing – line 313.</p><p>– How are the numbers of lipid droplets measured in Figure 6? Per area? Per whole worm?</p><p>– Please address the issue of skn-1 isoforms in the text. You have carried out skn-1 RNAi which in theory takes out all isoforms – have you confirmed this? My issue is whether the skn-1 gof mutants and the skn-1 RNAi are true opposites of each other. It is also important as you refer to it as skn-1/Nrf2 specifically. You could just remove the 2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82210.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Experiments were done in the presence of FuDR.

To address whether biguanide-mediated ether lipid induction relies on live bacteria, we leveraged a robust strategy to prevent both bacterial replication and metabolic activity of the OP50-1 <italic>E. coli</italic> food source via pre-treatment with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for two hours prior to seeding on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates<sup>3</sup>. We confirm that 1% PFA treatment completely prevents bacterial replication, and that the pre-treatment process itself does not significantly abrogate bacterial titer production compared to standard OP50-1 plate seeding protocols (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2A). Using this approach, we verify through lipidomic FAME GC/MS analysis that biguanides drive somatic fatty acid depletion and increases 16:0 DMA species. Importantly, these effects do not rely on the OP50-1 food source being alive, suggesting that the effects of biguanides on increasing ether lipid biosynthesis and altering somatic lipid stores do not act directly through alterations in bacterial growth or metabolism (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2B-G). We additionally include lifespan analyses that reveal that biguanides still extend lifespan on metabolically killed OP50-1, and that ether lipid deficiency in <italic>ads-1</italic> mutant animals completely abrogates both metformin and phenformin-mediated lifespan extension, even when grown on metabolically inactivated and dead bacteria (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3). Combined, these data rigorously advance the conclusion that the effects of biguanides on ether lipid biosynthesis and lifespan extension occurs directly through the nematode, and do not rely upon alterations in bacterial growth or metabolism to exert their pro-longevity effects. We include discussion of these new results in lines 509 to 547. Given that these results contrast with previously published work by others, and the importance to the field, we plan a whole separate manuscript about biguanide effects directly on nematode lifespan versus indirectly through the bacteria. As such, we do not dwell extensively on the subject herein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please explain in the text why different biguanide concentrations were used in different experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify the uses of different concentrations of biguanides in our assays. We wish to clarify that our current study is focused on the role of ether lipid machinery in modulation of lifespan and healthy aging – as such, we focused on genetic and biochemical experiments leveraging minimally lifespan extending doses of biguanides (4.5 mM phenformin and 50 mM metformin) to identify epistatic links and interactions, as utilized by several independent laboratories <sup>4-9</sup>. The goal of the 160 mM dosage of metformin used in our prior genetic screens <sup>10</sup> and subsequently highlighted in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A is to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our discovery approach to identify effectors of the biological action of biguanides. The 160 mM dose we leveraged causes potent growth inhibition <sup>10</sup>. Our prior published work indicates that using this dose to look for gene inactivations that block the growth inhibitory effects of the drug can also identify longevity effectors of metformin<sup>10</sup>. Thus, we used a similar strategy here to identify <italic>fard-1</italic> and <italic>acl-7,</italic> which were initially identified as gene knockdowns that block the growth inhibitory effects of 160 mM metformin. Thereafter, lower doses of biguanides are used (4.5 mM phenformin and 50 mM metformin) to elucidate requirements of the ether lipid machinery in biguanide-prompted longevity. We succinctly modify in the text the reasoning for the different biguanide concentrations used in this work (lines 135 to 153).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please address in the text the reviewer's question on the role of oxidative stress and the role of gst-4.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for allowing us to highlight this important clarification. We have performed reporter imaging experiments in the <italic>gst-4</italic> transcriptional reporter strain <italic>gst-4p::GFP::NLS</italic> (included as Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A-B), suggesting that biguanides do not significantly activate <italic>gst-4</italic> expression in either OP50 and HT115 dietary sources, and that phenformin treatment conversely significantly reduced <italic>gst-4</italic> expression. We have repeated this experiment numerous times and at multiple timepoints in the lifespan. In fact, the analysis of <italic>gst-4</italic> expression indicates that metformin and phenformin <italic><bold>decrease</bold> gst-4</italic> expression. These data substantiate our claim that the requirement of SKN-1 activity downstream of biguanides to mediate somatic lipid depletion and pro-longevity outcomes is not due to a <italic>gst-4</italic> mediated antioxidant role. We additionally include reporter imaging data for expression of <italic>dod-24</italic>, a metabolic defense stress response factor known to be transcriptionally regulated by SKN-1<sup>2</sup>, revealing that biguanides activate <italic>dod-24</italic> expression via a mechanism dependent on both ether lipid machinery and SKN-1 activity (Figure 6F). Concordant with our prior work<sup>2</sup>, there are multiple “flavors” of <italic>skn-1</italic> activation, and the metabolic “flavor” is oppositely regulated to oxidative defenses (thus leading to increased expression of <italic>dod-24</italic> and decreased expression of <italic>gst-4</italic>). Given that these results conflict with the literature and the prevailing notions in the field. we describe these results in the revised text in the Results section in lines 497 to 508 and in the Discussion in lines 659 to 673.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

As noted in Author Response 1, we have performed lifespan experiments without the use of FUdR (included as Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) for wild type and ether lipid deficient mutants treated with either metformin or phenformin in biological triplicate. These new data reveal that the requirements for the ether lipid machinery in biguanide-mediated lifespan extension are independent of the effects of FUdR, with abrogation of lifespan extension seen in rates comparable to that when using FUdR (Figure 1B-G and Supplementary file 1). We address these important confirmatory results in the text under lines 160 to 165.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have corrected the discussion of the Onken and Driscoll, 2010 and Cabreiro et al., 2013 citations to highlight the previously published observations of a moderate ~1.5 to 2-fold increase in <italic>gst-4</italic> expression with 50 mM metformin treatment<sup>4,5</sup>. We have attempted numerous times to reproduce this induction result with both 50 mM metformin and 4.5 mM phenformin administration, at multiple times across the lifespan. We include as Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A-B data that fails to replicate the subtle increase in <italic>gst-4</italic> expression previously reported on either OP50-1 or HT115 food sources, and instead show that phenformin treatment significantly reduces <italic>gst-4</italic> expression. We include as Figure 6F data that indicate that phenformin treatment activates expression of the metabolic stress defense factor <italic>dod-24</italic>, a known transcriptional target of the non-canonical SKN-1 innate immune effector regulon<sup>2</sup>. The induction of <italic>dod-24p::GFP</italic> expression is both <italic>skn-1</italic> and ether lipid machinery dependent, analogous to the dependencies seen with adult somatic lipid depletion (Figure 6B-E). Thus, we argue that biguanides exert their pro-longevity outcomes via alterations in somatic lipid levels and metabolic stress defense response through an ether lipid and SKN-1 signaling axis independent of the transcription factor’s known role in inducing an oxidative stress response. We have included discussion of these new results in Results (lines 497-508) and (659-673) of the manuscript. The decrease in <italic>gst-4</italic> expression seen with phenformin treatment is potentially of great interest, suggesting that phenformin treatment may increase the sensitivity of animals to oxidative stressors. We are focusing on follow ups of this result in manuscripts currently in preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Less critical points that should be addressed:</p><p>3. The paper would benefit from just a little bit more description of the original genetic screen, although published in Wu 2016. The endpoint of the original screen was for growth/body size changes in high metformin; how did data translate to the longevity endpoint focus here?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to highlight the rationale for our original genetic screen in integration of growth and longevity outcomes. In our original study, we leveraged an RNAi library consisting of ~1000 genes annotated with a metabolic gene ontology to identify genetic elements required for metformin-mediated growth inhibition, to illuminate the physiologic mechanisms that regulate the drug’s known anti-neoplastic and anti-growth proliferative effects. We identified a pathway linking mitochondrial perturbation to improved nuclear pore complex (NPC) and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking function, resulting in reduced mTORC1 signaling and activation of biguanide response element CeACAD10 to induce growth inhibition<sup>10</sup>. We surprisingly found that improved NPC fidelity is not only required for the growth inhibitory properties of the drug, but were also necessary for the pro-longevity outcomes, suggesting a unified mechanism for both anti-cancer and lifespan extension<sup>10</sup>. Given our previous success in identifying genetic elements that bridge both the growth inhibitory and pro-longevity mechanisms of the drug, we were interested in identifying other hits from our genetic screen that may be required for both mechanisms, leading to our current study interrogating the role of ether lipid machinery in regulation of biguanide-mediated lifespan extension. We have amended the text in lines 135 to 153 to succinctly describe this transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

As FARD-1 is likely overexpressed in these experiments (as the authors themselves point out in later lifespan experiments using the fard-1 (oe1) construct, Figure 5A), it is possible that the localization pattern here is the result of an &quot;activated&quot; ether biosynthesis pathway state, and that further stimulation with biguanide treatment might not impact FARD-1 localization.</p><p>10.

The authors show that expression of ether lipid biosynthesis genes does not increase with biguanide treatment (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2; Results lines 305 – 313), and FARD-1::RFP levels decrease with phenformin treatment (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2M) and suggest that &quot;post-translational negative feedback of ether lipids on the ether lipid biosynthetic pathway, as has been previously reported&quot; (Results lines 311 – 313)--a citation for these results should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight and have included the citation for Honsho, et al. 2010 in lines 312 and 648<sup>1</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. These data argue against phenformin and fard-1 overexpression triggering downstream pathways in the same way. Although fard-1 oe increases lifespan in a manner that is not additive with phenformin treatment (Figure 5 A and B), fard-1 overexpression evidently does not trigger the same negative feedback mechanism, as overexpressed FARD-1 levels shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2 M appear to be high in vehicle controls, and are lowered with phenformin treatment. If both fard-1 overexpression and phenformin treatment signal similarly to trigger a post-translational negative feedback mechanism (which would presumably be important for lifespan extension), one would expect similar FARD-1 levels in fard-1 oe animals with and without phenformin treatment. It is possible that fard-1 overexpression simply overwhelms – or is insufficient to trigger – negative feedback mechanisms. Data showing overexpressed fard-1 mRNA and FARD-1 protein levels vs. endogenously expressed fard-1 and FARD-1, with and without biguanide treatment, would help clarify these seemingly paradoxical results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion, and we have performed the experiment as suggested.

These results indicate that FARD-1 overexpression indeed reduces native <italic>fard-1</italic> expression by ~40%, and that biguanide treatment does not additively reduce <italic>fard-1</italic> expression even further. Interestingly, biguanide treatment appears to reduce the expression of exogenously overexpressed <italic>fard-1</italic> by about ~60%, consistent with the reduction in RFP-tagged protein levels shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2M. We speculate that the discrepancy in feedback mechanisms between the endogenous and exogenous <italic>fard-1</italic> transcripts is likely due to the design of the overexpressor, as the <italic>fard-1(oe)</italic> strains in this manuscript all utilize a synthetic <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’ UTR to enhance permissive expression in all <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic cells, and likely maintain expression as a multicopy integrant in the genome, thus overwhelming negative feedback mechanisms. Indeed, several studies have suggested that the 3’ UTR structure of several mRNAs mediate negative feedback loops to finely tune protein expression patterns<sup>12,13</sup>. Combined, these results suggest that FARD-1 overexpression and biguanide treatment regulate endogenous <italic>fard-1</italic> levels through similar mechanisms, but the differential UTR utilization and potential for multicopy integration may explain their distinct lifespan promoting dependencies.

In Figure 6, the authors show that phenformin inhibits fat accumulation in young adults in a manner that requires ether lipid biosynthesis gene expression. As a skn-1 gain-of-function mutant has a similar fat reduction phenotype that does not appear to be additive with phenformin treatment, and because lifespan extension with phenformin and lipid ether biosynthesis gene fard-1 overexpression requires skn-1, the authors suggest that biguanides increase ether lipid biosynthesis to trigger a low-fat, pro-longevity metabolic state through skn-1. To support this model, the authors could further explore the link between phenformin, ether lipid biosynthesis, and skn-1: is skn-1 expression required for the low-fat phenotype seen with phenformin treatment? Is the expression of ether lipid biosynthesis genes needed for the low-fat phenotype seen in skn-1 gf mutants? Do fard-1(oe) mutants display a similar low-fat phenotype? What is the state of ether lipid levels in skn-1 gf mutants (as compared to phenformin-treated animals in Figure 2E and fard-1 overexpressors in Figure 5G)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these highly insightful suggestions to better delineate the link between SKN-1 and ether lipid synthesis with biguanide-mediated low-fat metabolic states.

Possible point for additional discussion. Metformin has been documented to intersect with the bacterial food source to influence longevity PMID: 23540700. This manuscript does not engage that story, but I would encourage authors to add a small statement regarding their take on the interface of the &quot;microbiome&quot; or bacterial influence on biguanide action and possibly ether lipid synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this critical suggestion, which was additionally suggested by Reviewer #2 and the Reviewing Editor for experimental evaluation. As indicated in Author Response 3, we have performed FAME GC/MS of Adult Day 1 nematodes treated with or without phenformin and grown on live or metabolically dead OP50-1 <italic>E. coli</italic> food sources<sup>3</sup>. These analyses rigorously show that biguanides increase nematode ether lipid levels independent of any indirect effects on bacterial growth, proliferation, or metabolism (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). Compellingly, metabolically inactivating the bacterial food source does not impair the ability of the ether lipid machinery to abrogate biguanide-mediated lifespan extension (Figure 2 —figure supplement 4). Additionally, our previously published study interrogating the role of CeACAD10 in regulation of metformin action in growth and cancer highlights that UV-mediated inactivation of OP50-1 growth does not affect metformin-mediated growth inhibition, and that direct injection of metformin into the animal is sufficient to drive CeACAD10 biguanide response activation<sup>14</sup>. Combined, these data rigorously exclude the possibility that biguanides alter ether lipid levels or the activity of the machinery via indirect effects through bacterial metabolism. We include a new section in Results to highlight this important statement (lines 509 to 547) and include a brief description of these results in the Discussion (lines 577 to 580).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21.

Still, the highlight of a critical biosynthetic pathway in biguanide outcomes and the implication of SKN-1/NRF2 in the biology is of sufficient importance in the field to merit high-profile publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We again thank the reviewer for their support of our work and for their excellent feedback, which greatly strengthened the mechanistic underpinnings of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Key points to address:</p><p>1. Address the impact of biguanides on bacterial growth (OP50, HT115) experimentally e.g. bacterial growth, the impact of heat-killed bacteria on key biguanide phenotypes, and their relationship to ether lipids. The impact of biguanide concentration should also be considered in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion, and we have performed the experiment as suggested. As indicated in Author Responses 3 and 22, we have performed FAME GC/MS of adult day 1 nematodes treated with or without phenformin and grown on live or metabolically dead OP50-1 <italic>E. coli</italic> food sources using a rigorously established 1% PFA treatment protocol <sup>3</sup>. This PFA treatment protocol, as opposed to heat or UV killing protocols, both completely kill and metabolically inactivate the food source (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2A), making this a more reliable, uniformly consistent strategy to eliminate bacterial growth and metabolism as confounding variables in lipidomic and lifespan analyses <sup>3</sup>. These analyses rigorously show that biguanides increase relative nematode ether lipid levels independent of any indirect effects on bacterial growth, proliferation, or metabolism (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2D-G). Compellingly, metabolic inactivation of the bacterial food source neither impairs the lifespan extending effects of biguanides nor impairs the ability of the ether lipid machinery to abrogate biguanide-mediated lifespan extension (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3A-F). Combined, these data rigorously exclude the possibility that biguanides alter ether lipid levels or the activity of the machinery via indirect effects through bacterial growth or metabolism. We performed experiments utilizing a final dosage of 4.5 mM phenformin and 50 mM metformin, both of which are minimally required to robustly and reproducibly extend <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan, as corroborated and utilized by several independent laboratories<sup>7-10</sup>. Thus, these data strengthen the conclusion that phenformin and metformin prompt ether lipid-dependent increases in lifespan via direct effects on the worm, i.e. independently of biguanide effects on bacteria. Given that these results contrast with previously published work by others, and the importance to the field, we plan a whole separate manuscript about biguanide effects directly on nematode lifespan versus indirectly through the bacteria. As such we do not dwell extensively on the subject herein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Address whether different amounts of biguanide cause the same effect on ether lipids.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We again wish to clarify to the reviewer that the intention of this study is to illuminate the requirements for ether lipid biosynthesis on the pro-longevity mechanism of biguanides. As such, we utilized doses of metformin and phenformin that minimally robustly extend <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (4.5 mM phenformin and 50 mM metformin) without resulting in negative pleiotropies, as utilized by multiple independent laboratories to identify genetic regulators of the drug<sup>7-10</sup>. The supraphysiological 160 mM dosage of metformin used in our prior genetic screens was only initially utilized to identify biguanide response elements. Given that the prior literature shows that higher doses of biguanides do not positively influence <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan<sup>5,7</sup>, even if additive effects on ether lipids were evident, we argue that they are not relevant to the major thrust of this manuscript on longevity-promoting effects of biguanides and ether lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Address the direct genetic connections between skn-1 and fard-1 (etc) e.g. by creating a fard-1; skn-1 gof double and examining fat +/- Phenformin. Alternatively, could this be examined using fat measurements from aak-2 and daf-16 +/- fard-1? It would be interesting to see if the mechanism is the same for all of these longevity processes and make the study of even broader relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To clarify, we believe that SKN-1 is the transcription factor operating downstream of the ether lipid machinery to induce somatic lipid depletion, metabolic stress defenses, and pro-longevity outcomes. We have multiple lines of evidence to support this conclusion: (1) A <italic>skn-1</italic> RNAi targeting all isoforms of SKN-1 completely abrogates the pro-longevity effects of <italic>fard-1 (oe1)</italic> animals (Figure 5D), (2) a total SKN-1 loss-of-function mutant completely prevents both biguanide-mediated lifespan extension<sup>4</sup> and somatic lipid depletion phenotypes (Figure 6D-E), and (3) <italic>skn-1gf</italic> animals displaying depleted somatic lipid content elevate 18:0 DMA levels (Response Figure 1), in contrast to changes in 16:0 DMA and 18:1 DMA in <italic>fard-1 (oe3)</italic> animals, suggesting that <italic>skn-1gf</italic> alone does not mirror FARD-1 overexpression mediated changes in ether lipid levels. As such, we do not believe that a <italic>fard-1lf,skn-1gf</italic> animal will suppress the <italic>skn-1gf</italic> Asdf phenotype. We agree that it would be interesting to see if multiple pro-longevity paradigms known to activate the major pro-longevity signaling and transcription factors AAK-2 and DAF-16 similarly control somatic lipid depletion, but we believe that this is outside of the scope of this initial manuscript delineating the role of SKN-1 and ether lipid machinery in regulation of biguanide-mediated lipid depletion and lifespan extension.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>4. Are the error bars in Figure 1 S1A correct? The data is normalised to 1. I am also unclear of the logic here. Metformin makes the worms smaller, but fard-1 and aCl<sup>-</sup>7 RNAi reverse this?

Instead, we shifted our experimentation to address whether the ether lipid machinery is required for biguanide-mediated lifespan extension, which is the major thrust of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
