species have revealed two mechanisms by which meiotic recombination is directed to the genome—through PRDM9 binding or by targeting promoter-like features—that lead to dramatically different evolutionary dynamics of hotspots. Here, we identify PRDM9 orthologs from genome and transcriptome data in 225 species. We find the complete PRDM9 ortholog across distantly related vertebrates but, despite this broad conservation, infer a minimum of six partial and three complete losses. Strikingly, taxa carrying the complete ortholog of PRDM9 are precisely those with rapid evolution of its predicted binding affinity, suggesting that all domains are necessary for directing recombination. Indeed, as we show, swordtail fish carrying only a partial but conserved ortholog share recombination properties with PRDM9 knock-outs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24133.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24133.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24133.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic information of Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants and fungi) is encoded on strands of DNA called chromosomes. In animals that sexually reproduce, most cells carry two copies of each chromosome, with one inherited from each of their parents. Sex cells such as sperm and egg cells are the exception, and contain only a paternal or maternal set respectively. These chromosomes are not exact copies of the parental chromosomes, but are instead combinations of both of them, generated by a process called meiotic recombination. Meiotic recombination begins by breaking the chromosomes, and the repair of those breaks shuffles DNA segments between the two chromosomes. This shuffling is known as a “recombination event”.</p><p>In humans, apes and mice, the location of recombination events depends on where a protein called PRDM9 binds to the DNA. Over the course of evolution, this binding location has changed relatively rapidly so that even closely related species such as humans and chimpanzees localize recombination events to different DNA regions. In contrast, closely related species that do not produce PRDM9 tend to direct recombination events to similar DNA regions.</p><p>It remains unclear when PRDM9 first evolved its role in recombination, or why different methods of directing recombination have developed. To begin answering these questions, Baker, Schumer et al. investigated whether 225 species of vertebrates (backboned animals) have a gene that encodes PRDM9. This analysis revealed that even distantly related animals have genes that produce equivalents of the complete PRDM9 protein. However, several species have independently lost the ability to produce PRDM9. In certain other species, particular regions of the gene have been removed or shortened. Notably, only species that carry genes that contain regions called the KRAB and SSXRD domains show relatively rapid evolution of where PRDM9 binds in the DNA.</p><p>To investigate this phenomenon further, Baker, Schumer et al. constructed a map of recombination events in swordtail fish, which carry a version of the gene that lacks the KRAB and SSXRD domains. The PRDM9 protein produced by this gene does not direct where recombination events occur.</p><p>Overall, it appears that the KRAB and SSXRD domains are necessary for PRDM9 to direct meiotic recombination. Furthermore, Baker, Schumer et al. predict that those species that have complete versions of PRDM9 use this protein to localize recombination events. Knowing which species use PRDM9 in this way is the first step towards understanding why recombination mechanisms change in evolution, and with what consequences.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24133.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24133.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Vertebrates</kwd><kwd>PRDM9</kwd><kwd>Recombination</kwd><kwd>Hotspot</kwd><kwd>Meiosis</kwd><kwd>Xiphophorus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM83098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Przeworski</surname><given-names>Molly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DDIG DEB-1405232</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schumer</surname><given-names>Molly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PRDM9 is widely conserved across vertebrates yet has been lost numerous times, as has its role in directing meiotic recombination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiotic recombination is a fundamental genetic process that generates new combinations of alleles on which natural selection can act and, in most sexually-reproducing organisms, plays critical roles in the proper alignment and segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coop and Przeworski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Massy, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Meiotic recombination is initiated by a set of double strand breaks (DSBs) deliberately inflicted throughout the genome, whose repair leads to crossover and non-crossover recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Most of the molecular machinery involved in this process in vertebrates has been conserved since the common ancestor of plants, animals and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Massy, 2013</xref>). Notably, in all sexually reproducing species that have been examined, the SPO11 protein generates DSBs, which localize to histone H3 lysine K4 trimethylation marks (H3K4me3) along the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Yet not all features of meiotic recombination are conserved across species. As one example, in many species, including all yeast, plant and vertebrate species studied to date, recombination events are localized to short intervals (of hundreds to thousands of base pairs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lange et al., 2016</xref>) known as recombination hotspots, whereas in others, such as in flies or worms, the recombination landscape seems more uniform, lacking such hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Heil et al. 2015</xref>)</p><p>Among species with recombination hotspots, there are at least two mechanisms directing their location. In mammalian species, including apes, mice and likely cattle, the locations of recombination hotspots are specified by PRDM9 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baudat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Great Ape Genome Project et al., 2016</xref>). In these species, PRDM9 has four major functional domains: a KRAB, SSXRD and PR/SET domain (referred to as the SET domain in what follows), followed by a C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During meiosis, PRDM9 binds sequences throughout the genome, as specified by its ZF array (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ségurel et al., 2011</xref>), and the SET domain of PRDM9 makes H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). These actions ultimately serve to recruit SPO11 to initiate DSBs, by a mechanism that remains unknown but is associated with the presence of both histone marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Getun et al., 2017</xref>) and may involve KRAB and SSXRD domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parvanov et al., 2017</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24133.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic distribution and evolution of PRDM9 orthologs in vertebrates.</title><p>Shown are the four domains: KRAB domain (in tan), SSXRD (in white), PR/SET (in light green) and ZF (in gray/dark green; the approximate structure of identified ZFs is also shown). The number of unique species included from each taxon is shown in parenthesis. Complete losses are indicated on the phylogeny by red lightning bolts and partial losses by gray lightning bolts. Lightning bolts are shaded dark when all species in the indicated lineage have experienced the entire loss or same partial loss. Lightning bolts are shaded light when it is only true of a subset of species in the taxon. ZF arrays in dark green denote those taxa in which the ZF shows evidence of rapid evolution. White rectangles indicate cases where we could not determine whether the ZF was present, because of the genome assembly quality. For select taxa, we present the most complete PRDM9 gene found in two examplar species. Within teleost fish, we additionally show a PRDM9 paralog that likely arose before the common ancestor of this taxon; in this case, the number of species observed to have each paralog is in paranthesis. Although the monotremata ZF is shaded gray, it was not included in our analysis of rapid evolution because of its small number of ZFs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24133.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24133.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-24133-fig1-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24133.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic approach to identifying PRDM9 orthologs and related gene families.</title><p>A maximum likelihood phylogeny built with RAxML, using an alignment of SET domains, distinguishes between genes that cluster with mammalian PRDM9 and PRDM11 with 100% bootstrap support.

In contrast, in yeasts, plants, and vertebrate species (such as birds and canids) that lack functional PRDM9 orthologs, recombination events are concentrated at or near promoter-like features, including TSSs and CpG islands (CGIs), perhaps because they are associated with greater chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lichten and Goldman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hellsten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, in mouse knockouts for PRDM9, recombination events appear to default to promoter-like features that carry H3K4me3 peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Narasimhan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The two mechanisms by which recombination events are targeted to the genome are associated with dramatic differences in the evolution of recombination hotspots. When recombination is directed by PRDM9, hotspot locations are not shared between closely related ape species or between mouse subspecies and differ even among human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ptak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Myers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ptak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coop et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hinch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Great Ape Genome Project et al., 2016</xref>). This rapid evolution appears to be driven by two phenomena. First, the binding specificity of the PRDM9 ZF leads to the existence of ‘hotter’ and ‘colder’ alleles, that is, sequences that are more or less likely to be bound by PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Myers et al., 2008</xref>). In heterozygotes carrying a colder and a hotter allele, this asymmetry in binding leads to the hotter alleles more often experiencing a DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 2016</xref>). Since repair mechanisms use the intact, colder allele as a template, the sequences to which PRDM9 binds are preferentially lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kauppi et al., 2005</xref>). This process of under-transmission of the hotter allele in hot/cold heterozygotes acts analogously to selection for the colder allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nagylaki and Petes, 1982</xref>) and is thus expected to drive the rapid loss of hotspots from the population (leading to the ‘hotspot paradox’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pineda-Krch and Redfield, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coop and Myers, 2007</xref>), consistent with empirical observations in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this loss of hotspots in <italic>cis</italic>, changes in the PRDM9 binding domain can also lead to the rapid loss—and gain—of whole sets of hotspots. Interestingly, PRDM9 has the fastest evolving C2H2 ZF array in the mouse and human genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers et al., 2010</xref>). More generally, mammalian PRDM9 genes show strong evidence of positive selection at known DNA-binding sites of ZFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, in mammals carrying PRDM9, individual hotspots are lost quickly over evolutionary time, but changes in the PRDM9 ZF generate novel sets of hotspots, leading to rapid turnover in the fine-scale recombination landscape between populations and species.</p><p>The mechanism driving the rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF is unclear. One hypothesis is that the under-transmission of hotter alleles eventually leads to the erosion of a sufficient number of hotspots that the proper alignment or segregation of homologs during meiosis is jeopardized, strongly favoring new ZF alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coop and Myers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Myers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ubeda and Wilkins, 2011</xref>). Whether hotspot loss would exert a sufficiently strong and immediate selection pressure to explain the very rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF remains unclear. An alternative explanation has emerged recently from the finding that in mice, widespread asymmetric binding by PRDM9 on the two homologs is associated with hybrid sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>). Since older PRDM9 motifs are more likely to have experienced erosion and hence to be found in heterozygotes for hotter and colder alleles, there may be an immediate advantage to new ZFs that lead to greater symmetry in PRDM9 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davies et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless of the explanation, the rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF is likely tied to its role in recombination.</p><p>Conversely, in species that do not use PRDM9 to direct meiotic recombination events, the rapid evolution of recombination hotspots is not seen. In birds that lack an ortholog of PRDM9, the locations of recombination hotspots are conserved over long evolutionary time scales. Similarly, both the location and heats of recombination hotspots are conserved across highly diverged yeast species, in which H3K4me3 marks are made by a single gene without a DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>). In these taxa, it remains unknown whether the coincidence of recombination with functional genomic elements, such as TSSs and CGIs, is facilitated by specific binding motifs or simply by greater accessibility of the recombination machinery to these genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lam and Keeney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>). Even if there are specific motifs that increase rates of recombination near functional genomic elements, they are likely to have important, pleiotropic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nicolas et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, there may be a strong countervailing force to the loss of hotspots by under-transmission of hotter alleles in these cases, leading to the evolutionary stability of hotspots.</p><p>These observations sketch the outline of a general pattern, whereby species that do not use PRDM9 to direct recombination target promoter-like features and have stable fine-scale recombination landscapes, whereas those that employ PRDM9 tend to recombine away from promoters and experience rapid turnover of hotspot locations. This dramatic difference in the localization of hotspots and their evolutionary dynamics has important evolutionary consequences for genome structure and base composition, for linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels along the genome, as well as for introgression patterns in naturally occurring hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fullerton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McVean et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duret and Galtier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Janoušek et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore important to establish the generality of these two mechanisms and characterize their distribution across species.</p><p>To date, studies of fine-scale recombination rates are limited to a handful of organisms. In particular, although it has been previously reported that the PRDM9 gene arose early in metazoan evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>), direct evidence of its role in recombination is limited to placental mammals (mice, primates and more circumstantially cattle). It remains unknown which species carry an intact ortholog and, more broadly, when PRDM9-directed recombination is likely to have arisen. To address these questions, we investigated the PRDM9 status of 225 species of vertebrates, using a combination of genome sequences and RNAseq data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Initial identification of PRDM9 orthologs in vertebrates</title><p>In order to identify which species have PRDM9 orthologs, we searched publically available nucleotide and whole genome sequences to create a curated dataset of vertebrate PRDM9 sequences.

While PRDM9β orthologs were identified in each species of teleost fish examined, we were unable to identify PRDM9α type orthologs within three major teleost taxa, suggesting at minimum three losses of PRDM9α type orthologs within teleost fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

We focused on testis expression rather than ovaries because although both obviously contain germline cells, preliminary analyses suggested that meiotic gene expression is more reliably detected in testes (see Materials and methods). We selected 23 representative species, spanning each major vertebrate group, with publically available testis expression or testis RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>); we also generated testis RNA-seq data for two species of bony fish (see Materials and methods). In teleost fish with both PRDM9α and PRDM9β genes, we were able to detect either the expression of both orthologs or only expression of PRDM9α orthologs. In species of teleost fish with only PRDM9β genes, we consistently identified expression of PRDM9β genes. More generally, we were able to identify PRDM9 expression in nearly all RNA-seq datasets from species in which the genome carried a putative ortholog, the elephant shark (<italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>) being the sole exception (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2B,C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Confirmation of PRDM9 loss events</title><p>Concerned that absences of PRDM9 observed in some species could reflect lower quality genome assemblies rather than true loss events, we also used testis RNAseq data to investigate putative losses of PRDM9 in amphibians and fish (PRDM9α). To this end, we relied on the fact that when PRDM9 is present, it is detectable in RNAseq data from the whole testis of vertebrates (see above). Our approach was to analyze testis transcriptome data from species lacking PRDM9 sequences in their genome assemblies, using an analysis that is not biased by the genome assembly (see Materials and methods). For each species, we confirmed that the dataset captured the appropriate cell populations and provided sufficient power to detect transcripts that are expressed during meiosis at levels comparable to PRDM9 in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2B,D</xref>). With this approach, we were able to find support for the loss of PRDM9 in salamanders (<italic>Cynops pyrrhogaster, Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) and frogs (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>). Because of the paucity of amphibian genomes, however, it is not clear whether or not these examples represent a widespread loss of PRDM9 within amphibians or more recent, independent losses. Within bony fish, we were able to confirm the three independent losses of PRDM9α type orthologs in one species each of percomorph (<italic>Xiphophorus birchmanni</italic>), cypriniform (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and osteoglossomorph fish (<italic>Osteoglossum bicirrhosum</italic>).

Instances include the absence of the SSXRD domain in some cartilaginous fish (see Materials and methods), absence of both KRAB and SSXRD domains in PRDM9β orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and in PRDM9α orthologs found distributed throughout the teleost fish phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the absence of the KRAB domain in monotremata (<italic>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</italic>) and marsupial mammals (<italic>Sarcophilus harrisii</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>Because these frequent N-terminal losses could be the result of assembly or gene prediction errors, we sought to confirm them by systematically searching genomes and transcriptomes for evidence of these missing domains (see Materials and methods). We required not only that missing domains homologous to PRDM9 be absent from the genome in a whole genome search, but also that the missing domain not be present in the transcriptome, when other domains of PRDM9 were. This approach necessarily limits our ability to verify putative losses when there are no suitable transcriptome data, but nonetheless allowed us to confirm the losses of the KRAB and SSXRD domains in a PRDM9 ortholog from holostean fish (<italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic>), in all PRDM9β orthologs from teleost fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in PRDM9α orthologs that lost their complete domain structure in several taxa of teleost fish (<italic>Gadus morhua</italic>, <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>, <italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>, <italic>Esox lucius</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>), as well as losses of the KRAB domain in two PRDM9 orthologs identified in monotremata (both in <italic>O. anatinus</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>), indicating a minimum of six N-terminal domain losses within vertebrates.</p><p>For representative cases where we were able to confirm missing N-terminal domains, we further investigated whether the truncated genes had become pseudogenes by testing whether the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions in the SET domain is significantly different than 1 (see Materials and methods). In all cases of N-terminal truncation, the partial PRDM9 shows evidence of functional constraint (i.e., dN/dS &lt;1, where dN is the rate of amino-acid substitutions and dS of synonymous substitutions; see Materials and methods for more details). This conservation is most strikingly seen in teleost fish, in which a partial PRDM9 ortholog has been evolving under constraint for hundreds of millions of years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>).

While it is not known whether this rapid evolution is a necessary consequence of its role in recombination, plausible models suggest it is likely to be (see Introduction). If so, we expect species with PRDM9-directed recombination to show evidence for rapidly-evolving PRDM9 ZF arrays and can use this feature to hone in on the subset of PRDM9 orthologs most likely to play a role in recombination.</p><p>To this end, we characterized the rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF in terms of the proportion of amino acid diversity within the ZF array that occurs at DNA-binding sites (using a modification of the approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>). This summary statistic is sensitive to both rapid amino acid evolution at DNA binding sites and concerted evolution between the individual ZFs (see Materials and methods).

(Salmoniformes, Esociformes, Elopomorpha), turtles, snakes, lizards, and coelacanths show similarly elevated values of this statistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In fact, PRDM9 is the most rapidly evolving ZF gene genome-wide in most species in these taxa and all PRDM9 orthologs with the complete domain structure were in the top 5% of the most rapidly evolving ZFs in their respective genomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3B</xref>). In contrast, evidence of such rapid evolution is absent from other taxa of bony fish, including all PRDM9β orthologs and partial PRDM9α orthologs, as well as from the putatively partial PRDM9 orthologs found in the elephant shark, the Tasmanian devil, and in several species of placental mammals (see Materials and methods for details). We only observed one instance (little brown bat, <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic>) in which a partial PRDM9 ortholog was evolving unusually rapidly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>); in this case, we were unable to confirm the loss of the missing KRAB domain (see Materials and methods), so it remains possible this ortholog is in fact intact. In summary, with one possible exception, species show evidence of rapid evolution of the ZF binding affinity if and only if they carry the intact PRDM9 ortholog found in placental mammals. This concordance of rapid evolution with the complete domain structure is highly unlikely by chance (taking into account the phylogenetic relationship between orthologs, p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>; see Materials and methods). Assuming that rapid evolution of the ZF is indicative of PRDM9-directed recombination, these observations carry two implications: KRAB and SSXRD domains are required for this role and non-mammalian species such as turtles or snakes also use PRDM9 to direct recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Analysis of SET domain catalytic residues</title><p>While partial orthologs of PRDM9 have lost one or both of their N-terminal domains, they retain the SET and ZF domains known to play a role in recombination, are under purifying selection, and are expressed in testis. In principle then, these partial orthologs could still play a role in directing recombination. To evaluate this possibility, we started by examining whether the catalytic activities of the SET domains of partial PRDM9 orthologs are conserved. We did so because the catalytic specificities of PRDM9 are believed to be important to its role in directing recombination: two marks made by the SET domain of PRDM9, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, are associated with hotspot activity in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Powers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Getun et al., 2017</xref>) and the human PRDM9 is unusual in being able to add methyl groups to different lysine residues of the same nucleosomes, when most other methyltransferase genes are responsible for only a single mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Powers et al., 2016</xref>). </p><p>Specifically, we focused on three tyrosine residues shown to be important for the catalytic specificities of the human PRDM9 gene (Y276, Y341 and Y357; see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) and asked if those residues were conserved across vertebrates. Loss of individual residues is not necessarily evidence for loss of catalytic activity, as compensatory changes may have occurred. For example, a substitution at Y357 of PRDM7 has led to the loss of H3K36me3 specificity, but H3K4me3 activity appears to have been retained through compensatory substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blazer et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, PRDM9 orthologs with substitutions at these residues are unlikely to utilize the same catalytic mechanisms as human PRDM9 for any methyltransferase activity that they retain.</p><p>We found that each of the three residues is broadly conserved across the vertebrate phylogeny, with substitutions observed in only 57 of 227 PRDM9 orthologs, including 11 genes from placental mammals and 46 genes from bony fish. Strikingly, however, none of these substitutions occur in a complete PRDM9 ortholog containing KRAB, SSXRD, SET and ZF domains. Within mammals, the majority of PRDM9 orthologs that experienced these substitutions lack the ZF array entirely, including eight PRDM7 genes from primates, which share a substitution at Y357, and one PRDM9 ortholog from a bat (<italic>Miniopterus natalensis</italic>) that carries a substitution at Y276. Others are lacking the KRAB domain, including PRDM9 orthologs identified from a lemur (<italic>Galeopterus variegatus</italic>) and a rodent (<italic>Octodon degus</italic>), which carry substitutions at Y276 and Y357, respectively.</p><p>Within bony fish, we identified 46 PRDM9 orthologs with substitutions at one or more of these residues, including the partial PRDM9 ortholog from holosteans (see above) and all PRDM9β orthologs in teleosts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The distribution of substitutions at these residues within PRDM9β genes suggests that numerous independent substitution events have occurred in this gene family following the loss of KRAB and SSXRD domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, no substitutions were observed at these residues in any PRDM9α ortholog, regardless of their domain architecture. These observations could be consistent with a lack of constraint on the ancestral methyltransferase activities of PRDM9 in PRDM9β genes after the PRDM9α/PRDM9β duplication event (or conceivably an indication that there has been convergent evolution towards a new functional role). Thus, PRDM9β genes not only lack KRAB and SSXRD domains, they likely lack some methyltransferase activity of the SET domain.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24133.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Substitutions at SET domain catalytic residues in bony fish PRDM9 genes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Lineages within bony fish carrying substitutions at each of three tyrosine residues involved in H3K4me3 catalysis in human PRDM9 are shown in blue, yellow and red.

By this approach, we found recombination rates to be elevated near TSSs and CGIs, two promoter-like features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, and in contrast to what is observed in species with PRDM9-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), there is no elevation in recombination rates near computationally-predicted PRDM9 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These patterns resemble those previously reported for birds lacking PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we performed native chromatin Chip-seq with an H3K4me3 antibody in <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> testis and liver tissue. Consistent with a role for H3K4me3 in inducing DSBs, recombination is increased around H3K4me3 peaks (testing the association with distance, rho = −0.072, p=2.3e-69; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), an effect that remains significant after correcting for distance to TSSs and CGIs (rho = −0.026, p=5.4e-10). In fact, the increase in recombination rate near the TSS is almost completely explained by the joint effects of proximity to H3K4me3 peaks and CGI (TSS with both: rho = −0.009, p=0.02). Windows that contain testis-specific H3K4me3 peaks have significantly higher recombination rates than those that contain liver-specific H3K4me3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4;</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, H3K4me3 peaks in the testis are not enriched for the computationally predicted PRDM9 motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), nor do they overlap with PRDM9 motifs in the testis more than the liver (see Methods). Conversely, sequence motifs associated with testis-specific H3K4me3 peaks do not resemble the predicted PRDM9 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4;</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, there is no evidence that PRDM9 lays down the H3K4me3 marks associated with an increase in recombination in swordtails.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Recombination landscapes in vertebrates with and without PRDM9</title><p>To put the genomic patterns of recombination in swordtail fish in an explicit comparative framework, we re-analyzed patterns of recombination near TSSs and CGIs in previously published genetic maps based on LD data from three species without functional PRDM9 genes (dog, zebra finch and long-tailed finch) and three species known to use PRDM9-mediated recombination (human, gorilla and mouse), as well as using a pedigree-based genetic map for one species with a complete PRDM9 ortholog, but for which no direct evidence of PRDM9’s role in recombination has yet been reported (sheep; see Materials and methods for details and references).</p><p>Among species with complete PRDM9 genes, recombination rates are either weakly reduced near TSSs and CGIs or similar to what is seen in nearby windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for results with genetic maps based on pedigrees or admixture switches instead of LD data in humans and dogs). In contrast, in all species lacking PRDM9 and in swordtail fish, the recombination rate is notably increased in windows overlapping either a TSS or CGI relative to nearby windows. Quantitative comparisons are difficult because of the varying resolution of the different genetic maps. Nonetheless, these results indicate that patterns of recombination near TSSs and CGIs differ between species carrying complete PRDM9 orthologs and species lacking PRDM9 altogether, and that swordtail fish exhibit patterns of recombination similar to species that completely lack PRDM9, despite the presence of a partial ortholog.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24133.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Patterns of recombination near TSSs and CGIs in species with and without complete PRDM9 orthologs.</title><p>For each species, recombination rates were binned in 10 kb windows along the genome; curves were fit using gaussian loess smoothing.

Recombination rates near the TSS and CGI in human do not seem to be strongly influenced by the choice of genetic map, though peaks at these features are slightly reduced in admixture- and pedigree-based methods.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24133.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24133.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-24133-fig5-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Based on our reconstruction of 227 PRDM9 orthologs across the vertebrate phylogeny, we inferred that the ancestral domain architecture of PRDM9 consisted of KRAB, SSXRD and SET domains followed by a C2H2 ZF array, and that this complete architecture was likely already in place in the common ancestor of vertebrates.</p><p>Moreover, even though to date only the functions of the SET domain and C2H2 ZF array have been connected to the role of PRDM9 in directing recombination, the evolutionary patterns uncovered here suggest that all four domains are important. The first line of evidence is that there is no observation of rapid evolution of the ZF domains in PRDM9 orthologs from which KRAB and SSXRD domains have apparently been lost (including a subset of species in which the catalytic activity of the SET domain is seemingly conserved), suggesting that there has not been rapid evolution of binding specificity. In contrast, there is evidence of rapid evolution of the PRDM9 ZF in all species that have KRAB, SSXRD, SET, and ZF domains. Since plausible models suggest that the rapid evolution of PRDM9 binding affinity is a consequence of the role of this gene in directing recombination (see Introduction), this observation suggests that all four domains are required for this role.</p><p>The second piece of evidence is that swordtail fish with a truncated copy of PRDM9 that is missing KRAB and SSXRD domains behave like PRDM9 knockouts in their fine-scale recombination patterns. It is unclear if this behavior can be attributed to loss of the N terminal domains, since two key catalytic residues within the SET domain were also substituted in this species. However, substitutions at catalytic residues are only seen in PRDM9 genes that have lost KRAB and/or SSXRD domains or have lost the ZF entirely. When the ZF is lost, PRDM9 obviously cannot induce DSBs by binding DNA and its new role may not require the same methyltransferase specificities. We speculate that the absence of KRAB and SSXRD domains in a PRDM9 ortholog may similarly signify that PRDM9 is no longer used to direct recombination and lead to reduced constraint on the catalytic activities of the SET domain. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent paper suggests that the KRAB domain may play a role in recruiting the recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parvanov et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>If the partial ortholog of PRDM9 is not used to direct recombination at all, then the overall conservation of the protein points to another role of the gene. In that regard, we note that partial PRDM9 orthologs share their domain architecture with other members of the PRDM gene family, many of which act as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vervoort et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, if the presence of all four domains, conservation of catalytic residues, and the rapid evolution of the ZF array are sufficient indications of PRDM9-directed recombination, then the role of PRDM9 in directing recombination appears to have originated before the diversification of vertebrates. It would follow that many non-mammalian vertebrate species, such as snakes, use the gene to determine the location of recombination hotspots. One hint in that direction is provided by the high allelic diversity seen in the ZF within a python species (<italic>Python bivittatus</italic>), reminiscent of patterns observed in apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Assessing the role of PRDM9 in directing recombination in these species is a natural next step in understanding the evolution of recombination mechanisms.</p><p>It further appears that the intact PRDM9 has often been duplicated, with more than one copy associated with recombination rate variation in cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the RAxML tree of the SET domain, we count 55 independent cases of duplications. How commonly more than one copy of PRDM9 retains a role in directing recombination remains to be investigated.</p><p>More generally, the distribution of PRDM9 across vertebrates raises the question of why species switch repeatedly from one recombination mechanism to another. Although PRDM9-directed recombination clearly confers enough of an advantage for it to be widely maintained in vertebrates, at least six taxa of vertebrates carry only partial PRDM9 orthologs and the gene has been lost entirely at least three times (based on 227 orthologs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, PRDM9 is not essential to meiotic recombination in the sense that SPO11 is, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>). Instead, the role of PRDM9 is perhaps best envisaged as a classic, trans-acting recombination rate modifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otto and Barton, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coop and Przeworski, 2007</xref>), which was favored enough to be adopted at some point in evolution, but not so strongly or stably as to prevent frequent losses.</p><p>In this regard, it is worth noting that in mammalian species studied to date, recombination rates are lower near promoters than in species lacking PRDM9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Myers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coop et al., 2008</xref>). Because recombination hotspots have higher rates of point mutations, insertions and deletions, and experience GC-biased gene conversion, there may be an advantage conferred by directing recombination to non-genic regions. Recombination at the TSS could have the further disadvantage of uncoupling coding and regulatory variants, potentially uncovering negative epistasis, and therefore leading to indirect selection for decreased recombination at the TSS. Alternatively (but non mutually-exclusively), because PRDM9 binding motifs are strongly associated with certain transposable element classes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Myers et al., 2008</xref>), the role of PRDM9 in recombination could be related to the regulation of certain families of transposable elements. With a more complete picture of recombination mechanisms and their consequences across the tree of life, these hypotheses can start to be tested in an evolutionary context.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Identification of putative PRDM9 orthologs from the RefSeq database</title><p>As a first step in understanding the distribution of PRDM9 in vertebrates, we identified putative PRDM9 orthologs in the RefSeq database.

The retrieved SET domain sequences, an additional 44 retrieved from whole genome assemblies, as well as seven retrieved from RNAseq datasets for five species without sequenced genomes (see Predicting PRDM9 orthologs from whole genome sequences) were input into ClustalW2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>), in order to generate a neighbor-joining (NJ) guide tree (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

For 33 representative species from these groups, we investigated whether we could find additional PRDM9 orthologs in their whole genome assemblies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Song et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bradnam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Georges et al., 2015</xref>). To this end, we ran <italic>tblastn</italic> against the whole genome assembly, using the PRDM9 ortholog from the most closely related species that contained a KRAB domain, a SET domain, and at least one ZF domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

When PRDM9 domains were found spread across multiple contigs, we needed to arrange them in order to generate the proper sequences of the genomic regions containing PRDM9 orthologs from each species. When linkage information was available and we observed the presence of PRDM9 domains on linked contigs, we arranged the sequences of these contigs accordingly, with gaps padded with 100 Ns, before inputting them into Genewise. In cases where linkage information was not available, our approach differed depending on whether or not we identified more than one hit to each region of the query sequence. In species where there appeared to be only one PRDM9 ortholog, we arranged the contigs according to the expected arrangements of the domains, though did not include any ZF arrays unless they were found on the same contig as the complete SET domain because the repeat structure of these domains makes homology difficult to infer. In species with more than one PRDM9 ortholog, we did not attempt to construct any gene models not supported by linkage or by transcripts identified from the same species (see Confirming the expression or absence of PRDM9 in the testes of major phylogenetic groups; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> for details).</p><p>The positions of KRAB, SSXRD and SET domains for each gene model were annotated using <italic>CD-blast</italic> (Domain Accessions smart00317, pfam00856, cl02566, pfam09514, pfam01352, cd07765, smart00349).

We were unable to detect PRDM9 orthologs in one lizard (<italic>Anolis carolinenesis</italic>), or in any of three amphibian species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). We used RNA-seq data to investigate whether these negative findings are due to genome assembly quality or reflect true losses (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of PRDM9 orthologs and related gene families</title><p>To understand the evolution of PRDM9 within vertebrates, we used a phylogenetic approach. We first built an alignment of the amino acid sequences of putative PRDM9 and PRDM11 SET domains using Clustal Omega (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>). We included genes clustering with PRDM11 because it had been reported that PRDM11 arose from a duplication event of PRDM9 in the common ancestor of bony fish and tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vervoort et al., 2016</xref>), and we were interested in identifying any PRDM9 orthologs carried by vertebrate species that may precede this duplication event. The alignment coordinates were then used to generate a nucleotide alignment, which was used as input into the program RAxML (v7.2.8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stamatakis, 2006</xref>). We performed 100 rapid bootstraps followed by maximum likelihood estimation of the tree under the General Reversible Time substitution model, with one partition for each position within a codon. The resulting phylogeny contained monophyletic groups corresponding to the PRDM9 and PRDM11 duplication event, with 100% bootstrap support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These groups were used to label each putative ortholog as PRDM9 or PRDM11. Only jawless fish have PRDM9 orthologs basal to this duplication event, suggesting PRDM11 arose from PRDM9 before the common ancestor of cartilaginous fish and bony vertebrates. We observed at least one PRDM11 ortholog in each of the other vertebrate species examined.</p><p>Within teleost fish, we identified two groups of PRDM9 orthologs, which we refer to as PRDM9α and PRDM9β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the bootstrap support for the monophyly of the two groups is only 75% for PRDM9α and 54% for PRDM9β, the potential duplication event suggested by this tree is coincident with the whole genome duplication event known to have occurred in the common ancestor of teleost fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the phylogenetic grouping based on the SET domain is concordant with general differences in the domain architectures between the two orthologs: In contrast to PRDM9α, PRDM9β genes have derived ZF array structures, containing multiple tandem ZF arrays spread out within the same exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and are always found without the KRAB and SSXRD domains, whereas PRDM9α genes generally have a single tandem array of ZFs consistent with the inferred ancestral domain architecture, and occasionally have KRAB and SSXRD domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Confirming the expression or absence of PRDM9 in the testes of major phylogenetic groups</title><p>A necessary condition for PRDM9 to be involved in recombination is its expression in meiotic cells. For groups of taxa in which we detected a PRDM9 ortholog, we evaluated whether this ortholog was expressed in the testes, using a combination of publically available RNAseq data and RNAseq data that we generated. Additionally, in groups of species where PRDM9 appeared to be absent from the genome, we used publically available RNAseq data to confirm the absence of expression of PRDM9. In both cases, we used a stringent set of criteria to try to ensure that the absence of expression was not due to data quality issues (see details below).</p><p>We downloaded data for jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, bony fish, coelacanth, reptile, marsupial and monotreme species for which Illumina RNAseq data were available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A,C,D</xref>).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we used other recombination-related genes as positive controls, reasoning that if expression of several other conserved recombination-related genes were detected, the absence of PRDM9 would be more strongly suggestive of true lack of expression. Eight recombination-related genes are known to be conserved between yeast and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lam and Keeney, 2014</xref>).

In addition, in order to assess whether PRDM9 expression might simply be lower than that of other meiotic genes, we quantified absolute expression of PRDM9 and the seven conserved recombination-related proteins in whole testes, using data from three major taxa (bony fish, mammals, and reptiles); see Analysis of PRDM9 expression levels and expression levels of other conserved recombination-related genes for more details.

If PRDM9 or PRMD7 was the top <italic>blast</italic> hit in this search, we considered that the missing domain could be a result of assembly or gene model prediction error (if not, we investigated the potential loss of these domains further). This approach allowed us to rule out genome-wide losses of PRDM9 domains in nine out of 14 species of mammals for which our initial approach had failed to identify complete PRDM9 orthologs. In each case, we checked whether or not the identified domains were found adjacent to any of our predicted gene models and adjusted the domain architecture listed for these RefSeq genes accordingly in our dataset (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). In five species of mammals (Tasmanian devil, three bat species, and the aardvark), we only identified a partial PRDM9 ortholog, but we were unable to confirm the loss of domains using RNAseq data (see next section). Within bats, each partial gene model starts within 500 bp of an upstream gap in the assembly. Moreover, we were able to identify a KRAB domain corresponding to PRDM9 from a closely related species of bat (<italic>Myotis brandtii</italic>). Thus, we believe that in the case of bats, these apparent domain losses are due to assembly errors or gaps.</p><p>For species with available RNAseq data from taxa in which we predicted PRDM9 N-terminal truncation based on our initial analyses, we sought to confirm the domain structure observed in the genome with de novo transcriptome assemblies from testis RNAseq (described above).

Finally, we performed a reciprocal nucleotide <italic>blast</italic> (<italic>blastn</italic>; e-value cutoff 1e-20) to confirm that these transcripts were homologous to the PRDM9 ortholog identified using phylogenetic methods in these taxa. Results of this analysis can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>. In summary, there were two cases where the transcriptomes supported additional domain structures not found in the whole genome sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2C</xref>): a PRDM9 ortholog from the spotted gar (<italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic>) that was observed to have a KRAB domain not identified in the genome sequence, and a PRDM9α ortholog from the Atlantic salmon (<italic>Salmo salar</italic>) that was observed to have both KRAB and SSXRD domains not identified in the genome search. In all other cases, we confirmed the losses of either the KRAB or SSXRD domains, including: (i) PRDM9β orthologs missing KRAB and SSXRD domains in all species of teleost fish expressing these orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2B,C</xref>) (ii) PRDM9α orthologs missing KRAB and SSXRD domains identified from <italic>Astyanax mexicanus, Esox lucius, Gadus morhua,</italic> and <italic>Ictalurus punctatus</italic>, and (iii) loss of the KRAB domain from one PRDM9 ortholog in monotremata (<italic>O. anatinus</italic>) and both KRAB and SSXRD domains from the other ortholog in this species.</p><p>For all groups in which we confirm that there is only a partial PRDM9 ortholog based on the above analyses, we asked whether the PRDM9 gene in question has likely become a pseudogene (as it has, for example, in canids; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2011</xref>), in which case the species can be considered a PRDM9 knockout. Though such events would be consistent with our observation of many losses of PRDM9, they would not be informative about the role of particular PRDM9 domains in recombination. For this analysis, we aligned the SET domain of the PRDM9 coding nucleotide sequence to a high-quality PRDM9 sequence with complete domain structure from the same taxon using Clustal Omega (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>), except for the case of PRDM9β in bony fish and the PRDM9 ortholog from cartilaginous fish, where such a sequence was not available. In the case of PRDM9β, we compared the sequence between <italic>X. maculatus</italic> and <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>, sequences that are &gt;200 million years diverged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hedges et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of cartilaginous fish, we used the sequence from <italic>R. typus</italic> and <italic>C. milii</italic>, which are an estimated 400 million years diverged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hedges et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed these alignments with codeml, comparing the likelihood of two models, one with a fixed omega of 1 and an alternate model without a fixed omega, and performed a likelihood ratio test. A significant result for the likelihood ratio test provides evidence that a gene is not neutrally-evolving (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>). In all cases of N-terminal truncation analyzed, dN/dS is significantly less than one (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3A</xref>). While it is possible that some of these cases represent very recently pseudogenized genes, the widespread evidence for purifying selection on the SET domain strongly suggests that these PRDM9 orthologs are functionally important.</p><p>We also investigated constraint in all mammalian Ref-seq orthologs that appear to lack only an annotated KRAB or SSXRD domain; for this larger number of genes, we did not confirm all domain losses, due to the large number of genome searches that would be required and lack of RNAseq data for most species. We found evidence of purifying selection in all cases except for five PRDM7 orthologs from primates, for which we had been unable to identify a KRAB domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3C</xref>). PRDM7 is thought to have arisen from a primate specific duplication event and to have undergone subsequent losses of the C2H2 ZF array and of some catalytic specificity of its SET domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blazer et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, PRDM7 orthologs are unlikely to function in directing recombination. Our findings further suggest they are evolving under very little constraint, and may even be non-functional. More generally, within placental mammals, the majority of partial PRDM9 orthologs that we identified lack the ZF array completely or have truncated arrays (notably, there are fewer than four tandem ZFs in 24 of 28 orthologs), in sharp contrast to other taxa in which partial orthologs to PRDM9 lack the N terminal domains, yet have conserved ZF arrays and are constrained. Moreover, the paralogs lacking a long ZF tend to be found in species that already carry a complete PRDM9 ortholog (21 of 24). Thus, some of these cases may represent recent duplication events in which one copy of PRDM9 is under highly relaxed selection, similar to PRDM7 in primates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Evolutionary patterns in the SSXRD domain</title><p>The SSXRD domain is the shortest functional domain in the PRDM9 protein. One species of cartilaginous fish (<italic>Rhincodon typus</italic>), and several species of bony fish (<italic>Anguilla anguilla, A. rostrata, A. japonica, Salmo trutta, S. salar</italic>) have weakly predicted SSXRD domains (e-values &gt;10, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">2C</xref>).

It has further been observed that DNA-binding residues show high levels of amino acid diversity, suggestive of positive selection acting specifically at DNA-binding sites, that is, on binding affinity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schwartz et al., 2014</xref>). These signals have been previously studied by comparing site specific rates of synonymous versus non-synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) between paralogous ZFs in PRDM9’s tandem ZF array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliver et al., 2009</xref>). Assessing statistical significance using this approach is problematic, however, because the occurrence of paralogous gene conversion across copies means that there is no single tree relating the different ZFs, in violation of model assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schierup and Hein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson and McVean, 2006</xref>). Here, we used a statistic sensitive to both rapid evolution at DNA-binding sites and high rates of gene conversion: the total proportion of amino acid diversity observed at DNA-binding sites within the ZF array. We then assessed significance empirically by comparing the value of this statistic to other C2H2 ZF genes from the same species (where possible).</p><p>To this end, for each species with a PRDM9 ortholog, we downloaded the nucleotide and protein sequences for all available RefSeq genes with a C2H2 ZF motif annotated in Conserved Domain Database (pfam id# PF00096). To simplify alignment generation, we only used tandem ZF arrays with four or more ZFs matching the 28 amino acid long C2H2 motif (X2-CXXC-X12-HXXXH-X5 where X is any amino acid). In all of our analyses, if a gene had multiple tandem ZF arrays that were spatially separated, only the first array of four or more adjacent ZFs was used for the following analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3B</xref>). However, an alternative analysis using all ZFs or different subsets of ZFs led to qualitatively similar results for the PRDM9β orthologs from bony fish, where ZFs are commonly found in multiple tandem arrays separated by short linker regions in the predicted amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For species with PRDM9 orthologs with fewer than five ZFs, we implemented <italic>blastn</italic> against the whole genome sequence using the available gene model as a query sequence, in order to determine whether or not there was a predicted gap within the ZF array, and, if there was, to identify any additional ZFs found in the expected orientation at the beginning of the adjacent contig. This approach was able to successfully identify additional ZF sequences on contigs adjacent to PRDM9 in the genome assembly for two species (<italic>Latimeria chalumnae</italic> and <italic>Protobothrops mucrosquamatus</italic>).

We coded these variables using a binary approach with ‘00’ for incomplete domain structure and no evidence of rapid evolution and ‘11’ for complete domain structure and evidence of rapid evolution. To describe the phylogenetic relationships between orthologs, we used the RAxML tree that we constructed from the SET domain for all PRDM9 orthologs.

The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2% SDS and incubating at 55 C for an additional seven minutes. One of 96 custom indices were added to each sample in a plate with an individual PCR reaction including 1 ul of the tagmented DNA; between 13–16 PCR cycles were used.

Briefly, raw data was parsed by barcode and trimmed to remove low-quality basepairs (Phred quality score &lt;20). Reads with fewer than 30 bp after trimming were discarded. Because of prohibitively long computational times, reads from individuals with more than 16 million reads were subsampled to 16 million before running the MSG pipeline. The minimum number of reads for an individual to be included was set to 300,000, since ancestry inference with fewer reads is predicted to have lower accuracy based on simulations (Schumer et al. 2015). This procedure resulted in 239 individuals for our final analysis, with an average coverage of 8.3 million reads, or ~1X genome-wide coverage.</p><p>The parameters used in the MSG run were based on previous work on this hybrid population (Schumer et al. in review). The expected number of recombination events per chromosome (recRate) was set to 8, based on a prior expectation of approximately 30 generations of admixture and assuming initial admixture proportions of 75% of the genome derived from <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> and 25% derived from <italic>X. malinche</italic>. Similarly, priors for each ancestry state were set based on these mixture proportions (par1 = 0.5625, par1par2 = 0.375 and par2 = 0.0625). The recombination rate scaling factor was set to the default value of 1.</p><p>Ancestry transitions were identified as the interval over which the posterior probability changed from ≥0.95 in support of one ancestry state to ≥0.95 for a different ancestry state. Breakpoint intervals that occurred within 10 kb of a contig edge were excluded from the analysis due to concerns that false breakpoints may occur more frequently near the edges of contigs. The identified recombination intervals varied significantly in their lengths, that is, in the resolution of the crossover event. The median resolution was 13 kb, with 75% of breakpoints resolved within 35 kb or less.</p><p>To evaluate the relationship between recombination frequency and genomic elements such as the TSS, CGIs, and computationally predicted PRDM9 binding sites, we needed to convert the observed recombination events into an estimate of recombination frequency throughout the genome. To this end, we considered the proportion of events observed in a particular 10 kb window; we note that this rate is not equivalent to a rate per meiosis. We filtered the data to remove windows within 10 kb of a contig boundary.

Native chromatin ChIP was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, tissue was homogenized and lysed; the lysate was spun through a sucrose cushion (to pellet nuclei). Nuclei were resuspended in 500 ul MNase digestion buffer and digested with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease (MNase, Sigma N5386, St. Louis, MO) for 2 min at 37 C, then inactivated with 20 ul 0.5M EDTA and chilled on ice. The first soluble chromatin fraction was recovered by spinning for 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4C and collecting the supernatant. To isolate the second soluble chromatin fraction, the pellet was resuspended in 500 µl dialysis buffer, rotated overnight at 4 C, then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4 C to pellet insoluble material. The digestion quality of each fraction was evaluated on an agarose gel. The two soluble fractions were combined for chromatin immunoprecipitation with 1 µg of H3K4me3 antibody (Millipore 04–745, Billerica, MA); 1/10 vol was retained as an input control. Antibody was bound to the remaining chromatin overnight while rotating at 4 C. The next day blocked Protein A and Protein G beads were added, and rotated for 3 hr. The bound beads were then washed a total of 7 times with chilled wash buffers and immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted in elution buffer for 30 min at 37 C and cleaned up with ChIP DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Libraries were prepared for sequencing using the NuGEN ultralow library prep kit (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at Hudson Alpha to collect 10.3–10.5 and 12.2–14.5 paired-end 50 bp reads for pull-down and input samples respectively.</p><p>Raw reads were trimmed to remove adapter sequences and reads with fewer than 18 bp after adapter trimming using the program cutadapt. These trimmed reads were then mapped to the <italic>X. maculatus</italic> reference genome with bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) and the resulting bam file was sorted with samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Homer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) was used to generate bigWig files and call peaks using the option style –factor. We also performed the analysis using the option style –histone and found that the results were qualitatively similar. Peak files were converted to bed files and bedtools2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) was used to analyze overlap between the locations of H3K4me3 peaks and predicted PRDM9 binding motifs in the swordtail genome (see above). Based on Homer analysis, which identified 20,662 peaks in the testis and 15,050 in the liver, the IP efficiency was estimated to be 38% for the testis sample and 40% for the liver sample; the peak width was estimated to be 229 bp for the testis sample and 238 for the liver sample.</p><p>Having identified H3K4me3 peaks in testis and liver tissue, we next asked about the relationship between these peaks and predicted PRDM9 binding sites (see above). If PRDM9 is generating H3K4me3 peaks during meiosis, we expect to see an association between predicted PRDM9 binding motifs in the swordtail genome and H3K4me3 peaks. To test for such an association, we generated 500 null motifs by randomly shuffling without replacement the position weight matrix of the <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> PRDM9 and re-running FIMO as described above. We then asked how frequently randomly shuffled PRDM9 motifs overlap H3K4me3 peaks compared to the real motif. We found that no evidence that the real motif overlapped H3K4me3 peaks more frequently than the shuffled versions of the motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>As a secondary approach, we compared H3K4me3 peaks that are specific to the testis to H3K4me3 peaks that are specific to the liver, defined as peaks in the testis where there is no overlapping peak in the liver. Using a Chi-squared test, we asked whether H3K4me3 peaks found only in the testis are more likely to overlap a PRDM9 binding motif than those that are liver specific (where the definition is analogous) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because the size of H3K4me3 peaks will impact the expected overlap with PRDM9 binding motifs, we also constrained the size of the H3K4me3 peaks in the liver analysis to be the same as that inferred from the testis using the –size flag in homer (229 bp). Results were not qualitatively different with the original analysis, using liver H3K4me3 peaks that were inferred to be 238 bp. Counterintuitively liver-specific H3K4me3 peaks appear to overlap predicted PRDM9 motifs more often than testes-specific peaks (χ = 14.8; p=1.2e-4). However, performing this same analysis with the 500 null motifs (generated as described above), we found that liver-specific peaks were significantly enriched in shuffled motifs in 85% of simulations (at the 0.05 level). This analysis suggests that base composition differences between liver and testes-specific H3K4me3 peaks explain the difference in overlap results.</p><p>We also repeated the above analysis for clusters of three ZFs in the swordtail PRDM9 ZF array, using a smaller number of shuffled sequences (n = 20). We observed the same qualitative patterns for each of the ZF clusters as reported above.</p><p>Finally, we used a third approach to ask about the association of H3K4me3 peaks and PRDM9 binding sites. We generated five replicate datasets of H3K4me3 sequences and their flanking 250 bp regions from both the testis and the liver. We ran the program MEME to predict motifs enriched in the testis-specific H3K4me3 peaks using the liver as a background sequence set on these five replicate datasets. We then examined the top ten predicted motifs to ask whether any of these motifs resembled the computationally predicted PRDM9 binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The above analyses suggest that in swordtail fish, PRDM9 does not make H3K4me3 marks but they do not indicate whether H3K4me3 peaks are associated with recombination events in swordtails. We therefore verified that recombination rates in 10 kb windows are significantly correlated with the distance of that window to the nearest H3K4me3 peak (rho = −0.072, p=2.3e-69; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This relationship weakens but remains significant when accounting for distance both to TSSs and CGIs by a partial correlation analysis (rho = −0.026, p=5.4e-10). Furthermore, windows that contain a testis-specific H3K4me3 peak have a higher recombination rate than windows that contain a liver-specific peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, there is a significant positive correlation between the number of bp in a 10 kb window overlapping an H3K4me3 peak and the number of recombination events observed in that window in the testis but not in the liver (testis: rho = 0.044, p=2.8e-29; liver: rho = 0.002, p=0.66). Together, these analyses suggest that a relationship between H3K4me3 peaks and recombination exists in swordtails, but not one mediated through PRDM9 binding.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the federal government of Mexico for permission to collect fish under a scientific collecting permit to Guillermina Alcaraz (PPF/DGOPA-173/14).

They confirm that PRDM9 has been lost independently in several lineages. They show that the domain architecture of PRDM9 in placental mammals (KRAB, SSXRD, PR/SET and ZF) corresponds to the ancestral state, at the root of vertebrates. They also identified many lineages in which PRDM9 orthologs have lost the KRAB and/or SSXRD domains. These 'truncated' PRDM9 orthologs are subject to strong negative selection, which implies that they are functional. Their zinc finger domain does not show however evidence for positive selection. This observation leads to the conclusion that the presence of KRAB/SSXRD domains is most probably required for the DSB-targeting function of PRDM9. To test this prediction, a recombination map of swordtail fish, which has a truncated PRDM9 has been generated, and the authors conclude that this map shows a pattern similar to that of Prdm9 knock-outs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The phylogeny of Prdm9 is very convincing and the reviewers recognize the quality of this work which provides important information about maintenance or loss of Prdm9 in vertebrates. The association between the presence of KRAB/SSXRD domains and the rate of evolution of the ZF domain is clear, and the authors propose that the KRAB and SSXRD domains are required for the DSB-targeting function of PRDM9. However the conclusion drawn by the authors that recombination sites are preferentially located near TSS in swordtail fish similarly to other species lacking Prdm9 is not convincing; First the increase of recombination rate near TSS is very weak (about 1.2x) compared to that observed in dog (about 4-7x, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> in Auton et al. 2013 Plos Genet) or finches (about 2-3x, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in Singhal et al. 2015 Science). Moreover, the increase in recombination rate in the vicinity of TSS and CGIs in swordtail fish is similar to that observed in human and chimpanzee (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in Auton et al. 2012 Science), two species that have PRDM9-directed hotspots. In addition, the power of detecting an increase of recombination near motifs is limited by the resolution of their map. Having a zinc finger with a normal evolution rate does not automatically means that PRDM9 is not involved in targeting recombination. Other mechanisms may be used such as DNA binding at distance from DSB sites for instance and one cannot interpret the data with only two possible hypotheses to be tested: “the motif mode” or “the promoter/CpG mode”.

The authors may want to consider whether this request is compatible with a revision time, which is normally recommended not to exceed two months.</italic> </p><p>In response to these concerns, we have added a number of analyses. Notably:</p><p>We collected additional genomic data in the hybrid swordtail population (specifically ~1X genome-‐wide coverage for 268 individuals) and have thereby increased the resolution of our genetic map (resolving crossover events to a median of 13 kb). The increase near the TSS is higher than what we initially reported, but weaker than in some other species without PRDM9 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We believe the smaller peak in swordtail fish reflects the lower resolution of our map, consistent with it being higher now than what it was previously (and with differences between pedigree and LD map</p><p>in dogs, for example). In that sense, maps from different species are not strictly comparable, a caveat we now state explicitly in the text. We note that another complication in interpreting the depth of troughs and peaks is that maps based on LD confound differences in Ne along the genome with variation in recombination rates; nonetheless, we show our findings to be robust to the use of pedigree/admixture maps or LD-‐based maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>These caveats notwithstanding, we have conducted a comparative analysis of recombination maps in four species with an intact PRDM9 (human, gorilla, mouse, sheep) and three species with no PRDM9 (zebrafinch, long-‐tailed finch, dog) to contrast those patterns with the ones seen in swordtail fish. This analysis shows that swordtail fish behave like PRDM9 knockouts with regard to patterns of recombination around the TSS and CpG islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and highlights qualitative differences between vertebrates with and without PRDM9 among species studied to date. We agree that this observation does not rule out other roles of PRDM9 in recombination (i.e., roles unlike the ones it plays in mammals).</p><p>Based on findings from yeast to mice, we would expect that a role for PRDM9 in recombination would be associated with H3K4me3 marks. For that reason, we have added H3K4me3 chip-‐seq experiments from swordtail testis and liver tissue samples. Consistent with our expectation, we see increased recombination near H3K4me3 peaks in testes, and no effect of the TSS once these peaks and the locations of CpG islands are taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, however, when we analyzed the conservation of catalytic residues of the SET domain for each PRDM9 ortholog in our dataset, we found that ‘PRDM9β’ genes such as the one carried by swordtail fish lack conservation of key residues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, analyzing the correspondence of H3K4me3 peaks and the predicted PRDM9 binding motif in swordtails, we find no association between these H3K4me3 peaks and the predicted PRDM9 binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Together 4) and 5) suggest that the SET domain does not lay down H3K4me3 marks in swordtail fish.</p><p>Together, we believed these different lines of evidence provide compelling evidence that swordtail fish, although they carry a constrained, truncated ortholog to PRDM9, do not use PRDM9 to direct recombination, at least through any mechanism that has been reported.</p></body></sub-article></article>
