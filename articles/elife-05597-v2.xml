cytoskeletal transport and autophagy. Here we show that Rab26 is specifically associated with clusters of synaptic vesicles in neurites. Overexpression of active but not of GDP-preferring Rab26 enhances vesicle clustering, which is particularly conspicuous for the EGFP-tagged variant, resulting in a massive accumulation of synaptic vesicles in neuronal somata without altering the distribution of other organelles. Both endogenous and induced clusters co-localize with autophagy-related proteins such as Atg16L1, LC3B and Rab33B but not with other organelles. Furthermore, Atg16L1 appears to be a direct effector of Rab26 and binds Rab26 in its GTP-bound form, albeit only with low affinity. We propose that Rab26 selectively directs synaptic and secretory vesicles into preautophagosomal structures, suggesting the presence of a novel pathway for degradation of synaptic vesicles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05597.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05597.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05597.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brain contains billions of cells called neurons that form an extensive network through which information is readily exchanged.

The most dramatic phase of synaptic remodeling occurs during development when the majority of initially formed synapses are eliminated while the final synaptic network is being generated. However, even in the adult brain there is persistent turnover of synapses, mostly in response to experience and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caroni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung and Barres, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Formation of a new synapse involves the establishment of highly specialized structures containing arrays of unique membrane and scaffold proteins, which necessitates close coordination between the presynaptic axon and the postsynaptic dendrite. Components of these structures are delivered by microtubule-based transport, although some of the proteins are locally synthesized in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Steward and Levy, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>). Similarly, delivery of synaptic membranes (such as synaptic vesicles) and active zone precursors to the synapse relies on kinesin-mediated transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>). A lot has been learned in recent years about the signaling events and the downstream effectors involved in synaptogenesis as well as the mechanisms by which individual components are recruited and maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caroni et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Less is known, however, about the molecular cascades involved in synaptic elimination. In principle, two mechanisms of elimination co-exist that are not mutually exclusive and may indeed be coordinated with each other: ‘attack from the outside’ or ‘self-destruction from the inside’. Elimination from the outside is usually executed by microglial cells but the underlying signaling network is complex, and astrocytes have also recently been appreciated to play a major role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung and Barres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stephan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke and Barres, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maor-Nof and Yaron, 2013</xref>). In cell autonomous elimination, synaptic components may either be (i) recycled, that is, being removed in a functionally intact form for the use at another site, or (ii) degraded. With the exception of some recent evidence showing that synaptic vesicles can be exchanged between neighboring synapses, whether synaptic components can be reused after having been operational in a functional synapse remains largely unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darcy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kamin et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, an increasing body of evidence supports the view that synaptic components are rapidly degraded once a synapse is earmarked for elimination. Unsurprisingly, the ubiquitin-proteasome system is emerging as one of the central players, both at presynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>) and postsynaptic sites ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bedford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patrick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2004</xref>], for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mabb and Ehlers (2010)</xref>). At the presynaptic site, the ubiquitin system is not only involved in synaptic elimination, but also in the general regulation of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muralidhar and Thomas, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell and Holt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DiAntonio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yi and Ehlers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). For instance the protein RIM, a crucial hub for organizing active zones that form the release site for synaptic vesicles, was recently shown to be rapidly turned over upon ubiquitination, resulting in loss of synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, an increasing number of ubiquitin-modifying enzymes have been described from synapses (particularly E3-ligases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding and Shen, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the emerging role of the ubiquitin proteasome system, little information is currently available regarding the mechanisms by which synaptic membrane proteins are eliminated. At the postsynaptic site, ubiquitin-dependent pathways are clearly involved in the regulation of surface receptor density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patrick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwarz et al., 2010</xref>). However, only scant information is available about the turnover of membrane proteins at the presynaptic site where a complicated and autonomous vesicle recycling machinery needs to deal with many 100s of synaptic vesicles. Surprisingly, the mechanisms by which synaptic vesicles are eliminated have thus far received little attention. By analogy to non-neuronal cells, it is frequently assumed that synaptic vesicle membrane proteins follow the canonical endosomal-lysosomal route for degradation which involves ubiquitination and recognition by the ESCRT machinery after being delivered to endosomes, followed by the formation of multivesicular bodies, retrograde transport, and ultimately fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Katzmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009</xref>). However, aside from a few hints from a recent proteomic study, whether synaptic vesicle proteins are ubiquitinated remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Na et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, whether sequestration into the lumen of multivesicular bodies is involved and, if so, to what extent is unknown. Indeed, multivesicular bodies are infrequently observed in axons and typically appear in response to pathological (dystrophic or toxic) conditions (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Von Bartheld and Altick, 2011</xref>]). Furthermore, no information is currently available concerning the involvement of the ESCRT pathway in the elimination of presynaptic components. Intriguingly, recent studies implicate the involvement of clathrin-dependent pathways in targeting plasma membrane components to autophagosomes, hinting at the potential involvement of this mechanism in the turnover of synaptic vesicles recovered by endocytosis following the release of their neurotransmitter content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study we report about data suggesting the presence of a novel pathway for the degradation of synaptic and secretory vesicles, which involves selective sequestration of vesicle clusters into structures resembling early autophagosomes. This pathway is triggered by Rab26, a little-studied member of the Rab-GTPase superfamily that is related to the exocytotic Rab3/Rab27 subgroup. We show that Rab26 selectively localizes to presynaptic membrane vesicles and recruits both Atg16L1 and Rab33B, two components of the pre-autophagosomal machinery. Remarkably, these autophagosomal structures are filled almost exclusively with synaptic vesicles and proteins typically associated with large dense-core vesicles. Overexpression of EGFP-tagged Rab26, but not of FLAG-tagged or wild-type (WT) Rab26, induces the formation of giant autophagosomes in the cell bodies of hippocampal neurons—a phenotype that is mirrored upon transfection in HeLa cells. Based on these findings, we conclude that Rab26 may selectively channel synaptic vesicles into pre-autophagosomes and, thus, may represent a new regulator of synapse turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rab26 is a GTPase enriched on synaptic vesicles with properties reminiscent of Rab27b</title><p>Previously we reported that synaptic vesicles highly purified from rat brain contain more than 30 different Rab-GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Of these, a subgroup of Rabs including Rab3a, Rab3b, Rab3c, and Rab27b were highly enriched in the vesicle fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlos et al., 2010</xref>). These Rabs are known to function in the regulation of exocytosis and constitute part of the ‘secretory Rab subfamily’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pereira-Leal and Seabra, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukuda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pavlos and Jahn, 2011</xref>). Rab26, a comparatively uncharacterized member of the Rab superfamily, is also closely related to this subgroup. Since we detected Rab26 on purified synaptic vesicles in two previous independent proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlos et al., 2010</xref>), we decided to further explore its endogenous localization in neurons. To this end, we raised a mouse monoclonal antibody that is specific for Rab26 and does not cross-react with other related Rab proteins including Rab27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>First, we used immunoblotting to monitor the subcellular distribution of Rab26 during the purification of synaptic vesicles from the rat brain. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Rab26 co-purified with synaptic vesicle markers (as indicated here using synaptophysin), with the highest enrichment being observed in the synaptic vesicle (SV) fraction obtained after purification using consecutive density gradients and size exclusion chromatography. This fraction has been previously shown to be comprised almost exclusively of synaptic vesicles (at least 95% purity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huttner et al., 1983</xref>). For independent confirmation, we carried out immunoisolation of synaptic vesicles using beads (Eupergit C1Z) covalently coupled with monoclonal antibodies specific for Rab26 or synaptophysin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, both antibodies resulted in the isolation of membranes highly enriched in both synaptophysin and Rab26. As a control, the membranes were solubilized with the detergent Triton X-100 prior to immunoisolation (Tx-IP). In this case, only the respective antigens were isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), thus validating the specificity of the isolation procedure. We also verified the nature of the immunoisolated vesicles by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As previously reported, synaptophysin-beads were densely covered by small vesicular profiles with a size distribution typical for synaptic vesicles (i.e., 40–45 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takamori et al., 2000</xref>). Rab26 beads were similarly populated with these vesicles, albeit to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Nevertheless, quantitative assessment of the size distribution of the bead-bound vesicles revealed no distinguishable difference between the vesicles bound to synaptophysin and Rab26 beads, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05597.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The small GTPase Rab26 co-purifies with synaptic vesicles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rab26 co-purifies with synaptic vesicles using conventional fractionation. Synaptic vesicles were purified from rat brain homogenate (H) by two consecutive differential centrifugation steps, yielding a low-speed pellet (P1) and a supernatant (S1), followed by a second centrifugation yielding a pellet P2 (containing synaptosomes and mitochondria) and a supernatant (S2). P2 was then lysed by osmotic shock, followed by centrifugation to separate large particles including synaptic junctional complexes (LP1) and a supernatant from which small membranes enriched in synaptic vesicles are collected by high-speed centrifugation (LP2, supernatant LS2 only contains soluble proteins). LP2 was further fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation followed by chromatography on controlled pore glass beads where larger membrane fragments (PK1) were separated from synaptic vesicles (SV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huttner et al., 1983</xref>). 12 µg of proteins of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for Rab26 and the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin. Note that Rab26 copurifies with synaptophysin, displaying a pattern typical of synaptic vesicle proteins. (<bold>B</bold>) Synaptic vesicles were immunoisolated using Eupergit C1Z/methacrylate beads to which monoclonal antibodies specific for Rab26 or synaptophysin (Syph) respectively, were covalently coupled. The beads were incubated with a resuspended LP2 fraction and collected (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takamori et al., 2000</xref>] for details). SN, supernatant obtained after bead incubation; Bound, immunoisolates; Tx-SN and Tx-IP, same as before but the Input sample was solubilized with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% before immunoprecipitation. For immunoblotting, 4% of the input or supernatant samples and 33% of bound samples were loaded for analyses. Note that Rab26 and synaptophysin cofractionate with the immunobeads irrespective of the antibody employed. Incubation with synaptophysin beads quantitatively depleted Rab26 from the supernatant whereas depletion of synaptophysin by Rab26-beads was less complete. In contrast, only the respective antigen was recovered from the detergent-solubilized samples. Asterisks denote IgG heavy and the light chains of the antibodies used for isolation, respectively.

This cycle is frequently paralleled by a membrane ‘on/off’ association—dissociation cycle. Membrane association is achieved following posttranslational modification of Rabs by geranyl-geranylation, a prerequisite for membrane insertion and Rab activation. Conversely, membrane dissociation is regulated by a specific adaptor protein, termed GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), which sequesters GDP-bound Rabs from membranes to the cytosol following GTP-hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ullrich et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goody et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, to gain initial insights into the functional membrane association/dissociation cycle of Rab26, we assessed whether it could be extracted from synaptic vesicle membranes following GDI treatment. For this, we incubated a fraction enriched in synaptic vesicles (LP2) with purified recombinant GDI in the presence of GDP or GTPγS. The latter analogue was used to overcome the intrinsically high GTPase activity of Rabs (see ‘Discussion’). Consistent with previous observations, Rab3 is rapidly retrieved from synaptic vesicles membranes by GDI in the presence of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou and Jahn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlos et al., 2010</xref>). By comparison, Rab26 is resistant to GDI-mediated membrane extraction, even when GDP is present in excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This feature is reminiscent of the biochemical characteristics of Rab27b, which also fails to be retrieved from synaptic vesicles by GDI treatment in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlos et al., 2010</xref>). Rather, Rab27b is known to dimerize and persist on synaptic vesicle membranes in its GDP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlos et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, to assess whether GDP-bound Rab26 exhibits a similar tendency to oligomerize, we additionally performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments between FLAG- and EGFP-tagged wild-type (WT) Rab26 and its variants containing mutations that selectively interfere with the Rab26 GDP/GTP switch domain(s). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, co-precipitation of FLAG-tagged Rab26 was only observed when cells were transfected with either wild-type EGFP-Rab26 or with a GDP-preferring variant (Rab26T77N, henceforth referred to as Rab26TN). By comparison, little to no co-precipitation was observable when the ‘nucleotide empty’ Rab26 (Rab26N177I, Rab26NI) or ‘GTP-locked’ (Rab26Q123L, Rab26QL) variants were employed. Together, these data indicate that Rab26 is a synaptic vesicle protein that oligomerizes preferentially in its GDP-bound form, thereby precluding GDI-mediated membrane extraction—a feature shared with its synaptic vesicle relative Rab27b.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05597.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GDP-Rab26 cannot be extracted by GDI from membranes and forms oligomers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rab26 is resistant to extraction by GDI from synaptic vesicle membranes.

Although the tagged Rab26 protein variants were expressed throughout development, no lethality or delayed development was observed (data not shown). Consistent with previous observations, analysis of third instar larvae nerve-muscle preparations revealed an exclusive localization of Rab26 to presynaptic compartments of the neuromuscular junction without staining of axons and cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2011</xref>]). Remarkably, expression of wild-type and of the gain-of-function (QL) Rab26 resulted in the appearance of large vesicle clusters within the presynaptic boutons whereas the GDP-preferring form (TN) was diffusely localized. This indicated that, like in hippocampal neurons, formation of these clusters is dependent on the nucleotide-bound state of Rab26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These Rab26-positive compartments are present in neuromuscular junction boutons as indicated by staining with anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and showed a partial overlap with the synaptic vesicle protein cysteine string protein (Csp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zinsmaier et al., 1990</xref>).

Thus, it is conceivable that the induction of these vesicle clusters is an intrinsic property of GTP-Rab26, which is enhanced by the weak homo-dimerization of EGFP and YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shaner et al., 2005</xref>). What could be the identity of these clusters? Considering their striking resemblance of these clusters to autophagosomal precursors, we hypothesized that these clusters may represent autophagosomes at various stages of formation and/or maturation.</p><p>Autophagy is a degradative pathway during which cellular contents are enclosed by a double-membrane (i.e., the isolation membrane) and then delivered to lysosomes for disposal (for review see e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamb et al., 2013</xref>]). The pathway is initiated by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems that operate in a sequential manner. The first conjugates the ubiqutin-like protein Atg12 to Atg5 which is then recruited by Atg16L1 to the pre-autophagosome structure. This complex then recruits a LC3 family member, a second ubiquitin-like molecule, and attaches it covalently to phosphatidylethanolamine in an E3-ligase like reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klionsky and Schulman, 2014</xref>). Since LC3 remains associated with the autophagosomal membrane until its delivery to the lysosome, it is considered to be the most reliable marker for autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klionsky et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, to test whether the Rab26 containing clusters are linked to the autophagy pathway, we next checked for association with autophagosome-related proteins. First, we assessed for colocalization between Rab26 and Atg16L1, a component of pre-autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizushima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>). For this purpose, hippocampal neurons transiently expressing EGFP-Rab26WT were immunostained for endogenous Atg16L1. Indeed, an almost perfect colocalization between Atg16L1 and Rab26-positive clusters was detected in neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), thereby identifying these clusters as autophagosomal precursors. Next, we stained untransfected neurons for endogenous Rab26 and Atg16L1. Again, a high degree of overlap was observed between Rab26 and Atg16L1 in clusters decorating neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) but not in cell bodies which remained largely unstained (not shown). Strong overlap with Atg16L1 was also observed when neurons were transfected with FLAG-Rab26WT and/or FLAG-Rab26QL, but not with FLAG-Rab26TN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This indicated that the association of Rab26 with autophagosomes depends on the GTP-form of the protein. This GTP-dependency was similarly noted in HeLa cells following ectopic expression of Rab26.

Therefore, to assess whether the Rab26/Atg16L1 clusters recruit LC3 to membranes, we co-transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with GFP-tagged LC3B (one of the eight known LC3 family members) and FLAG-tagged Rab26 variants. Co-expression of GFP-LC3 and active forms FLAG-Rab26 (WT and QL) resulted in a localization pattern comparable to that observed for Atg16L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), thereby verifying the nature of these compartments as autophagosomes. Interestingly, however, LC3 recruitment was not observed when the EGFP-tagged Rab26WT was overexpressed (not shown, see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>Taken together, the above findings indicate a novel functional link between a Rab GTPase and a hitherto unknown autophagy pathway in neurons that appears selective for synaptic and/or secretory vesicles, tentatively termed ‘vesiculophagy’. Indeed, there is now a growing body evidence implicating several Rabs (Rab1, Rab7, Rab9, Rab11, Rab24, Rab32, and Rab33, inclusive) in canonical autophagy (for a comprehensive review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chua et al., 2011</xref>]). Among these, Rab33, a Golgi resident Rab, participates in the formation of autophagosome precursors by recruiting Atg16L1 (a Rab33 effector) to isolation membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itoh et al., 2008</xref>). Given that Rab26 colocalizes with Atg16L1, we checked for potential cooperation between Rab26 and Rab33 in neurons. For this, hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with FLAG-Rab26WT and EGFP-Rab33BWT. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, EGFP-Rab33BWT was largely restricted to the perinuclear/Golgi region in the soma which showed no appreciable overlap with FLAG-Rab26WT. On the other hand, significant overlap between Rab26 and Rab33 was observed in more peripheral puncta lining neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

For this, purified bacterially expressed recombinant Rab26 variants (QL or TN), tagged with GST were incubated with a preassembled complex of Atg5 and the N-terminal fragment of Atg16L1 containing its coiled coil domain (Atg16NT). In agreement with our immunoprecipitation studies, GST-pulldown revealed an interaction between Atg16L1 and Rab26, with Atg16L1 binding to the QL and to a lesser extent the TN-variant of Rab26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), with the latter being further reduced upon repetitive washings (not shown). Atg5 remains bound in this complex. To further examine the interaction, we analyzed the binding between Rab26 and Atg16L1 using analytical gel filtration. Surprisingly, formation of Rab26(QL)-ATG16L1 complexes were not detectable with this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a positive control, we carried out the same experiment using Rab33(QL) and ATG16L1. Here, complex formation was detectable with this approach. Thus, while both IP and pull-down experiments show that RAB26 binds ATG16L1 in a GTP-dependent manner, this binding appears to be weaker than the interaction between Rab33 and ATG16L1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we have combined multiple complementary biochemical and cell biological approaches to demonstrate that the small GTPase Rab26 is specifically associated with synaptic vesicles. Intriguingly, Rab26 appears to be particularly enriched in large clusters of synaptic vesicles to which the autophagy proteins Atg16L1, LC3 and Rab33B are recruited, suggesting that they represent pre-autophagosomal compartments. We show further that, at least when using overexpression of EGFP-tagged Rab26, such clusters are also formed in cell bodies where they are enclosed by a single (and in some instances a double) isolation membrane. Based on these observations, we conclude that Rab26 provides a direct link between synaptic vesicles and the core autophagy machinery thereby uncovering a novel and selective autophagy pathway (tentatively named ‘vesiculophagy’) that may regulate synapse turnover.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rab26 is a secretory GTPase resembling Rab27b in its molecular properties but differing in its function</title><p>Rab26 is most closely related to the secretory GTPases Rab3 and Rab27, which led to the conclusion that it may perform similar functions in membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fukuda, 2008</xref>). This view is supported by reports showing association of Rab26 with zymogen granules in exocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nashida et al., 2006</xref>) and by the observation that overexpression of the dominant-negative form abolishes the formation of zymogen granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, Rab26 has been found to be associated with lysosomes in zymogen-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin and Mills, 2014</xref>) implying that its functions in secretory cells extend beyond that of exocytosis. In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlos et al., 2010</xref>), Rab26 was identified among the list of Rab proteins (up-to-30) enriched on highly purified synaptic vesicles. Our present data now show that this association is exclusive, with Rab26 being absent from other organelles such as early endosomes, paralleling the distribution of other secretory Rabs. On the other hand, the preferential association of Rab26 with large clusters of synaptic vesicles and its conspicuous absence from smaller boutons positive for synaptic vesicle markers is clearly distinct from Rab3 and Rab27b and indicates that Rab26 may not be contributing to the canonical function of these Rabs in regulated exocytosis.</p><p>Intriguingly, in contrast to for example, Rab3 and Rab5, Rab26 cannot be extracted from synaptic vesicle membranes by GDI in its GDP-form—a feature it shares with Rab27b. Rather, Rab26 exhibits a tendency to oligomerize in the GDP-form, again a feature shared with Rab27b and perhaps with some others such as Rab11 and Rab9, which crystallize as dimers in the GDP-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pasqualato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wittmann and Rudolph, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavas et al., 2007</xref>). It is somewhat surprising that, along with the GDP-bound variant, wild-type Rab26 also appears to oligomerize (albeit to a lesser extent). However, this might be explained by the known high intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis rates of wild-type and native Rab proteins which would render a percentage of wild-type Rab26 inactive (approximately 40% by co-immunoprecipitation), thereby prompting its oligomerization on membranes and hence preclude its GDI-extraction from synaptic vesicles. By comparison, the propensity of the ‘GDP-locked’ variant (Rab26TN) to rapidly oligomerize would likely result a steric clash with the GDI-related Rab escort protein (REP), which is required for prenylation and delivery of new synthesized Rabs to their cognate membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andres et al., 1993</xref>). Such a scenario would be in keeping with the predominantly cytosolic distribution pattern observed in neurons expressing FLAG/EGFP-tagged Rab26TN.</p><p>Perhaps the most conspicuous feature of Rab26 is that it is not only preferentially associated with secretory vesicle clusters but actually induces their formation in a GTP-dependent manner as becomes apparent upon the expression of exogenous Rab26 variants in both neurons and non-neuronal cells. This is most dramatically observed with the EGFP-tagged variant suggesting that the weak homodimerization tendency of EGFP enhances the phenotype (note that no other EGFP-tagged Rab exhibits similar features including the most abundant secretory GTPase, Rab3a). At present, the exact mechanism underlying this clustering phenotype is unclear. Nevertheless, since the GTP-form of Rab26 does not oligomerize, it is unlikely that clustering is effected by homophilic Rab26 interactions. Rather, it possible that clustering is mediated by a hitherto unknown effector protein. This effector is probably distinct from Atg16L1 as overexpression of EGFP-Rab33B (that also recruits Atg16L1) does not induce such clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and data not shown). However, given that the central terminal region of Atg16L1 has a tendency for homo-multimerization, this possibility cannot be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizushima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishibashi et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, our findings agree with a recent report according to which overexpression of Rab26 in exocrine cell lines induces clustering of lysosomes, reminiscent of the partial co-localization of the EGFP-induced Rab26 clusters with lysosomes in neuronal cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin and Mills, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Does Rab26 direct synaptic vesicles towards the autophagy pathway?</title><p>Our results indicate that the core autophagy protein Atg16L1 is an effector of Rab26 that binds to the GTPase exclusively in the GTP-form, paralleling previous findings on the Golgi-resident Rab33B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itoh et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, binding of Rab26 to Atg16L1 appears to be weaker than that between Rab33 and Atg16L1, which plays a role in canonical autophagy, probably explaining why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Itoh et al. (2008)</xref> did not observe binding of GST-Rab26 to a full-length Atg16L1 protein using stringent conditions. It is conceivable that the interaction is more transient, or else, that it requires additional factors for stabilization, thus allowing for fine-tuning the flow of synaptic vesicles targeted for selective autophagy.</p><p>How does recruitment of Atg16L1 to synaptic vesicle clusters relate to the established steps of autophagosome formation? First of all, it cannot yet be excluded with certainty that upon recruitment to these vesicles Atg16L1 performs a non-canonical function that is not related to autophagosome formation (see e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pimentel-Muinos and Boada-Romero, 2014</xref>] for review of such functions). In particular, Atg16L1 and Rab33A have recently been found to be associated with secretory vesicles in neuroendocrine PC12 cells, with the data suggesting a role for Atg16L1 in regulating exocytosis independent of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishibashi et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, based on our extensive morphological assessment using double immunolabeling microscopy, we strongly favor that the Rab26-Atg16L1 complexes in neurons represent pre-autophagosomal structures because (i) Rab26 is not present on all synaptic vesicles but rather confined to vesicle aggregates that may be functionally impaired, and (ii) LC3 is recruited to these clusters suggesting that the formation of an autophagosomal membrane is, at least in part, initiated.</p><p>Our data indicates that the vesicle clusters containing Rab26 and Atg16L1 have undergone exo-endocytotic cycling. Intriguingly, clathrin has recently been shown to interact with Atg16L1, thus targeting plasma membrane constituents towards autophagosome precursors via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ravikumar et al., 2010</xref>). Since clathrin-mediated endocytosis constitutes the main endocytotic pathway for synaptic vesicles, it is conceivable that there is a synergy between Rab26- and clathrin-induced autophagocytosis in nerve terminals that further fine-tunes the targeting of synaptic vesicles to preautophagosomal structures.</p><p>Taken together, the data support the view that Rab26 is member of a signaling cascade that selectively targets synaptic and secretory vesicles towards autophagocytosis, which may represent a novel and highly specific form of autophagy (‘vesiculophagy’). In recent years, it has become apparent that in addition to the classical, mTOR/ULK kinase-induced pathway of macroautophagy there is a panoply of diverse and highly regulated pathways (e.g., pexophagy and mitophagy) that all converge on the common pathway but differ in the mechanism of initiation and cargo recruitment. In many of these cases the pathway is initiated by ubiquitination of target proteins. While we do not know whether this is also the case here, it is conceivable that the initiation event may indeed be the recruitment of active Rab26 to the membrane of subsets of synaptic vesicles that then interacts with other factors to form clusters and to recruit an isolation membrane, the origin of which remains to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for presynaptic function</title><p>Following the classical work in the early 70s of last century demonstrating that synaptic vesicles undergo multiple rounds of recycling in the synapse, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwood et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ceccarelli et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heuser and Reese, 1973</xref>), recent attention has focused primarily on unraveling the mechanisms of endocytosis and vesicle re-formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saheki and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). However, all membrane constituents age and accumulate structural defects requiring sorting out of damaged constituents. Although no increase in the number of late endosomes, lysosomes or autophagosomes was observed following even massive stimulation, it was hypothesized as early as 1971 that newly reformed synaptic vesicles could either be actively re-used as functional synaptic vesicles or re-directed to a pathway ultimately leading to lysosomes as the final destination for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holtzman et al., 1971</xref>). Our discovery of vesiculophagy as a pathway initiated in presynaptic boutons that directs entire synaptic vesicle pools towards autophagosomes provides a previously uncharacterized link towards lysosomal degradation of trafficking organelles which is distinct from the classical endosomal route. Indeed, recent data suggest that presynaptic neurotransmission is functionally modulated by macroautophagy. Induction of autophagy in neurons increased the amount of autophagic vacuoles in presynaptic terminals and with an accompanying reduction in synaptic vesicle number and decrease in evoked neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, two groups have recently suggested that in axons autophagosomes originate distally and then are transported by retrograde motors towards the cell body. During their travel they undergo fusion with acidic compartments and finally with the lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that Rab26 feeds vesicle membranes into autophagosomes that may form and mature during retrograde transport. How this novel pathway is initiated and regulated will be the subject of future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin, Rab3a, GDI (Cl 81.2) and GFP were provided by Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany).

We leave it up to you either to tone down your claim (Title, Discussion, etc) or to provide further experimental data</italic>.</p><p>We agree that we do not have conclusive evidence showing directly that Rab26 activation triggers autophagy of synaptic vesicles. The problem, as far as we see it, is that in situ this pathway is probably not active or of only very low activity, making loss-of-function experiments rather difficult. We have tried various approaches but it became clear that considerable additional efforts (including suitable animal models) are required for obtaining air-tight evidence, and it will probably be more efficient to carry out these experiments with a laboratory having the required tools and experiences.</p><p>We have therefore revised the Discussion as suggested in order to make sure we are not over-interpreting our results or draw conclusions that are not substantiated by the evidence. We have also revised the Abstract accordingly. As far as the Title is concerned, we could not come up with something better: “link”, at least by our understanding, means a connection (which we have shown) and does not imply necessity/sufficiency. Therefore, we have retained it except for a small change suggested by the <italic>eLife</italic> office, but we are open for a better suggestion.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p><italic>It is surprising why EGFP-Rab26 is not LC3 positive: is this a question of weaker efficiency or eGFP-Rab26? Please comment</italic>.</p><p>We were also puzzled by the observation that EGFP-Rab26, unlike FLAG-Rab26, does not readily localize with LC3. Possibly, the addition of the bulky EGFP-moiety (which is of similar size as the GTPase itself) interferes with the binding of additional factors needed for recruiting LC3 or for targeting vesicles to LC3 positive compartments, thereby trapping the vesicles at a step just prior to the recruitment of LC3. While uncommon, there are notable examples of the bulky GFP moiety interfering with protein-protein interactions and thus with function such as in the ESCRT pathway (Howard et al., 2001, J. Cell Sci., 114, 2395; Langelier et al., 2006, J. Virol. 80, 9465; Strack et al., 2003, Cell, 114, 689; Tandon et al., 2009, J. Virol., 83, 10797). Prevention of LC3-recruitment may therefore render the Rab26-induced vesicle clusters “stuck” as they cannot progress to form mature autophagosomes that are then degraded. Such a scenario would explain the accumulation of the enormous vesicle clusters observed within neuronal cell bodies that whilst retained Atg16L1, formed no or only incomplete isolation membranes. It may also account for the densely packed vesicle clusters lacking isolation membranes observed upon expression of EGFP-Rab26 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular synapses.</p><p><italic>What role does Rab26 expression levels play in the morphological phenotype</italic>?</p><p>A higher level of Rab26 WT expression in cells (monitored by immunocytochemistry) does increase the phenotype. Nevertheless, even though Rab26 WT and Rab26 QL both express at similar levels in these cells (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the WT variant still exhibits the stronger morphological phenotype. Consequently, the functional state of Rab26 (rather than its level alone) is the dominant factor influencing the magnitude of the phenotype.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: which synaptobrevin was used for colocalization with EGFP-Rab26</italic>?</p><p>Antibodies specific for synaptobrevin 2 were used.
