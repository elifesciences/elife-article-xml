sites (IRESs) drive translation initiation during stress. In response to hypoxia, (lymph)angiogenic factors responsible for tissue revascularization in ischemic diseases are induced by the IRES-dependent mechanism. Here, we searched for IRES <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (ITAFs) active in early hypoxia in mouse cardiomyocytes. Using knock-down and proteomics approaches, we show a link between a stressed-induced nuclear body, the paraspeckle, and IRES-dependent translation. Furthermore, smiFISH experiments demonstrate the recruitment of IRES-containing mRNA into paraspeckle during hypoxia. Our data reveal that the long non-coding RNA <italic>Neat1</italic>, an essential paraspeckle component, is a key translational regulator, active on IRESs of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factor mRNAs. In addition, paraspeckle proteins p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSPC1 as well as nucleolin and RPS2, two p54<sup>nrb</sup>-interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry, are ITAFs for IRES subgroups. Paraspeckle thus appears as a platform to recruit IRES-containing mRNAs and possibly host IRESome assembly. Polysome PCR array shows that <italic>Neat1</italic> isoforms regulate IRES-dependent translation and, more widely, translation of mRNAs involved in stress response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translational control</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>Neat1</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>angiogenic growth factor</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE11-0020-RIBOCARD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prats</surname><given-names>Anne-Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ProFI ANR-10-INBS-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlet-Schiltz</surname><given-names>Odile</given-names></name><name><surname>Froment</surname><given-names>Carine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Godet</surname><given-names>Anne-Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Hantelys</surname><given-names>Fransky</given-names></name><name><surname>Roussel</surname><given-names>Emilie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LncRNA Neat1, with paraspeckle proteins, controls translational induction of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factors by the IRES-dependent mechanism in mouse cardiomyocytes submitted to hypoxia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell stress triggers major changes in the control of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. One of the main responses to stress is the blockade of global translation allowing cells to save energy. This process results from inactivating the canonical cap-dependent mechanism of translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holcik and Sonenberg, 2005</xref>). However, translation of specific mRNAs is maintained or even increased during stress via alternative mechanisms of translation initiation. One of these mechanisms involves internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), structural elements mostly present in the 5’ untranslated regions of specific mRNAs, which drive the internal recruitment of ribosomes onto mRNA and promote cap-independent translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Godet et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia, or the lack of oxygen, is a major stress in pathologies such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pouysségur et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, in ischemic heart failure disease, coronary artery branch occlusion exposes cardiac cells to hypoxic conditions. The cell response to hypoxia induces angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis to reperfuse the stressed tissue with new vessels and allow cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morfoisse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pouysségur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tatin et al., 2017</xref>). The well-known response to hypoxia is the transcriptional induction of specific genes under the control of the hypoxia-induced factors 1 and 2 (HIF1, HIF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koh et al., 2011</xref>). However, we have recently reported that most mRNAs coding (lymph)angiogenic growth factors are induced at the translatome level in hypoxic cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hantelys et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of these factors allows the recovery of functional blood and lymphatic vasculature in ischemic diseases, including myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tatin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ylä-Herttuala and Baker, 2017</xref>). The mRNAs of the major (lymph)angiogenic growth factors belonging to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) families all contain IRESs that are activated in early hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morfoisse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hantelys et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>IRES-dependent translation is regulated by IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs) that are in most cases RNA-binding proteins acting as positive or negative regulators. A given ITAF can regulate several IRESs, while a given IRES is often regulated by several ITAFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Godet et al., 2019</xref>), depending on the cell type or physiology. This has led to the concept of IRESome, a multi-partner ribonucleic complex allowing ribosome recruitment onto the mRNA via the IRES.</p><p>ITAFs often exhibit several functions in addition to their ability to control translation. Many of them play a role in alternative splicing, transcription, ribosome biogenesis or RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Godet et al., 2019</xref>). Clearly, a large part of ITAFs are nuclear proteins able to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. Previous data have also shown that a nuclear event is important for cellular IRES activity, leading to the hypothesis of IRESome formation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainaoui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semler and Waterman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoneley et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, several ITAFs are components of a nuclear body, the paraspeckle, formed in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choudhry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2002</xref>). These ITAFs include several hnRNPs, as well as major paraspeckle proteins such as P54<sup>nrb</sup> nuclear RNA binding (P54<sup>nrb</sup>/NONO) and splicing factor proline and glutamine-rich (SFPQ/PSF). P54<sup>nrb</sup> and SFPQ belong to the family of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> behavior and human splicing (DBHS) proteins whose third member is the paraspeckle protein C1 (PSPC1). P54<sup>nrb</sup> and SFPQ are essential for paraspeckle formation while PSPC1 is not. These three DBHS proteins are known to interact with each other and function in heteroduplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Passon et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, P54<sup>nrb</sup> and SFPQ interact with the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <italic>Neat1</italic> (nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1), that constitutes the skeleton of the paraspeckle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clemson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sunwoo et al., 2009</xref>). This lncRNA, a paraspeckle essential component, is present as two isoforms <italic>Neat1_1</italic> and <italic>Neat1_2</italic> whose sizes in mouse are 3.2 and 20.8 kilobases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sunwoo et al., 2009</xref>). Its transcription is induced during hypoxia by HIF2 and promotes paraspeckle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choudhry et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Neat1</italic> is overexpressed in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, its induction by hypoxia has been shown in cardiomyocytes where it plays a role in cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kenneweg et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>According to previous reports, paraspeckle is able to control gene expression via the retention of edited mRNAs and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prasanth et al., 2005</xref>). In 2017, Shen et al. have also shown that the paraspeckle might inhibit translation by sequestering p54<sup>nrb</sup> and SFPQ which are ITAFs of the <italic>MYC</italic> IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we were interested in finding new ITAFs responsible for activating (lymph)angiogenic factor mRNA IRESs in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, during early hypoxia. We have previously shown that the two paraspeckle proteins p54<sup>nrb</sup> and hnRNPM are ITAFs, activators of the FGF1 IRES during myoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainaoui et al., 2015</xref>). This incited us to investigate the potential role of the paraspeckle and of <italic>Neat1</italic> in the control of IRES-dependent translation in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. We show here that Neat1 expression and paraspeckle formation correlate with the activation of the <italic>FGF1</italic> IRES during hypoxia, in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells. The knock-down of p54<sup>nrb</sup>, PSPC1 or <italic>Neat1</italic> generates a decrease in <italic>FGF1</italic> IRES activity and in endogenous FGF1 expression. Furthermore, our data revealed that IRES-containing mRNA is colocalized with Neat1 in paraspeckle during hypoxia. By quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of the p54<sup>nrb</sup> interactome, we identified two additional ITAFs able to control the <italic>FGF1</italic> IRES activity: nucleolin and ribosomal protein RPS2. Analysis of IRESs in the knock-down experiments showed that p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSPC1 are activators of several but not all IRESs of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factor mRNAs whereas <italic>Neat1</italic> appears as a strong activator of all the cellular IRESs tested. These data suggest that the paraspeckle, via <italic>Neat1</italic> and several protein components would be the site of IRESome assembly in the nucleus. In addition, a polysome PCR array reveals that <italic>Neat1</italic> affects the translation of most IRES-containing mRNAs and of several mRNA families involved in hypoxic response, angiogenesis and cardioprotection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGF1 IRES activation during hypoxia correlates with paraspeckle formation and with Neat1 induction in different cell types</title><p>In order to analyze the regulation of IRES activity during hypoxia, HL-1 cardiomyocytes were transduced with the ‘Lucky Luke’ bicistronic lentivector validated in our previous reports, containing the <italic>renilla</italic> luciferase (LucR) and firefly luciferase (LucF) genes separated by the <italic>FGF1</italic> IRES (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In order to identify other members of this complex, we analysed the p54<sup>nrb</sup> interactome in HL-1 cell nucleus and cytoplasm using a label-free quantitative mass spectrometry approach. For this purpose, cells were transduced by a lentivector expressing an HA-tagged p54<sup>nrb</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

To evaluate p54<sup>nrb</sup> interaction changes, pairwise comparisons based on MS intensity values were performed for each quantified protein between the four groups, cytoplasmic and nuclear complexes from cells subjected to normoxia or hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

This lncRNA is an activator of all cellular IRESs tested, but not of the viral EMCV IRES. More broadly, <italic>Neat1</italic> isoforms impact the recruitment into polysomes of most IRES-containing mRNAs and several families of mRNAs involved in the response to hypoxia. The colocalization of IRES-containing mRNA with <italic>Neat1</italic> RNA in paraspeckles increased in hypoxia conditions, suggesting that the paraspeckle may be a recruitment platform for IRES-containing mRNAs during stress and that the IRESome could be assembled in the paraspeckle before mRNA export from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of IRESome formation in the paraspeckle.</title><p>According to the present data, we propose that the paraspeckle may be a recruitment platform for IRES-containing mRNAs in hypoxic cardiomyocytes. <italic>Neat1</italic> and proteins present in the paraspeckle (among them major paraspeckle components such as p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSPC1) would assemble the IRESome, then mRNA would be exported from the nucleus and translated in the cytosol. Identification of Neat1 in the cytoplasm suggests that it might be part of the IRESome and have a direct role in translation. However this latter hypothesis remains to be elucidated.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-69162-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>It may be noted that the inhibition of IRES activities resulting from ITAF depletion is quite moderate for the different proteins while stronger for the lncRNA <italic>Neat1</italic>. This cannot be explained only by differences in knock-down efficiency. We hypothesize is that several proteins are present in the IRESome complex and that there may be a certain redundancy between them. Thus, the depletion of a single ITAF would not be sufficient to abolish the IRES activity completely. Also, to explain why paraspeckle ITAFs such as p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSPC1 do not inhibit all the IRESs, we propose that the paraspeckle IRESome protein composition varies depending on the IRES and the hypoxic or normoxic condition, while <italic>Neat1</italic> remains the main actor of the process. Several observations suggest that <italic>Neat1_2</italic> may be the main isoform involved. However, the knock-down of <italic>Neat1-2</italic> isoform with a specific gapmer does not affect IRES activity as much as the knock-down of both Neat1 isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We were not successful in knocking down the isoform Neat1_1, as its sequence is entirely contained in <italic>Neat1_2</italic>. Thus at this stage we conclude that the two isoforms are probably involved. The fluidigm PCR array suggests that they may affect translation differently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We searched for an ITAF able to regulate a set of IRESs during hypoxia and found the lncRNA <italic>Neat1</italic> as a wide activator of IRES-dependent translation. However, our data show that <italic>Neat1</italic> also regulates IRES activities both in normoxia and hypoxia. One explanation may be that <italic>Neat1</italic> is already expressed in normoxia in HL-1 cells, which are transformed cells despite their cardiomyocyte beating phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Claycomb et al., 1998</xref>). Although <italic>Neat1</italic> expression and paraspeckle number increase in response to hypoxia, a significant percentage of cells already contain paraspeckles in normoxia, which may explain why IRESs are already active in normoxia. It has been reported that <italic>Neat1_2</italic> is not expressed in all tissues in vivo, whereas it is found in all transformed or immortalized cell lines (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakagawa et al., 2011</xref>). In concordance with this observation, previous reports show that cellular IRESs are active in all cultured cell lines while inactive or tissue-specific in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Créancier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Créancier et al., 2001</xref>). The presence of paraspeckles in normoxia may also reflect the stress due to the transfection procedure, which could interfere with the effect of the hypoxic stress performed in our study. A different approach to obtain <italic>Neat1</italic> silencing, such as CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-down or knock-out could provide an interesting solution to this issue.</p><p>Our data contrast with the study of Shen et al. who showed that <italic>Neat1</italic> depletion allows redistributing p54<sup>nrb</sup> and SFPQ/PSF onto the <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA, in correlation with an increase in MYC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Several reasons may explain this lack of concordance. Firstly, different cell lines were used: HL-1 cardiomyocytes and 67NR breast tumor cells in the present study, HeLa and MCF7 tumor cells in the report by Shen et al. The regulation of IRES-dependent translation varies depending on cell lines. Secondly, they worked with human cell lines while our report is focused on mouse cells. In human, <italic>MYC</italic> expression is different from mouse as the <italic>MYC</italic> gene contains an additional upstream promoter, P0, which generates a longer transcript with a second IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nanbru et al., 2001</xref>). Thirdly, they have not directly analyzed the <italic>MYC</italic> IRES activity but only the binding of p54<sup>nrb</sup> and SFPQ to the <italic>MYC</italic> endogenous mRNA. Moreover an increase in myc protein expression does not necessarily correspond to increased IRES activity as the <italic>MYC</italic> mRNA is also translated by the cap-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nanbru et al., 1997</xref>). Taken together, the two studies are different rather than discordant.</p><p>A surprising result has been finding a ribosomal protein, RPS2, in the nuclear p54<sup>nrb</sup> interactome. This suggests an extra-ribosomal role of this protein. Its interaction with p54<sup>nrb</sup> favors the hypothesis that RPS2 would impact the IRES activity as an IRESome component in the paraspeckle. The presence of nucleolin in the complex also suggests a link of paraspeckle with nucleolus and ribosome biogenesis. Supporting this, PSPC1 was first identified in the nucleolus proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2002</xref>). The nuclear binding of specific ribosomal proteins to IRESs might be a mechanism for forming specialized ribosomes.</p><p><italic>Neat1</italic> is not the first lncRNA to exhibit an ITAF function. The lncRNA TP53-regulated modulator of p27 (<italic>TRMP</italic>) has been recently described as an ITAF of the <italic>Cdkn1b/p27<sup>kip</sup></italic> IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). TRMP inhibits the <italic>p27<sup>kip</sup></italic> IRES activity by competing with the IRES for pyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) binding and prevents IRES activation mediated by PTB. Also, the lncRNA <italic>ARAP-as1</italic> directly interacts with SFPQ, which results in release of PTB and activation of <italic>MYC</italic> IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We have not yet deciphered the mechanism of action of <italic>Neat1</italic>. We propose that the paraspeckle would be a recruitment platform for IRES-containing mRNAs. <italic>Neat1</italic>, by interacting with p54<sup>nrb</sup> and other paraspeckle proteins/ITAFs, would thus allow IRESome formation in the paraspeckle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Is the role of <italic>Neat1</italic> exclusively nuclear in the paraspeckle, or is it exported to the cytoplasm with the IRESome complex? Several observations argue for the presence of <italic>Neat1</italic> in the cytoplasm: our FISH experiments clearly identify the <italic>Neat1-2</italic> isoform in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), while a recent report shows that <italic>Neat1-1</italic> isoform is released from nucleus to cytoplasm where it suppresses the Wnt signaling in leukemia stem cells and acts as a tumor suppressor in acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Neat1-2</italic> isoform has been detected in the cytoplasm of hematopoietic cells by other authors. Interestingly, they identified a histone modifier, ASXL1, interacting with p54<sup>nrb</sup>/NONO and involved in paraspeckle formation. Mutation of ASXL1 generates <italic>Neat1_2</italic> export to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the role of cytoplasmic <italic>Neat1</italic> in translation is suggested by our previous data showing that <italic>Neat1</italic> is present in HL-1 cell polysomes and that this association with polysomes is increased in early hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hantelys et al., 2019</xref>). The involvement of <italic>Neat1</italic> in translation control via a cytoplasmic location is also supported by the presence of the triple helix in the 3’UTR of <italic>Neat1_2</italic>, whose role in translation activation has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilusz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The model of IRESome formation mediated by <italic>Neat1</italic> in the paraspeckle, and the absence of any impact of <italic>Neat1</italic> on the picornaviral EMCV IRES activity, are both consistent with previous reports suggesting that the site of mRNA synthesis is crucial for IRES structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Semler and Waterman, 2008</xref>). For picornaviruses whose mRNAs are synthesized in the cytoplasm, IRES elements would be able to form an IRESome RNP in the cytoplasm. In contrast, cellular mRNAs (as well as DNA viruses and retroviruses mRNAs) transcribed in the nucleus need a nuclear event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainaoui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoneley et al., 2000</xref>). The present data provide a mechanism for this nuclear history and reveal a new function of the paraspeckle, a nuclear body, in IRESome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>A role of <italic>Neat1</italic> in ischemic heart has been recently reported showing that <italic>Neat1</italic> down-regulation would protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis by regulating the processing of pri-miR-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gidlöf et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, these authors show that hypoxia down-regulates <italic>Neat1</italic> expression in cardiomyocytes. This contradicts our data showing that <italic>Neat1</italic> is induced by hypoxia. Our data are however in agreement with the rest of the literature showing that Neat1 is induced by hypoxia in tumors, its transcription being activated by HIF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choudhry et al., 2015</xref>). Another study also showed that <italic>Neat1</italic> overexpression protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis by sponging miR125a-5p, resulting in upregulation of the apoptosis repressor gene B-cell lymphoma-2-like 12 (BCL2L12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). These contradictory reports highlight the complex impact of <italic>Neat1</italic> on miRNA-mediated gene regulation.</p><p>In the present study, we have uncovered a novel role of <italic>Neat1</italic> in the translational control of several families of genes involved in stress response, angiogenesis and cardioprotection, while it does not affect global translation. The increased protein synthesis from mRNAs coding ITAFs favors a wide role of <italic>Neat1</italic> and of the paraspeckle in activating IRES-dependent translation. Many of the genes involved in angiogenesis or cardioprotection tested here have not been described as containing an IRES in their mRNAs. We can make the hypothesis that these mRNA families either contain IRESs that have not been identified yet, or are translated by another cap-independent mechanism such as m6A-induced ribosome engagement sites (MIRES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prats et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>Neat1</italic>, as a stress-induced lncRNA, plays a role in many pathologies including cancer and ischemic diseases, thus its central role in the translational control of expression of genes involved in tissue revascularization and cell survival makes it a potential therapeutic target of great interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

The 20 most intense ions per survey scan were selected with an isolation width of 2 m/z for subsequent data-dependent CID fragmentation, and the resulting fragments were analyzed in the linear trap (LTQ). The normalized collision energy was set to 30%. To prevent repetitive selection of the same peptide, the dynamic exclusion duration was set to 60 s with a 10 ppm tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes.

The cross-assignment of MS/MS information between runs was enabled (it allows to assign peptide sequences to detected but non-identified features). Each protein intensity was based on the sum of unique peptide intensities and was normalized across all samples by the median intensity. Missing values were independently replaced for each run by its 5% quantile. After log2-transformation of the data, the values of the technical replicates were averaged for each analyzed samples. For each pairwise comparison, an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed. Proteins were considered significantly enriched when their absolute log2-transformed fold change was higher than 1 and their p-value lower than 0.05. To eliminate false-positive hits from quantitation of low-intensity signals, two additional criteria were applied: only the proteins identified with a total number of averaged peptide spectrum match (PSM) counts &gt;4 and quantified in a minimum of two biological replicates, before missing value replacement, for at least one of the two compared conditions were selected.

(nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1) is required for IRES Internal Ribosome Entry Site)-mediated mRNA translation activity. <italic>Neat1</italic> is required for the activity of many cellular

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper reports highly novel data that connect nuclear paraspeckles and lncRNA to IRES activity. However, many of the experiments are incomplete, and some of the conclusions are unjustified. Technical problems. such as missing loading controls must be rectified. The full reviewers' reports are included. They include a long list of criticisms and constructive suggestions for improvements.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Depletion of NEAT1 by control gapmers already exerts stress on the cardiomyocytes. Can the authors be sure that observed changes in IRES activities were not caused by higher levels of cell stress? Is eIF2alpha phosphorylated in the gapmer experiments (Figure 2)? If this is the case, it could explain why only a few differences were noted in Figure 4D.</p><p>Relevant to this point, you silence the long non-coding RNA, but transfection per se causes stress to cell. It seems that a different approach instead of silencing should be used since stress response is the question that needs to be answered. Perhaps a stable cell line or CRISPR KO can be used instead? Otherwise, the authors need to explain why the cell stress induced by transfection is not relevant here.</p><p>2. While NEAT1 abundance has an effect on IRES, the NEAT-ITAFs do not. The authors should check the effects of DDX17, Eno3, and Hspa2 that were enriched in the cytoplasm during hypoxia (Figure 4E).</p><p>3. Depletion of NEAT1 or NEAT1-ITAFs has always more effect on endogenous FGF1 protein abundance than on IRES activity. Is the half-life of FGF1 affected during the siRNA and gapmer treatments?</p><p>4. You need to provide a more direct cause-effect relationship between Neat1 and the proteins claimed to be ITAFs for the FGF1 IRES activity.</p><p>5. Validate the idea that paraspeckles are platforms for IRESome formation as this would imply the IRES needs to transit through the paraspeckle to gain full activity.</p><p>6. Validate some of the MS-IP data where 2013 proteins interacti with p54nrb.</p><p>7. There is an issue with the timing of the response, inasmuch as the amount of Neat1 induction of the FGF IRES and paraspeckle activity does not seem to align.

In other words, are the novel data presented connected to established effects of hypoxia on protein synthesis?</p><p>10. According to the data in Figure 1 and supplemental Figure 1, there is a better correlation with the formation of paraspeckles and greater expression under hypoxia of the longer isoform, NEAT1_2. You should explain the reason for focusing on just NEAT1, the shorter isoform, on the effect of the regulation of FGF1 IRES activity in Figure 2?</p><p>11. The mRNAs encoding the major (lymph)angiogenic growth factors are fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). You should evaluate the effect of Neat1 on the regulation of more than just one IRES. The same experiments shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3 should be included for VEGF, especially since the results presently cannot be extrapolated to other IRES elements, and because recent studies have shown that FGF can act synergistically with VEGF.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript investigates an interesting topic regarding IRES regulation by the Neat1 lncRNA and several ITAFs. General conclusion regarding paraspeckles being sites of IRESome formation appear premature as they are supported by correlative information. It is difficult to conclude direct cause-effect relationships on a quick-response regulatory mechanism such as translation through the use of gene knockdowns. The reason being that it takes several days for appropriate knockdown levels of RNA or protein to be reached – making it difficult to eliminate the possibility that secondary/pleiotropic effects are responsible for, or significantly contributing to, the observed physiological effect.</p><p>I think experiments are required that (i) provide a more direct cause-effect relationship between Neat1 and the proteins claimed to be ITAFs for the FGF1 IRES activity, (ii) validate the idea that paraspeckles are platforms for IRESome formation as this would imply the IRES needs to transit through the paraspeckle to gain full activity, and (iii) validate the MS-IP data where 2013 proteins interacting with p54nrb.</p><p>Specific:</p><p>1. Section entitled: &quot;FGF1 IRES activation during hypoxia correlates with paraspeckle formation and with Neat1 induction.&quot;</p><p>– Measurements from the RLuc/FLuc reporter are made 4, 8, 24 after induction of hypoxia. Please show individual RLuc and FLuc measurements, not the ratios. Is eIF2-α phosphorylated under the experimental conditions? Under hypoxic conditions, are the same isoforms of Neat1 produced to the same ratios? Are new isoforms seen? A Northern blot would provide insight into whether the architecture of this lncRNA changes.</p><p>– Last sentence of this paragraph reads &quot;This correlation fits better with Neat1_2 than with the total Neat1, suggesting a link between expression of the long Neat1 isoform and IRES activation.&quot; Can correlation of Neat1 expression and IRES activation be used to imply a link between the two?</p><p>2. Section entitled: &quot;LncRNA Neat1 knock-down drastically affects the FGF1 IRES activity and endogenous FGF1 expression.&quot;</p><p>The authors deplete Neat1 using gap-mers, I could not find how long a treatment was used to achieve the 3-fold knockdown (I'm assuming at least 2 days). The long time period in these experiments likely makes it difficult to conclude that reductions in Neat are directly responsible for the effects on FGF1 IRES activity or FGF1 protein levels. How selective is the reported effect for the FGF1 5' leader? Hence, I think it is premature to conclude that &quot;Neat1 regulates FGF1 expression, and acts as an ITAF of the FGF1 IRES&quot; (last sentence of paragraph) since an ITAF would imply a direct interaction (which is not shown in this MS).</p><p>3. Section entitled &quot;Paraspeckle proteins P54nrb and PSCP1, but not SFPQ, are ITAFs of the FGF1 IRES.&quot; The authors assess three major components of paraspeckles (the SFPQ, p54nrb and PSPC1 proteins) for a potential role in IRES activity. Since knockdowns are used to reduce protein levels and this takes several days to achieve, how can effects on IRES activity or FGF1 protein levels be directly link to the protein activity targeted for knockdown versus a secondary effect arising due to target knockdown? How selective is the reported effect for the FGF1 5' leader? Hence, I think its difficult to conclude that &quot;The ability of three paraspeckle components, Neat1, p54nrb and PSPC1 to regulate the FGF1 IRES activity led us to the hypothesis that the paraspeckle might be involved in the control of IRES-dependent translation. &quot;. Can direct interaction be shown and can this, in turn, be linked to a translational response.</p><p>4. Section entitled &quot;P54nrb interactome in normoxic and in hypoxic cardiomyocytes&quot;. The authors write &quot;The moderate effect of p54nrb or PSPC1 depletion on FGF1 IRES activity suggested that other proteins are involved&quot;. Maybe the moderate effect is due to the poor knockdown achieved with the siRNAs (Figure 3 – Suppl Figure 1; 50% for p54nrb and 25% for PSPC1)? The IP performed with HA-tagged p54nrb pulled down 2013 proteins if I understand this section correctly. Can the authors explain why so many proteins are being pulled down? The supplemental table provided with all the raw data is not reader friendly and the column labeling difficult to interpret for someone like me who is not familiar with seeing data in this format. The identification of some ITAFs in this dataset is taken as evidence that these ITAFs interact with p54nrb in paraspeckles. What independent validation has been undertaken to show that these are associated with p54nrb? How many proteins that are not ITAFs are pulled down by p54nrb and enriched when comparing hypoxic versus normoxic extracts? In Figure 4D and 4E, the identity of all proteins enriched under the conditions shown should be shown in the upper rectangles.</p><p>5. Section entitled &quot;Neat1 is the key activator of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factor mRNA IRESs.&quot; In this section, the authors test the response of other IRESes to knockdown of p54, PSPC1, and Neat1 and depending on the response, stratify the IRESes into different regulons based on IRESome composition. Whereas, the experiments do allow the authors to classify the response of the different IRESes, I don't think it provides insight into IRESome composition since the experiments to not show that any of the three tested molecules directly associate with the IRES under study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There is an issue with timing of the response, the amount of Neat1 induction of the FGF IRES and paraspeckle activity that do not seem to align.

Is the interaction between nucleolin and ribosomal protein Rps2 with p54 direct or indirect? The graphical abstract shows a direct interaction but there is no confirming evidence for this. Also, does this potential interaction only occur under hypoxia?</p><p>10. Figures 1-3 need a protein loading control, perhaps actin.</p><p>11.

However, in new data presented, the authors show that eIF2alpha is phosphorylated upon Neat1_2 KO (Figure 2, Suppl 4) and in their rebuttal write that this could explain the small difference of IRES activity between normoxia and hypoxia generated by the KO. I, therefore, don't understand how the authors conclude on line 232 of the MS that the Neat1 knockdown results suggest &quot;that Neat1 regulates FGF1 mRNA translation, directly or indirectly&quot;.

We tried to generate Neat1 CRISPR-based induction and silencing using lentivectors (with Cas9-VP160 and Cas-9-Krab, respectively, but we were unfortunately not successful). One gRNA was not sufficient, we obtain very low titers of the lentivector and in addition it was impossible in our hands to construct a lentivector coding several guides with the mCas9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Otherwise, the authors need to explain why the cell stress induced by transfection is not relevant here.</p></disp-quote><p>I agree with the reviewer that the stress generated by transient transfection is a limitation of our approach. However the gapmer was the best tool to deplete Neat1, a nuclear ncRNA. As you can see in the Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we constructed lentivectors coding artificial miRNAs against Neat1 to deplete Neat1 in 67NR cells. This was done before the experiments with HL-1. We gave up this approach as it was very difficult to have an efficient knock-down. Gapmer provided better data. The stress due to the gapmer transfection can explain why we have no difference between normoxia and hypoxia, whereas we should have less effect in normoxia. Nevertheless the effect of Neat1 depletion on the activities of all IRESs except for EMCV IRES, remains a very convincing result by showing the role of Neat1 in IRES-dependent translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

It is superior to 24 hr either without treatment, or with gapmer treatment, or with siRNA treatment (control and target-specific). A hypothesis to explain a more important effect on endogenous FGF1 mRNA than bicistronic mRNA translation may be that the IRES of the endogenous FGF1 mRNA is recruited more efficiently to the paraspeckle than the IRES present in the bicistronic mRNA, whose structure may be altered due to the presence of the upstream cistron. However, if one looks at the Western quantification (normalized to total proteins), the difference is not so big: upon Neat1 depletion endogenous FGF1 protein is 34%, while IRES activity is 50% (Figure 2C and 2D). Upon p54 or PSPC1 depletion, endogenous FGF1 is 61% or 82% while IRES activity is 70% or 80%, respectively (Figure 4E and 4F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

General conclusion regarding paraspeckles being sites of IRESome formation appear premature as they are supported by correlative information. It is difficult to conclude direct cause-effect relationships on a quick-response regulatory mechanism such as translation through the use of gene knockdowns. The reason being that it takes several days for appropriate knockdown levels of RNA or protein to be reached – making it difficult to eliminate the possibility that secondary/pleiotropic effects are responsible for, or significantly contributing to, the observed physiological effect.</p><p>I think experiments are required that (i) provide a more direct cause-effect relationship between Neat1 and the proteins claimed to be ITAFs for the FGF1 IRES activity, (ii) validate the idea that paraspeckles are platforms for IRESome formation as this would imply the IRES needs to transit through the paraspeckle to gain full activity, and (iii) validate the MS-IP data where 2013 proteins interacting with p54nrb.</p></disp-quote><p>To validate the idea that the paraspeckle is a platform for IRESome we performed an experiment of smiFISH (see point 5 above). The results show that the bicistronic mRNA containing the IRES is significantly co-localized with Neat1, which indicates its recruitment in the paraspeckle, supporting the hypothesis that paraspeckles are platforms of IRESome formation (Figure 3).</p><p>Also, the interaction of nucleolin with p54<sup>nrb</sup> has been validated by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>A list of proteins present in the paraspeckle complex with p54<sup>nrb</sup> has been reported previously, in addition to the main paraspeckle proteins SFPQ and PSPC1 known to interact with p54 (Both of them are found in our MS-IP) (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and MS data in Supplement file 7). Among 40 paraspeckle proteins listed in previous reports (Naganuma et al., EMBO J, 2012 and Yamamoto et al. 2021), 22 have been found interacting with p54<sup>nrb</sup> in our SM-IP (supplementary file 7). Furthermore, among these 22 proteins, 6 have been described as ITAFs: FUS, hnRNPA1, hnRNPK, hnRNPM, p54<sup>nrb</sup>/NONO, SFPQ/PSF (Godet et al., IJMS 2018). This analysis has been added page 12 and Table 1. In our view it is significant to have found more than half of the main paraspeckle proteins in our MSIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific:</p><p>1. Section entitled: &quot;FGF1 IRES activation during hypoxia correlates with paraspeckle formation and with Neat1 induction.&quot;</p><p>– Measurements from the RLuc/FLuc reporter are made 4, 8, 24 after induction of hypoxia. Please show individual RLuc and FLuc measurements, not the ratios. Is eIF2-α phosphorylated under the experimental conditions? Under hypoxic conditions, are the same isoforms of Neat1 produced to the same ratios? Are new isoforms seen? A Northern blot would provide insight into whether the architecture of this lncRNA changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed the table with LucR and LucF activities of Figure 1 data had been forgotten in the first submission. It is a mistake. The LucR and LucF values are now presented in Figure 1 Supplement 1 and new Supplementary file 1. eIF2a is already phosphorylated after 4 hours of hypoxia (published in our previous paper Hantelys et al., 2019, Figure 2 Supplement 4). Interestingly, LucR activity increases at 4 hr, and decreases only after 24 hr of hypoxia. This suggests an effect of the IRES on translation of the first cistron, as observed previously (Conte et al., PLoS One. 2008 Aug 27;3(8):e3078. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003078.)</p><p>The experiments presented in Figure 1 were done in parallel to that published in 2019.</p><p>Regarding Neat1 isoforms, we can see in Figure 1D that the global Neat1 (two isoforms) induction is different from that of Neat 1-2 isoform. It is impossible to detect Neat1-1 shorter isoform separately by RT PCR as its sequence is contained in that of Neat1_2. The paraspeckle quantification confirms that difference in Figure 1F-K (FISH probing either Neat1 or Neat1_2): Neat1_2 shows a peak at 4 hr of hypoxia (as for RTqPCR), whereas for Neat1 reaches a plateau at 4 hr. This indicates a variation of the isoform ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Last sentence of this paragraph reads &quot;This correlation fits better with Neat1_2 than with the total Neat1, suggesting a link between expression of the long Neat1 isoform and IRES activation.&quot; Can correlation of Neat1 expression and IRES activation be used to imply a link between the two?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a correlation is not a link but this observation incited us to look for a link, as p54 had been identified as an ITAF in our previous paper (Ainaoui et al., PlOS ONE 2015).

Section entitled: &quot;LncRNA Neat1 knock-down drastically affects the FGF1 IRES activity and endogenous FGF1 expression.&quot;</p><p>The authors deplete Neat1 using gap-mers, I could not find how long a treatment was used to achieve the 3-fold knockdown (I'm assuming at least 2 days). The long time period in these experiments likely makes it difficult to conclude that reductions in Neat are directly responsible for the effects on FGF1 IRES activity or FGF1 protein levels. How selective is the reported effect for the FGF1 5' leader? Hence, I think it is premature to conclude that &quot;Neat1 regulates FGF1 expression, and acts as an ITAF of the FGF1 IRES&quot; (last sentence of paragraph) since an ITAF would imply a direct interaction (which is not shown in this MS).</p></disp-quote><p>The times of gapmer treatment (48 hr for Neat 1 and 72 hr for Neat1_2 knock-down) are indicated in the “Cell transfection” section of Material and methods. However it has been added in the figure legends (Figure 2 and Figure 2 supplement 1). It is indeed premature to conclude that Neat1 is an ITAF at this stage. However the definition of ITAF does not mean that there is a direct interaction with the IRES: by example the ncRNA TMRP acts as a negative IRES trans-acting factor by competing for PTB binding and preventing it to bind to the IRES (Godet et al., IJMS 2019, Yang et al., Cell Death Diff 2018). By this way TRMP regulates p27<sup>kip</sup> expression. In our view the IRESome is not limited to the protein directly linked to the mRNA but to a protein (or RNP) complex. Many ncRNAs are considered as regulators of gene expression without binding directly to mRNA or gene promoters: lcnRNAs and circRNAs are sponges for miRNAs and RBPs and by this mechanism they regulate gene expression. In our case Neat1, by participating in forming the IRESome by binding different RBPs present in the paraspeckle, acts as a positive regulator of gene expression. The smiFISH data showing the co-localization of Neat1 with the IRES-containing mRNA (Figure 3). The role of Neat1 in translational control is also supported by its export from the nucleus observed in Figure 1F-K, Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3, and its presence in hypoxic polysomes shown in our previous paper (Hantelys et al., 2019, Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Section entitled &quot;Paraspeckle proteins P54nrb and PSCP1, but not SFPQ, are ITAFs of the FGF1 IRES.&quot; The authors assess three major components of paraspeckles (the SFPQ, p54nrb and PSPC1 proteins) for a potential role in IRES activity. Since knockdowns are used to reduce protein levels and this takes several days to achieve, how can effects on IRES activity or FGF1 protein levels be directly link to the protein activity targeted for knockdown versus a secondary effect arising due to target knockdown? How selective is the reported effect for the FGF1 5' leader? Hence, I think its difficult to conclude that &quot;The ability of three paraspeckle components, Neat1, p54nrb and PSPC1 to regulate the FGF1 IRES activity led us to the hypothesis that the paraspeckle might be involved in the control of IRES-dependent translation. &quot;. Can direct interaction be shown and can this, in turn, be linked to a translational response.</p></disp-quote><p>The direct interaction of at least p54 and SFPQ with Neat1 has been established previously, and the three DBHS proteins (p54, SFPQ and PSPC1) are known to function in heteroduplex (for example see: Yamazaki et al. (2018). Functional Domains of NEAT1 Architectural lncRNA Induce Paraspeckle Assembly through Phase Separation. Molecular cell, 70(6), 1038–1053.e7. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2018.05.019). The interaction of Neat1 with the IRES-containing mRNA has been shown by smi-FISH (Figure 3). At this stage we cannot conclude whether the IRES interacts with Neat1 or with one or several of the paraspeckle proteins, but we can conclude that they are all in the same nuclear body. In a recent paper, it has been established that Neat1 interacts directly with several mRNA targets (Jacq et al., RNA Biol. 2021), thus we cannot exclude the hypothesis of a direct RNA-RNA interaction of the IRES with Neat1.</p><p>The selectivity for FGF1 leader (and other growth factor leaders) is shown in Figure 7: The EMCV IRES is not regulated by either of these paraspeckle components. The set of cellular IRESs assessed are all regulated by Neat1, and selectively by the paraspeckle proteins p54 and PSPC1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Section entitled &quot;P54nrb interactome in normoxic and in hypoxic cardiomyocytes&quot;. The authors write &quot;The moderate effect of p54nrb or PSPC1 depletion on FGF1 IRES activity suggested that other proteins are involved&quot;. Maybe the moderate effect is due to the poor knockdown achieved with the siRNAs (Figure 3 – Suppl Figure 1; 50% for p54nrb and 25% for PSPC1)? The IP performed with HA-tagged p54nrb pulled down 2013 proteins if I understand this section correctly. Can the authors explain why so many proteins are being pulled down? The supplemental table provided with all the raw data is not reader friendly and the column labeling difficult to interpret for someone like me who is not familiar with seeing data in this format. The identification of some ITAFs in this dataset is taken as evidence that these ITAFs interact with p54nrb in paraspeckles. What independent validation has been undertaken to show that these are associated with p54nrb? How many proteins that are not ITAFs are pulled down by p54nrb and enriched when comparing hypoxic versus normoxic extracts? In Figure 4D and 4E, the identity of all proteins enriched under the conditions shown should be shown in the upper rectangles.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the moderate effect is due to the poor knock-down. HL1 are beating cardiomyocytes (see Video1), not efficiently transfected (and for that reason we have transduced them with lentivectors expressing the bicistronic reporter constructs). This has been changed in the text, page 6 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph. It was not expected to pull down so many proteins (Figure 5). This experiment has been done in independent quadruplicates. A possible explanation is that the paraspeckle is a huge RNP: a recent paper showed that 4268 RNAs are targeted to paraspeckle (Jacq et al., RNA Biol 2021). A single paraspeckle contains about 50 molecules of Neat 1-2 (Hirose WIR RNA 2019) binding multiple proteins. Many proteins are components of paraspeckle but the proteins interacting with Neat1 are mainly the core proteins p54 and SFPQ, thus is expected that p54 may form a big complex with many associated proteins. In addition, p54 can form complexes outside the paraspeckle (role in splicing).</p><p>Among 40 paraspeckle proteins listed in previous reports (Naganuma et al., EMBO J, 2012 and Yamamoto et al. 2021), 22 have been found interacting with p54<sup>nrb</sup> in our SM-IP (supplementary file 7).

Section entitled &quot;Neat1 is the key activator of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factor mRNA IRESs.&quot; In this section, the authors test the response of other IRESes to knockdown of p54, PSPC1, and Neat1 and depending on the response, stratify the IRESes into different regulons based on IRESome composition.

In addition, this alignment is also observed in another cell line, the 67NR breast tumor murine cell line (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Data show that this cell line is more resistant to hypoxia: Neat1 is not induced whereas Neat1_2 is strongly induced after 24h of hypoxia. This time, 24 hr, also corresponds to the IRES activation.

The authors silence the long non-coding RNA but their transfection per se causes stress to cell. It seems that a different approach instead of silencing should be used since stress response is the question that needs to be answered. Perhaps a stable cell line or CRISPR KO can be used instead? Otherwise, the authors need to explain why the cell stress induced by transfection is not relevant here.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried several knock-down approaches in HL-1 without success (siRNA, phosphorothiate oligonucleotides, shMir…). The gapmer was the best way to obtain a significant knock-down in these cells. We agree that CRISPR KO would be a nice approach and we also thought about it but it seemed us quite long to develop, as our experiments have already been delayed by the confinement and stock ruptures related to COVID19. We tried however to generate Neat1 CRISPR-based induction and silencing using lentivectors (with Cas9-VP160 and Cas-9-Krab, respectively, but we were unfortunately not successful). One gRNA was not sufficient, we obtain very low titers of the lentivector and in addition it was impossible in our hands to construct a lentivector coding several guides with the mCas9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

These data, in addition to the results provided by fluidigm (Figure 8) and knock-down in 67NR cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) indicate that Neat1_2 is involved in the regulation. However the knock-down of both isoforms (Neat1) has a more important effect on IRES activity, suggesting that both isoforms play a role.

Regarding eIF2a, we performed the experiment (Figure 2—figure supplement 4): eIF2a is phosphorylated upon Neat1_2 gapmer treatment, but not using the control gapmer.

It superior to 24 hr either without treatment, or with gapmer treatment, or with siRNA treatment (control and target-specific). A hypothesis to explain a more important effect on endogenous FGF1 mRNA than bicistronic mRNA translation may be that the IRES of the endogenous FGF1 mRNA is recruited more efficiently to the paraspeckle than the IRES present in the bicistronic mRNA, whose structure may be altered due to the presence of the upstream cistron. However, if one looks at the Western quantification (normalized to total proteins), the difference is not so big: upon Neat1 depletion endogenous FGF1 protein is 34%, while IRES activity is 50% (Figure 2C and 2D). Upon p54 or PSPC1 depletion, endogenous FGF1 is 61% or 82% while IRES activity is 70% or 80%, respectively (Figure 4E and 4F).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>As detailed by referees #1 and 2 there are omissions in the text of the authors' responses listed in the rebuttal letter.

However, in new data presented, the authors show that eIF2alpha is phosphorylated upon Neat1_2 KO (Figure 2, Suppl 4) and in their rebuttal write that this could explain the small difference of IRES activity between normoxia and hypoxia generated by the KO. I, therefore, don't understand how the authors conclude on line 232 of the MS that the Neat1 knockdown results suggest &quot;that Neat1 regulates FGF1 mRNA translation, directly or indirectly&quot;. The same comments holds true for the data regarding changes in the polysomal mRNA context following Neat1 knockdown (Figure 8).

We have deeply analyzed this issue from our data and we can provide a clear answer (added in the text page 5):</p><p>The IRES activity corresponds to the ratio LucF/LucR and provides a value normalized to LucR activity. If we look to the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity alone, reflecting the first cistron expression, we see that the slight increase in eIF2a phosphorylation is not sufficient to block global translation.

It is presented as a hypothesis and not as a conclusion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors do not show a direct association between Neat1 and the ITAFs investigated herein, I would ask that they change or remove Figure 4A which appears to show Neat1 and p54nrb interacting with the FGF1 IRES.</p></disp-quote><p>Done: the IRES-containing mRNA has been removed from the drawing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
