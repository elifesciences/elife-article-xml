development of diabetes complications. Recently, hypoxia has been identified to play an additional pathogenic role in diabetes. In this study, we hypothesized that ROS overproduction was secondary to the impaired responses to hypoxia due to the inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) by hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>The ROS levels were analyzed in the blood of healthy subjects and individuals with type 1 diabetes after exposure to hypoxia. The relation between HIF-1, glucose levels, ROS production and its functional consequences were analyzed in renal mIMCD-3 cells and in kidneys of mouse models of diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Exposure to hypoxia increased circulating ROS in subjects with diabetes, but not in subjects without diabetes. High glucose concentrations repressed HIF-1 both in hypoxic cells and in kidneys of animals with diabetes, through a HIF prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD)-dependent mechanism. The impaired HIF-1 signaling contributed to excess production of mitochondrial ROS through increased mitochondrial respiration that was mediated by Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). The restoration of HIF-1 function attenuated ROS overproduction despite persistent hyperglycemia, and conferred protection against apoptosis and renal injury in diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We conclude that the repression of HIF-1 plays a central role in mitochondrial ROS overproduction in diabetes and is a potential therapeutic target for diabetic complications. These findings are timely since the first PHD inhibitor that can activate HIF-1 has been newly approved for clinical use.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by

contributor to oxidative stress, which is a major cause of diabetic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charlton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giacco and Brownlee, 2010</xref>). In diabetes, excessive production of ROS in mitochondria is caused by an increased proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane. This occurs secondary to elevated electron transport chain flux, mainly at complex I and complex III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishikawa et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia also plays an important role in the development of diabetic complications and is present in both patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi et al., 2011</xref>) and in animal models with diabetes, in all tissues in which complications occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catrina, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catrina and Zheng, 2021</xref>). Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor central in the cellular response to low oxygen tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prabhakar and Semenza, 2015</xref>). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β, both of which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells. Regulation of HIF-1 function is critically dependent on the degradation of the HIF-1α subunit in normoxia. The molecular basis of its degradation is oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of at least one of the two proline residues by specific Fe<sup>2+</sup>-, and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent HIF prolyl hydroxylases (PHD 1–3), among which, PHD2 (encoded by <italic>Egln1</italic> gene) has the main role. Hydroxylated HIF-1α binds to the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor protein, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and targets HIF-1α for proteasomal degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α is stabilized against degradation, translocates to the nucleus, binds to hypoxic responsive elements (HRE) and activates transcription of a series of genes involved in different processes (i.e. angiogenesis, cell proliferation, survival, and cell metabolism). These processes enable the cell to adapt to reduced oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schödel and Ratcliffe, 2019</xref>).</p><p>HIF-1, as the key mediator of adaptation to low oxygen tension, contributes to a balance in redox homeostasis by supressing the excessive mitochondrial production of ROS under chronic hypoxia, thereby minimizing potentially deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Semenza, 2017</xref>). Since HIF-1 stability and function is complexly repressed in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catrina and Zheng, 2021</xref>), we hypothesized that its repression might contribute to increased ROS. We therefore investigated the impact of glucose levels on ROS production during hypoxia in cells, animal models of diabetes and patients with diabetes, and whether the excessive mitochondrial ROS production in diabetes could be normalized by restoring HIF-1 function.</p><p>We found that repressed HIF-1 function secondary to hyperglycemia contributes to an overproduction of mitochondrial ROS with direct pathogenic effects. Consequently, pharmacological or genetic interventions to prevent repression of HIF-1 function normalize mitochondrial production of ROS in diabetes and inhibit the development of nephropathy, in which hypoxia plays an important pathogenic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haase, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key Resources Table is in Appendix 1 - key resources table.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical study</title><p>Thirteen non-smoking patients with type 1 diabetes (28.9 ± 7.2 years old; 53.8% male and 46.2% female; HbA1c: 74.4 ± 11.8 mmol/mol (9.0% ± 1.1 %); BMI: 24.3 ± 4.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 11 healthy, age-matched controls (30.5 ± 8.5 years old; 54.5% male and 45.5% female; HbA1c: 35.6 ± 2.6 mmol/mol (5.4% ± 0.2 %); BMI: 24.3 ± 4.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia for 1 hr, consisting of five hypoxic episodes (13% O<sub>2</sub>, 6 min) that alternated with normoxic episodes (20.9% O<sub>2</sub>, 6 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The subject breathed through a disposable mouthpiece which was connected via an antibacterial filter (Carefusion, Yorba Linda, CA,USA) to a T-tube carrying one-way respiratory valves (Tyco Healthcare, Hamshire, UK). A nose clip assured that respiration occured through the mouth. The air supplied to the subject came from a tube connected to a stopcock (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS, USA) connected to a 60 L Douglas bag (Hans Rudolph) which was continuously filled with hypoxic gas. By turning the stopcock, the air supplied to the subject could be switched from hypoxic to ambient (normoxic) air. The Douglas bag was positioned behind the subject’s bed, so that he/she could not notice when the hypoxic gas or normoxic air was supplied. Blood samples were taken before and immediately after hypoxia exposure. Patients had been diagnosed with diabetes for 10–20 years, showed no signs of peripheral neuropathy and had intact peripheral sensibility when checked with monofilament and vibration tests. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, and carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The sample size has been decided according to the experience from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duennwald et al., 2013</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the nuclear expression of HIF-1α increased after exposure to hypoxia; however, this effect was attenuated under hyperglycemic conditions. Moreover, HRE-driven luciferase reporter assay showed less HIF activity in hypoxia under hyperglycemic conditions compared with normoglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). High glucose concentrations also increased apoptosis of mIMCD3 cells during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

In addition, excessive ROS stimulate several other deleterious biochemical pathways such as activation of protein kinase C, formation of advanced glycation end-products, polyol pathway flux and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishikawa et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we show that in diabetic models, overproduction of ROS from mitochondria is not due to increased electron transport chain flux secondary to hyperglycemia alone. Impairment of HIF-1 signaling is also a critical mechanism, since promoting HIF-1 activity in diabetic models in vitro and in vivo attenuated ROS production, despite the persistence of hyperglycemia, which prevents the development of oxidative stress-induced kidney injury.</p><p>In subjects with diabetes, ROS levels increase after exposure to hypoxia in opposition to control subjects. Acute hypoxia can unmask the impaired HIF-1 signaling that presents in patients with diabetes. However, other ROS sources responsive to acute hypoxia, either from mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hernansanz-Agustín et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waypa et al., 2013</xref>) or from elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weissmann et al., 2000</xref>) cannot be excluded. The concentration of oxygen in tissues ranges from 1% to 10%, which continuously activates HIF-1 signaling machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carreau et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the small decrease in oxygen tension present in patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernardi et al., 2017</xref>), combined with an impaired HIF-1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Catrina et al., 2004</xref>), may contribute to increased ROS levels in tissues associated with diabetic complications.</p><p>Indeed, the direct relationship between hyperglycemia-dependent repression of HIF-1 signaling and excess ROS in hypoxia was demonstrated experimentally both in vitro and in vivo in this study. We found that HIF-1 signaling was inhibited by hyperglycemia in tubular cells during hypoxia and in kidneys from mouse models of diabetes, through a PHD-dependent mechanism, which is in accordance with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bento and Pereira, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catrina, 2014</xref>). This was followed by increased ROS production in mitochondria, when assessed by a specific mitochondrial probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), which was not evident under hyperglycemic conditions when HIF-1 function was promoted with different approaches. The relationship between HIF-1 and ROS is bidirectional, with most evidence showing that mitochondrial ROS has a stabilizing effect on HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunelle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzy et al., 2005</xref>), although the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Several mechanisms in the repressive effects of HIF-1 signaling on mitochondrial ROS production have also been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Our results indicate that the role of HIF-1 on ROS is due to the decreased respiration rate of the mitochondria, since both pharmacological and genetic induction of HIF-1 prevents increased respiration. This effect is at least partially mediated by HIF-1 target gene PDK1, that has been previously shown to inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, leading to reduced flux of lactate through TCA cycle and electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Along with the cellular systems that mitigate the effect of ROS (e.g. Nrf2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>), the increased mitochondrial leak noted in diabetes is a pathway aimed at diminishing ROS production by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Echtay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miwa and Brand, 2003</xref>). However, to produce enough ATP, this is followed by increased flux through the electron transport chain. Although HIF-1 activity normally suppresses electron transport chain, this regulation is diminished in diabetes, resulting in an increased oxygen consumption rate and aggravation of cellular hypoxia that contributes to tissue injury. This was confirmed by increased pimonidazole staining in diabetic kidney in this study, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenberger et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, our results provide evidence for repressed HIF-1 in diabetes as a critical mechanism underlying the vicious cycle between oxidative stress and hypoxia, which is suggested to contribute to kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honda et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, pharmacological or genetic interventions to sustain HIF-1 signaling in diabetes normalized ROS production and had direct consequences on kidney function, despite persistent hyperglycemia. Albuminuria, a typical marker of diabetic nephropathy, was prevented in animal models of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes when HIF-1 signaling was maintained. This is in accordance with the previous reports after exposure to cobalt, which also stabilizes HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ohtomo et al., 2008</xref>). The expression of the proximal tubular damage marker KIM-1, which in diabetic nephropathy becomes positive even before detection of albuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nauta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nordquist et al., 2015</xref>), was not evident when ROS levels were suppressed by promoting HIF signaling in both animal models. This is in agreement with the absence of an increase of KIM-1 in diabetic kidneys where the renal oxygen levels were normalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friederich-Persson et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, apoptosis, another classical marker of ROS damage in diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2003</xref>), was reduced not only in DMOG-treated mIMCD3 cells exposed to high glucose concentrations in hypoxia but also in DMOG-treated <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice and diabetic <italic>Egln1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice. Thus, promoting HIF-1 is a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat even other chronic diabetes complications since excessive production of mitochondrial ROS is a key common driver of diabetic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charlton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giacco and Brownlee, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the PHD-dependent HIF-1 repression induced by high glucose concentrations contributes to excessive production of mitochondrial ROS in diabetes, which is mediated by increased mitochondrial respiration secondary to the inhibition of HIF-1 target gene PDK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Promoting HIF-1 function is sufficient to normalize ROS levels during hyperglycemia and protects against diabetic nephropathy, making HIF-1 signaling an attractive therapeutic option for diabetes complications. This is a timely finding, given that the first PHD inhibitor that can activate HIF-1 has been recently approved for clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Repression of HIF-1 contributes to increased mitochondrial ROS production in diabetes.</title><p>Under non-diabetic conditions (left panel), HIF-1 is induced by hypoxia and activates PDK1 expression which inhibits excess mitochondrial ROS production through inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. However, under diabetic conditions (right panel), HIF-1 is inhibited by high glucose levels through a PHD-dependent mechanism despite hypoxia. This results in decreased expression of PDK1, leading to increased mitochondrial respiration and excessive mitochondrial ROS production which causes tissue damage.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70714-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The clinical study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden, and carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ernestina Schipani as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have listed numerous strengths. Weaknesses were also identified. Please, address concerns and comments point-by-point.</p><p>Of note, additional experiments are less important than modifications to current data and text. Reanalysis and modifying text are essential to support the claims of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, Zheng and colleagues report the novel findings that in diabetic models hyperglycemia suppress HIF1a in a PHD-dependent manner, and this in turn leads to increased mitochondrial ROS and cell death. Both the increased ROS and the cell death are prevented by increasing HIF1a activity either pharmacologically or genetically.</p><p>The paper is novel, informative, and with interesting translational implications. The authors used a variety of in vitro and in vivo models for the testing of their hypothesis, with special emphasis on a model of diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>However, a few issues need to be addressed in order to strengthen the authors' conclusions and their biological significance.</p><p>1. Suppressing HIF1a should also increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption and, thus, intracellular hypoxia. Along those lines, it would be helpful if the authors could show the pimonidazole data per se, in addition to the ratio HIF1a/pimonidazole. Increasing intracellular hypoxia could be an alternative mechanism that may promote cell death upon HIF1a suppression.</p><p>2. The authors do not provide unequivocal evidence that the increased mitochondrial ROS are responsible for the cell death upon exposure to hyperglycemia. Along those lines, use of reducing agents such as NAC could be helpful and informative.</p><p>3. Is the cell death documented by the authors caspase-3 dependent?</p><p>4. All western blot data should be properly quantified.</p><p>5. In the various genetic models, inactivation or increased expression of the gene of interest should be properly documented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Zheng et al. addresses the question of whether abnormal HIF stabilisation in response to hypoxia could be responsible for the increased ROS generation in diabetes, and whether hyperglycaemia could be the driver for the ROS damage and cell death in hypoxia. Diabetes complications across multiple organs are associated with oxidative damage and are accompanied by restricted oxygen delivery due to vascular dysfunction. Thus, understanding how these two phenotypes are linked by diabetes is an important question for advancing our understanding of diabetes complications and to identify novel therapeutic targets.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This study uses multiple different techniques to address this question, using cell culture, animal models as well as human samples.</p><p>Mechanistic conclusions are based on both genetic and pharmacological approaches, adding strength to the key findings.</p><p>This is an excellent continuation of high-quality work conducted by this group in this field. The conclusions have far reaching consequences within the field.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Although the authors establish a translational pipeline for their findings, from cells to animals to humans, the findings from the human studies could be interpreted in alternative ways to that presented. Cells cultured for 24hrs in hypoxia have sufficient time to activate the HIF transcription factor, its downstream targets and result in a functional outcome for the cell. Humans exposed to hypoxia for 1 hr will not have the same time to induce the HIF-dependent effects, and other mechanisms will be at play. To some extent this is due to the difficulties of performing mechanistic studies in humans, however, care should be taken in not oversimplifying findings and instead highlighting alternative conclusions.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species are a group of molecules comprising different species with different reactivities. It is important to be clear which aspects of ROS and their downstream damage are being measured with these methodologies.</p><p>Care must be taken to ensure the correct statistical analysis is performed based on the groups assessed, the study design and the scientific question being asked.</p><p>My major concern relates to the conclusions drawn from the human studies and their direct relevance to the cell/animal work.</p><p>1. Results – human study. This is a really interesting and important finding that the diabetic patients have greater ROS generation in response to hypoxia. However, this is an acute hypoxic response and will not be related to any HIF-related changes in mitochondrial function that form the core of the rest of the paper. These are two independent mechanisms/phenomena. I think this has to be addressed at some point in the paper, that the findings in patients cannot be explained by the mechanism presented in the rest of the manuscript, and are more likely due to other acute hypoxic factors. For example, in the discussion the authors state 'An optimal HIF-1 response during hypoxia, as seen in the control subjects in our study&quot; – this is false – 1 hr is not sufficient to induce a HIF response that has a functional outcome that could have been measured in the blood of the patients.</p><p>2. Abstract – nonspecific terminology needs correcting to make the abstract specific to the findings. Terms such as &quot;the dynamics of ROS levels&quot; and &quot;was followed by functional consequences&quot; don't really tell the reader what was found in the paper. Also, please don't use the term &quot;findings are highly significant&quot; as this could relate to statistics.</p><p>3. Introduction – paragraph 1 – The final sentence about ROS generation being related to increased glucose availability is not relevant to all tissues – in heart for example there is decreased intracellular glucose availability. Please correct to make this broad statement more tissue specific.</p><p>4. Methods – Evaluation of ROS levels in kidney. 4HNE does not detect ROS – it measures oxidative damage as evident by lipid peroxidation. It is incorrect in the methods and results to describe this as ROS levels.</p><p>5. Methods – Clinical study – please describe how the patients were given 5 hypoxic episodes – methodological detail is lacking.</p><p>6. Statistics – I am confused about some of the choices for statistical analysis. In figure 1 why was an unpaired t-test used when the same patient has been tested at 0 and 4 hrs, this should be a paired t-test. Figure 2 – I'm unclear why a repeated measures ANOVA was used, when these were independent groups of cells, not the same cells measured at different points/conditions (this shouldn't be repeated measures). Figures 4 and 5 – when there are groups with 2 factors varying – genotype (wt vs PHD) and diabetic status (Ctl and db) – this should be a 2-way ANOVA not a one-way ANOVA.</p><p>7. Figure 3 – panels B and C – could the authors show HIF blots for these same groups, to compliment the mitosox intensity, so its possible to relate ROS to the degree of HIF stabilisation in these genetic cell models.</p><p>8. Figure 4 – could the authors please comment on why respiration in the PHD2 mutant isn't below the WT? One would expect the HIF stabilisation in this model to decrease oxygen consumption.</p><p>9. Discussion – 3rd paragraph. The authors have made incorrect conclusions regarding their respiration data. They state that &quot;our results indicate that the role of HIF on ROS is limited to complex I&quot;. What the data shows is that when respiring through the ETC that involves all of complexes I, II, III, and IV – with substrate feeding in at the start and oxygen consumed at the end – that there is a HIF dependent effect. They cannot conclude it is at complex I as they haven't independently assessed complex II (independent of complex I), complex III and separately complex IV (which would need to be done with succinate alone, DHQ and TMPD as 3 separate experiments). The data shows the HIF effect resides at some point between Complex I and Complex IV.</p><p>10. Table 3 – blood glucose before STZ – is this significantly different?</p><p>11. Page 9 – PDK1 only inhibits flux through the TCA is exclusively metabolising glucose – not the case if metabolising amino acids or fatty acids.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. Oxidative stress and damage is central to pathology of diabetic complications. As mitochondria are a key generator of ROS-mediated damage, the authors nicely connect glucose-dependent HIF1a deficiency with the development of mitochondrial ROS-mediated damage.</p><p>2. Approaches to understand and target oxidant stress in diabetic complications are elusive and the authors nicely delineate a PHD2-dependent mechanism by which HIF1a levels decline, subsequently giving rise to renal dysfunction.</p><p>3. Notably, improvement of HIF1a levels by PHD2 pharmacologic or genetic inhibition appears to ameliorate renal injury independent of glycemic control. This could be of high translational value as therapies to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy do not exist currently in the clinic.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The mechanism by which hyperglycemia precipitates PHD2-dependent HIF1a degradation and activation of renal injury is not clear.</p><p>2. The induction of mitochondrial damage to elicit mitochondrial ROS and subsequent renal compromise downstream of HIF1a deficiency is proposed to be via PDK1. It would strengthen the paper if the PDK1-dependent mechanism was further solidified.</p><p>3. Clinical data on patients with uncontrolled T1D and impaired circulating hypoxia responses are very interesting, but it is unclear how they directly relate to the renal specific findings presented in the remainder of the manuscript.</p><p>The study presented by Zheng and colleagues is well written and serves to highlight the important role of ROS in the development of diabetic kidney disease. The studies are interesting, well written, and nicely performed. Further, the translational implications of PHD2 inhibition to potentially ameliorate diabetic nephropathy are highly appealing. However, a central concern is that some of the major observations of this study, while interesting, appear to be consistent with other previous observations in the field. Indeed, several groups have observed a depletion of HIF1a leads to renal demise. Further, PHD2 genetic and pharmacologic inhibition have been shown by several groups to protect against renal injury. Finally, the importance of mitochondrial ROS in diabetic kidney disease is also well known. While this study nicely weaves the concept together, a concern is the results are mostly confirmatory in nature.</p><p>Thus, several approaches could be employed to enhance the novelty of the observations within the manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors note that glucose reduces HIF1a levels through a PHD2 dependent mechanism, yet in Figure 4 supplement 2, PHD2 levels do not rise in db/db mice. It would substantially improve the manuscript if the mechanisms underlying increased PHD2 activity/HIF1a degradation were reconciled. Is enzymatic activity enhanced? Is it possible that VHL targets HIF1a for degradation more rapidly? Garcia-Pastor et al. (Sci Reports 2019) previously published that glucose inhibits the interaction of HIF1a with Hsp90 in cell lines. Does this occur in primary cells as well?</p><p>2. The authors implicate loss of PDK1 activity downstream of HIF1a deficiency as a key mechanism underlying the increase in complex I activity and subsequent mitochondrial ROS. However, reductions in PDK1 gene expression are modest at best. This mechanism, while based upon a highly interesting study from Kim and colleagues in Cell Metabolism, is not well substantiated in the author's study. More conclusive experimentation reconciling this pathway's importance is crucial for the development of the mechanism underlying the authors' model.</p><p>3. Increases in mitochondrial ROS in diabetic nephropathy have also been thought to be related to effects on the Nrf2 anti-oxidant response, which is not discussed in this study. It would be helpful to address the potential roles of Nrf2 in the pro-oxidant responses surveyed in their mouse and cell based models.</p><p>4. Clinical data on T1D patients, while interesting, is of unclear utility in this manuscript. Do these patients have renal disease? While HbA1c levels are higher in T1D patients versus non-T1D patients, are ROS responses improved in T1D patients with normal glycemic control? Further, as ROS levels are often transient in the blood stream, what are the ambient blood glucose levels during the period of the EPR assays?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70714.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Zheng and colleagues report the novel findings that in diabetic models hyperglycemia suppress HIF1a in a PHD-dependent manner, and this in turn leads to increased mitochondrial ROS and cell death. Both the increased ROS and the cell death are prevented by increasing HIF1a activity either pharmacologically or genetically.</p><p>The paper is novel, informative, and with interesting translational implications. The authors used a variety of in vitro and in vivo models for the testing of their hypothesis, with special emphasis on a model of diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>However, a few issues need to be addressed in order to strengthen the authors' conclusions and their biological significance.</p><p>1. Suppressing HIF1a should also increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption and, thus, intracellular hypoxia. Along those lines, it would be helpful if the authors could show the pimonidazole data per se, in addition to the ratio HIF1a/pimonidazole. Increasing intracellular hypoxia could be an alternative mechanism that may promote cell death upon HIF1a suppression.</p></disp-quote><p>The levels of hypoxia evaluated by pimonidazole staining were added as Figure 4-supplement figure 1. It is true that the levels of intracellular hypoxia were increased in diabetic kidneys compared with the animals without diabetes that confirms previous observations (Rosenberger, Khamaisi et al. 2008, PMID: 17914354) and were improved by HIF induction in both animal models. Their potential contribution to tissue injury was added in Discussion (the first paragraph of page 26).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors do not provide unequivocal evidence that the increased mitochondrial ROS are responsible for the cell death upon exposure to hyperglycemia. Along those lines, use of reducing agents such as NAC could be helpful and informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank to the reviewer for the constructive suggestion. Since we have found that the cell death induced by high glucose levels in hypoxia is dependent on caspase-3/7 (next question), we have verified the effect of NAC on the caspase-3/7 activity in mIMCD3 cells. As shown in Figure 2G, the caspase-3/7 activity increased in mIMCD3 cells exposed to high glucose concentrations and hypoxia, and was inhibited by NAC pre-treatment. These results indicate that the increased mitochondrial ROS is responsible for cell apoptosis upon exposure to hyperglycemia and hypoxia. This result has been added to the manuscript as Figure 2G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As shown in Figure 2F, high glucose levels in hypoxia enhanced caspase 3/7 activity in mIMCD3 cells, which could be inhibited by DMOG treatment. These results suggest that the apoptosis induced by high glucose levels in hypoxia is dependent on caspase-3 and -7 and are added to the manuscript as Figure 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
