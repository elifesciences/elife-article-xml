In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of the widely used fluoroquinolones are known to induce the SOS response. Interestingly, the expression of several PMQR <italic>qnr</italic> genes is controlled by the SOS master regulator, LexA. During the characterization of a small <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid carried in <italic>E. coli,</italic> we observed that the aminoglycosides become able to induce the SOS response in this species, thus leading to the elevated transcription of <italic>qnrD</italic>. Our findings show that the induction of the SOS response is due to nitric oxide (NO) accumulation in the presence of sub-MIC of aminoglycosides. We demonstrated that the NO accumulation is driven by two plasmid genes, ORF3 and ORF4, whose products act at two levels. ORF3 encodes a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide (<italic>FAD</italic>)-binding oxidoreductase which helps NO synthesis, while ORF4 codes for a putative fumarate and nitrate reductase (<italic>FNR</italic>)-type transcription factor, related to an O<sub>2</sub>-responsive regulator of <italic>hmp</italic> expression, able to repress the Hmp-mediated NO detoxification pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Thus, this discovery, that other major classes of antibiotics may induce the SOS response could have worthwhile implications for antibiotic stewardship efforts in preventing the emergence of resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SOS</kwd><kwd>Escherichia coli</kwd><kwd>qnr</kwd><kwd>aminoglycosides</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Université de Reims Champagne-Ardenne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babosan</surname><given-names>Anamaria</given-names></name><name><surname>de Champs</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Guillard</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002334</institution-id><institution>Conseil Régional de Champagne-Ardenne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babosan</surname><given-names>Anamaria</given-names></name><name><surname>de Champs</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name><name><surname>Guillard</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Association pour le Developpement de la Microbiologie et de l'Immunologie Rémoises</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babosan</surname><given-names>Anamaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000157</institution-id><institution>International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babosan</surname><given-names>Anamaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62- IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mazel</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baharoglu</surname><given-names>Zeynep</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazel</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baharoglu</surname><given-names>Zeynep</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazel</surname><given-names>Didier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mechanism whereby aminoglycosides-mediated SOS induction in Escherichia coli also promote high-level fluoroquinolone resistance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is a well-known commensal of the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tenaillon et al., 2010</xref>), but several strains can also cause enteric and extra-enteric diseases such as urinary tract infection or sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaper et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> is in the fluoroquinolone’s spectrum of action, and these antibiotics are widely used to treat such infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lode, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rice, 2012</xref>). Historically, fluoroquinolone resistance was found to develop solely through chromosome-mediated mechanisms, but plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes are now being identified more and more frequently in clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strahilevitz et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>qnr</italic> genes are important PMQR determinants, with six families described so far (<italic>qnrA</italic>, <italic>qnrB</italic>, <italic>qnrC</italic>, <italic>qnrD</italic>, <italic>qnrS</italic>, and <italic>qnrVC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruiz, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Among these <italic>qnr</italic> genes, <italic>qnrD</italic> was first described in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> isolates located on a 4270-bp long non-conjugative plasmid (p2007057), a very different context from that of the other <italic>qnr</italic> genes in terms of plasmid size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cavaco et al., 2009</xref>). Soon after, we reported for the first time the presence of smaller <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmids (∼2.7 kb, with pDIJ09-518a as the archetype) in several bacteria belonging to <italic>Morganellaceae</italic> and proposed, what is now considered as the likely scenario, that the origin of <italic>qnrD</italic> lies within an as-yet-unidentified progenitor from this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guillard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruiz, 2019</xref>). pDIJ09-518a is a 2683-bp long plasmid-harbouring four open reading frames (ORFs), including <italic>qnrD</italic>, and exhibits only 53% identity with the plasmid found in <italic>S. enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guillard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). No function has yet been found for ORF2, ORF3, or ORF4. <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmids can be roughly divided into two categories: the pDIJ09-518a-like plasmids and the p2007047-like plasmids. The ORF3 and ORF4 can only be found in the pDIJ09-518a-like plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To date, among the 53 fully sequenced <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmids, ∼81% are reported to be pDIJ09-518a-like plasmids and ∼19% to be p2007057-like plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>qnrD</italic> genes are carried by small plasmids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The two <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid archetypes: p2007057 and pDIJ09-518a.

Oxidative stress and sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of certain antibiotics can cause DNA damage, triggering the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baharoglu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baharoglu and Mazel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kohanski et al., 2010</xref>). Once triggered, the SOS response favours bacterial survival in numerous ecological settings, including the likely emergence of antibiotic-resistant isolates in patients, when sub-MIC antibiotic concentrations occur at the infection site, through the transient increase of mutation rate accompanying the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matic, 2019</xref>). Fluoroquinolones are known to induce the SOS response in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baharoglu and Mazel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Recacha et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, aminoglycosides are able to induce the SOS response in bacteria such as <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> but not in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is better equipped to tackle oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baharoglu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baharoglu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baharoglu and Mazel, 2011</xref>). Two main mechanisms have been reported to explain why aminoglycoside-mediated oxidative stress in <italic>E. coli</italic> does not lead to SOS induction, and include: (1) the production of the general stress response sigma factor RpoS, which induces DNA polymerase IV, and (2) increased activity of the GO-repair system, which removes the mutagenic oxidized guanine (GO lesion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Michaels and Miller, 1992</xref>), along with the base excision repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baharoglu et al., 2013</xref>). Nitric oxide (NO), which can be converted to other reactive nitrogen species, can also cause DNA damage, inducing also the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lobysheva et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakano et al., 2005a</xref>). But, <italic>E. coli</italic> possesses the well-characterized Hmp flavohaemoprotein that detoxifies NO either by producing nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) under aerobic conditions, or by a O<sub>2</sub> autoreduction to nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cruz-Ramos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stevanin et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that in <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying pDIJ09-518a-like plasmids the SOS response can nonetheless be triggered by sub-MIC levels of aminoglycosides through NO accumulation. The latter is all at once due to higher NO formation and to the repression of the Hmp-mediated detoxification pathway driven by proteins encoded by this small <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>qnrD</italic> expression is SOS regulated and triggered by aminoglycosides</title><p>Transcription of the <italic>qnrB and qnrD</italic> genes has been shown to be controlled by the LexA-mediated SOS response. LexA represses the SOS regulon genes by binding to its cognate LexA-box or SOS-box sequence on the promoter. Thus, the LexA proteolysis leads to de-repression of this regulon, comprised of about 40 genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courcelle et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Unlike <italic>qnrB</italic>, the regulation of the most recently characterized PMQR gene, <italic>qnrD,</italic> by the SOS response has only been partially described, given that LexA dependence has not yet been evidenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briales et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Da Re et al., 2009</xref>).

Using <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1656/pDIJ09-518a grown in lysogeny broth (LB, MG1656 henceforth referred to as <italic>E. coli</italic> in the text and WT in the figures), we found a 2.18- and 2.02-fold increase in <italic>qnrD</italic> expression induced by mitomycin C and ciprofloxacin, respectively.

In this study, however, we identified and characterized for the first time that the SOS response is induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying a <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid upon exposure to aminoglycosides at a very low concentration (1% of MIC). This unexpected aminoglycoside-induced SOS response turns to be subsequent to NO accumulation in combination with aminoglycosides that eventually increase 8-oxo-G incorporation into DNA. Thereby, DNA damage appears through DSBs leading to induction to the SOS.</p><p>We found that two ORFs of the <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid, ORF3 and ORF4, were responsible for this SOS response induction by aminoglycosides in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Indeed, ORF3, which encodes a putative FAD-binding oxidoreductase, leads to NO production while ORF4, which encodes a putative CRP/FNR-like protein, inhibits <italic>hmp</italic> expression and thereby hampers the detoxification of NO. Although we did not evidence directly the 8-oxo-G incorporation hampering us to identify which targets aminoglycosides interact with, it has been previously reported that aminoglycosides and nitrosative stress caused oxidation of guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spek et al., 2001</xref>). Taking this into account, we propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) of the pathway by which aminoglycosides induce the SOS response in <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying the <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid. In the absence of aminoglycosides, <italic>E. coli</italic> can repair the DNA damage resulting from the carriage of the <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid, and the SOS response is not induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In this case, the GO-repair system sanitizes efficiently the 8-oxo-G produced by the <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid-mediated NO accumulation. However, in the presence of aminoglycoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the level of oxidized guanine may increase. The resultant DNA damage yields genotoxic concentrations of alternate nucleotides that the GO-repair system can no longer sanitize efficiently, leading to induction of the SOS response. It is noteworthy that the burden caused by this <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid in <italic>E. coli</italic> upon exposure to tobramycin was not observed for <italic>Providencia</italic> spp. since no SOS induction was observed. We speculate that such a plasmid is harmless for <italic>Providencia</italic> spp. when exposed to aminoglycosides. Thereby, it could be one of the reasons why <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmids may rarely be found in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of SOS response induction by aminoglycosides in <italic>E. coli</italic> bearing the small <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid.</title><p>Schematic representation of the network leading to SOS induction in <italic>E. coli</italic>/pDIJ09-518a when not (<bold>A</bold>) or exposed (<bold>B</bold>) to sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of aminoglycosides.

This is a worrying issue, since we observed that the <italic>qnrD</italic>-plasmid is mobilizable (data not shown) and stable without antibiotic selective pressure. Selective pressures maintained by the overuse of antibiotics are the main drivers of resistance. In addition, sub-MICs of antibiotics can select for resistant bacteria and this occurs notably with fluoroquinolones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2017</xref>). In this regard, expression of Qnr proteins and other PMQR normally confers only low levels of resistance to fluoroquinolones, but they were shown to significantly reduce the bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guillard et al., 2013</xref>) and to further facilitate selection for higher levels of resistance in Qnr-producing enterobacterial isolates exposed to fluoroquinolones, which can culminate in therapeutic failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guillard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez-Martínez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robicsek et al., 2006</xref>).

Six biological replicates were prepared, if not specify otherwise in the legends. One percent of the MICs of indicated antibiotics was then been added to the culture for 30 min to allow for induction of the SOS response. One culture was kept as an antibiotic-free control. Five hundred microliters of exponentially growing cells were stabilized in 1 ml of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen). After treatment of the culture pellet with lysozyme (Qiagen), subsequent RNA extractions were performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The genomic DNA contaminating the samples was removed with TURBO DNA-free Kit (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientifics) at 37°C, for 30 min. First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR were performed with KAPA SYBR FAST (CliniSciences, Nanterre, France) on the LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) using the primers indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Xian-Zhi Li (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Main Concerns:</p><p>1. The major weakness of the work is that it does not assess whether the SOS induction by AGs leads to increased mutagenesis as speculated.</p><p>2. The qnrD plasmid containing ORFs 3 and 4 is not commonly found in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Table S3 and Figure S1). It is adequate that most of the work has been performed in this genetically tractable organism. Nevertheless, it would be important to assess whether the same AG-mediated SOS induction occurs in bacteria that usually carry this type of plasmid (P. mirabilis or other Morganellaceae). This is a simple qRT PCR experiment which could add a lot to the significance of the paper. Perhaps the nitrosative stress (which is obviously a deleterious effect) is particular to <italic>E. coli</italic> and that could be one of the reasons why this particular plasmid architecture occur rarely (or never?) in this species.</p><p>3. There is no direct evidence provided for increase in 8-oxo-G incorporation. Thus, discussion should carefully be worded (Line 425). Indeed, the target(s) (molecules) with which aminoglycoside interact with as inducers remain unknown, although the aminoglycoside effect is dependent on the GO repair system and indirectly results in DNA damage (Figure 3). It is difficult to extend this to the description that aminoglycosides and others form 8-oxo-G (in L280-282). If any, the aminoglycoside effect is indirect. Clarity is needed.</p><p>4. Further to the above, the qnrD expression was induced by aminoglycosides (L130). However, it remains unknown whether the elevated 2.8-fold increase in qnrD expression in the presence of tobramycin could produce an impact on fluoroquinolone resistance phenotype. First, an aminoglycoside at 1% MIC is expected to exhibit no antibacterial activity. Thus, a simple fluoroquinolone MIC testing can be done in the presence and the absence of very low levels of aminoglycosides that induce SOS response. A reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility would argue in favor of author-suggested significance of SOS induction findings.</p><p>5. As indicated by authors (L414-415), the functional roles of ORF3 and ORF4 via biochemical studies were not directly measured. Instead, sfiA expression and fluorescence indicators were assessed. This represents a weakness of the study. Can the authors address this?</p><p>6. How do the experiments in figure S2 address plasmid stability during growth by measuring OD? Plasmid stability in the experimental conditions is an important issue.</p><p>7. Comparing Figures 3B and 1E, it can be observed that deletion of both recF and recB have significant effects on SOS induction by AG in cells carrying the qnrD plasmid. These results are very important for the model and a qRT measurement of sulA in recF and recB mutants would be an important confirmation for the results obtained with plasmid based assays, which could be influenced by the reporter plasmid copy number and stability in the different genotypes analyzed.</p><p>8. The complementation of ORF 3 and 4 mutants (Figures 4A and 4C) is incomplete, the same SOS induction level as observed in the wt is never reached. Could this be due to the deletion of one ORF influencing on the expression of the other? Additionally, a more appropriate comparison with cells carrying the empty expression vector may help to solve this issue.</p><p>9. In contrast with the detailed analysis described in the initial sections, the information provided on the products of ORF3 and ORF4 is scanty. This is unfortunate as these products and their activities are the main findings of the story. Hence, more detailed characterization of these putative proteins seems advisable to support the authors's model. Bioinformatic analysis should be shown in more detail, the existence of the predicted proteins should be proven and the putative DNA binding activity of the ORF4 product should be shown. Otherwise, the possibility of indirect effect will remain open.</p><p>Other Comments that should be addressed:</p><p>1. The study introduces two groups of qnrD plasmids (L77). Do the authors have information about their copy numbers? For example, what is the copy number of pDIJ09-518a? This information will assist in understanding the basal expression of qnrD and the other genes in the absence of an inducer, and thus the significance of aminoglycoside induction of SOS response.</p><p>2. BLAST was carried out to find homologs of ORF3 and ORF4 (L366-373). Please include gene/product access information for an Erythrobacter spp protein and an O2-responsive regulator from Pedobacter panaciterrae. Are there any reference(s) to support these proteins that are used for comparison?</p><p>3. L326. In the absence of RecB, the SOS response was somehow (1.4-fold change; but seems statistically significant [Figure 3B]) observed in the presence of tobramycin, suggesting the possible presence of a RecF-independent SOS response pathway. For comparison, the control for both recF and recB, the ratios are quite below 1, Hence, the actual changes are larger. Suggest additional discussion. (Additionally, &quot;LB&quot; is indicated in text while Figure 3B shows &quot;MH&quot; – please clarify.)</p><p>4. L65. Among 53 fully sequenced qnrD plasmids, do they share the same orf3 and orf4 reported in this manuscript? In other word, how often are these ORFs observed in qnrD plasmids?</p><p>5. L221. Is the description &quot;However, the underlying mechanism explaining these findings has yet to be identified&quot; simply due to QnrD protection of ciprofloxacin target?</p><p>6. L402-403. The description &quot;We found that ORF4 did not alleviate the SOS response after exposure to aminoglycoside sub-MICs as measured by sfiA expression (Figure 4C)&quot; is not reflective of Figure 4C because orf3 deletion reduced sifA expression (statistically significant per Figure 4C legend). Please verify. As well, obviously, the complementation with pORF4 did not work in Figure 4C.</p><p>7. L431. The proposed Model (should be Figure 5, not Figure 4) is considered to reflect the findings. However, the wording should be careful. For example, in L436, the description &quot;the level of oxidized guanine increases&quot; may be revised as &quot;the level of oxidized guanine may increase&quot; as no measurement for 8-oxo-G was done in this study.</p><p>8.

Please revise the statement that you proved functionality of the SOS box in the qnr locus of the plasmid family under study. You did so in the archetypal plasmid pDIJ109-518a.

Figure S1 and introduction. Are ORFs 3 and 4 from the &quot;small&quot; qnr plasmids studied in this work also present in the &quot;large&quot; qnr plasmid? This is not clear from the text or Figure S1. As an alternative, Table S3 could indicate if ORFs 3 and 4 homologues are present in each of the qnrD plasmids.</p><p>3. This is a matter of choice, but sulA is a more widely use gene name than sfiA, and should be used throughout the text. sfiA is the original name, but modern gene annotations in bacterial genomes use sulA.</p><p>4.

Lines 402-403: &quot;We found that ORF4 did not alleviate the SOS response after exposure to aminoglycoside sub-MICs, as measured by sfiA expression&quot;. In my view the SOS response is attenuated, although not completely, after ORF4 deletion. Maybe a more precise statement would be: &quot;We found that ORF4 deletion does not completely abolish SOS induction by aminoglycoside sub-MICs, as measured by sfiA expression&quot;.</p><p>7. There is an unnecessary repetition of results in Figures 4A, 4C and 4E (wt, wt/pDIJ09). All these results could be merged into a single graph.</p><p>8. Data from Figure 4B and the model depicted in Figure 5 implicate that ORF4 can act on its own (independently from ORF3 or stressors) as a negative regulator of hmp, contributing to nitrosative stress. Nevertheless, if this was the case, I would expect the following in qRT-PCR experiments shown in Figure 4D:</p><p>Wt/pDIJ09 – lower hmp levels than cells without plasmid, due to (ORF4) action.</p><p>Wt/pDIJ09 del ORF4 – same hmp levels as cells without plasmid. No negative regulator present in spite of the rest of plasmid.</p><p>Wt/pDIJ09 del ORF4/pORF4 – lower hmp levels than cells without plasmid, due to in trans negative regulator (ORF4) action.</p><p>Can the authors perhaps add some comment? Is it possible that there is another interpretation for these data?</p><p>9. Lines 622-623 mention a mutation rate analysis, but such experiments are not shown in the paper.</p><p>10. Viability after tobramycin treatment (lines 601-606): It is not clear for how long cells were exposed to the antimicrobial.</p><p>11. Material and Methods or Figure legends should be more clear regarding the concentration of antimicrobials used in each experiment. For example, when comparing <italic>E. coli</italic> cells carrying or not the qnrD plasmid, each strain was treated with different sub-MIC concentrations of cipro to account for their different resistance levels? In Materials and methods (lines 479-481), 1% of the MIC of Cipro (0.06 µg/mL) is indicated as the sub-MIC concentration used. However, Table S1 indicates a MIC of 0.004 µg/mL for the wt strain, and 0.094 µg/mL for the strain carrying the qnr plasmid. This information is confusing and should be revised.</p><p>12. Were experiments measuring SOS induction with the GFP reporter performed in LB or MH medium? Material and Methods (lines 559-561) is contradictory on this regard. Figure legends indicate LB, but the Y axis of figures 1E and 3B show MH.</p><p>13. Line 588 mention levofloxacin and ofloxacin, but these antimicrobials were not used in this work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors use the term &quot;aminoglycosides&quot; in multiple sections of the manuscript, including the title, the abstract and the discussion. However, only one aminoglycoside (tobramycin) has been used throughout the study. Gentamicin was used at the beginning of the study but disappears at some point.

There is no reference for the pTOPO vector used for complementation. Does it carry kanamycin or another aminoglycoside resistance?

As a consequence, a crucial point in the story (the mechanism that triggers NO accumulation) remains enigmatic. Despite this shortage, I agree with the authors that qnr-mediated induction of the SOS response by aminoglycosides is an interesting phenomenon. My only suggestion at this point is to modify the text wherever pertinent (e. g., lines 47-49 and 388-396) to make it clear that the identities of the ORF3 and ORF4 products are putative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69511.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The major weakness of the work is that it does not assess whether the SOS induction by AGs leads to increased mutagenesis as speculated.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we added the results of the spontaneous mutation ratio we obtained upon pre-treatment with sub-MIC of tobramycin.

The qnrD plasmid containing ORFs 3 and 4 is not commonly found in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Table S3 and Figure S1). It is adequate that most of the work has been performed in this genetically tractable organism. Nevertheless, it would be important to assess whether the same AG-mediated SOS induction occurs in bacteria that usually carry this type of plasmid (P. mirabilis or other Morganellaceae). This is a simple qRT PCR experiment which could add a lot to the significance of the paper. Perhaps the nitrosative stress (which is obviously a deleterious effect) is particular to E. coli and that could be one of the reasons why this particular plasmid architecture occur rarely (or never?) in this species.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that such a strategy is important for the significance of the paper. The experiments of qRT-PCR quantifying the <italic>sulA</italic> expression level in <italic>Providencia rettgeri</italic> carrying the pDIJ09-518a were performed. They have been included in the revised manuscript (lines 188-191) and shown in the figure S3. Our results showed that the SOS response induction is not increased in <italic>P. rettgeri</italic>/pDIJ09-518a upon sub-MIC of tobramycin, but induced in mitomycin. This confirm that the SOS response is functional in this strain and that AG-mediated SOS induction is specific for <italic>E. coli.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is no direct evidence provided for increase in 8-oxo-G incorporation. Thus, discussion should carefully be worded (Line 425). Indeed, the target(s) (molecules) with which aminoglycoside interact with as inducers remain unknown, although the aminoglycoside effect is dependent on the GO repair system and indirectly results in DNA damage (Figure 3). It is difficult to extend this to the description that aminoglycosides and others form 8-oxo-G (in L280-282). If any, the aminoglycoside effect is indirect. Clarity is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not evidence the increase of 8-oxo-G incorporation. As suggested we reworded the discussion (524-528) by stating that although we did not identify which target(s) aminoglycosides interact with, guanine oxidation upon aminoglycosides and nitrosative stress exposure has been reported in the literature (doi: 10.1128/jb.183.1.131-138.2001 and doi: 10.1126/science.1219192), leading us to propose our mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Further to the above, the qnrD expression was induced by aminoglycosides (L130). However, it remains unknown whether the elevated 2.8-fold increase in qnrD expression in the presence of tobramycin could produce an impact on fluoroquinolone resistance phenotype. First, an aminoglycoside at 1% MIC is expected to exhibit no antibacterial activity. Thus, a simple fluoroquinolone MIC testing can be done in the presence and the absence of very low levels of aminoglycosides that induce SOS response. A reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility would argue in favor of author-suggested significance of SOS induction findings.</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate the influence of the aminoglycoside-mediated SOS induction of <italic>qnrD</italic> on the level of fluoroquinolone resistance, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin have been determined for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>/pDIJ09-518a exposed to sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin or tobramycin (Table 1). These results showed that the aminoglycoside-induced SOS response increased fluoroquinolone MIC in line with the increased expression of <italic>qnrD</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, to test the possibility that the tobramycin could allow the survival of <italic>E. coli</italic> harbouring <italic>qnrD</italic> plasmids, that further develop stepwise accumulation of QRDR mutations, we determined the mutant prevention concentrations (MPC) of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin on a multi-susceptible clinical strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>, ATCC 25922 (reference multi-susceptible strain for antibiotic susceptibility testing), and its derivative harbouring pDIJ09-518a or pDIJ09-518aΔ<italic>qnrD</italic>. We added these findings in the revised manuscript (436-503) as well as in the figure 5. Altogether, our findings showed that aminoglycosides increased <italic>qnrD</italic> gene expression and promote high-level fluoroquinolone resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. As indicated by authors (L414-415), the functional roles of ORF3 and ORF4 via biochemical studies were not directly measured. Instead, sfiA expression and fluorescence indicators were assessed. This represents a weakness of the study. Can the authors address this?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with that demonstrating the functional roles of ORF3 and ORF4 via biochemical studies is an important point that would have strengthened our study. However, as we mentioned initially, such experimental effort does not invalidate our results and does not reduce its significance. Considering all the reviewer’s recommendations, we choose the other experiments to be considered as top priority (for instance, qRT-PCR on <italic>P. rettgeri</italic>, MPC, MIC, spontaneous mutations). As a follow-up to this initial report, we are currently working on biochemically and genetically characterizing the activities of purified proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. How do the experiments in figure S2 address plasmid stability during growth by measuring OD? Plasmid stability in the experimental conditions is an important issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Initially, experiments were performed in order to assess the stability of pDIJ09-518a carriage in the absence of a fluoroquinolone selective pressure. The schematical figure of our experiment is included in the revised manuscript and showed in figure S2B. We performed colony PCR every 5 days on 5 different colonies, until day 30. The plasmid was still present in the <italic>E. coli</italic> WT strain (figure S2C). These results are mentioned lines 146-153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Comparing Figures 3B and 1E, it can be observed that deletion of both recF and recB have significant effects on SOS induction by AG in cells carrying the qnrD plasmid. These results are very important for the model and a qRT measurement of sulA in recF and recB mutants would be an important confirmation for the results obtained with plasmid based assays, which could be influenced by the reporter plasmid copy number and stability in the different genotypes analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>This approach based on the expression of another SOS regulon gene (<italic>recN</italic>) used to measure the SOS response induction have already been used widely in many studies (e.g. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001165, doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003421, doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt1259). No influence of the reporter plasmid nor its stability were evidenced. The normalization of the method/apparel is made on the level of fluorescence of the WT strain in the MH medium without antibiotic.

The complementation of ORF 3 and 4 mutants (Figures 4A and 4C) is incomplete, the same SOS induction level as observed in the wt is never reached.

Relevant points have been clarified and risky statements have been toned down in the revised version. The story remains incomplete as ORF3 and ORF4 have not been characterized. As a consequence, a crucial point in the story (the mechanism that triggers NO accumulation) remains enigmatic. Despite this shortage, I agree with the authors that qnr-mediated induction of the SOS response by aminoglycosides is an interesting phenomenon. My only suggestion at this point is to modify the text wherever pertinent (e. g., lines 47-49 and 388-396) to make it clear that the identities of the ORF3 and ORF4 products are putative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done all the modifications all over the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
