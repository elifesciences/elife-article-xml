Assessing the magnitude of these fluctuations, that is, assigning uncertainties to the computed results, is of critical importance to drawing statistically reliable conclusions.

Naturally, the simulated reality is limited in accuracy by the underlying assumptions and approximations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1990</xref>). For example, a frequently noted shortcoming of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is its dependence on the force field, that is, simplified representation of the electronic ground state potential energy. Large efforts are continuously dedicated to improve force field accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another major simulation accuracy determining factor is the sampling convergence. For the cases where the phase space is not thoroughly explored, e.g. relevant protein conformations are not sampled, the subsequently estimated thermodynamic and kinetic properties will likely have a substantial associated error. A failure to properly assess this error may be critical, leading to an erroneous interpretation of the simulation data and a wrong overall conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knapp et al., 2018</xref>). Considering the stochastic nature of common sampling algorithms such as molecular dynamics simulations, biomolecular trajectories represent a multidimensional random walk of which the analysis is especially prone to suffer from sampling deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hess, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Recently, reports have appeared on a possible effect of the simulation box size on thermodynamic quantities in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Hage et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Hage et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asthagiri and Tomar, 2020</xref>). Specifically, the role of solvation and a box-size-dependent hydrophobic effect have been claimed as the underlying physical cause. However, these studies have been challenged, showing no significant box size effects when a larger statistical sample was studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapsys and de Groot, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehra and Kepp, 2019</xref>), indicating a lack of statistical significance of the original results that appeared to show a box size dependence. This scientific discussion makes the simulation box size variable an interesting candidate for further investigation in the light of statistical significance of the calculated thermodynamic and kinetic measures.</p><p>In the current work, we closely examine box size effects in different systems varying from the solvation free energy of a small molecule to the kinetics of a protein conformational change. We use a rigorous statistical framework to evaluate how the employed statistics affect the conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Thermodynamics: Solvation of small molecules</title><p>As a first example, we have investigated the box size dependence of the computed hydration free energy of the small molecule anthracene by employing the alchemical approach. The alchemical method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Straatsma and McCammon, 1992</xref>) allows circumventing computationally expensive paths along the thermodynamic cycle, e.g. pulling a molecule from the gas phase into solvent, for the case of solvation free energy calculations. This is achieved by exploiting an alternative, alchemical path: for the hydration free energy example, the Hamiltonian of the molecule in gas phase is transformed into the Hamiltonian of the molecule coupled to water. Sampling this path is not feasible in nature, but is possible by computation. Since the free energy is a thermodynamic state variable, it does not depend on whether a physical or alchemical pathway has been used for calculation.</p><p>We computed the hydration free energy in boxes ranging from 473 to 5334 solvating water molecules. The smallest box size was chosen such as to minimally satisfy the simulation condition that the box size exceeds twice the non-bonded cut-off radius in all three spatial dimensions. Twenty repeats were included per box size to study the spread from individual estimates. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asthagiri and Tomar, 2020</xref>, no trend in the computed hydration free energy was observed as a function of the employed simulation box size, when all repeats (N = 20) are taken into account. Naturally, if we were to rely on single realizations of molecular dynamics trajectories, it is possible to obtain any type of trend suggesting a box size dependence: in the middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> we highlight an arbitrary selection of an upward, downward, as well as upward followed by downward trends. However, neither trend is statistically significant and merely illustrates the erroneous conclusion that may be drawn from anecdotal evidence. This analysis also clearly illustrates the importance of reporting uncertainty estimates for the calculated observables: depicting confidence intervals for the ΔG estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> right panel) would help avoiding making unfounded claims about the depicted trends.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Solvation free energy of anthracene molecule.</title><p>The simulations were performed in boxes of 6 different sizes (<bold>A</bold>).

Firstly, we switch on the charges on the solute, this way evaluating the electrostatic contribution to the solvation free energy. In the second step, we introduce the van der Waals interactions of protein atoms, this way estimating the hydrophobic contribution of Pauli repulsion and attractive dispersion interactions. For both of these steps we also computed the respective <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> of charge and van der Waals interaction introduction in vacuum.</p><p>Switching on protein charges in water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> left panel) appears to be independent of the box size. The simulations without solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> middle panel) exhibit strong box size dependence. The latter result of simulations in vacuum is easy to explain when taking into consideration the treatment of long range electrostatic interactions: in our simulations we followed the nowadays standard approach of Ewald summation (Particle-Mesh-Ewald, PME method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darden et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">York et al., 1993</xref>]) to account for the electrostatic interactions in a system with periodic boundaries. Decreasing the box size in vacuum alters protein’s environment, as the distances between the periodic images decrease.</p><p>In the solvated system, PME is used as well, but the electrostatic effect between the periodic images is screened by water molecules. Following best practices of the system setup for molecular dynamics simulations ensures a sufficiently large distance between the periodic images, such that the thermodynamic properties of the system remain box size independent. For example, in the current setup, the minimal distance between the protein surface and the box edge was at least 1 nm even in the smallest simulation box. Reducing the box size allowing ∼0.5 nm distance between the solute and the box edge introduces artifacts where water screening is not sufficient and solvation shells of the periodic images can interact with each other. Such an extremely small box introduces a clear box size dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and is not recommended for any MD simulation.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Illustration of artifacts introduced in the solvation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> calculation upon charge introduction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strongly reduced simulation box size has an effect on the calculated <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> value.

Scaling the charges on water molecules to retain only 10% of the original charge reduces solvent’s screening strength making the solvent more similar to a Lennard-Jones fluid. In turn, the protein’s charge introduction free energies become more similar to those in vacuum and a box size dependence emerges.</p><p>Overall, to obtain the net electrostatic contribution to solvation free energy we can use the calculation in any of the sufficiently large solvated water boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> left panel) and subtract the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> value calculated in an infinitely large non-periodic vacuum box (illustrated by the blue square in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> middle panel). This ensures that the electrostatic component of hydration free energy is independent of the box size. Also, it is worth noting that in our calculations of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>Q</italic></sub> we did not need to apply any additional corrections, while Asthagiri and Tomar used an analytical correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hummer et al., 1998</xref>) to remove box size dependence of this ΔG component. The need for such a correction might depend on the particular details how the MD software computes the solvation free energy. Gromacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>), the simulation package used in this work, considers all the terms, including short and long range solute-solvent, solute-solute, as well as self interactions.</p><p>Another marked difference between the calculation reported by Asthagiri and Tomar and our work comes from the estimated absolute value of the ΔG<sub><italic>Q</italic></sub> component: −662 kcal/mol and −994 kcal/mol, respectively. There are several possible reasons underlying such a large discrepancy. The calculation of the solvation free energy of a whole protein is a highly specific endeavour, thus the absolute value of the estimated ΔG will strongly depend on the particular details of the simulation setup. To facilitate convergence and avoid protein unfolding for the simulations in vacuum Asthagiri and Tomar chose to freeze all the degrees of freedom of the protein. In our setup we only restricted the protein motions by harmonic position restraints. This disparate solute treatment itself contributes to the final difference in Δ<italic>G</italic>. An even larger contribution to the discrepancy can be expected from having all the protein degrees of freedom constrained (or restrained), as it exaggerates the influence of the starting structure for simulation: the internal dynamics of the solute is restricted and the solvent will interact with the initial conformer only.</p><p>Another aspect that we took particular care of was to properly equilibrate water molecules for the solvation free energy calculations. In the first step we performed annihilation of the van der Waals interactions of uncharged G<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> using Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations. This way the replicas of the protein were exchanged in 32 discrete steps between the pure water box and the water box with the protein coupled to the system via van der Waals interactions. In turn, the end state of the protein with the van der Waals interactions switched on was further used to initialize ΔG<sub><italic>Q</italic></sub> calculations. Naturally, such an exhaustive equilibration allowed water molecules to explore deep pockets of the protein, later contributing to the final free energy estimate.</p><p>Lastly, a considerable amount of sampling is required to reach convergence for an alchemical solvation of the whole protein, as the phase space overlap between neighboring windows needs to be ensured. In this work we invested 1.38 μs of sampling for the ΔG<sub><italic>Q</italic></sub> solvation in water for each box size including sampling enhancement by means of Hamiltonian replica exchange. Considering different sampling times in this work and that reported by Asthagiri and Tomar might further contribute to the discrepancy in the estimated ΔG<sub><italic>Q</italic></sub> values.</p><p>As for the van der Waals interaction contribution to the solvation free energy, no box size dependence is present neither in the solvated, nor in the vacuum state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Even the smallest box was sufficient to avoid protein self interactions (minimal distance between periodic images at least 1.4 nm). In spite of this apparently sufficient solvation, the authors have reported the PMF profile in the smallest box to deviate significantly from the other two larger boxes. It is therefore interesting to investigate what might give rise to such an effect.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Thermodynamics of dihydrofolate reductase.</title><p>Dihydrofolate reductase was simulated in boxes of 3 different sizes (<bold>A</bold>). (<bold>B</bold>) The distance between C<sub>α</sub> atoms of residues 18 and 45 was used as a reaction coordinate.

In the first example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> upper panel), we constructed a profile from three umbrella sampling based simulation repeats running 2.5 ns, of which 0.5 ns were discarded for equilibration, for each of the 27 discrete windows along the reaction coordinate (distance between the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of residues 18 and 45, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This rather short sampling time is comparable to the simulations performed by Babu and Lim. Indeed, the free energy profiles obtained from these simulations show an apparent box size dependence. However, in contrast to the original finding, it was the middle box (8 nm edge length) that showed a different behaviour, which appears statistically significant within the limited sampling at hand.</p><p>We subsequently extended the simulations 20 times, reaching 50 ns per window along the reaction coordinate. The profiles obtained from these simulations, after discarding the first 10 ns from each window for equilibration, are statistically indistinguishable among the different box sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> bottom panel).</p><p>This example once again highlights the caveat of undersampling and its crucial importance for drawing conclusions from the molecular dynamics simulations. To further highlight the manifestation of undersampling, we have calculated autocorrelation functions of the interatomic distance used as a reaction coordinate in every restraint window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). For the shorter distances (for brevity, in the figure we show the data for seven windows only), we observe autocorrelations significantly larger than zero pertaining for up to 10 ns. The autocorrelations from the short 2.5 ns simulations follow different trends and are significantly different from those obtained from the longer 50 ns runs. It is evident that analyzing the autocorrelations from the short trajectories may lead to the impression that the 2.5 ns simulation is readily converged, as the local free energy minimum is properly sampled and the trajectory appears to be memoryless. Unfortunately, this situation reveals the nature of the problem being akin to that of Zeno’s paradoxes (Aristotle, 350BC, Physics, Book VI): it is only possible to deduce that a simulation is not converged after obtaining a better converged simulation. The longer trajectories reveal that there are other relevant free energy minima, the sampling of which uncovers longer autocorrelation times and subsequently has a pronounced effect on the free energy profiles. The free energy profiles obtained from the trajectories of 10 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> middle panel) already show that the average values for the three box sizes approach one another and the remaining differences are largely within the range of uncertainty.</p><p>Furthermore, this case illustrates the importance of generating independent samples and taking into account autocorrelation times to obtain unbiased estimates. For the profiles and associated uncertainties in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (upper panel), 95% confidence intervals from three independent repeats erroneously indicated statistically signifcant difference between the simulation boxes. This under-estimation of the standard error appears due to remaining dependence between the three repeats, as they all started from the same initial structure. The short overall sampling time with a brief equilibration phase were insufficient to remove autocorrelations at longer time-scales. The sufficient equilibration time is system dependent: as we showed before in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, for alanine dipeptide even shorter simulations were sufficient to obtain reliable error estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Kinetics: alanine dipeptide</title><p>In addition to possible thermodynamic effects, it is also of interest to investigate if the analysis of the kinetics of conformational transitions is affected by the obtained statistics. Here the current literature status is particularly confusing. For the same simulation system, differences in transition times between single repeats have been reported and interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Hage et al., 2018</xref>) while at the same time it has been argued that hundreds to thousands of transitions should be sampled for an estimate of kinetic rate constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Hage et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For the same alanine dipeptide system as used for the thermodynamics investigation described above, we therefore investigated the transition times from the A to the B conformation of the molecule based on a different number of simulation trajectories.

For the data at hand, no significant differences between the studied box sizes are observed for any number of repeats.

Such an evaluation can be achieved by following Bayesian inference methodology.

A relatively strong effect is visible, but as laid out above, without further analysis it remains unclear to which extent this is explained by a difference in protein-to-water ratio and to which extent it truly reflects a difference in water diffusion.</p><p>To dissect the two effects, in principle the water diffusion constant could be analyzed as a function of the distance to the biomolecular surface. However, water molecules move during the analysis period, changing their distance to the surface and with that their level of restriction, hence challenging the analysis. We therefore chose to use an alternative approach in which we take the largest box of 15 nm as a reference and extrapolate the average diffusion constant of the other two box sizes to the same size of 15 nm by assuming that only bulk water is added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). The diffusion constant calculated for the water molecules in the smaller 9 nm and 12 nm boxes was combined by means of a weighted average based on the volume of the added bulk water and the bulk water diffusion coefficient to compute the extrapolated value at 15 nm box size.</p><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref> (circles), the original strong effect from the straight averages (squares) has vanished, indicating that the original apparent effect was largely dominated by a normalization artifact arising from a difference in protein-to-water ratio. It should be noted that the applied extrapolation procedure is approximate, as here we have used simple averaging of non-corrected diffusion coefficients. There is a remaining small trend visible and it will be interesting to analyze in the future if this stems from our crude extrapolation procedure or if it reflects an effect of the periodic boundary conditions.</p><p>In addition to water dynamics, also water thermodynamics might in principle be affected by the box size. As with the diffusion constant, a straightforward analysis such as a solvent radial distribution function (RDF) is complicated by normalization issues, which can lead to artifacts when comparing boxes of different size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Hage et al., 2018</xref>). The issue arises due to the fact that RDF is normalized by the particle density (in the current case, water density) in the box. In an infinitely diluted system, the density would approach the value of bulk water. In a realistic simulation box, however, a fraction of its volume that is occupied by the protein is not accessible to water. This way, the calculated RDF is larger than the true RDF by V<italic><sub>box</sub></italic>/(V<italic><sub>box</sub></italic>-V<italic><sub>protein</sub></italic>). This ratio depends on the box size, in turn, making the normalization of RDF box size-dependent.</p><p>To overcome this issue, we have previously used a procedure of cutting out boxes of constant size from differently sized simulation boxes, rendering the RDF analyszd from the cut-out boxes comparable. This analysis showed that the strong apparent box size effect on the solvent RDF initially derived from the different box sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Hage et al., 2018</xref>) vanished upon consistent normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapsys and de Groot, 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, as the procedure of cutting out subsystems from a simulation trajectory is a somewhat crude and ad hoc procedure, we now implemented a spherical RDF normalization that does not rely on subsystem extraction from larger boxes. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, the result of this radial normalization is consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gapsys and de Groot, 2019</xref>) as well as the anthracene solvation presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and it confirms that no significant box size effects are observed in terms of protein solvation and, by implication, the hydrophobic effect.</p><p>The combined results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> demonstrate the established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yeh and Hummer, 2004</xref>) mild box size dependence of bulk water dynamics. In contrast, no evidence for a thermodynamic effect on the solvent shell was found.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the work we have not observed any statistically significant box size effects on the kinetics and thermodynamics of biomolecules. It should be noted, however, that all box sizes studied in this work included a solvent shell of at least 1 nm in size, or at least three solvation layers between the studied biomolecule and the box edge. Beyond that range only minimal box size effects should be expected, as shown, but naturally box size artifacts may occur for smaller boxes due to (indirect) self-interaction caused by the periodic nature of typical molecular dynamics boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mehra and Kepp, 2019</xref>). Therefore the box-size independence demonstrated in this work is limited to box sizes that exceed a distance of 1 nm between the biomolecule and the box edge.</p><p>Similarly, simulations in particularly small boxes may have a profound effect on the lateral lipid diffusion, resulting in significant correlations in lipid motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klauda et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, lateral diffusion of lipids, as well as membrane proteins embedded in a lipid bilayer depend on the simulation box size and box asymmetry due to the hydrodynamic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vögele et al., 2018</xref>), Hydrodynamic effects also induce the rotational diffusion dependence on the simulation box size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linke et al., 2018</xref>). Analytical hydrodynamic corrections for the latter effects have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vögele and Hummer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linke et al., 2018</xref>) in a similar fashion to the correction for the bulk water diffusion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yeh and Hummer, 2004</xref>.</p><p>Among other box size related caveats that need to be considered when performing simulations in a periodic system where electrostatics is treated by means of Ewald summation, is the overall charge of the system. For a charged simulation box, a uniformly distributed neutralizing background charge will be introduced automatically by the Ewald methods, thus the charges in the simulated system will experience a potential which will depend on the solvent volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2014</xref>) and dielectric constants of the solvents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hub et al., 2014</xref>). While posthoc corrections to the free energies calculated in the charged periodic systems exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rocklin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reif and Oostenbrink, 2014</xref>), a generalize advice to obtaining reliable dynamic trajectories would be, if possible, to neutralize the simulation system.</p><p>All in all, in the work we aimed at collecting a comprehensive set of examples illustrating that a reliable uncertainty estimation is not a mere nuisance, but an essential part of good scientific practice. Ignoring to obtain error estimates and relying on single realizations of processes stochastic in nature may lead to drawing incorrect conclusions, as for example showcased in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. A previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Hage et al., 2018</xref> serves as clear illustration of this when interpreting a set of single (no replicas) simulation trajectories. Upon generation of a larger data sample, the previous conclusions of El Hage et al. are shown not to hold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is our hope that this work will provide a reference for the scientific community to identify cases that do not meet scientific standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pezzella et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work we have systematically investigated the effect of the usage of statistics on the interpretation of results from molecular simulation. Due to the stochastic nature of most commonly used sampling integrators, it is of critical importance that sampling convergence is demonstrated. This can be achieved in single runs if the slowest degree of freedom relevant for the property of interest is reversibly sampled multiple times. Alternatively, multiple repeats can be carried out to check for reproducibility and convergence. The use of multiple repeats has many additional advantages such as a straightforward error estimate obtained from the spread among individual repeats. This is frequently a valid approach, provided that the individual repeats can be considered statistically independent. A practical advantage of multiple repeats is its trivial parallelization. In the absence of multiple repeats, there is a substantial risk of lack of reproducibility due to the fact that the results from individual runs may have happened by chance and are not representative of a larger set. Such anecdotal evidence may be useful for hypothesis generation but should be followed up by a more thorough statistical approach. The examples provided in this work illustrate that an initial indication of an apparent box size effect in molecular dynamics simulations based on single repeats was not confirmed when repeated with an order of magnitude more statistics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Anthracene solvation free energy calculations</title><p>An automated procedure was used to assign the CGenFF based topology for anthracene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vanommeslaeghe and MacKerell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2012</xref>).

Jeffreys prior, although being invariant to scaling of Θ, does not provide a defined posterior distribution in the absence of observed transitions. Therefore, using the uniform prior has an advantage that it allows making inferences about rates even when no transitions are observed. In practice, whenever possible, it is recommended to use both priors and compare the generated posteriors: given sufficient evidence by the data, both posteriors converge to the same distribution.</p><p>To compare the odds ratio of the two models we, firstly, define two hypotheses: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>: one process with a rate <italic>k</italic> has generated the data observed in differently sized boxes. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>: the data from different boxes were generated by distinct processes with disparate rates.

resides in its rigorous analysis and clear presentation of non-trivial methodological issues that are of relevance to all molecular simulation studies. It is anticipated that this work will serve a reference for the growing community of scientists using these types of computational methods.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;On the importance of statistics in molecular simulations: thermodynamics, kinetics and simulation box size&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alan Grossfield (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In the interest of full transparency, the Senior Editor has decided to provide you with the reviewers' reports as received. As you will see, the reviewers have judged that your manuscript is of interest and potentially suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, they also conclude that additional data and revisions to the text will be required before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Given this decision, I would like to draw your attention to the changes in the <italic>eLife</italic> revision policy that were made in response to the COVID-19 crisis (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The work by Gapsys and de Groot addresses the critical issues of adequate sampling and proper statistical analysis in molecular simulations, which are essential to provide a rigorous assessment and interpretation of the simulation results. Molecular simulations are necessarily performed on limited-size systems confined in a simulation box, typically under periodic boundaries and it is legitimate to investigate the implications of such finite-size approximation in conventional simulation setups.</p><p>In this work the authors analyze the effect of the simulation box size in different types of simulations and bimolecular systems, ranging from small test systems to more realistic biological molecules (i.e. hemoglobin), exemplifying in each case the possible shortcomings arising from sampling and statistical inaccuracies. In the case of hemoglobin, the authors propose rigorous statistical analysis to evaluate the trend of the transition times from T to R protein conformations as a function of the box size for different simulations repeats. This work report an extensive set of examples, is well written and appear very well done from the technical standpoint. Nonetheless in my opinion the manuscript requires a few revisions to improve the clarity of the presentation and to provide a better and more comprehensive fit with the current literature.</p><p>One of the main conclusions of this work is that beyond a reasonable threshold the box size does not affect the simulation outcome. While this has been clearly proven for the systems and observables investigated in this study, to provide a broader perspective it is important to mention clear-cut examples in which the effect of the finite box size must be taken into consideration to provide meaningful results and in some case could also lead to artifacts.</p><p>For the case of the alchemical calculations reported in the manuscript the authors should mention and discuss documented cases of inhomogeneous systems (e.g. when charges are generated) in which the periodic boundaries could lead to shifts in the calculated free energy unless a proper setup is utilized (Lin et al., 2014). One example of artifact that could be induced by the periodic boundaries is also reported in a previous study by one of the authors of this work (Hub et al., 2014). Another example is the significant system size dependence of the lateral diffusion of lipids (Klauda et al., 2006). Lastly, even for homogenous systems a box size dependence of the rotational diffusion of biomolecules has been recently reported (Linke et al., 2018).</p><p>A general question that I have pertains to the examples of Figure 1C and Figure 5C, in which the authors illustrate the anecdotal trends that could be obtained with limited statistics. It could be instructive in these cases to report additional controls that could be taken for assessing lack of statistics. In Figure 1C for example block analysis within each single repeat could already indicate that the reported trends as a function of the box size are not significant. In the case of Figure 5C autocorrelation analysis and/or block analysis could be used to assess the presence of correlations between the repeats (i.e. each single repeat is not equilibrated). Another possibility is to compare the results with a Markov Model analysis, such as TRAM (Wu et al., PNAS June 7, 2016 113 (23) E3221-E3230) or DHAM (Stelzl et al., J Chem Theory Comput. 2017 Dec 12;13(12):6328-6342) that should better handle non equilibrated samples.</p><p>I report below more specific clarifications/improvements that need to be addressed.</p><p>In the application to the Gb protein the authors compare their results to the work of Asthagiri and Tomar. Here the explicit comparison must be clarified; Asthagiri and Tomar also report a thermodynamic integration calculation to estimate the charging free energy of Gb which is (consistently with this work) box size independent. The box size dependence emerges when using the quasi chemical theory (e.g. to analyze the specific components). Additionally, the charging free energy reported by Asthagiri and Tomar doesn't seem consistent with the values reported in this work.</p><p>The Discussion section is more a result section about water diffusion, my suggestion is to move this section in the results and provide an actual discussion, e.g. expanding the Conclusions by including the considerations reported above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>General assessment:</p><p>This paper aims to present a methodical demonstration of the importance of obtaining complete sampling statistics from MD simulations for the purpose of estimating thermodynamic or kinetic quantities. As a test case, the authors apply this demonstration to the hypothesis that solvent periodic box size affects the simulation-derived thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecules. This work is statistically rigorous and provides a clear comparison between results obtained with insufficient sampling and those derived from more extensive sampling. This paper can serve as a good reference for future scientists employing MD simulations who want to make sure their sampling is adequate based on proper statistical methods.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The authors show that increased simulation time per window (50 ns instead of 2.5 ns) along the dihydrofolate reductase M20 loop motion reaction coordinate results in indistinguishable PMF profiles by box size. The authors attribute the discrepancies observed when using 2.5-ns sampling times to insufficient equilibration away from the initial structure, as 2.5 ns is not sufficiently greater than the autocorrelation time of the loop motion. While this is a very plausible explanation, the conclusion would be strengthened by explicit calculation of the reaction coordinate autocorrelation time. This is particularly important to include as an example to other scientists who would like to estimate how long their independent simulations need to be to avoid biased estimates that are caused by using the same initial structure.</p><p>2) For the kinetics analysis it would be helpful to include more information, including equations or a reference to the appropriate equations, to show how the rate constants and uncertainty were calculated in detail using the frequentist approach. In particular, it is not clear how the trials that did not exhibit any transitions for hemoglobin were accounted for in the calculation of the T state halflife.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I think this is a timely, important, and well-executed study that will be a valuable resource to the community. Insufficient sampling has been the bane of bimolecular simulation since its inception 40 years ago, and this paper is largely framed as a rebuke to a recent, high-profile example.</p><p>My biggest complaint with the paper as it stands is not with the work, which is excellent, but with the lack of details in the presentation. As I see it, the real value in this manuscript isn't beating up on a bad paper, the authors already accomplished that, but in teaching the community how to do things better. The paper covers a truly enormous scope, arguably, 3-4 paper's worth, and as a consequence doesn't include all of the details needed to understand their arguments. Most of the information is available in the references, or in the code they distribute (another excellent choice on their part), but to really maximize the didactic value of the paper I think more of the explanation has to be in the main body of the paper. For example:</p><p>1) They never said what enhanced sampling method was used in the DHFR calculations, or what the collective variable was. It sounds like umbrella sampling, but they weren't explicit.</p><p>2) Figures 8-10 on the kinetics of hemoglobin. There's no real explanation of what they did to generate any of these figures. The error bars in Figure 8 aren't defined, nor is how they were calculated. I'm assuming they did bootstrapping, with different sample sizes, but it should be stated explicitly. It's interesting that the standard errors in Figure 8B are larger for the smaller box, but the authors don't comment on why.</p><p>3) Figure 9: there are 2 curves in each panel, presumably one for each prior, but which is which is not stated. In the top right panel, there's only 1 curve, with no explanation. Given that the paper is mostly intended as a teaching tool, I think a brief summary of the Ensign and Pande theory would be helpful, as would an explanation for why you would use to two different priors.</p><p>4) Figure 10: You have to read pretty far into the caption before you realize the data which shows 2 distributions is artificial, to prove a point. No details are given to explain how this was done, in the caption or the body of the paper. The authors should either leave it out or provide those details.</p><p>5) Very few details are given about the alanine dipeptide calculations.</p><p>6) When discussing the protein solvation calculations, the final conclusion (that the appropriate approach to eliminate box-size dependence in vacuum is to use no cutoff at all) is very reasonable, but the data should be shown.</p><p>Despite my somewhat lengthy list of complaints, I want to re-emphasize that I think this is an outstanding paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57589.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] One of the main conclusions of this work is that beyond a reasonable threshold the box size does not affect the simulation outcome.

[…] While posthoc corrections to the free energies calculated in the charged periodic systems exist (Rocklin et al., 2013,Hub et al., 2014,Lin et al., 2014,Reif et al., 2014), a generalize advice to obtaining reliable dynamic trajectories would be, if possible, to neutralize the simulation system.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A general question that I have pertains to the examples of Figure 1C and Figure 5C, in which the authors illustrate the anecdotal trends that could be obtained with limited statistics.

The large error bars depicting 95% confidence intervals illustrate the danger of interpreting the trends without considering the underlying uncertainties. When the uncertainties are taken into account, it appears that the confidence intervals cover a large range of G values making the judgement about only increasing/decreasing trend statistically insignificant.</p><p>“Naturally, if we were to rely on single realizations of molecular dynamics trajectories, it is possible to obtain any type of trend suggesting a box size dependence: in the middle panel of Figure 1B we highlight an arbitrary selection of an upward and downward trends. However, neither trend is statistically significant and merely illustrates the erroneous conclusion that may be drawn from anecdotal evidence. This analysis also clearly illustrates the importance of reporting uncertainty estimates for the calculated observables: depicting confidence intervals for the G estimates (Figure 1B right panel) would help avoiding making ungrounded claims about the depicted trends.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the case of Figure 5C autocorrelation analysis and/or block analysis could be used to assess the presence of correlations between the repeats (i.e. each single repeat is not equilibrated).

For the short distances, autocorrelations significantly larger than zero pertain for up to 10 ns. The autocorrelations from the short 2.5 ns simulations are significantly different from those obtained from longer 50 ns runs. Analyzing autocorrelations from the short trajectories may lead to a misleading interpretation that the simulation is readily converged, as the local free energy minimum is properly sampled and the trajectory appears to be memoryless. Unfortunately, this situation reveals the nature of the problem being akin to that of Zeno’s paradoxes: it is possible to deduce that the simulation is not converged only after obtaining a better converged simulation. The longer trajectories reveal that there are other relevant free energy minima, sampling which discloses longer autocorrelation times and subsequently has a pronounced effect on the free energy profiles.</p><p>“To further highlight the manifestation of undersampling, we have calculated autocorrelation functions of the interatomic distance used as a reaction coordinate in every restraint window (Figure 5D). […] The free energy profiles obtained from the trajectories of 10 ns (Figure 5C middle panel) already show that the average values for the three box sizes approach one another and the remaining differences are largely within the range of uncertainty.”</p><p>We have also performed DHAMed analysis, but in our hands incorporating the kinetic information had little effect on the generated free energy profiles when compared to those obtained by means of MBAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). While this technique might help with certain convergence issues in particular situations, as illustrated in the DHAMed publication, we decided not to include this result in the manuscript, as it had no significant effect in the investigated case.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the free energy profiles for dihydrofolate reductase as obtained by MBAR and DHAMed.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57589-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I report below more specific clarifications/improvements that need to be addressed.</p><p>In the application to the Gb protein the authors compare their results to the work of Asthagiri and Tomar.

Exponential fitting to a survival curve yields time constant, which can be related to the half-life by t<sub>1=</sub>2 = ln 2. Standard error was calculated as a standard deviation of a bootstrapped distribution.

It sounds like umbrella sampling, but they weren't explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>A detailed description has now been added to the Materials and methods section, also a shortened version of the overall procedure is introduced in the Results section as well.</p><p>Results</p><p>“In the first example (Figure 5C upper panel), we constructed a profile from 3 umbrella sampling based simulation repeats running 2.5 ns, of which 0.5 ns were discarded for equilibration, for each of the 27 discrete windows along the reaction coordinate (distance between the C atoms of residues 18 and 45, as depicted in Figure 5B).”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“For the dihydrofolate reductase simulation setup, we closely followed the protocol described by Babu and Lim. Once solvated and neutralized, the systems were first equilibrated for 1 ns with position restraints on heavy protein atoms, followed by 1 ns unrestrained equilibration. The free energy profiles were constructed from equilibrium simulations at 27 discrete windows (umbrella sampling) along the reaction coordinate defined as a distance between the C atoms of residues 18 and 45. A harmonic restraint with a force constant of 4184 kJ/mol/nm<sup>2</sup> was applied to the drive distance from 0.4 to 1.7 nm by a 0.05 nm increment. Three independent simulation repeats were performed for each of the three simulation boxes reaching 50 ns per window. The final PMF profile was calculated by means of MBAR estimator.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figures 8-10 on the kinetics of hemoglobin. There's no real explanation of what they did to generate any of these figures. The error bars in Figure 8 aren't defined, nor is how they were calculated. I'm assuming they did bootstrapping, with different sample sizes, but it should be stated explicitly. It's interesting that the standard errors in Figure 8B are larger for the smaller box, but the authors don't comment on why.</p></disp-quote><p>The procedure for obtaining error bars for Figure 8 has now been described in detail in the Materials and methods section (also addressed when replying to question 2 of reviewer 2). For the Figure 8B we have now added bootstrapped standard errors showing that the differences between the standard errors in the estimated half lives are statistically insignificant.</p><p>The theory behind Bayesian rate estimation has been added to the Materials and methods. In addition, we also describe describe in more detail the analysis performed for Figures 9-10.</p><p>“In the Bayesian framework, the rate estimates depend on the chosen prior distribution (more details in Materials and methods). Following Ensign and Pande, we chose both a uniform prior as well as Jeffreys prior for the rate estimates. From the generated hemoglobin trajectories, for the simulations in each box, we have extracted the number of transitions from T to R state, as well as the time required to make a transition (or the full trajectory time, in case no transition is made). This information allowed constructing posterior rate constant distributions (see Materials and methods and Ensign and Pande). As shown in Figure 9, whereas the choice of prior has a large influence on the probability distribution for the rate for single simulations, this effect is much smaller for 10, 20 and 100 repeats.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 9: there are 2 curves in each panel, presumably one for each prior, but which is which is not stated. In the top right panel, there's only 1 curve, with no explanation. Given that the paper is mostly intended as a teaching tool, I think a brief summary of the Ensign and Pande theory would be helpful, as would an explanation for why you would use to two different priors.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that the two curves denote posterior distributions calculated from the uniform and Jeffreys priors. This is denoted in the Figure 9 legend (top left panel). To make this clearer we have additionally added an explanation to the figure caption.</p><p>The details of Bayesian rate estimation are now provided in the Materials and methods section and the use of priors is discussed there as well.</p><p>Figure 9 caption:</p><p>“Two priors were used: uniform (solid line, subscript U) and Jeffreys prior (dashed line, subscript J).”</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“The expressions above illustrate that the posterior distribution based on uniform prior allows infering rates even for the cases where no transitions have been observed. Jeffreys prior, although being invariant to scaling of , does not provide a defined posterior distribution in the absence of observed transitions. Therefore, using the uniform prior has an advantage that it allows making inferences about rates even when no transitions are observed. In practice, whenever possible, it is recommended to use both priors and compare the generated posteriors: given the sufficient evidence by the data, both posteriors converge to the same distribution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 10: You have to read pretty far into the caption before you realize the data which shows 2 distributions is artificial, to prove a point. No details are given to explain how this was done, in the caption or the body of the paper. The authors should either leave it out or provide those details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now indicated in the figure that the third panel in Figure 10 represents an artificial case. An additional explanation for this analysis was added to the text. We have also adjusted the synthetic case example, showcasing that to obtain strong evidence for two processes governing the kinetics of simulation in different boxes, one would need a very particular situation to occur. Namely, for three out of three 1 s hemoglobin simulations in a 15 nm box no transition should occur, while a 9 nm box in three simulations would make a transition already in the first half of the simulation time.</p><p>“The Bayes formalism provides a framework to estimate if two distributions differ significantly from each other (details in Materials and methods section). […] To reach the scenario of strong evidence for two disparate processes generating the distributions, we had to artificially replicate 3 times the observations that in 9 nm box a transition occurs in 0.466 s and no transition occurs in 15 nm box within 1𝜇s.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Very few details are given about the alanine dipeptide calculations.</p></disp-quote><p>More details about the alanine dipeptide simulations have been added to the Materials and methods.</p><p>“To summarize briefly, we have prepared four simulation setups in cubic boxes with an edge of 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 nm. […] The standard errors were calculated from the standard deviations of independent simulations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) When discussing the protein solvation calculations, the final conclusion (that the appropriate approach to eliminate box-size dependence in vacuum is to use no cutoff at all) is very reasonable, but the data should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>This approach is demonstrated in Figure 2 where infinitely large box (no periodicity) was used to calculate G in vacuum. We have now clarified this in the text.</p><p>“Overall, to obtain the net electrostatic contribution to solvation free energy we can use calculation in any of the sufficiently large solvated water boxes (Figure 2B left panel) and subtract the G value calculated in an infinitely large non-periodic vacuum box (illustrated by the blue square in Figure 2B middle panel).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
