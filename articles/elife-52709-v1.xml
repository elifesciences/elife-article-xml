bone disorders that are associated with crystal nephropathies. Phytate, the major form of phosphorus in plant seeds, is known as an indigestible and of negligible nutritional value in humans. However, the mechanism and adverse effects of high-phytate intake on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate absorption and homeostasis are unknown. Here, we show that excessive intake of phytate along with a low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet fed to rats contributed to the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss through tubular dysfunction secondary to dysregulation of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplementation alleviated the detrimental effects of excess dietary phytate on bone and kidney through excretion of undigested Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate, which prevented a vicious cycle of intestinal phosphate overload and renal phosphate wasting while improving intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> bioavailability. Thus, we demonstrate that phytate is digestible without a high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet and is a risk factor for phosphate overloading and for the development of crystal nephropathies and bone disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phytate</kwd><kwd>phosphate overload</kwd><kwd>kidney stones</kwd><kwd>hypophosphatemia</kwd><kwd>crystal nephropathies</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017R1D1A1B03031094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Ok-Hee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019R1A2C2008130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Byung-Chul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003569</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Food and Drug Safety</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14182MFDS460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Byung-Chul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003710</institution-id><institution>Korea Health Industry Development Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C1135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Byung-Chul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003569</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Food and Drug Safety</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16181MFDS381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Byung-Chul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A high-phytate-low Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet causes crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone disease in rats, whereas high Ca<sup>2+</sup> intake ameliorates the detrimental effects of a high-phytate diet.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phytate (<italic>Myo</italic>-inositol hexaphosphate) is the main phosphorus storage system in plant seeds such as those of cereal grains, nuts, oilseeds, and legumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raboy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddy et al., 1982</xref>), accounting for up to 80% of total phosphorous. Phytate tightly binds to essential minerals such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> to form mineral-phytate salts because of its six phosphate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oh et al., 2006</xref>). These mineral-phytate salts are known to be indigestible by monogastric animals and humans, which lack the digestive enzyme phytase that releases phosphate from mineral-phytate salts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reddy and Sathe, 2002</xref>). The prevailing hypothesis argues that phytate-derived phosphorus is indigestible, not absorbed in the intestine, and is excreted in the feces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Golovan et al., 2001</xref>). This widespread belief led to the development of low-phytate crops and commercial phytases to improve the bioavailability of phytate-bound essential minerals, including phosphorus, and to improve the nutritional quality of plant seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raboy, 2007</xref>). Thus, plant seeds or high-fiber vegetable proteins represent a poor or negligible source of bioavailable phosphate for intestinal absorption compared with animal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vervloet et al., 2017</xref>). Further, they are not considered to affect intestinal phosphate absorption adversely in humans eating diets that are mainly comprised of plant-based, cereal-rich diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reddy and Sathe, 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, there are insufficient data indicating the amount of phytate phosphorus that is bioavailable for intestinal absorption and whether specific conditions can modulate the bioavailability and digestibility of phytate.</p><p>High-phytate diets cause stronger adverse effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels in infants, young children, and pregnant and lactating women when cereal-based foods represent a large percentage of the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Hasan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). Prior studies of dogs demonstrate that increasing the levels of phytate reduces the intestinal absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and causes nutritional rickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harrison and Mellanby, 1939</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mellanby, 1949</xref>). Likewise, increasing dietary phytate is associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in young adults because of the reduced intestinal absorption of dietary Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calvo et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pettifor, 1994</xref>). Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ford et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goswami et al., 2000</xref>), a subsequent case-control study found that nutritional rickets is more prevalent in children who consume diets comprising low dietary Ca<sup>2+</sup> and high phytate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2012</xref>). These findings suggest a strong association between high-phytate intake and metabolic bone diseases, including nutritional rickets and osteomalacia. However, although the roles of phytate in mineral deficiency are well-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raboy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reddy et al., 1982</xref>), who do not know whether dietary phytate can modulate the intestinal absorption of phosphate because of a lack of awareness.</p><p>Despite its adverse effects on animal and human health, dietary phytate can be beneficial because it inhibits digestive enzymes that hydrolyze lipids, proteins, and starch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). For example, high-phytate diets inhibit the absorption of glucose and lipids, leading to lower serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, and total cholesterol in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson et al., 1987</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jariwalla et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onomi et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, diets based on vegetable protein lead to lower plasma levels of phosphate and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a major regulator of phosphate homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Razzaque, 2009</xref>), compared with those based on meat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moe et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, few studies suggest that phytate diets reduce the risk of developing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced kidney stones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goswami et al., 2000</xref>). Unfortunately, these studies fail to contribute a broader understanding of the detrimental effects of excess phytate intake on the functions of bone and kidney, two major organs that regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate homeostasis.</p><p>Here, we investigated the effects of excessive intake of phytate on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate homeostasis in a rat model, as well as in a dietary study of humans. Thus, the goals of this study were to determine how a high-phytate diet affects kidney and bone health, to establish whether these changes depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> or mineral content, and to provide a rationale for restricting excessive phytate intake in patients who have kidney and metabolic bone diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phytate-fed rats develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with hypophosphatemia and azotemia</title><p>We previously reported that phytate forms insoluble tricalcium- or tetracalcium-phytate salts in vitro over a wide pH range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). To evaluate the systemic effects of dietary phytate, rats (4-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley) were fed AIN-93G diets supplemented with 0% (control), 1%, 3%, or 5% phytate for 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). On the basis of the molecular weights of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phytate in these diets, increased phytate supplementation at a constant Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (0.5%) gradually decreases the molar ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/phytate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Rats that were fed higher levels of phytate (3% and 5%) exhibited decreased growth rates and reduced fat-free lean mass and whole-body fat compared with those of the control, despite similar daily food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). We reasoned therefore that the decreased growth rates were caused by decreased bioavailability of dietary Ca<sup>2+</sup> associated with increased phytate supplementation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phytate-fed rats develop secondary hyperparathyroidism with hypophosphatemia and azotemia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

Thus, we conclude that rats fed the HP-HCa<sup>2+</sup> diet accumulated unabsorbed and indigestible Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts in the intestine while decreasing the intestinal phosphate available for absorption, indicating that the endogenous enzyme phytase was unable to hydrolyze Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts.</p><p>Conversely, rats fed the HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet hydrolyzed and absorbed &gt;68–74% of the phosphate in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–K</xref>) with a concomitant increase in urinary phosphate excretion, thus developing renal phosphate wasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>).

As phosphate and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake occur along the gastrointestinal tract via the dedicated phosphate channel NaPi-2b and the major Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV6, we analyzed the expression levels of NaPi-2b and TRPV6 in the intestinal tissues by immunohistochemical staining. However, there were no differences in expression levels of intestinal NaPi-2b or TRPV6 between any of the different dietary groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Thus, our findings demonstrate that phytate was digestible and absorbed in the intestine, considering that phytate is indigestible and unabsorbable in vivo when it forms Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts in the presence of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.

MINPP1 could be a secreted enzyme with extremely high catalytic activity for phytate and is widely expressed in several tissues, including the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, colon, and pancreas, as well as at the highest levels in kidney, liver, and placenta. Phylogenic analysis of bacterial MINPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stentz et al., 2014</xref>) suggested that Bacteroidetes express and secrete a homolog of a mammalian MINPP1 in the gut, whereas Firmicutes, a major phylum of the human intestinal microbiota, do not encode a protein homolog of MINPP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Taken together, these findings suggest crucial roles of gut bacterial and intestinal MINPP1 in the hydrolysis of dietary phytate, although further research is needed to determine whether the hydrolysis of phytate by MINPP1 is direct and/or indirect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplementation protects phytate-fed rats against crystal nephropathies and bone loss</title><p>We next examined the morphological and histopathological changes in bones and kidneys when rats were fed the HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet.

Our findings support our hypothesis that an HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet has detrimental metabolic effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate homeostasis in rats through inhibiting intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption while increasing intestinal phosphate overloading. These events lead to high levels of PTH and low levels of FGF23 and αKlotho. The resulting hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia caused by the high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet could explain the secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss and phosphaturia, which in turn causes nephrocalcinosis. By contrast, supplementation with high Ca<sup>2+</sup> alleviated phytate-mediated pathogenic defects such as biochemical abnormalities, high PTH levels, nephrocalcinosis, renal fibrosis, vitamin D insufficiency, hypophosphatemia, and bone loss. We identified the dietary conditions that influence the bioavailability of phytate when an excess of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is added to high-phytate diets. Thus, phytate forms insoluble Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts in the intestine, where it becomes indigestible and unabsorbable, and ultimately is excreted as undigested Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts in the feces. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplementation normalized impaired renal tubular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate reabsorption by preventing intestinal phosphate overloading caused by phytate hydrolysis and improving intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> bioavailability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the effects of phytate diets supplemented with low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> or high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate homeostasis.</title><p>In the presence of a low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/phytate &lt;5), phytate can adversely affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate homeostasis in normal healthy rats by inhibiting intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption while increasing phosphate overload through phytate hydrolysis in the intestine. These effects lead to crystal nephropathies, severe renal phosphate wasting, and pathologic bone loss via increased PTH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. By contrast, in the presence of a high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet, phytate forms multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts, which makes them indigestible and unabsorbable in vivo, leading to their excretion in the feces as undigested Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts. This process prevents a vicious cycle of intestinal phosphate overloading and renal phosphate wasting while improving intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> bioavailability, which eventually alleviates the detrimental effects of excess phytate hydrolysis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52709-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We identified previously unrecognized mechanisms of bioavailability and digestibility of phytate in vivo. Thus, HPIC and ICP-MS analyses of feces revealed that phytate is present in digestible or indigestible forms in vivo depending on the dietary Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, revealing that phytate is only indigestible and unabsorbable when it forms multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts. This finding is consistent with data of our in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), which show that phytate possesses three or four Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites at physiological pH and forms insoluble multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate salts. By contrast, when the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/phytate molar ratio is &lt;5 (HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet), phytate becomes digestible, which leads to phosphate overloading in the intestine leading to renal phosphate wasting and metabolic bone disease. These results may explain why the adverse effects of high-phytate on nutrients are exacerbated when Ca<sup>2+</sup> intake or mineral content is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raboy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Humer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Phytases can be classified into two major classes on the basis of their biochemical and structural properties, that is, the histidine acid phytases and the alkaline β-propeller phytases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stentz et al., 2014</xref>). The histidine acid phytase (HAP) superfamily consists of purple acid phosphatase, histidine acid phytase, histidine acid phosphatase, and MINPP1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Our in vivo data suggested that a high-phytate diet can be hydrolyzed and can release excess phosphates into the gut by either mammalian intestinal or microbial MINPP1 when the diet contains a low concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, although further studies are needed to determine how mammalian MINPP1 is processed and secreted into the digestive tract. The HAPs, predominantly, have positively charged amino acids in their active sites, thereby explaining how the HAPs can bind highly negatively charged phytate at acidic pH but that this is unfavorable for binding to positively charged Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate due to electrostatic repulsion between the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate and the active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oh et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests a mechanism to explain why the HAPs can only hydrolyze Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free phytate but cannot hydrolyze Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate when the diet contains a high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leading to a decrease in the bioaccessibility of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate and the bioavailability of intestinal phosphates and Ca<sup>2+</sup> for absorption into the blood, eventually leading to excretion of undigested Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate in the feces. These results explain why high-phytate/high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets prevented the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss in rats. By contrast, β-propeller phytases mainly have negatively charged amino acids in their active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ha et al., 2000</xref>), which provide a favorable electrostatic environment and strict substrate specificity for the hydrolysis of positively charged Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate but not Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free phytate, due to electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged phytate and negatively charged amino acids of the active sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Therefore, we propose that humans and other monogastric animals may lack β-propeller phytases that hydrolyze Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate in the gut, as high-phytate/high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets could not be hydrolyzed (indigestible) in the guts of the rats and, eventually, most Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate was excreted in the feces.</p><p>Further, the potential toxicity of excess phosphate in the context of mineral bone disorders (MBD) associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vervloet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ketteler et al., 2017</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phosphate crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuro-o, 2013</xref>), together with our present findings, indicate that a HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet can be particularly harmful to patients suffering from these conditions. Moreover, dietary phosphate overload can cause tubular damage, hypophosphatemia, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phosphate crystals; and phosphate overloading never causes persistent hyperphosphatemia unless renal function is critically impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haut et al., 1980</xref>). Thus, our study emphasizes that a detailed understanding of the dietary effects and properties of phytate may provide a new opportunity to reduce intestinal phosphate overload and to benefit patients with CKD, mineral bone disease, or crystal nephropathies.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support our findings that phytate is digestible in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or divalent minerals. First, studies of rats fed <sup>14</sup>C-labeled phytate show that approximately 94% of phytate is absorbed when Ca<sup>2+</sup> intake is low, whereas 54% of phytate is excreted in the feces when Ca<sup>2+</sup> intake is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nahapetian and Young, 1980</xref>), suggesting that phytate absorption is modulated or inhibited by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Second, another study of rats fed <sup>3</sup>H-inositol phytate shows that 78% of phytate is absorbed and 14% is excreted in the feces. Further, most of the radioactivity represents <italic>myo</italic>-inositol or <italic>myo</italic>-inositol monophosphate in the plasma or urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sakamoto et al., 1993</xref>), suggesting the phytate is digestible in vivo. The biased belief that phytate is indigestible led the authors of the above two studies to conclude that intact phytate is absorbed through the upper intestine, hydrolyzed within mucosal cells before entry into the blood, and then released as <italic>myo</italic>-inositol and phosphate into the blood or urine.</p><p>Subsequently, investigators who assumed that phytate is absorbed and can be detected in the blood or urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grases et al., 2000</xref>) were unable to detect phytate in serum or urine despite using a highly specific and sensitive mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Letcher et al., 2008</xref>). These studies support the conclusion that phosphate or <italic><underline>myo</underline></italic>-inositol generated by the hydrolysis of phytate is absorbed rather than phytate, which is unabsorbable. Numerous explanations account for the impermeability of intestinal membranes to phytate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reddy and Sathe, 2002</xref>). Phytate possesses six phosphate groups with strong negative charges at physiological pH, which suggests that phytate cannot cross the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane without a specific receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>). In support of this possibility, we found that phytate is only engulfed by hepatic Kupffer cells and tissue macrophages in vivo when we intravenously injected iron-containing phytate particles into live mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that phytate cannot penetrate membranes of epithelial cells in the intestine. Together, these findings suggest that phytate is not absorbed in the intestine and that only products generated through the hydrolysis of phytate, phosphate, or <italic>myo</italic>-inositol can be absorbed in the intestine of rats fed phytate-containing low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that phytate can act as a dual demon in healthy normal rats by adversely affecting Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate homeostasis through inhibition of intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> absorption while increasing intestinal phosphate overload, depending on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> content of diets. This may explain why rats fed the HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet exhibited high levels of PTH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, as well as low levels of FGF23 and αKlotho. Moreover, our findings are consistent with data from a large population-based study of subjects with preserved renal function without CKD, which showed that PTH levels increase earlier than FGF23 levels as kidney function decreases and that high FGF23 levels are more closely associated with low levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D than with excessive renal phosphate wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dhayat et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that high levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D may suppress the expression of calvarial FGF23 in rats fed the HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet, in accordance with an earlier study showing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> deficiency is highly associated with low levels of FGF23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rodriguez-Ortiz et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> deficiency increases the levels of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, which leads to low levels of FGF23 in Ca<sup>2+-</sup>deficiency states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clements et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>However, previous studies that investigated the effects of phytate on kidney stones in rats report conflicting results, which we ascribe to differences in dietary compositions, particularly to the ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/phytate and analytical laboratory methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grases et al., 2000</xref>). Specifically, the AIN-76A purified rodent diet containing 1% phytate prevents the development of kidney stones compared with the AIN-76A controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grases et al., 2000</xref>). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grases et al. (2000)</xref> concluded that rats fed the AIN-76A diet developed mineral deposits at the corticomedulary junction from Alizarin Red S staining, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lien et al. (2001)</xref> did not find an increased incidence or severity of renal tubular mineralization in rats fed the AIN-76A or AIN-93G diet. Consistent with this, we found that rats fed the AIN-93G control diet did not have nephrocalcinosis. Moreover, we found that an AIN-93G-based HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup> diet induced biochemical and urinary abnormalities associated with kidney disease as well as histopathological defects in the kidney. Phytate in the AIN-96-G diet caused a dramatic time- and concentration-dependent increase in PTH levels, leading to PTH-induced impairment of the renal reabsorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate, and predisposed rats to the development of hypophosphatemic rickets and nephrocalcinosis.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate here that a high-phytate low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet is a risk factor for nephrocalcinosis, renal inflammation, and fibrosis as well as renal phosphate wasting disorders and bone loss in rats. Our studies provide an animal model for studying the pathogenesis of crystal nephropathies and bone loss associated with renal phosphate wasting, and further suggest that the restriction of phytate intake may reduce the risks of developing crystal nephropathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Three-week-old male (60–70 g) and female (50–55 g) Sprague–Dawley rats (Orient Bio, Seoul, Korea) were housed three per cage in a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle with ambient temperature maintained at 22 ± 2°C. The rats were fed AIN-93G (Dyets Inc, Bethlehem, PA, USA) for a 1 week adaptation period and were randomly assigned to control AIN-93G (0% phytate), AIN-93G with 1%, 3%, or 5% sodium phytate (P-8810, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or AIN-93G with 3% sodium phytate with an additional 0.5% Ca<sup>2+</sup> (n = 6–12 per group) diet for 12 weeks. All diets had equivalent percentages of carbohydrate, protein, fat, and minerals. Pathogen-free water and food were available ad libitum.

Tail vein blood samples were stored at 4°C for 10–20 min and serum was frozen at −80°C. At the end of the experiment, the rats were fasted for 14–16 hr before receiving isoflurane. Abdominal aorta blood was obtained, and urine was collected over 24 hr. The kidneys and femora were dissected and stored at −80°C. Serum biochemical analysis was performed (Model AU-480; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Rat intact PTH (Immutopics, San Clemente, CA, USA), human intact PTH (Abcam), soluble RANKL (Immundiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany), osteoprotegerin (Alpco Immunoassay, Salem, NH, USA), rat intact and C-terminal FGF23 (Elabscience, Houston, TX, USA), and human intact FGF23 (Elabscience) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum levels of 25-OH Vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D were determined by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) and radioimmunoassay (DIAsource, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), respectively, in the biochemistry laboratory at Green Cross Labcell (Yongin, Korea). According to the manufacturers, the antibodies for 25-OH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D have cross-reactivity for vitamin D2 and D3 forms of 25-OH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D, respectively. In our assay, the serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D are the sum of both vitamin D2 and D3 levels. Creatinine clearance (Cl) was calculated as Cl (ml/min) = (urine [creatinine]×urine vol×body wt)/(serum [creatinine]×24 × 60).

Cells were cultured in 24-well plates (1 × 10<sup>5</sup>/ well) with 30 ng/mL of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 72 hr. Differentiation of M-CSF-dependent bone marrow osteoclast precursors was induced with 30 ng/mL receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and 30 ng/mL M-CSF for 4 days. Differentiated osteoclasts with more than three nuclei were identified as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive (Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase Assay, Sigma).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title><p>The primary antibodies used for Western blotting or immunohistochemistry were monoclonal β-actin (AC-15, 1:1000; Santa Cruz), FGF23 (bs-5768R, 1:200; Bioss), αKlotho (NBP1-76511, 1:500; Novus Biologicals), NHERF1 (A-7, 1:200; Santa Cruz), NaPi-2a (ab182099, 1:500; Abcam), and NaPi-2a (ab151129, 1:500; Abcam), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2017</xref>).

All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was registered with Clinical Research Information Service (registration number KCT0003144) in accordance with the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of phytate intake on mineral metabolism in humans between January and February 2015. All participants provided written informed consent. In total, six premenopausal women aged between 23 and 34 years with a body mass index between 17.7 and 25.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited. The exclusion criteria were as follows: bone and mineral metabolism disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, osteomalacia); previous surgical history which could affect bone and mineral metabolism (e.g., parathyroidectomy, thyroidectomy, and gastrectomy); use of any medication that could affect bone and mineral metabolism (e.g., estrogen, bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and calcitonin); use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and vitamin D supplementation within the past 3 months; use of corticosteroids within the past 1 month; acute or chronic renal failure; exhibited abnormal liver function; or people who were pregnant or lactating. All participants completed a 12-day trial consisting of three successive diet cycles containing: (1) polished rice (low phytate content, 0.35%); (2) brown rice (medium phytate content, 1.07%); and (3) brown rice mixed with rice bran (high phytate content, 2.17%). Each diet cycle lasted for 4 days. During each day of the study, all participants were provided with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. Every meal was packed in a lunch box and delivered each day, and participants were not allowed to consume any other food during the trial except for the food provided by study investigators. All meals were identical across the three diet cycles except for the phytate content. Water consumption was allowed ad libitum. No medications or supplements that affected mineral metabolism were allowed during the course of the study. A blood sample was collected from each participant at the beginning of the trial and at the end of each diet cycle. Urine samples of 24 hr were collected before the trial and during the fourth day of each diet cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Microbiota analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen stool samples using the QIAamp fast DNA stool kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of 16S rRNA gene expression of each bacterial phylum were quantified using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) on a CFX Connect real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample sizes for all experiments were based on preliminary results and previous experience of conducting related experiments. Power calculations were not used to determine sample sizes. Animals for each group of experiments were randomly assigned. No animals were excluded from statistical analysis, and investigators were blinded to the study condition when scoring histopathological samples. Unless noted otherwise, all data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons of groups were performed by either unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison test. All data were subjected to D’Agostino and Pearson (n &gt; 8) or Shapiro–Wilk (n &lt; 8) normality test before analysis. Those groups that failed the normality test (p&lt;0.05) were subjected to an outlier test (ROUT; Q = 1%), as recommended to determine whether the outlier was responsible for the failure of the normality test. If the exclusion of outliers led to passing the normality test and altered the statistical results, the exclusion was made; if it did not alter the statistical outcome, no data were excluded from that group. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for non-parametric statistical analysis of data that did not have a normal distribution. We performed data analysis and prepared graphs using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr S Dhe-Paganon and S Shoelson at Harvard Medical School for their valuable suggestions regarding the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Resources, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial registration A noncomparative pilot study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital (IRB No. 2014-117).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The paper defines mechanistically, using young growing rats, the dietary profile (high phytate and low calcium content) that promotes intestinal phosphate overload and phytate-induced renal and bone disease. This dietary composition induces reductions in bone mass, osteoclastogenesis, phosphate wasting, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and nephrocalcinosis. The high dietary phytate effects are counteracted with high calcium intake. In a small 12-day human pilot study of 6 premenopausal women, the authors noted decreases in serum phosphate and urinary calcium levels with progressive increases in dietary phytate. Overall, the study has translational implications for nutritional rickets and osteomalacia; for growing children and adolescents consuming diets high in phytate (cereal-based foods) and low in calcium; and for individuals with kidney and metabolic bone diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;High-phytate/low-calcium diet is a risk factor for crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript is considered potentially acceptable, but there are some issues that need to be addressed before final acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>It would be important to clarify Figure 1 legends and the statistical results which are somewhat confusing.</p><p>Please discuss the rationale for using 3 week rats and the differences by sex which seem somewhat unusual.</p><p>Clarify the methods and measurements of the vitamin D metabolite.</p><p>Are there other measures of renal function such as inulin clearance?</p><p>These responses should be relative straightforward as noted below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Kim et al. conduct in their article &quot;High-phytate/low-calcium diet is a risk factor for crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate 1 wasting, and bone loss&quot; a careful analysis of diets with different phytate and calcium contents on renal function and mineral and bone metabolism. They translate their findings in rats to humans. However, the interpretation of their data would benefit from some clarification: they need to separate bioaccessibility from bioavailability of calcium and phosphate. The former is measured with the ratio of soluble vs. insoluble calcium and phosphate in the feces, the latter is reflected by uptake of radioactive Ca and Pi tracers, which in part reflects earlier work of the authors. Their findings are not novel per se, but they present nice studies to evaluate the mechanism of how calcium supplements affect bioaccessibility and bioavailability of phytate-phosphate, which would benefit from conceptually separating luminal and blood/extracellular compartments when discussing effects of Ca and Pi on renal function and mineral and bone metabolism. I am not sure, whether I would arrive at the same conclusion: could it be that phytate is cleaved in the gut and free phosphate reduces bioaccessibility and thereby bioavailability of calcium? Resulting hypocalcemia could explain secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss and phosphaturia, which in turn causes nephrocalcinosis.

We have described the statistical methods in the Materials and methods section in the revised manuscript as follows: “All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons of groups were performed by either unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparison test. All data were subjected to D’Agostino and Pearson (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 8) or Shapiro–Wilk (<italic>n</italic> &lt; 8) normality test before analysis. Those groups that failed the normality test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) were subjected to an outlier test (ROUT; Q = 1%), as recommended to determine whether the outlier was responsible for the failure of the normality test. If the exclusion of outliers led to passing the normality test and altered the statistical results, the exclusion was made; if it did not alter the statistical outcome, no data were excluded from that group. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for non-parametric statistical analysis of data that did not have a normal distribution.”</p><p>Accordingly, the statistical significance has been corrected in Figure 1G, H and L, Figure 2B, C and H, Figure 3C, Figure 6A, B and C, as well as Figure 1–figure supplement 1E, Figure 1—figure supplement 2D, E, and F), and Figure 5—figure supplement 3A in the revised manuscript. In Figure 1L, One sample of 3% phytate in male rats was out of range according to ROUT (Q = 1%) but it did not alter the statistical outcome and no data were excluded from that group. The type of statistical test used for the analysis in each graph has been stated in the corresponding figure legend. A detailed description of the group comparison statistical test has been added to the Materials and methods section.</p><p>For a better description of the data, we elaborated on the experimental design in Figure 1A and molar ratio of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to phytate in Figure 1A as follows:</p><p>“(A) Experimental design. After a 1-week period of adaptation with control AIN93G diet, we fed 4-week-old male and female Sprague–Dawley rats with AIN-93G diets supplemented with 0% (control), 1%, 3%, or 5% phytate for 12 weeks.

Four weeks of age is an appropriate time to start a diet-based study. Although longitudinal growth ceases, the rats maintain growth plates for life, and Roach (Roach et al.) reported that it was appropriate to start a study at weaning to examine the effects of diet on bone in a rat model.</p><p>We hypothesized that a high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet is more harmful to young rats that are growing actively because a higher Ca<sup>2+</sup> content is required for bone mass accrual and the growing skeleton. Therefore, we used 4-week-old rats in these experiments. We think that our results might be translated to humans in that a high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet could have a greater effect on children and adolescents than adults.</p><p>As the reviewer noted, it is well known that there are sex-related differences in bone metabolism in rats and humans (Czerniak, 2001; Yan et al., 2002), although the reason for these differences has not been elucidated. In our experiments, female rats were slightly more likely to develop nephrocalcinosis, but the sex-related differences in the effects of the phytate diets on bone metabolism were not significant. Currently, we cannot explain the greater sensitivity of female rats, and further research is needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarify the methods and measurements of the vitamin D metabolite.</p></disp-quote><p>The serum levels of 25-OH Vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D were determined by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) and radioimmunoassay (DIAsource, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium), respectively. According to the manufacturers, the antibodies for 25-OH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D have cross-reactivity for vitamin D2 and D3 forms of 25-OH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D, respectively. In our assay, the serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D are the sum of both vitamin D2 and D3 levels. Therefore, we corrected the names of vitamin D metabolites as 25-(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in the revised manuscript.

[…] Addition of extra calcium to the diet prevents secondary hyperparathyroidism and other consequences.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and high-phytate/high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets. In the high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets, the majority of phytate might exist as a form of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free phytate and the amount would increase with the percentage of phytate in diets with the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> content.</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free phytate is hydrolyzed to inositol phosphate and free phosphate in the gut (increased bioaccessibility), which may result in increased absorption of phosphate into the blood (increased bioavailability) and cause renal phosphate wasting (hyperphosphaturia). Most Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets complexed with phytate to form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate, and the amount of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> decreased gradually with the increment in phytates in the diet, reducing the bioaccessibility of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This, in turn, could result in a decrement in the absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the blood (decreased bioavailability), contributing to the development of hypocalcemia, resulting in hypocalcemia, as the reviewer commented. The hypophosphatemia combined with the high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet could explain the secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss, and phosphaturia, which in turn causes nephrocalcinosis.</p><p>By adding extra calcium to the high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet (giving the high-phytate/high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet), the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> could increase the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate and decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup> free-phytate. This might decrease the absorption of phosphate. Under these conditions, the amount of fecal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate should increase, as shown by the ICP-MS results for fecal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate and the fecal phytate content determined by HPIC. The increased amount of calcium could also increase the amounts of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate complex. Therefore, we postulated that the deleterious effects of a high phytate diet could be reduced by adding extra calcium to the diet.</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have described this in the Discussion as follows: “The resulting hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia caused by the high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet could explain the secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss and phosphaturia, which in turn causes nephrocalcinosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Kim et al. present in well-written manuscript extensive data indicating that a high-phytate/low-calcium diet leads to nephrocalcinosis, hyperparathyroidism induced by reduced calcium absorption leading to hypocalcemia.

That is, the only difference among the diets was the composition of rice provided; white rice, brown rice or brown rice with rice bran. We calculated the composition of the diets with an expert on clinical nutrition before the clinical study. The nutrient contents in terms of total energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, and micronutrients were analyzed using the software CAN-Pro 5.0 (Computer-Aided Nutritional analysis program, version 5; The Korea Nutrition Society, 2015), and the calculated compositions of the nutrients were not different.

However, rats fed the high-phytate diets showed a reduction in fat-free lean mass, mainly muscle mass. At present, we cannot explain the exact mechanism for the reduction of muscle mass in rats fed the high-phytate diets. One possible mechanism is increased muscle catabolism in rats fed the high-phytate diets, which is supporting by the high blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and a high BUN/Cr ratio as BUN is a serum byproduct/waste product of protein metabolism (Haines et al., 2019). A reduced bioavailable amino acid pool for muscle protein synthesis could be another potential mechanism because phytate is a well-known inhibitor of digestive enzymes, such as proteases. But the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated yet.</p><p>We briefly discussed this issue in the Results section in the revised manuscript as follows: “Elevated BUN/Cr ratio may provide a biochemical signature of increased muscle catabolism associated with decreased fat-free lean mass in rats fed a high-phytate diet (Haines et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3 – why did the bone assessment was done only 0 vs. 5% phytate diets?

As shown in Figure 3A, phytate-fed rats had significantly decreased bone mineral density in a phytate dose-dependent manner compared with the controls. Based on these results, we compared the bone assessments shown in Figure 3 in the 5% phytate diet and control in both male and female rats. This demonstrated that both sexes were affected. Next, we performed bone histomorphology (e.g., TRAP staining of bone sections and BMC TRAP staining) and measured the serum RANKL levels in female rats because the difference was more evident in female rats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4 (figure and text)- why were only females studied? what was the overall diet composition? why were feces not collected to see phytate excretion?

We also performed immunohistochemical analysis for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporter (TRPV6), phosphate channel (NaPi-2b), and multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1), a potential histidine phytase, using formalin-fixed intestinal tissue from rats fed control, HP-LCa<sup>2+</sup>, and HP-HCa<sup>2+</sup> diets. To further address the reviewer’s questions regarding the changes in digestibility of phytate, we examined recent reports and several biological databases for information on intestinal or microbial phytases.

As shown in Figure 5E and G, rats fed a high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet showed a marked increase in the 24-hour urinary Pi/Cr ratio compared to controls, suggesting that rats fed high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets excrete large amounts of phosphates in the urine. These results suggested that ~10 – 30-fold higher excretion of total urinary phosphate may slightly acidify the urinary pH in rats fed high-phytate/low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diets (pH 7.0 vs. pH 5.8).
