of DNA in the bloodstream as biomarkers. While it is thought that cfDNA is largely released by dying cells, the proportion of dying cells' DNA that reaches the bloodstream is unknown. Here, we integrate estimates of cellular turnover rates to calculate the expected amount of cfDNA. By comparing this to the actual amount of cell type-specific cfDNA, we estimate the proportion of DNA reaching plasma as cfDNA. We demonstrate that &lt;10% of the DNA from dying cells is detectable in plasma, and the ratios of measured to expected cfDNA levels vary a thousand-fold among cell types, often reaching well below 0.1%. The analysis suggests that local clearance, presumably via phagocytosis, takes up most of the dying cells' DNA. Insights into the underlying mechanism may help to understand the physiological significance of cfDNA and improve the sensitivity of liquid biopsies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cfDNA</kwd><kwd>cellular turnover</kwd><kwd>liquid biopsy</kwd><kwd>clearance mechanisms</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schwartz-Reisman collaborative science program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Yotam project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mary and Tom Beck Canadian Center for Alternative Energy Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ulman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milo</surname><given-names>Ron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

Apoptosis is the primary mechanism of cell death in tissues with rapid turnover, in which cells are disposed of orderly and engulfed by phagocytic cells to recycle their resources.</p><p>Apoptosis involves the fragmentation of DNA through two distinct mechanisms. The first mechanism occurs within the apoptotic cell, where endonucleases break down chromatin into nucleosomal units. The second mechanism is carried out by phagocytic cells, which engulf and degrade the DNA of apoptotic cells in order to prevent the release of potentially immunogenic intracellular materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagata, 2005</xref>).</p><p>It has been known since the late 1940s that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments can be found in the circulation of healthy and diseased individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mandel and Metais, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bendich et al., 1965</xref>). The fragments are typically nucleosome-size (165 base pairs), likely representing molecules that were not completely degraded during the process of cell death. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), cfDNA has become a clinically useful biomarker for various applications. These include non-invasive prenatal testing (via detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities via sampling of maternal cfDNA), cancer monitoring (via detection of oncogenic mutations in plasma, termed circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA]), and monitoring of allogeneic organ transplants (via detection of donor-derived SNPs in cfDNA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heitzer et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps, the greatest promise of cfDNA is in cancer diagnostics â a blood test that can allow early detection at an actionable stage, real-time assessment of treatment response, detection of recurrence, and identification of specific genetic mutations to inform treatment decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jamshidi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of somatic mutations, the mere presence of cfDNA from a given tissue is of great value as it often correlates with tissue-specific injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lehmann-Werman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gala-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lehmann-Werman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zemmour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heitzer et al., 2020</xref>). Multiple layers of epigenetic information allow the inference of the tissue origins of cfDNA. For example, the size, fragmentation patterns, and exact end position of cfDNA fragments, nucleosome positions reflected in the relative abundance of promoter sequences, and histone modification patterns all allow tracing cfDNA molecules to their tissue origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oberhofer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lo et al., 2021</xref>). One particularly sensitive approach is using DNA methylation patterns, a stable determinant of cell identity preserved on cfDNA. Deconvolution of cfDNA methylomes using a reference atlas of human cell-type-specific methylomes has revealed various tissues' relative and absolute contribution to cfDNA in health and disease. Under baseline conditions, over 90% of cfDNA originates in blood cells (neutrophils, megakaryocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and erythroblasts), with vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes being the only solid tissue source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>). In both homeostatic and pathologic conditions, the exact mechanism by which cfDNA is released is not fully understood but is thought to involve cell death. Whether cfDNA can be released from cells that remain alive after the event is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stroun et al., 2001</xref>). Two striking examples of such a scenario are megakaryocytes and erythroblasts, whose physiological function is to release anuclear cells, namely platelets and erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moss et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>From a practical perspective, the amount of cfDNA (typically ~1000 genome equivalents per ml of plasma) is a major barrier to a sensitive diagnosis of diseases â particularly cancer â at an early stage. Beyond maximization of the volume of blood drawn and the number of markers tested in parallel, understanding and eventually manipulating the local release and systemic clearance of cfDNA hold great potential for improving the sensitivity of tests. For example, recent studies have suggested pharmacologic approaches for blocking the removal of cfDNA from the systemic circulation, leading to a transient elevation in cfDNA concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tabrizi et al., 2023</xref>). The efficiency and determinants of local cfDNA release to circulation have not been examined.</p><p>In this study, we use recent estimates of cellular turnover rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>) to calculate the expected amount of DNA resulting from cell death from each cell type at a given time. By comparing this to the amount of cell type-specific cfDNA present in the plasma, taking into account estimates of systemic cfDNA clearance rate, we estimate the fraction of DNA that reaches the plasma as cfDNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Based on atlases of human cell-type-specific methylation signatures, Moss et al. and Loyfer et al. analyzed the main cell types contributing to plasma cfDNA. They found the primary sources of plasma cfDNA to be blood cells: granulocytes, megakaryocytes, macrophages, and/or monocytes (the signature could not differentiate between the last two), lymphocytes, and erythrocyte progenitors. Other cells that had detectable contributions are endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Qualitatively, these cells represent most of the leading cell types in cellular turnover, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>. Epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, kidney, bladder, and skin are other cell types that significantly contribute to cellular turnover. Dying cells in these tissues are shed into the gut lumen, the air spaces, the urine, or out of the skin (note that while DNA from gut, lung, and kidney epithelial cells can be found in stool, bronchoalveolar lavage, and urine, the fate of DNA from skin cells is not known). This arrangement may explain why DNA from these cell types is not represented in plasma cfDNA in healthy conditions. Therefore, it appears that cells with high cfDNA plasma levels are those with relatively high turnover that are not being shed out of the body.</p><p>We used the cellular turnover estimates of these cell types to calculate the potential amount of DNA discarded from each cell type. We derived the potential levels of cfDNA in the plasma (see Materials and methods). By comparing this data to the measured levels of cfDNA in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>), we could calculate the fraction of potential DNA presented as cfDNA in the plasma, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The results indicate that less than 4% of the DNA of dying cells reaches the plasma. The ratios of measured to expected cfDNA levels vary a thousand-fold, ranging from 1:30 (megakaryocytes and endothelial cells) to 1:3x10<sup>4</sup> (erythrocyte progenitors).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>cfDNA as a fraction of homeostatic cell turnover.</title><p>Estimates for the DNA flux from homoeostatic cell turnover were made based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref> and converted to units of potential cfDNA plasma concentration (see Methods). Cell types are ordered by their estimated cellular turnover. Empty markers represent cell types being shed out of the body upon turnover. Observed levels of cfDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>) are shown for cell types found in the plasma, with labels depicting the ratio between potential and measured cfDNA concentrations. Circles, potential representation in cfDNA; diamonds, observed concentration of cfDNA. The assayâs detection limit is presented by a gradient (from around ten genome equivalents for deconvolution assay to around one genome equivalent for targeted assays). Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval of the uncertainty, approximated by a lognormal distribution (see Materials and methods).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89321-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In general, around 1000 genome equivalents of cfDNA are found in the plasma in healthy individuals. The limit for detection of a cell type of specific origin depends on the assay in use. General essays using deconvolution have a sensitivity of around 1%, for example, ~10 genome equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>). Targeted essays using markers for a specific cell type at a deep coverage can improve the sensitivity to around 0.1%, for example ~1, genome equivalent. The gradient in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> depicts this range of sensitivities. The low ratios of measured to potential cfDNA described for the mentioned cell types indicate that cells with lower cellular turnover, such as skeletal myocytes, adipocytes, and pancreatic beta cells, are not being detected in the plasma of healthy individuals because their plasma levels are lower than the sensitivities of existing essays. Notably, a comparison of potential cfDNA plasma levels of breast epithelial cells in healthy women to the limit of detection reveals the breast as an outlier. This might suggest that dying breast epithelial cells' local DNA utilization mechanism is extremely efficient.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report a surprising, dramatic discrepancy between the measured levels of cfDNA in the plasma and the potential DNA flux from dying cells. One hypothetical explanation for that discrepancy is the limited sensitivity of typical cfDNA assays to short DNA fragments, which may contribute a significant fraction of the overall cfDNA mass. Regular cfDNA analysis shows a size distribution concentrated around a length of 165 base pairs (bp). The sizes in ctDNA vary more, but most are longer than 100 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcaide et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Udomruk et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies suggested a significant fraction of single-strand ultrashort fragments (length of 25â60 bp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hisano et al., 2021</xref>). However, the total amount of DNA contained in these fragments is less than or comparable to that of the longer âregularâ nucleosome-protected cfDNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hisano et al., 2021</xref>), arguing against ultrashort fragments as a dominant explanation for the âmissingâ cfDNA material. We integrated the estimate provided by Hisano et al. into our analysis as a modifying factor for both the total concentration and uncertainty of plasma cfDNA. Importantly, this incorporation did not alter the overall conclusions, as the discrepancy between the cfDNA plasma concentration and potential DNA flux remains on the same order of magnitude. We note that we cannot exclude the presence of abundant DNA fragments that are even shorter (e.g. 10 bp long) and are not measurable in cfDNA analysis. Thus, our formal conclusion is that only a small fraction of the DNA of dying cells appears as measurable cfDNA.</p><p>An alternative hypothetical explanation is that most DNA of dying enters the bloodstream but is rapidly degraded or taken up. Accounting for the tissue-specific DNA concentration found in the blood, we can estimate the half-life of cfDNA in the bloodstream in that case, based on the cellular turnover rate. This calculation suggests that the half-life of cfDNA in the bloodstream should be only a few seconds to a few minutes. However, previous research using various methods (mostly the decay of fetal cfDNA in maternal plasma after birth) has shown that the half-life of DNA in the bloodstream ranges from 15 to 120 min, orders of magnitude higher than this estimate suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diehl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">To et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, a systemic clearance mechanism cannot explain the differential representation of cfDNA from different cell types relative to their turnover rate.</p><p>Therefore, the low fraction of DNA measured as cfDNA suggests that less than a few percent of the DNA from dying cells reaches the bloodstream. An unknown mechanism utilizes the rest with a tissue-specific efficiency. A potential explanation is that tissue-resident phagocytes are degrading the DNA after apoptosis, similar to what has been shown for extruded erythroblast nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2005</xref>). Studies in mice have revealed that lysosomal DNases in macrophages play a role in cleaving chromosomal DNA during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McIlroy et al., 2000</xref>), as well as the degradation of erythroid nuclei in erythroblastic islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoshida et al., 2005</xref>). The first DNA fragmentation occurs within the apoptotic cells, resulting in nucleosomal unit multiples of about 180 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matassov et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, up to 200 bp cfDNA fragments in plasma may indicate that phagocytes have not further degraded these fragments.</p><p>Our current analysis focused on estimating plasma cfDNA concentration and cellular turnover in a cohort of healthy, relatively young individuals. The total plasma cfDNA concentrations were sourced from healthy individuals below 47 years, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meddeb et al., 2019</xref>. We use data analyzed based on plasma samples from healthy individuals to estimate the proportion of cfDNA originating from specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>). These values were then compared to the potential DNA flux resulting from homeostatic cellular turnover, estimated for reference healthy males aged between 20 and 30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>). In our analysis, we considered various sources of uncertainty, including inter-individual variation, variability in the timing of sample collection, and analytical precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Madsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meddeb et al., 2019</xref>). These factors collectively contributed to an uncertainty factor of less than 3. Importantly, this level of uncertainty does not alter our conclusion regarding the relatively small fraction of DNA present in plasma as cfDNA. Furthermore, we acknowledge that age and sex can impact total cfDNA concentration, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meddeb et al., 2019</xref>, with potential variations of up to 30%. However, as the results of our analysis present a much larger difference, these effects do not change the conclusions drawn from our analysis. Nevertheless, age and health status may influence the proportion of cfDNA originating from specific cell types and their corresponding cellular turnover rates. Consequently, the ratios themselves may vary in the elderly population or individuals with underlying health conditions.</p><p>A comparison between the different types of cells shows a trend in which less DNA flux from cells with higher turnover gets to the bloodstream. In particular, a tiny fraction (1 in 3x10<sup>4</sup>) of DNA from erythroid progenitors arrives at the plasma, indicating an extreme efficiency of the DNA recovery mechanism. Erythroid progenitors are arranged in erythroblastic islands. Up to a few tens of erythroid progenitors surround a single macrophage that collects the nuclei extruded during the erythrocyte maturation process (pyrenocytes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chasis and Mohandas, 2008</xref>). The amount of DNA discarded through the maturation of over 200 billion erythrocytes per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>) exceeds all other sources of homeostatic discarded DNA. Our findings indicate that the organization of dedicated erythroblastic islands functions highly efficiently regarding DNA utilization. Neutrophils are another high-turnover cell type with a low level of cfDNA. When contemplating the process of NETosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vorobjeva and Chernyak, 2020</xref>), the existence of cfDNA originating from live neutrophils would potentially diminish the concentration of cfDNA released by dying neutrophils, thereby amplifying the observed ratio for this particular cell type. The overall trend of higher turnover resulting in a lower cfDNA to DNA flux ratio may indicate similar design principles, in which the utilization of DNA is better in tissues with higher turnover. However, our analysis is limited to only several cell types (due to cfDNA test and deconvolution sensitivities), and extrapolation to cells with lower cell turnover is problematic.</p><p>A thorough explanation for the gap between the estimated DNA flux from dying cells and the measured cfDNA data requires more research. Since macrophages play a prominent role in the phagocytosis of dying cells, we hypothesize that the local uptake of cfDNA by activated macrophages is responsible for the uptake of most DNA from dying cells. An interesting implication of this possibility is that cfDNA levels are expected to be highly sensitive to perturbations in the local clearance mechanism. In other words, elevated levels of cfDNA from a given cell type may represent a disruption of local macrophages rather than an actual increase in the rate of cell death.</p><p>Comparing the DNA flux involved in the homeostatic cellular turnover of specific cell types to the sensitivity of cfDNA essays reveals some current limitations in the field. Cell types such as adipocytes, cardiomyocytes, and pancreatic beta cells are not represented in the cfDNA of healthy individuals. Our analysis suggests that current essays need to be more sensitive to identify the minute amount of those. Moreover, the quantitative analysis can predict potential cell types with a non-neglectable contribution to the plasma cfDNA and allow their focused study. The current analysis calls for a focus on breast epithelial cells and myocytes, as their potential cfDNA levels are relatively higher than the detection limit. Previous research regarding their contribution to cfDNA has used highly sensitive essays but found no contribution in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>). This might indicate a highly effective mechanism for the utilization of DNA from dying cells, for example, local degradation of myonuclei within the syncytium of skeletal muscle fibers.</p><p>Quantitative characterization of the abundance of macrophages concerning the cellular death rate in different tissues could improve our understanding of the DNA clearance mechanism and the role of phagocytes.</p><p>Illuminating the discrepancy between the dying cells' DNA flux and the measured cfDNA levels may open the door for research with clinical potential. The sensitivity of the assays and the amount of available DNA limit the utility of liquid biopsy, particularly in early disease detection. Better characterization of the mechanism that limits available plasma cfDNA could lead to potential interventions that increase the fraction of DNA flux arriving at the plasma and thus improve the sensitivity of liquid biopsies based on cfDNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cellular turnover</title><p>Normal cellular turnover data for all cell types except hepatocytes and megakaryocytes were obtained from estimates provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sender and Milo, 2021</xref>. We estimated the cellular turnover of megakaryocytes in two ways. First, based on the number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Harrison, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noetzli et al., 2019</xref>) and a maturation time of around five days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Machlus and Italiano, 2013</xref>).

To complement this, we integrated our total concentration estimates with data on the proportion of cfDNA originating from specific cell types, leveraging a plasma methylome deconvolution method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loyfer et al., 2023</xref>, which did not provide absolute quantities of cfDNA.</p><p>The overall plasma cfDNA concentration was multiplied by a factor of 1.5 to accommodate for the presence of small fragments of approximately 50 base pairs of cfDNA in the plasma. These fragments are suggested to contribute comparable molar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hisano et al., 2021</xref>). Despite having approximately one-third of the mass, it is reasonable to presume that these fragments represent a similar number of genomes. This assumption is based on the idea that their source is a broken nucleosome unit, and the fragments represent the portion that was not degraded. Given the restricted data and its interpretation, we consider factors spanning the range of 1 (negligible effect) and 2 (doubling of the amount). The chosen factor, 1.5, is selected as the midpoint within this range of uncertainty.</p><p>To quantify the uncertainty associated with our cfDNA concentration estimates, we employed a methodology that considered several sources of variation. First, we incorporated the confidence interval of the median concentration reported by Meddeb et al. as a measure of uncertainty. Additionally, we accounted for individual-specific and analytic variations based on the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Madsen et al., 2019</xref>, encompassing factors such as the precise timing of measurements and assay precision. These sources of uncertainty were combined using the approach outlined below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Estimation of the potential DNA flux</title><p>We estimated the potential cfDNA plasma levels if all the DNA from the dying cells had reached the bloodstream.

In several cases, such as the half-life of plasma cfDNA, the valueâs uncertainty was big and best described as a multiplication factor of error (i.e. the uncertainty of a variable with lognormal distribution). To facilitate error propagation, we transformed all values and corresponding errors to be expressed in terms of multiplication error by fitting a lognormal distribution. Thus, we modeled the uncertainty around the median value as a log-normally distributed random variable <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> with a with a shape parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is the multiplication error factor.

This is of great interest to the community, as the amount of DNA from a certain tissue (for example, a tumor) that becomes available for detection in the blood has important implications for disease detection.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The question asked by the authors has potentially important implications for disease diagnosis. Understanding how genomic DNA degrades in the human circulation can guide towards ways to enrich for DNA of interest or may lead to unexpected methods of conserving cell-free DNA. Thus, the question &quot;how much genomic DNA becomes cfDNA&quot; is of great interest to the scientific and medical community.

Understanding how genomic DNA degrades in the human circulation can guide towards ways to enrich for DNA of interest or may lead to unexpected methods of conserving cell-free DNA.

In response to the feedback, we have updated the analysis to address all critical points as described below and revised the text to enhance the clarity of our methodology. One notable improvement to our analysis involved ensuring better alignment between the cohort data for cfDNA plasma concentration and cell turnover estimates. To achieve this, we utilized the total plasma concentration of cfDNA from a study conducted by Meddeb et al. 2019, taking into account the influence of age and sex on these concentrations and specifically focusing on a cohort of relatively young and healthy individuals. Additionally, we considered expected variations related to sex, age, and other pertinent factors, as outlined in the studies by Meddeb et al. 2019 and Madsen et al. 2019.</p><p>In addition, we have addressed concerns regarding the technical aspects of cfDNA analysis, providing detailed explanations of their limited impact on our analysis and the resulting conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are short DNA fragments released into the circulation when cells die. Plasma cfDNA level is thought to reflect the degree of cell-death or tissue injury. Indeed, plasma cfDNA is a reliable diagnostic biomarker for multiple diseases, providing insights into disease severity and outcomes. In this manuscript, Dr. Sender and colleagues address a fundamental question: What fraction of DNA released from cell death is detectable as plasma cfDNA? The authors use public data to estimate the amount of DNA produced from dying cells. They also utilize public data to estimate plasma cfDNA levels. Their calculations showed that &lt;10% of DNA released is detectable as plasma cfDNA, the fraction of detectable cfDNA varying by tissue sources. The study demonstrates new and fundamental principles that could improve disease diagnosis and treatment via cfDNA.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. The experimental approach is resource-mindful taking advantage of publicly available data to estimate the fraction of detectable cfDNA in physiological states. The authors did not assess if the fraction of detectable cfDNA changes in disease conditions. Nonetheless, their pioneering study lays the foundation and provides the methods needed for a similar assessment in disease states.</p><p>1. The findings of this study potentially explain discrepancies in measured versus expected tissue-specific cfDNA from some tissues. For example, the gastrointestinal tract is subject to high cell turnover and release of DNA. Yet, only a small fraction of that DNA ends up in plasma as gastrointestinal cfDNA.</p><p>1. The study proposes potential mechanisms that could account for the low fraction of detectable cfDNA in plasma relative to DNA released. This includes intracellular or tissue machinery that could &quot;chew up&quot; DNA released from dying cells, allowing only a small fraction to escape into plasma as cfDNA. Could this explain why the gastrointestinal track with an elaborate phagosome machinery contributes a small fraction of plasma cfDNA? Given the role of cfDNA as damage-associated molecular pattern in some diseases, targeting such a machinery may provide novel therapeutic opportunities.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies are needed to validate these findings and define tissue machinery that contribute to cfDNA production. The validation studies should address the following limitations of the study design: -</p><p>1. Align the cohorts to estimate DNA production and plasma cfDNA levels. Cellular turnover rate and plasma cfDNA levels vary with age, sex, circadian clock, and other factors (Madsen AT et al, EBioMedicine, 2019). This study estimated DNA production using data abstracted from a homogenous group of healthy control males (Sender &amp; Milo, Nat Med 2021). On the other hand, plasma cfDNA levels were obtained from datasets of more diverse cohort of healthy males and females with a wide range of ages (Loyfer et al. Nature, 2023 and Moss et al., Nat Commun, 2018).</p><p>1. &quot;cfDNA fragments are not created equal&quot;. Recent studies demonstrate that cfDNA composition vary with disease state. For example, cfDNA GC content, fraction of short fragments, and composition of some genomic elements increase in heart transplant rejection compared to no-rejection state (Agbor-Enoh, Circulation, 2021). The genomic location and disease state may therefore be important factors to consider in these analyses.</p><p>1. Alternative sources of DNA production should be considered. Aside from cell death, DNA can be released from cells via active secretion. This and other additional sources of DNA should be considered in future studies. The distinct characteristics of mitochondrial DNA to genomic DNA should also be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments on our analysis. In response to the feedback, we have updated to address key points and revised the text accordingly.</p><p>1. We have incorporated several enhancements to improve the coherence of our analysis. In our revised examination, we drew upon the total plasma concentration of cfDNA, as documented in a study conducted by (Meddeb et al. 2019), while considering the influence of age and sex on these concentrations. To ensure the cohort's alignment, we focus on relatively young and healthy individuals, specifically those below the age of 47. This approach allowed for a more meaningful comparison with the estimated DNA flux from a reference male human aged between 20 and 30 years.</p><p>There was no specific estimate for a cohort of young males in both Meddeb et al. and Loyfer et al.; however, we factored in the expected variations stemming from sex, age, and other relevant factors, as elucidated in literature (Meddeb et al. 2019; Madsen et al. 2019). Thus, we demonstrate that sex and age have a small effect on the cfDNA concentrations and thus are unlikely to alter our conclusions substantially when considering a healthy population.We summarize the changes in the first paragraph, replacing the âTissue-specific cfDNA concentrationâ subsection of the method, and the fourth paragraph added to the discussion.</p><p>1. In this study, we addressed the total amount of cfDNA in healthy individuals without regard to GC content, representation of different genomic regions, or fragment length, as the goal was to understand if cell death rates are fully accounted for by cfDNA concentration. We agree that it will be interesting to study the relative representation of the genome in cfDNA and the processes that determine cfDNA concentration in pathologies beyond the rate of cell death. These topics for future research fall beyond this study's scope.</p><p>2. We know only a few specific cases whereby DNA is released from cells that are not dying. These include the release of DNA from erythroblasts and megakaryocytes to generate anucleated erythrocytes and platelets (Moss et al. 2022, cited in our paper) and the release of NETs from neutrophils.</p><p>The presence of cfDNA fragments originating from megakaryocytes and erythroblasts indicates the elimination of megakaryocytes and erythroblasts and the birth of erythrocytes and platelets. However, the considerations in the rest of the paper still apply: the concentration of cfDNA from these sources is far lower than expected from the cell turnover rate.</p><p>Concerning NETosis: the presence of cfDNA originating in neutrophils that have not died would reduce the concentration of cfDNA from dying neutrophils and thus further increase the discrepancy, which is the topic of our study (under-representation of DNA from dying cells in plasma).</p><p>We neglected mitochondrial DNA, as it is not measured in methylation cell-of-origin analysis. Similarly to the argument above, if some of the total DNA measured in plasma is in fact, mitochondrial, this would mean that genomic cfDNA concentration is actually lower than the estimates, meaning that an even smaller fraction of DNA from dying cells is measured in plasma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I think readers would appreciate the authors commenting or addressing the following points, in addition to addressing the concerns I raised about the methods section in the public review:</p><p>What variables and considerations did the authors omit in this study?</p><p>1. Cell-free DNA is found in virtually every biofluid.</p><p>Thus, the fact that cell-free DNA is not present in the plasma does not mean it cannot be detected elsewhere. This also implies that phagocytosis may not be the only factor related to cfDNA not being present in the blood. One example (of many, many others) is neutrophil-derived cell-free DNA, which is present in the urine.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, dying cells and their DNA can be consumed locally, released into the blood, or shed outside the body. The latter is a function of tissue topology. For example, intestinal epithelial cell turnover releases material to the lumen of the gut (i.e., stool); kidney and bladder cell turnover releases material to urine; and lung epithelium releases material to the air spaces. In these cases, the absence of cfDNA in plasma is expected. However, in cases where tissue topology dictates release to blood, low representation in cfDNA indicates local consumption or a related mechanism. In Figure 1 of the manuscript, we distinguish between tissues according to their topology, labeling organs that shed material to the outside denoted by open circles.</p><p>Neutrophil-derived DNA in urine likely represents a local process in the kidney (neutrophils that penetrate the epithelium and fall into the urine). Neutrophils that die elsewhere in the body must release cfDNA to the blood before it can reach the urine. Hence, quantifying plasma cfDNA is a legitimate approach for assessing the relationship between cell death and cfDNA. The revised text clarifies this point. We made revisions to the initial paragraph in the results section and a paragraph within the discussion to provide clarity on this topic:</p><p>âBased on atlases of human cell type-specific methylation signatures, Moss et al. and Loyfer et al. analyzed the main cell types contributing to plasma cfDNA. They found the primary sources of plasma cfDNA to be blood cells: granulocytes, megakaryocytes, macrophages, and/or monocytes (the signature could not differentiate between the last two), lymphocytes, and erythrocyte progenitors. Other cells that had detectable contributions are endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Qualitatively, these cells represent most of the leading cell types in cellular turnover, as shown in Sender &amp; Milo 2021 (Sender and Milo 2021). Epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, kidney, bladder, and skin are other cell types that significantly contribute to cellular turnover. Dying cells in these tissues are shed into the gut lumen, the air spaces, the urine, or out of the skin (note that while DNA from gut, lung, and kidney epithelial cells can be found in stool, bronchoalveolar lavage, and urine, the fate of DNA from skin cells is not known). This arrangement may explain why DNA from these cell types is not represented in plasma cfDNA in healthy conditions. Therefore, it appears that cells with high cfDNA plasma levels are those with relatively high turnover that are not being shed out of the body.â</p><p>âA comparison between the different types of cells shows a trend in which less DNA flux from cells with higher turnover gets to the bloodstream. In particular, a tiny fraction (1 in 3x104) of DNA from erythroid progenitors arrives at the plasma, indicating an extreme efficiency of the DNA recovery mechanism. Erythroid progenitors are arranged in erythroblastic islands. Up to a few tens of erythroid progenitors surround a single macrophage that collects the nuclei extruded during the erythrocyte maturation process (pyrenocytes) (Chasis and Mohandas 2008). The amount of DNA discarded through the maturation of over 200 billion erythrocytes per day (Sender and Milo 2021) exceeds all other sources of homeostatic discarded DNA. Our findings indicate that the organization of dedicated erythroblastic islands functions highly efficiently regarding DNA utilization. Neutrophils are another high-turnover cell type with a low level of cfDNA. When contemplating the process of NETosis (Vorobjeva and Chernyak 2020), the existence of cfDNA originating from live neutrophils would potentially diminish the concentration of cfDNA released by dying neutrophils, thereby amplifying the observed ratio for this particular cell type. The overall trend of higher turnover resulting in a lower cfDNA to DNA flux ratio may indicate similar design principles, in which the utilization of DNA is better in tissues with higher turnover. However, our analysis is limited to only several cell types (due to cfDNA test and deconvolution sensitivities), and extrapolation to cells with lower cell turnover is problematic.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Effect of biofluid storage.</p><p>Cell-free DNA continues to degrade after it is extracted via blood draw. This is not expected to change tissue of origin predictions (although that remains to be shown in the literature), but definitely affects extraction yield. This is not accounted for (or even discussed) in the manuscript. It would be important to understand how this was done for the data presented here.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper integrates data from multiple recent studies that adhered to state-of-the-art procedures requiring rapid processing of blood samples. In fact, earlier studies that were not careful to isolate plasma quickly typically reported very high concentrations due to the lysis of leukocytes and artifactual release of genomic DNA. Rapid plasma isolation and DNA extraction typically yield 5ng/ml in healthy donors, as stated in the paper (last paragraph of Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Batch effects</p><p>Batch effects are not discussed here and can affect cfDNA yields.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis relies on data reported by multiple studies from different groups, which independently results in similar key findings (total concentration of cfDNA and the relative contribution of different tissues). Thus, batch effects are unlikely to affect the calculations markedly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Cell-free DNA extraction kits</p><p>Different kits and methods extract cell-free DNA at different quantities. Importantly, much research has been done recently that most kits are not sensitive for ultrashort cell-free DNA (of lengths ~50bp). This may represent most of the DNA present in plasma. This raises an important question: are the yields that are being used in Moss et al (where I presume the total concentration is taken from) accurate? Is there more cell-free DNA that was missed? While the importance of this ultrashort cfDNA has yet to be shown, it is in the blood. Thus, the authors' model may underestimate ratios by not accounting for this. This is mentioned in the discussion, but it is not evident why it was not added into the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The Qiagen cfDNA extraction kit can detect 50bp fragments. As shown in the specification sheets of the kit(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/diagnostics-and-clinical-research/solutions-for-laboratory-developed-tests/qiasymphony-dsp-circulating-dna-kit">available here</ext-link>), urine DNA contains abundant DNA fragments that peak at 50bp. In contrast, plasma cfDNA does not contain such fragments at appreciable concentrations. This suggests that small fragments, 50-150bp long, are not a major component of cfDNA, and thus, our measurements of the total concentration of cfDNA are not dramatically underestimated.</p><p>The convention regarding the size distribution of cfDNA fragments is based on extensive evidence using multiple approaches. For example, a study that profiled the DNA released by multiple cell lines in vitro (Aucamp et al. 2017) used another kit for DNA isolation â the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel, DÃ¼ren, Germany). This kit does extract fragments that are 50bp long (nucleospin-gel-and-pcr-clean-up-mini). Indeed, the DNA released from cultured cells did contain a peak at 50bp, but it was minor compared with the nucleosome-size peak.</p><p>More recently, several studies did suggest the presence of ultra-short cfDNA fragments, 50 bp long on average, and concluded that such fragments might be present at a molar concentration that is comparable to that of nucleosome-protected DNA (for example, (Hisano et al. 2021)).</p><p>Thus, our model estimates can be off by up to 2-fold (that is, actual cfDNA concentration measured in most studies overlooks the small fragments and thus underestimates the actual concentration of cfDNA by 2-fold). This is incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><p>We note that we cannot exclude the presence of abundant ultra-short DNA fragments (e.g., 10bp long). However, such fragments are not measurable in cfDNA analysis. Thus, we can refine our conclusion and state that only a small fraction of DNA of dying cells appears as measured cfDNA.We included a section in the methods detailing the integration of a potential factor for the short fragments and revised the discussion:</p><p>âThe overall plasma cfDNA concentration was multiplied by a factor of 1.5 to accommodate for the presence of small fragments of approximately 50 base pairs of cfDNA in the plasma. These fragments are suggested to contribute comparable molar concentrations (Hisano, Ito, and Miura 2021). Despite having approximately one-third of the mass, it is reasonable to presume that these fragments represent a similar number of genomes. This assumption is based on the idea that their source is a broken nucleosome unit, and the fragments represent the portion that was not degraded. Given the restricted data and its interpretation, we consider factors spanning the range of 1 (negligible effect) and 2 (doubling of the amount). The chosen factor, 1.5, is selected as the midpoint within this range of uncertainty.â</p><p>âIn this study, we report a surprising, dramatic discrepancy between the measured levels of cfDNA in the plasma and the potential DNA flux from dying cells. One hypothetical explanation for that discrepancy is the limited sensitivity of typical cfDNA assays to short DNA fragments, which may contribute a significant fraction of the overall cfDNA mass. Regular cfDNA analysis shows a size distribution concentrated around a length of 165 base pairs (bp). The sizes in ctDNA vary more, but most are longer than 100 bp (Alcaide et al. 2020; Udomruk et al. 2021). Recent studies suggested a significant fraction of single-strand ultrashort fragments (length of 25-60 bp) (Cheng et al. 2022; Hisano, Ito, and Miura 2021). However, the total amount of DNA contained in these fragments is less than or comparable to that of the longer âregularâ nucleosome-protected cfDNA fragments (Cheng et al. 2022; Hisano, Ito, and Miura 2021), arguing against ultrashort fragments as a dominant explanation for the âmissingâ cfDNA material. We integrated the estimate provided by Hisano et al. into our analysis as a modifying factor for both the total concentration and uncertainty of plasma cfDNA. Importantly, this incorporation did not alter the overall conclusions, as the discrepancy between the cfDNA plasma concentration and potential DNA flux remains on the same order of magnitude. We note that we cannot exclude the presence of abundant DNA fragments that are even shorter (e.g., 10bp long) and are not measurable in cfDNA analysis. Thus, our formal conclusion is that only a small fraction of the DNA of dying cells appears as measurable cfDNA.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Importantly, this level of uncertainty does not alter our conclusion regarding the relatively small fraction of DNA present in plasma as cfDNA. Furthermore, we acknowledge that age and sex can impact total cfDNA concentration, as demonstrated by (Meddeb et al. 2019), with potential variations of up to 30%. However, as the results of our analysis present a much larger difference, these effects do not change the conclusions drawn from our analysis. Nevertheless, age and health status may influence the proportion of cfDNA originating from specific cell types and their corresponding cellular turnover rates.

Importantly, this level of uncertainty does not alter our conclusion regarding the relatively small fraction of DNA present in plasma as cfDNA. Furthermore, we acknowledge that age and sex can impact total cfDNA concentration, as demonstrated by (Meddeb et al. 2019), with potential variations of up to 30%. However, as the results of our analysis present a much larger difference, these effects do not change the conclusions drawn from our analysis. Nevertheless, age and health status may influence the proportion of cfDNA originating from specific cell types and their corresponding cellular turnover rates. Consequently, the ratios themselves may vary in the elderly population or individuals with underlying health conditions.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. &quot;cfDNA fragments are not created equal&quot;. Recent studies demonstrate that cfDNA composition vary with disease state. For example, cfDNA GC content, fraction of short fragments, and composition of some genomic elements increase in heart transplant rejection compared to no-rejection state (Agbor-Enoh, Circulation, 2021). The genomic location and disease state may therefore be important factors to consider in these analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we addressed the total amount of cfDNA in healthy individuals without regard to GC content, representation of different genomic regions, or fragment length, as the goal was to understand if cell death rates are fully accounted for by cfDNA concentration. We agree that it will be interesting to study the relative representation of the genome in cfDNA and the processes that determine cfDNA concentration in pathologies beyond the rate of cell death. These topics for future research fall beyond this study's scope.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Alternative sources of DNA production should be considered. Aside from cell death, DNA can be released from cells via active secretion. This and other additional sources of DNA should be considered in future studies. The distinct characteristics of mitochondrial DNA to genomic DNA should also be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We know only a few specific cases whereby DNA is released from cells that are not dying. These include the release of DNA from erythroblasts and megakaryocytes to generate anucleated erythrocytes and platelets (Moss et al. 2022, cited in our paper) and the release of NETs from neutrophils.</p><p>The presence of cfDNA fragments originating from megakaryocytes and erythroblasts indicates the elimination of megakaryocytes and erythroblasts and the birth of erythrocytes and platelets. However, the considerations in the rest of the paper still apply: the concentration of cfDNA from these sources is far lower than expected from the cell turnover rate.</p><p>Concerning NETosis: the presence of cfDNA originating in neutrophils that have not died would reduce the concentration of cfDNA from dying neutrophils and thus further increase the discrepancy, which is the topic of our study (under-representation of DNA from dying cells in plasma).</p><p>We updated a paragraph in the discussion regarding this issue:</p><p>âA comparison between the different types of cells shows a trend in which less DNA flux from cells with higher turnover gets to the bloodstream. In particular, a tiny fraction (1 in 3x104) of DNA from erythroid progenitors arrives at the plasma, indicating an extreme efficiency of the DNA recovery mechanism. Erythroid progenitors are arranged in erythroblastic islands. Up to a few tens of erythroid progenitors surround a single macrophage that collects the nuclei extruded during the erythrocyte maturation process (pyrenocytes) (Chasis and Mohandas 2008). The amount of DNA discarded through the maturation of over 200 billion erythrocytes per day (Sender and Milo 2021) exceeds all other sources of homeostatic discarded DNA. Our findings indicate that the organization of dedicated erythroblastic islands functions highly efficiently regarding DNA utilization. Neutrophils are another high-turnover cell type with a low level of cfDNA. When contemplating the process of NETosis (Vorobjeva and Chernyak 2020), the existence of cfDNA originating from live neutrophils would potentially diminish the concentration of cfDNA released by dying neutrophils, thereby amplifying the observed ratio for this particular cell type. The overall trend of higher turnover resulting in a lower cfDNA to DNA flux ratio may indicate similar design principles, in which the utilization of DNA is better in tissues with higher turnover. However, our analysis is limited to only several cell types (due to cfDNA test and deconvolution sensitivities), and extrapolation to cells with lower cell turnover is problematic.â</p><p>We neglected mitochondrial DNA, as it is not measured in methylation cell-of-origin analysis. Similarly to the argument above, if some of the total DNA measured in plasma is in fact mitochondrial, this would mean that genomic cfDNA concentration is actually lower than the estimates, meaning that an even smaller fraction of DNA from dying cells is measured in plasma.</p></body></sub-article></article>
