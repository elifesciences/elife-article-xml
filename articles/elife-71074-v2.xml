Previously, we reported improved healing of dermal excisional wounds in circadian clock neuronal PAS domain 2 (<italic>Npas2</italic>)-null mice. In this study, we performed high-throughput drug screening to identify a compound that downregulates <italic>Npas2</italic> activity. The hit compound (Dwn1) suppressed circadian <italic>Npas2</italic> expression, increased murine dermal fibroblast cell migration, and decreased collagen synthesis in vitro. Based on the in vitro results, Dwn1 was topically applied to iatrogenic full-thickness dorsal cutaneous wounds in a murine model. The Dwn1-treated dermal wounds healed faster with favorable mechanical strength and developed less granulation tissue than the controls. The expression of type I collagen, Tgfβ1, and α-smooth muscle actin was significantly decreased in Dwn1-treated wounds, suggesting that hypertrophic scarring and myofibroblast differentiation are attenuated by Dwn1 treatment. NPAS2 may represent an important target for therapeutic approaches to optimal surgical wound management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>clock gene</kwd><kwd>fibroblast</kwd><kwd>high‐throughput screening</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000047</institution-id><institution>Annenberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarrahy</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002280</institution-id><institution>Plastic Surgery Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hokugo</surname><given-names>Akishige</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007185</institution-id><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Innovation Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishimura</surname><given-names>Ichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A small molecule compound Dwn1, identified through high-throughput screening using <italic>Npas2</italic> as the molecular target, enhances wound healing in a murine incisional wound model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Postsurgical hypertrophic scarring is relatively frequent, even with careful surgical care aimed at reducing inflammation, angiogenesis, and fibrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shirakami et al., 2020</xref>). Hypertrophic scarring results from the excessive deposition of collagen extracellular matrix (ECM) during wound healing. Since the 1970s, the scar-free wound healing noted in fetal skin during early gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrington, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rowlatt, 1979</xref>) has generated extensive research interest in scarless wound healing. Comparative characterizations of fetal and adult wounds have resulted in the identification of numerous soluble growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lichtman et al., 2016</xref>), insoluble ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchanan et al., 2009</xref>), and mechanics of tissue contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parekh and Hebda, 2017</xref>). Research in each of these target areas of interest has generated considerable progress in understanding wound healing. As a result, therapies using individual modulators of the wound healing process, such as transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCollum et al., 2011</xref>) and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kieran et al., 2014</xref>), have been studied in clinical trials. To date, however, the outcomes have been mixed, and therefore, the search for new clinically viable solutions to address the problem of pathological wound healing continues.</p><p>During skin wound healing, dermal fibroblasts migrate along the ECM scaffold found at the wound edges and into the wound bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tracy et al., 2016</xref>). Mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McDougall et al., 2006</xref>) and on-chip wound healing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shabestani Monfared et al., 2020</xref>) suggest that the activation of dermal fibroblast migration plays a critical role in wound closure and the degree of scarring. It has recently been reported that human burn wounds sustained during daylight hours were found to heal faster than those that occurred at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoyle et al., 2017</xref>). This observation is consistent with observations in circadian entrained/rhythmic hamsters in which cutaneous wounds created 3 hr after light onset healed faster than those created 2 hr after dark onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cable et al., 2017</xref>). Investigation into the mechanisms behind these findings revealed that fibroblast migration behavior was affected by the circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoyle et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Circadian rhythm provides temporal regulation and coordination of physiological processes and is responsible for functions related to homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franzoni et al., 2017</xref>). The core circadian clock is rigidly maintained by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Neil et al., 2013</xref>). Clock transcription factors such as circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), neuronal PAS domain 2 (NPAS2), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (ARNTL, BMAL1) induce the expression of the period (<italic>PER</italic>) and cryptochrome (<italic>CRY</italic>) genes. Heterodimers of PER and CRY molecules, in turn, inhibit the transcriptional activity of <italic>CLOCK</italic>, <italic>NPAS2</italic>, and <italic>BMAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). Given the emerging discovery of functional circadian rhythms in all cells and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsui et al., 2016</xref>) and the finding that circadian dysregulation is associated with a wide range of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sipahi et al., 2014</xref>), clock genes and the products of their expression have become targets in the growing research and clinical field of chronotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wei et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we discovered that the suppression of <italic>Npas2</italic> via a knockout (KO) mutation in mice significantly accelerated wound healing and skin closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Npas2</italic> KO dermal fibroblasts exhibited increased cell migration and contraction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>). While the role of <italic>Npas2</italic> in the central circadian rhythm within the SCN is still unclear, <italic>Npas2</italic> has been identified in peripheral tissues, possibly as a modulator of peripheral circadian processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McNamara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilles-GonzalezGonzalezGonzalez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertolucci et al., 2008</xref>). Microarray analysis of human skin has also identified <italic>Npas2</italic> as one of the upregulated genes associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glass et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that the therapeutic suppression of <italic>Npas2</italic> potentiates dermal wound healing with attenuated excessive collagen deposition. Through a high-throughput screening (HTS) process, we identified a small molecule compound that downregulates <italic>Npas2</italic> expression in dermal fibroblasts and results in the accelerated healing of dorsal incisional wounds in mice with minimum scarring.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Murine dorsal incisional wound model</title><p>While the goal of closing a wound surgically with sutures or other material is to facilitate primary wound healing and yield the best functional and cosmetic outcome, unpredictable factors such as wound infection, dehiscence, or ‘spitting’ of sutures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) can disrupt wound integrity and lead to healing by secondary intention. This process is characterized by the deposition of an excess of granulation tissue and leads to hypertrophic scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azmat and Council, 2020</xref>). To evaluate the healing of a full-thickness dermal wound by secondary intention, we developed a modification of a previously described murine model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansell et al., 2014</xref>). Two parallel incisions were made on the dorsal skin of each experimental subject animal, and full-thickness dermis was excised to achieve bilateral defects with uniform dimensions. One suture was placed at the midpoint of each wound to approximate the wound edges, while the anterior and posterior margins of the wound remained separated. This model generated two zones in each incisional wound: the center zone, with suture-supported tissue approximation, and the open peripheral zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We used visual analog scale (VAS) scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duncan et al., 2006</xref>) to validate the model. Each wound was evaluated on a daily basis using photographs of the surgical sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). VAS values from the left- and right-side wounds remained comparable between sides, remaining at the moderate healing level until day 6, primarily due to the sustained open wound in the peripheral zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Masson’s trichrome (MT) staining showed divergent healing patterns in the central wound zones compared to the peripheral zones. The center zones showed good approximation of the wound edges, indicating successful healing by primary intention. In contrast, the peripheral zones formed larger beds of granulation tissue and demonstrated darker MT-stained collagen fibers in the dermis of the wound edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Quantitative scar index analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>) showed significantly higher values in the peripheral zones than in the central zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Additionally, segmented color analysis of MT-stained sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed that collagen fiber density was significantly higher in the peripheral zones than in the central zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). The central zone wound underwent primary intention healing, while the peripheral zone of this model demonstrated secondary intention healing. Based on these observations, we are confident that the peripheral zone in our model is representative of dermal and subcutaneous wound healing and not the morpho-functional influences of deeper muscle layers that have been described in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zomer and Trentin, 2018</xref>).

We selected small molecule compounds from an FDA-approved drug library (1120 compounds). Reporter gene assays are widely used in HTS to identify compounds that modulate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siebring-van Olst and van Beusechem, 2018</xref>). In this study, we sought to identify small chemical compounds that downregulate <italic>Npas2</italic> expression. However, we found that some hit compounds that suppressed <italic>Npas2</italic> were false positives due to cytotoxicity that led to cell death or growth suppression.</p><p>To mitigate this problem, we performed a separate HTS using the same compound library to evaluate fibroblast migration. Dermal fibroblast migration is an important function that is highly relevant to wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2007</xref>). The cell migration HTS was designed with a commercially available 384-well plate with hydrogels printed in the center of each well. The hydrogels were degraded to leave cell-free areas in each well, and fibroblasts migrated at different rates based upon the various influences of the applied small molecule compounds. After the incubation period, fibroblasts were fluorescently stained with calcein AM for the cytoplasm and Hoechst for the nuclei and imaged by Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (ImageXpress, Molecular Devices). We developed an algorithm to capture the number and morphology of fibroblasts within the cell-free zone created by the hydrogel.</p><p>The HTS data sets from both assays were subjected to in silico computation. <italic>Npas2</italic> expression (Z score ≤–2.5) and cell migration (Z score ≥2.5) were co-analyzed, resulting in one ‘hit’ compound that demonstrated an optimum effect on fibroblasts according to these specific metrics, that is, suppression of gene expression and increased migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Based on these results, the hit compound ‘Dwn1’ was identified as the candidate compound for use in subsequent experiments.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Selection and evaluation of the candidate compound Dwn1 for <italic>Npas2</italic> suppression in dermal fibroblasts in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A scatter plot of the high-throughput drug screening assay in vitro using the FDA-approved compound library at Molecular Screening Shared Resource (MSSR) at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).

Surgical approximation of open wound tissues has been traditionally performed to minimize scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Welshhans and Hom, 2017</xref>). Currently, surgical skin incisions are routinely closed by suturing; however, the surgical closure of a dermal wound does not guarantee adequate approximation of the entire length of the wound. For example, cleft lip scars develop after surgical closure regardless of the corrective techniques used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartkowska and Komisarek, 2020</xref>) or the type or severity of the cleft lip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marston et al., 2019</xref>). The prevalence of problematic scar formation has been reported to be between 8% and 47% in pediatric cleft lip patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soltani et al., 2012</xref>). Even in simple facial laceration repair, surgical wounds are not always optimally closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), and small full-thickness dermal gaps in surgical wounds may lead to problems with both form and function. The resultant scarring can lead to numerous psychosocial consequences for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tebble et al., 2004</xref>), resulting in decreased satisfaction with life, an altered perception of body image, and higher rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, alcoholism, imprisonment, unemployment, or marital discord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levine et al., 2005</xref>). There is an acute need to improve surgical wound care.</p><p>The surgical incisional wound with the placement of suture heals by the primary closure, or first intension wound healing. However, the surgical incisional wound may result in premature dehiscence or hypertrophic scarring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansell et al., 2014</xref> compared the time course healing of 10 mm long incisional wound and 6 mm diameter excisional punch wound in mice and reported that the incisional wound healed less consistently than the excisional wound. While the excisional wound progressively closed, the incisional wound initially enlarged before wound margin approximation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2011</xref> refined the mouse incisional wound model by creating 10 × 3 mm<sup>2</sup> full-thickness skin wound to ensure the excision of underlying panniculus carnosus muscle. The present study used this refined mouse incisional wound model with an additional central suture, mimicking the wound dehiscence.</p><p>The present incisional wound models including ours have certain limitations. After 2 weeks of wounding, the present incisional wound healed either through the primary closure at the sutured area or the secondary closure. Therefore, this incisional wound model did not develop chronic unhealed wound. Skin is the largest barrier tissue protecting the internal homeostasis from environmental insults. Once injured, the wound healing process initiates the recovery of the barrier function. However, the skin wound healing may be disturbed by various factors such as diabetes to develop unhealed chronic wound. To investigate the mechanism and therapeutic intervention of unhealed chronic wound, mouse excisional skin wound models have been utilized. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>, reported a chronic wound model of 6 mm diameter excisional punch wound in diabetic mice. Recently, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu and Landen, 2020</xref>), recommended to create 4 mm diameter excisional punch wound in mice as a standard protocol. However, rodent skin excisional wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015a</xref>) heals essentially by tissue contraction, whereas human skin wound heals by re-epithelialization. To address this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>, proposed that the mouse excisional wound of 5 mm diameter would be splinted to prevent the rodent-specific wound contraction for the investigation of chronic wound healing relevant to humans. The effect of Dwn1 on the chronic wound must be separately investigated using the splinted excisional wound model.</p><p>Our study convincingly demonstrated that Dwn1 treatment significantly improved surgical wound healing by secondary intention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The open wounds in the peripheral zones of our surgical incisional wound model were quantitatively depicted by the VAS system. Dwn1 treatment resulted in smaller amounts of granulation tissue, as indicated by lower scar index scores, and less collagen ECM density, as measured by color segmentation analysis of MT-stained histological sections. These observations strongly indicate that Dwn1 facilitates surgical incisional wound healing and results in minimal scarring.</p><p>The mechanism of hypertrophic scarring has not been fully elucidated. During the early inflammation phase, cytokines and chemokines, including TGFβ1, promote the recruitment of fibroblasts to initiate wound repair. A hallmark of hypertrophic scar formation is the perturbation of collagen production, resulting in disorganized bundles of collagen ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hinz et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, Dwn1 supplementation decreased collagen deposition by dermal fibroblasts in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and in murine skin incisional wounds in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Type I and III collagen genes downregulated by Dwn1 in vitro and in vivo may suggest how Dwn1 regulates the attenuation of fibrosis. In addition, type XIV collagen, a member of the FACIT family that has been reported to contribute to normal physiological ECM organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castagnola et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berthod et al., 1997</xref>), was upregulated in <italic>Npas2</italic> KO murine fibroblasts in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we demonstrated Dwn1 dose-dependent upregulation of the expression of type XIV collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), suggesting a further mechanism by which Dwn1 contributes to normal ECM organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Young et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marchant et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It is widely known that myofibroblasts that secrete excessive collagen into the ECM are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertrophic scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shirakami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tracy et al., 2016</xref>). TGFβ1 acts as a major profibrotic cytokine that induces the differentiation of myofibroblasts and the deposition of excessive collagen ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darby et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, the myofibroblast markers <italic>Tgfβ1</italic> and α-SMA were significantly decreased in the Dwn1-treated wounded dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The Dwn1-mediated decrease in myofibroblasts at the wound edge may represent yet another mechanism by which this small compound exerts positive effects on wound healing and prevents hypertrophic scarring.</p><p>Our target molecule, NPAS2, is a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor dimerized with BMAL1. NPAS2 is a functional ortholog of CLOCK, and in fact, the CLOCK-BMAL1 dimer plays a predominant role in the SCN of the hypothalamus for maintaining the circadian rhythm. <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Clock</italic> null mutant mice develop severe pathological phenotypes such as early aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondratov et al., 2006</xref>) and abnormal bone metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2018</xref>), respectively. Alterations in circadian rhythms increase the risk of developing fibrosis in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2016</xref>), and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015b</xref>). The role of NPAS2 in skin hypertrophic scar has not been reported. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2019</xref>, reported the upregulation of <italic>NPAS2</italic> in hepatic stellate cells contributing to liver fibrosis. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morinaga et al., 2019</xref>, demonstrated that the upregulation of <italic>Npas2</italic> in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was induced by the exposure to surface roughened titanium biomaterial resulted in the formation of a thin but dense collagen layer between bone tissue and titanium implant. Thus, we propose that the increased <italic>NPAS2</italic> expression by dermal fibroblasts may contribute to increased collagen deposition potentially leading to hypertrophic scarring.</p><p><italic>Npas2</italic> KO mice demonstrated a relatively limited alteration in circadian behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franken et al., 2006</xref>) and liver metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Neil et al., 2013</xref>) and did not exhibit developmental and physiological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morinaga et al., 2019</xref>).

were approved by the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal Research Committee (ARC# 2003–009) and followed the Public Health Service Policy for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the UCLA Animal Care and Use guidelines. C57Bl/6J WT mice and <italic>Npas2</italic> KO mice (B6.129S6-Npas<sup>2tm1Slm</sup>/J) (Jackson Laboratory) were used in this study. The animals were fed a regular rodent diet and were provided water ad libitum. They were maintained in regular housing conditions with 12 hr light/dark cycles in the Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine at UCLA. The sample size was set based on a previously published manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Murine dorsal incisional wound healing model</title><p>Female WT mice (8–12 weeks of age, approximately 20–25 g) were used. General inhalation anesthesia was obtained using isoflurane (1182097, Henry Schein, Inc) delivered via vaporizer (Somni 19.1, Somni Scientific). The dorsal skin was shaved, and two parallel 10 × 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup> full-thickness dermal wounds were created using a double-bladed scalpel (S1190D, DoWell Dental Products, Inc). A single 5-0 nylon stitch was placed at the midpoint of each dermal defect, creating partially open wounds that mimicked cutaneous surgical wounds without appropriate wound edge approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Photographs and measurements of the wounds were taken every day for 1 week following surgery using a Nikon D40 digital single lens reflex (D-SLR) camera (Nikon, Inc, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>VAS assessment of incisional wound healing</title><p>Gross visual wound assessments were performed by three examiners who were blinded to the type of treatment (control or experimental) each wound received. Sequential postoperative photographs of healing wounds were reviewed by three independent examiners. Scar severity was rated according to a VAS scoring system previously described for use in evaluating human dermal scars.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tracy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castagnola et al., 1992</xref>) The examiners were asked to assess the wounds on a scale, with a score of zero indicating a completely healed dermal wound and a score of 10 indicating very poor healing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histological Examination</title><p>All animals were euthanized on postoperative day number 7 using carbon dioxide inhalation. For each animal, the entire full-thickness dorsal dermal unit, including both incisional wounds, was harvested and immediately fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 hr. Paraffin sections (4 µm) were made perpendicular to the incisional wounds and stained with standard HE or Masson’s trichrome (MT). The stained histological sections were examined under a microscope (LMD 7000, Leica Microsystems) equipped with a digital camera (DFC295, Leica Microsystems). Relevant images from the specimens were captured and analyzed using imaging software (Leica LMD software version 8.0.0.6043, Leica Microsystems).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Scar index analysis</title><p>The total scar area of each wound was normalized to the average dermal thickness, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>). The dermal thickness of each dermal section was recorded as the distance from the epidermal-dermal junction to the panniculus carnosus. Four points were used on each sample to calculate the average dermal thickness: two located 200 μm from either wound edge and two located 700 μm from either wound edge. Measurements were taken from the same site on each harvested wound specimen. Scar area was measured on all images. The scar index was calculated as the scar area (μm<sup>2</sup>) divided by the average dermal thickness (μm). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Statistical analysis of the measured scar index values was performed using the Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative analysis of collagen fiber density on MT-stained slides</title><p>Collagen deposition within wounds was quantified on images of MT-stained sections according to a previously reported method with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubinova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ying Chen and Xu, 2017</xref>). To evaluate each wound, we randomly selected two images: one from the area of granulation tissue and one from the wounded dermis. These images were obtained with a 40× objective lens using a microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon) equipped with a digital camera (AxioCam, Zeiss) and software (AxioVision Rel. version 4.7, Zeiss). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/">imagej.nih.gov</ext-link>). The split channels function was used to split the original RGB image into red, blue, and green channels. The red channel image was then subtracted from the blue channel image, and a standard threshold range was set for all specimens analyzed. Epithelial and subcutaneous layers and epithelial appendages such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands were eliminated manually. The percentage of collagen density in the tissue area was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>High-throughput drug screening</title><p>At the Molecular Screening Shared Resource (MSSR) at UCLA, a drug library of 1120 FDA-approved compounds was screened with two different assays to identify hit compounds with wound healing properties. First, hit compounds involved in the modulation of murine dermal fibroblast <italic>Npas2</italic> expression were identified using HTS. Dermal fibroblasts were isolated from mice engineered to carry the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene in the <italic>Npas2</italic> allele. <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene activity has previously been shown to correlate accurately with endogenous <italic>Npas2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>). The cells were cultured in growth medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (11995065, Life Technologies Corp.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (1600004, Life Technologies Corp.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (15140122, Life Technologies Corp.). Each well in 384-well plates (781906, Greiner Bio-One) was filled with 25 μL of non-phenol red DMEM (31053036, Life Technologies Corp.) containing 10% FBS and 1% PS and 50 nL of FDA-approved compounds (final concentration: 1 μM) using a pin tool (Biomek FX, Beckman Coulter). Cells were added to each well (1500 cells/25 μL) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr, followed by incubation at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide for 48 hr. To measure <italic>Npas2-LacZ</italic> expression, β-galactosidase activity was measured using a Beta-Glo Assay System (E4720, Promega). The <italic>Npas2-LacZ</italic> expression data were uploaded to an online data analysis tool (CDD Vault, Collaborative Drug Discovery Inc), on which data were normalized and the Z-factor was calculated.</p><p>Separately, the same compound library was screened for human dermal fibroblast migration. A commercially available human dermal fibroblast cell line (CCD-1122Sk, ATCC) (3000 cells/25 µL) was applied to an Oris Pro Cell Migration Assay 384-well plate (PRO384CMA1, Platypus Technologies), which contains a water-soluble biocompatible gel that creates a center cell-free detection zone for cell migration in each well. After the cells were plated, the plates were centrifuged at 200× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. After 1 hr of incubation at room temperature for cell attachment, the compounds were added using a 250 nL pin tool and incubated at 37°C in a carbon dioxide incubator. After 48 hr of incubation, 25 µL of staining solution (Calcein-AM and Hoechst, Life Technologies Corp.) was added to each well. After another period of centrifugation at 200× <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, the plates were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and each well was imaged by the Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System (ImageXpress, Molecular Devices). The cells that migrated into the detection zone were counted using a customized computer program (CDD Vault, Collaborative Drug Discovery, Burlingame, CA), and the Z-factor was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Npas2 gene expression in murine dermal fibroblasts treated with Dwn1</title><p>Primary dermal fibroblasts derived from WT mice were harvested as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glass et al., 2013</xref>) and cultured as described above. Fibroblast cultures were treated with 10 μM Dwn1, a hit compound identified via the high-throughput drug screening process, to modulate Npas2 expression and fibroblast migration. After synchronization using 10 nM dexamethasone, total RNA from the fibroblasts cultured with 10 μM Dwn1 was extracted every 6 hr from hours 24 to 48 (RNeasy Plus Mini Kit, Qiagen), followed by cDNA synthesis (SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). TaqMan-based qRT-PCR was performed using a primer/probe mix, <italic>Npas2</italic> (Mm01239312_m1, Thermo Fisher Scientific), with mouse <italic>Gapdh</italic> endogenous control mix (4352339E, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>In vitro wound healing scratch assay</title><p>Murine dermal fibroblasts derived from either WT or <italic>Npas2</italic> KO mice were seeded into a six-well plate with or without 10 µM Dwn1 supplementation. After 2 hr, the cells were scratched with a 20 μL plastic pipette, and the debris was washed out with medium. The scratched regions were imaged every 12 hr by time-lapse photomicrography (LAX S, Leica Microsystems). The number of cells that migrated into the scratched regions was counted at hours 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Collagen synthesis by murine dermal fibroblasts in vitro</title><p>Fibroblasts were cultured in growth medium and L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) with either 0, 1, or 10 μM Dwn1 supplementation to evaluate collagen synthesis. Control fibroblast cultures were also performed using growth medium only. Picrosirius red staining was performed using a commercially available kit (24901, Polysciences, Inc) at day 3 and day 7, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gross images were acquired with a Nikon D40 D-SLR camera (Nikon, Inc, Tokyo, Japan). Collagen deposition was quantified by analyzing absorbance of 550 nm with a plate reader (SYNERGY H1, BioTek). Statistical analysis was performed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test at each time point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Collagen gene expression by murine dermal fibroblasts in vitro</title><p>The gene expression of collagen types I, III, and XIV was determined at day 3 and day 7 of culture.

Following surgery, 20 µL of 10% DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) was applied every day to one wound as a control, and 20 µL of 30 µM Dwn1 dissolved in 10% DMSO was applied to the other wound. Standardized digital photographs and measurements of all wounds were taken daily postoperatively.</p><p>Daily visual wound assessments were performed to evaluate the effects of Dwn1 on wound healing using the VAS scoring system described above. Statistical analysis was performed by two-way ANOVA. In addition, the collagen fiber density in the granulation tissue and the tissue surrounding the wound was measured as described above. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mann-Whitney test.</p><p>Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation on postoperative day 7, 14, and 21 for the harvesting of dorsal skin. After the samples were harvested, the dorsal skin tissues were cut out to prepare identical dermal strips (15 mm long and 5 mm wide) standardized perpendicularly to the incision with the incisional wound at the center, using a surgical scalpel blade. The dermal strips were then mounted in metal clamps with pneumatic grips on Instron 5564 materials testing machine (Instron, Canton, MA). A load was applied at a constant tension rate of 5 mm/min until the dermal strips failure and force-displacement curves were recorded. The maximum load (N) to tear dermal strips was measured as the tensile strength of the wounds.</p><p>LCM of the dermal samples on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks was performed with an LMD 7000 (Leica Microsystems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, including brief HE staining of slides. RNA extraction was performed with an RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen GmbH) followed by cDNA synthesis. TaqMan-based qRT-PCR was performed to evaluate the gene expression of collagen-related genes as well as <italic>Tgfb1</italic> (Mm01178820_m1) and α-SMA (<italic>Acta2</italic>: Mm01546133_m1). <italic>Gapdh</italic> was used as an internal control.

Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was carried out for all sections in AR6 buffer (AR6001KT, PerkinElmer), pH = 6.00, using a BioCare Decloaker at 95°C for 25 min. The slides were then stained with rabbit anti-α-SMA (ab32575, Abcam) at 1/500 dilution for 1 hr at room temperature. The signal was detected using the Dako Envision + System Labeled Polymer HRP anti rabbit (K4003, Agilent). All sections were visualized with the diaminobenzidine reaction and counterstained with hematoxylin.

However, Yang et al., (65) reported the upregulation of NPAS2 in hepatic stellate cells contributing to liver fibrosis. In addition, Morinaga et al., (66) demonstrated that the upregulation of Npas2 in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells was induced by the exposure to surface roughened titanium biomaterial resulted in the formation of a thin but dense collagen layer between bone tissue and titanium implant. Thus, we propose that the increased Npas2 expression by dermal fibroblasts may contribute to increased collagen deposition potentially leading to hypertrophic scarring.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Can more information be provided the specific chemical/biological properties of Dwn1?</p></disp-quote><p>We have been advised by UCLA administration not to disclose Dwn1 citing its ongoing process of intellectual property protection at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Dwn1 could have off-target effects. Did the authors confirm that its effects are entirely dependent on Npas2 by using Npas2-/- mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. We appreciate this suggestion and have performed an additional in vitro wound scratch assay using dermal fibroblasts derived from Npas2 KO mice.
