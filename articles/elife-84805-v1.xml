represent the largest group of secondary-active transporters. Some members, such as the glucose transporters (GLUTs), are well known for their role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis in mammals, with their expression upregulated in many types of cancers. Because only a few sugar porter structures have been determined, mechanistic models have been constructed by piecing together structural states of distantly related proteins. Current GLUT transport models are predominantly descriptive and oversimplified. Here, we have combined coevolution analysis and comparative modeling, to predict structures of the entire sugar porter superfamily in each state of the transport cycle. We have analyzed the state-specific contacts inferred from coevolving residue pairs and shown how this information can be used to rapidly generate free-energy landscapes consistent with experimental estimates, as illustrated here for the mammalian fructose transporter GLUT5. By comparing many different sugar porter models and scrutinizing their sequence, we have been able to define the molecular determinants of the transport cycle, which are conserved throughout the sugar porter superfamily. We have also been able to highlight differences leading to the emergence of proton-coupling, validating, and extending the previously proposed latch mechanism. Our computational approach is transferable to any transporter, and to other protein families in general.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular dynamics simulations</kwd><kwd>molecular modeling</kwd><kwd>structure prediction</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009252</institution-id><institution>Science for Life Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gustafsson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-02433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Delemotte</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using state-specific contacts inferred from coevolving residue pairs enables us to build models of the various conformational states along the sugar porter functional cycle and reconstruct the free-energy landscape of the process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to the importance of glucose and other monosaccharides for cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koepsell, 2020</xref>), sugar porters (SPs) are the largest and widest spread family of small molecule transporters across all kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, the sugar porters are referred to as glucose transporters (GLUTs) belonging to the Solute Carrier Family 2 A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">César-Razquin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holman, 2020</xref>). Human has 14 different GLUT isoforms, and each isoform has a distinct pattern of tissue distribution, gene regulation, substrate preference, and kinetic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueckler and Thorens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Czech, 2007</xref>). GLUT1, for example, is distributed in a wide range of tissues, including the blood–brain barrier, and is essential for glucose transport into the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koepsell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holman, 2020</xref>), whereas GLUT4 is mostly localized in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, and is the major insulin-stimulated glucose transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang and Czech, 2007</xref>). GLUT5 is the only member specific to fructose and is the major route for its intestinal absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rand et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Douard and Ferraris, 2008</xref>). In plants, fungi, bacteria, and parasites the sugar porter family has likewise expanded into a large number of different isoforms, providing essential and niche roles in the uptake of <sc>D</sc>-glucose and other monosaccharides. Plants, for example, express specific sugar porter isoforms for seed, fruit, and pollen production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Niño-González et al., 2019</xref>) and yeast have 20 different hexose transporters with various kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boles and Hollenberg, 1997</xref>), which are targeted for biofuel production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Parasites, such as <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> rely on sugar transport to infect their host and reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Woodrow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blume et al., 2011</xref>), resorting to a promiscuous sugar porter, which can take up a variety of sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). Understanding the molecular basis for sugar transport is thus a fundamental question in biology, with important medical and biotechnological applications.</p><p>Sugar porters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2012</xref>) and are defined by an N- and a C-terminal bundle of six TMs, which are connected by a cytosolic loop that is made up of three to four intracellular helices (ICH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). The sugar porters can be subclassified by a sequence motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maiden et al., 1987</xref>), which structures have shown corresponds to an intracellular salt-bridge network that selectively stabilizes the outward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quistgaard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>). Constructing a transport cycle requires assembling five different conformational states along the transport cycle: outward open, outward occluded, occluded, inward occluded, and inward open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). Globally, sugar porters operate according to the rocker-switch alternating-access mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). To transport the substrate, the substrate-adjacent TM7b helix first needs to bend, before breaking into two halves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left), after which the bundles rock and TM10 rearranges to become more perpendicular to the membrane plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle). Lastly, the intracellular gate opens via the rearrangement of occluding contacts between TM4 and TM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). Although the two bundles are structurally similar, <sc>D</sc>-glucose is not coordinated evenly, but almost entirely by residues located in the C-terminal bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, half helices TM7b and TM10b in the C-terminal bundle are thought to undergo local rearrangements to control access to the sugar-binding site from the outside and inside, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Whilst the sugar porter family is structurally the best characterized out of all MFS transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>), there is still not a single sugar porter that has structures determined in all of these different states. Indeed, some conformations, such as the occluded and inward-occluded states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wisedchaisri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>), have only been experimentally resolved in one isoform. Due to the paucity of structural information, transport models are currently descriptive, lacking rigorous validation. Consequently, it is still unclear if the single snapshots represent physiologically relevant conformations along the transport cycle, and if unique structural features are transferable to more distantly related members.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Available structural and evolutionary information.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Clipped surfaces of representative structures of each functional state arranged according to the conformational cycle of sugar transporters (SPs).

Using the 20 available experimental structures spread across all major conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) we hypothesized that we should be able to pinpoint co-evolving residues pairs specific to each state, and then use these contacts for structure prediction. Notably, we reasoned that this approach would be superior to either (1) homology modeling, which is intrinsically biased toward the captured structure, regardless of whether the features of the template are actually transferable across isoforms or not, or (2) structures generated by coevolution only, which may settle on a conformational state that satisfies the contacts from each of the multiple states yet fails to capture a physiological conformation.</p><p>Here, we present a novel approach for state-specific structure prediction. In essence, we have used experimental structures determined in each of the different conformations to train a neural network to identify state-specific contacts. After filtering these contacts using coevolution information, we have then used them to apply biases to AlphaFold2 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and driven them toward the various conformational states along the functional cycle. Next, we have combined these contacts into collective variables (CVs) to use in enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harpole and Delemotte, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), and computed the free-energy landscape of the fructose transporter GLUT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Finally, with a set of conserved state-specific contacts defined, we were able to pinpoint both contacts that govern the conformational cycle across the sugar porter family, and a series of transporter-specific interactions that control conformational cycling of each of the sugar porter subfamilies. In particular, we concentrate on deciphering the molecular and evolutionary determinants of sugar–proton-coupled symport.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The state-specific structure prediction method.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summarized pipeline for obtaining a description of the conformational change in sugar transporters, colored by which technique is predominantly used.

(<bold>C</bold>) The architecture of the neural network used to train to predict conformational states from contacts between residue pairs. The first step consists in filtering out the low-coevolving contacts by the coevolution-based filtering, after which a restricted convolutional layer works to pool together close contacts in 4 × 4 grids, to account for the fact that contacts between adjacent positions often serve similar functions. Then, two unrestrained convolutions connect the aforementioned layer to the hidden layer and to the five-dimensional output layer, each node representing a single conformational state.

The final structure is chosen as the model with the lowest energy score value.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84805-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inferring coevolving conserved residue pairs across all sugar porters</title><p>AlphaFold2 structural models of the various sugar porters are thought to collectively capture all major conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Alamo et al., 2022</xref>). However, deterministic prediction of a given state is not possible. Therefore, as expected, principal component analysis (PCA) based on pair-wise interactions reveals that sugar porters cluster within their individual subfamilies rather than according to the conformational state that happens to be predicted by the structure prediction method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). To be able to rationally build models of individual sugar porters in each of the states in the transport cycle, we thus need to steer AlphaFold2 generated models, or experimentally captured structures, when applicable, into alternative states. We achieve this by using state-specific contacts derived from coevolution analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To do so, we first generated a representative sequence alignment by aligning <italic>~</italic>1000 sequences from each of the evolutionarily distant sugar porter relatives belonging to mammalian sugar transporters (GLUTs), the bacterial and parasitic transporters (<italic>Pf</italic>HT1 and XylE), the plant sugar transporters (SPs), and the fungal hexose transporters (HXT), separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These sugar porter family members were selected because they are either part of a major evolutionary branch of the sugar porter family or are functionally distinct and structurally characterized (as is the case for <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 or XylE, see Methods for details). We then used the resulting multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) as input for direct coupling analysis (DCA) to generate coevolution maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>). The coevolution maps generated from separately aligned MSAs were subsequently combined into a global coevolution map, filtering out contacts that were predominantly transporter-specific (see Methods). As illustrated for the proton-coupled xylose transporter XylE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), there is an extensive overlap between the MSA-derived coevolution contact maps and experimental inward-facing structural contacts. Nevertheless, several coevolving pairs do not correspond to interactions found in the structure. Overall, we estimate that ~10% of the top 500 coevolving pairs represent contacts not formed in available crystal structures, presumably representing contacts forming in other conformational states (see Methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Extracting state-dependent coevolving residue pairs from experimental structures</title><p>To determine which coevolving pairs correspond to contacts that are formed or broken in the 20 structures of different functional states, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the main five conformational states using as input contact maps from experimentally determined structures filtered by coevolution scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The CNN architecture was designed to avoid redundancy of contacts between neighboring residues while allowing residue pairs to be in contact in several functional states (Methods). Layer-wise relevance backpropagation (LRP) was then performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bach et al., 2015</xref>) on all five output classes separately, identifying contacts that are characteristically present or absent for each conformation. We termed these contacts encouraged and discouraged contacts, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, encouraged and discouraged contacts were not confined to interbundle contacts and are instead spread throughout the entire structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). They also displayed strong state dependency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because of the low number of experimental structures available, training of the neural network carried a substantial risk of overfitting. We thus sought to validate the results by making sure that the state-specific contacts identified were indeed in the expected regions. Starting from the outward-facing conformation, we observe the expected encouraged contacts of interbundle salt bridges formed between TM4–TM10b and TM5–TM8 helices. In contrast, we observe a strong signal for the discouraged contacts between TM1 and the extracellular gate TM7b, which are known to come together during rocker-switch transition into the inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>). In the occluded structure of <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>), the extracellular gate TM7b had moved fully inwards and transition into a broken helix at the point closest to TM1. Furthermore, mutations in TM1 were found to be just as critical for transport as those in TM7b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that TM1 and TM7b interactions might be important in driving formation of the occluded state. Indeed, we observe a robust signal for encouraged contacts between TM1 and TM7b, which is present as early as the occluded state (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), confirming that TM7b and the interactions with TM1 are coevolving to enable attainment of the occluded conformation. As expected for an intermediate state, the occluded state has the maximal number of encouraged contacts. One additional set of encouraged contacts in the occluded state is located between the intracellular gating helices TM10b and TM4, which are required to drive formation of the occluded state from the inward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wisedchaisri et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Network representations of the state-specific contact maps from the layer-wise relevance backpropagation (LRP) analysis of the trained neural network.</title><p>Nodes are labeled by the helix they are a part of, and the edges are colored by their sign in the LRP – blue represents discouraged contacts, and red represents encouraged contacts.

interbundle contacts between TM1 and TM5, and between TM3 and TM6 when transitioning from an outward-open to an outward-occluded state, possibly modulating the conformational change of TM1. In transition between outward- and inward-facing states, additional contacts are also seen between TM2 and TM11, both at the extracellular region, in which case they are encouraged in the inward-facing states, and at the intracellular region, in which case they are encouraged in the outward-facing ones. These previously unreported contacts appear particularly important for transporter function as they are at the basis of the rocker-switch motion passing through the occluded state. Taken together, the state-specific coevolution analysis is able to replicate the main structural transitions expected from comparing individual static structures, as well uncovering new contacts to be evaluated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Generating sugar porter structures for each major conformation</title><p>To expand the available structural information for sugar porters, AlphaFold2 models were driven into all five conformational states in RosettaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alford et al., 2015</xref>) using the derived encouraged and discouraged state-dependent contacts as attractive and repulsive biases, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Methods). A straightforward assessment of the quality of the models obtained was difficult to perform, however, as few experimental structures are available. Nevertheless, for an overall approximation, we calculated the Cα root mean squared deviation (RMSD) to the phylogenetically closest available experimental structure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the mean RMSD difference has an acceptable value of ~2.5 Å, with the RMSD distribution spanning a 95% confidence interval of 1.5–3.2 Å. In addition, to evaluate the stability of these models, 10 ns MD simulations of these models embedded in a model membrane bilayer were then performed, which further relaxed the structures, bringing their overall RMSD to the closest homolog to ~2.1 Å with the RMSD distribution spanning a 95% confidence interval of 1.1–2.7 Å. The RosettaMP modeling pipeline thus seems to bring the models close to their local free-energy minimum, but relaxation by MD simulations further improves the quality of the models by relaxing them further. To evaluate the cause of the RMSD reduction, we compared the GLUT5 outward-open state model before and after MD relaxation to the crystal structure of the same transporter solved in the same state (PDB ID 4YBQ), which showed that the model quality was improved from a 2.15- to a 1.49-Å Cα RMSD, mainly via the relaxation of TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It seems that, in this case, flexible helices require an explicit solvent model to attain a more physiological conformation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Quality of structure prediction of state-specific models of SPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram of root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of the structural models (Rosetta, blue and molecular dynamics [MD] relaxed, orange) from their closest relative in the same conformational state.

The inward-open state model of STP10 previously had a calculated Cα RMSD of 4.3 Å away from its closest homologue with known structure, XylE (PDB 4QIQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wisedchaisri et al., 2014</xref>). However, the actual Cα RMSD to the experimental STP10 inward-facing structure difference is only 2.2 Å, which was further reduced to 1.8 Å after MD simulations. Inspection of the STP10 structure reveals a unique helical kink in TM10, which is not present in XylE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) nor in the starting structure of STP10 in the outward-occluded state (PDB ID: 6H7D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bavnhøj et al., 2021</xref>). An additional structure for inward-open GLUT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>) was further determined after our initial model training was finalized. Our inward-open GLUT4 model has a RMSD of 2.3 and 1.8 Å before and after MD relaxation, respectively. Reassuringly, our method is thus able to model new structural features absent from the training set. Indeed, the Cα RMSD estimated for HXT and STP members, as well as for models of the inward-occluded states, which have fewer structures available to properly assess their accuracy, is generally higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Indeed, as coevolution analysis confirms, the occluded state is an intermediate that has a number of important and specific coevolved pairs that are critical for linking the outward and inward-facing conformations. In addition, the methods used to generate these landscapes did not consider whether structural features captured in specific structures were transferable to other family members. Here, we decided to generate a free-energy landscape for the human fructose transporter GLUT5 using family-wide information in the form of coevolving contacts. We chose GLUT5 because it is the only transporter with experimental structures in both fully outward- and inward-facing conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nomura et al., 2015</xref>) and because our recently determined free-energy landscape using a more traditional enhanced sampling method can serve as a comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Phelix, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The most efficient enhanced sampling techniques require the choice of a low-dimensional CV set that encompass all degrees of freedom implicated in a conformational transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harpole and Delemotte, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindahl et al., 2018</xref>). Given that state-dependent contacts constitute the driving force for a conformational transition, CVs based on those are well suited to distinguish conformational states and to enhance transitions between them. We thus trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish the modeled structures of adjacent states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and extracted therefrom top coevolving contacts, as inferred from their high SVM coefficients. We then designed state-specific CVs as weighted sums of distances between top state-specific coevolving pairs, using as weights the SVM coefficients (see Methods). Finally, we ran accelerated weighted histogram (AWH), an efficient enhanced sampling method natively available in GROMACS, using these CVs as input. Accumulating 250–650 ns of MD simulations enabled an extensive sampling of the conformational space and the estimation of the corresponding free-energy landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>) with satisfactory accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). The three separate free-energy landscapes give insights into the energetical details of each process. However, to infer global characteristics of the entire conformational cycle, we needed to estimate the free energy along a single variable able to describe the entire conformational cycle. To do this, we optimized a modified linear discriminant analysis (LDA) loss function to maximize the separation between states (see Methods). We then reweighted all of the samples from the separate AWH simulations, aggregating all of the statistical weights in a one-dimensional LDA-based CV space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We projected the experimentally solved structures in this same CV space to help identify the free-energy basins and analyzed representative snapshots extracted from each basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). As expected, the three AWH simulations mostly agree in the regions where they overlap, for example in the transition state region or relative free energies of the outward-occluded and occluded states. Notably, the rocker-switch simulations covered the conformational space most extensively, briefly sampling even outward-open states. However, the free-energy uncertainty estimated from these simulations in the outward-open region is higher than in the rest of the conformational ensemble (~4–6 kJ/mol), most likely due to the fact that the rocker-switch CV was not explicitly trained to sample the outward-open state. In contrast, the free-energy estimate coming directly from the outward opening simulations is more reliable.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The entire conformational cycle is captured by accelerated weight histogram simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Free-energy landscape of the outward opening process.

The outward-open and outward-occluded states appear to be of comparable free energies, and the barriers between the outward-open and outward-occluded states are fairly low at 4.6–9.9 kJ/mol, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This observation is consistent with the fact that the structure of GLUT3 has been determined in both outward-open and outward-occluded states even in the presence of a bound maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). The largest energetic barrier of ~35.7 kJ/mol is located between the occluded and the inward-occluded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This barrier presumably arises in part from the breakage of the strictly conserved salt-bridge network, is consistent with the activation barrier of 10 kcal/mol as estimated by GLUT1 kinetics (43 kJ/mol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lowe and Walmsley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ezaki and Kono, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, the relaxed GLUT5 occluded state does not fall on the largest energetic barrier corresponding to the transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, in the presence of a substrate sugar, GLUT5 passes through a transition state that closely matches the occluded state of <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McComas et al., 2022</xref>). Our analysis indicates that coevolution-driven MD simulations are detecting an energetic minimum for an occluded state prior to the transition state which has not yet been experimentally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). It is possible that the coevolution analysis is detecting a pre-transition state, which is likely to be lowly populated in the presence of a substrate sugar. As is expected in the absence of substrate, we fail to entirely stabilize the inward open state, which is also evident from the disparity in the localization of the inward open models and the corresponding free-energy basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that using evolutionary-based CVs enables us to obtain sugar porter conformational free-energy landscapes using AWH with simulations of the order of hundreds of nanoseconds. While not strictly comparable to other methods, this represents an increase in performance by at least an order of magnitude compared to some previous attempts on modeling conformational change of comparable magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galochkina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selvam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takemoto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary of the structural determinants responsible for the cycling between adjacent conformational states.</title><p>Contacts are characteristic of the first conformation they appear in, but they can be maintained more or less throughout the cycle depending on the family members.

Notably, these interactions are more robustly defined than in the previous analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, since those were based on the analysis of a reduced set of experimentally resolved structures.

In addition, the residue Ser306 located at the back of TM7b has coevolved to form an interaction to Gln366 located in TM9, an interaction that is between Thr/Arg or Lys in the SP members or made between small and/or polar residues in the rest of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The outward-occluded state is characterized by a bend in the TM7b helix, which occludes sugar exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). The contact analysis shows that this state appears to be stabilized by coevolving pairs between Tyr297 in TM7b and Asn325 and His387 in TM10a, which are peripheral to the sugar-binding site and could therefore be connected to sugar binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This interaction remains formed up until the inward occluded-open state. In most other GLUT members and in the HXT proteins, Tyr297 and His387 are replaced by Phe residues that are expected to interact with TM10a residues via hydrophobic or pi–pi interactions.</p><p>In the occluded state, TM7b transitions from a bent to a broken helix, which occludes the sugar-binding site and moves TM7b closer to TM1. Interestingly, Asn40 of TM1 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone residues at the break-point in TM7b, an interaction that remains formed up until the inward open states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The Asn40 is conserved in <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 and mutation to alanine was shown to severely impair transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>). In most other family members, a hydrogen bond is made possible by the presence of a small polar residue in TM1, highlighting that stabilized TM7b closure is generally connected to interactions in TM1 as early as in the occluded state.</p><p>In addition to the most outward-facing salt-bridge network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) breaking, rearrangements of TM10a helix and formation of the Tyr374 (TM10)–Thr318 (TM8) hydrogen bond characterizes the transition to the inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These positions often feature residue pairs capable of interaction either via hydrophobic interactions or H-bonding (Leu/Val-Ala in STPs, Asn/Tyr-Thr/Ser in the rest of the family). The formation of this contact in the inward-occluded state is a critical determinant for the rocker-switch motion, as the resulting rearrangement of TM10a promotes the tilting of the peripheral helices, which ultimately rocks the helical bundles into an inward-facing state.</p><p>For the intracellular gate to open, the residual Glu401–Arg159 salt bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) must completely break. Inspection of the distribution of the minimum distance between Glu401–Arg159 contact across reveals that it increases from an average of 1.4 Å in the occluded state, to 3.4 Å in the inward-occluded state. The weakening of Glu401–Arg159 presumably contributes to releasing TM10b. Entry into the inward-open state in the absence of sugar, stabilizing the tilted TM10b, features the full breakage of the Glu401–Arg159 interaction, and Glu401 forming a salt bridge with a different partner, namely Arg341 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The rotation of TM10b shifts the occluding Leu397 residue away from intracellular pathway to the sugar-binding site, opening the intracellular gate fully. This state is also stabilized by additional strictly conserved hydrophobic contacts in the TM10–TM7 interface (positions 397–400 in GLUT5, which rearrange from an interaction with TM4 in the outward-facing and occluded state) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Coevolving residues support proton-coupling in sugar porters</title><p>Having characterized the aspects of the sugar porter transport cycle that are likely conserved across the family, we turn to family-specific features, with a focus on the differences between passive and proton-coupled transporters, such as XylE. The current working model is that an aspartic acid reside in TM1 (Asp27 in XylE) is allosterically coupled to the sugar transport but does not participate directly in sugar binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seica et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jia et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, the aspartic acid to asparagine mutant has the same sugar-binding affinity as wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madej et al., 2014</xref>).

Simplistically, breakage of the Asp27–Arg133 salt bridge enables TM1 to come closer to TM7b which is associated with sugar binding and closing of the extracellular gate.

More specifically, we indeed see that the equivalent TM1 Asp and TM4 Arg salt bridge is broken in occluded states of all known proton-coupled symporters, such as STP10. The details of the conformational rearrangement differ, however. After breaking of the latch, in the occluded state of XylE, Arg133 can form a salt bridge with the neighboring TM6 Glu206 residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In STP10, on the other hand, Glu206 is replaced by an alanine, and R133 rearranges by adopting a different rotameric state facing toward TM11, where it appears to be stabilized by an interaction with the phospholipid headgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> , <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Most GLUTs are thought to be passive transporters and do not possess an acidic residue at position 27, consistent with its purported role as proton carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Intriguingly, however HXTs, which are generally not proton coupled, do carry an acidic residue in this position. Our analysis reveals that this is explained by the fact that these transporters contain a latch interaction that is maintained throughout the conformational cycle thanks to a large-scale pivot of the first helical bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This conformational change unique to HXTs is enabled by helix breaking residues at position 202 (Pro/Gly), which are replaced by mostly hydrophobic residues in the rest of the family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). GLUT2, a passive transporter that nevertheless possesses an acidic residue at position 27, has a serine in position 205 which interacts with D27, which appears to help the salt bridge remain formed in the occluded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>AlphaFold2 has made it possible to produce high-quality models of structures associated with any amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, these structures represent an arbitrary conformational state, and do not capture the conformational heterogeneity that enables protein function. Modifying the MSA depth enables to make models of alternate states, though in a non-deterministic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Del Alamo et al., 2022</xref>). In this work, we have used (1) AlphaFold models, (2) coevolution analysis encoded by family-wide MSAs, and (3) state-specific contacts extracted from the ~20 structures to guide enhanced MD simulations. Our work goes beyond the analysis of static structures and enables the separation of state- and transporter-specific features, thus firmly establishing the family-wide determinants of the conformational cycle as well as establishing specificities of GLUT5 and elucidating the mechanism of proton-coupled SPs. By introducing coevolution as a measure of predicted interaction, we can develop models that go beyond the comparison of structures only. We also minimize information that may be lost during dimensionality reduction, as demonstrated by our validation on newly reported structures.</p><p>Using state-dependent coevolution-based contacts, we show that we can create a low-dimensional projection that describes the transition between adjacent states. When derived into a set of CVs used in enhanced sampling MD simulations, we can construct weighted conformational ensembles, or in other words free-energy landscapes of the process. Comparing our convergence times (to less than 0.01 kJ/mol within 250–650 ns per walker and system) to previous works on similar systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galochkina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selvam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takemoto et al., 2018</xref>) and given the agreement between the activation barrier estimates from kinetic measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lowe and Walmsley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ezaki and Kono, 1982</xref>), we conclude that the introduction of coevolution data is a powerful approach in obtaining accurate free-energy landscapes efficiently. This methodology is likely to be applicable to other membrane protein families, such as GPCRs, ABC transporters, or other SLC transporter families.</p><p>The conformational ensembles reveal an overall functional cycle that is largely consistent with the evaluation of experimentally resolved structures, yet also provides details that were previously unknown. Across the larger MFS family of transporters, cavity-closing contacts are predominantly formed between TM1–TM2 and TM7–TM8 on the outside and between TM4–TM5 and TM10–TM11 on the inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>). However, the sugar porters, as exemplified by GLUT transporters, coordinate the sugars very asymmetrically with only a single residue in the N-terminal bundle coordinating the sugar. As such, local rearrangements during the transport cycle are assumed to be primarily established by local changes in TM7b and TM10b half-helices, which coordinate the sugar in the C-terminal bundle. Although sugar porters are made up of two structurally similar bundles, the asymmetrical rearrangements are more akin to the conformational changes described by rocking-bundle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drew and Boudker, 2016</xref>), which are made up from structurally distinct bundles. Consistently, coevolution analysis is able to detect the importance of the substrate gating regions for driving conformational changes. In particular, the coevolution analysis shows that TM7b and its interaction with TM1 have evolved to come together already in the occluded state, that is, rather than only interacting in the inward-facing conformations. This conclusion is in agreement with the occluded structure seen for <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>), wherein TM7b had moved completely inwards to break over the sugar-binding site.</p><p>The requirement for TM1 to interact with TM7b in formation of the occluded state further explains how sugar porters can evolve to be proton coupled, even if the proton-accepting residue itself does not directly coordinate the sugar, that is, unlike in other SPs, such as LacY. Simplistically, an aspartic acid residue in TM1 forms a salt bridge with an arginine residue in TM4, restricting its movement. Protonation of the aspartic acid residue removes this constraint and TM1 can come closer to TM7b, which itself is stabilized inwards when it binds a substrate sugar. Interestingly, an acidic residue in TM6 is further required to provide a favorable alternative conformation for the unpaired arginine. In the passive GLUT transporter GLUT2 and the yeast hexose transporters, for example, this additional acidic residue is missing and the salt bridge is still retained due to the assistance of a nearby serine residue. Nevertheless, STP members are proton coupled and yet they do not possess an additional acidic residue in TM6. Rather, the arginine residue is able to snorkel to the membrane interface in the unpaired state. Notably, although TM7b and TM1 are important, they are part of a larger interaction network that also includes, for example, how TM7b interacts with TM8 in the outward-open state. Further analysis and simulations are required, however, to identify the allosteric network responsible for proton transfer.</p><p>Consistent with the orchestrating role of TM7b in substrate translocation, the coevolved interaction with TM1 is retained across the entire second half of the transport cycle. In contrast, the inward-facing gating helix TM10b is likely to have a more passive role and a coevolved interaction with TM4 is only formed in the occluded state. Nevertheless, TM10b dynamics are likely to be important and it is possible that TM10b movement is facilitated by the stabilization of TM10a with TM8 on the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The bottom of TM10a harbors a strictly conserved acidic residue, which is part of the intracellular salt-bridge network. The contact maps initially generated for all sugar porters indicated mostly discouraged contacts between TM4 and TM10b residues in the inward-occluded state (bundle 5 contact in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, the GLUT5 models show that whilst most contacts are indeed broken, there is still an encouraged contact between TM4 and TM10b residues in the inward-occluded state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It thus appears that, at least in GLUT5, only one of the salt-bridge pairs is fully broken between the occluded and inward-occluded states. Such a result is intriguing and implies that even the rocker-switch rearrangement itself, might utilize asymmetric rearrangements, contrary to the symmetric bundle movement in other members of the MFS family, such as SWEETs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, GLUT transporters are shown as textbook examples of how small molecule transporters are functional equivalents to enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drew et al., 2021</xref>). Key to understanding catalysis is to understand how the transition state is formed during substrate translocation. The transition state, however, is only transiently occupied and therefore difficult to experimentally capture. Nevertheless, the parasite transporter <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 has an unusually very polar TM7b gate, which has made it possible to capture an occluded state with sugar present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qureshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>) that is, notably this state is unlikely to represent a transition state for <italic>Pf</italic>HT1. Nonetheless, out of the models we built, <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 has the highest number of state-specific contacts in both gates. We speculate that the <italic>Pf</italic>HT1 model could represent a pre-transition state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), with further dynamics between the bundles required to access the transition state. In summary, although many questions remain unanswered, our novel approach provides a rational framework for understanding how sugar porters function at the molecular level and provides the information to re-engineer sugar porters with different characteristics, which might be otherwise inaccessible by traditional forward-evolution approaches. Through the identification of family-wide state-specific interaction patterns, it would be possible to guide experimental dynamics, such as single-molecule FRET or <sup>19</sup>F NMR experiments. We also anticipate that breaking or stabilizing the interaction patterns would perturb the free-energy landscape significantly since these contacts are tightly coupled to survival through evolution. At a conceptual level, our work highlights how even the most simplistic type of transporters have evolved fine-tuned and intricate interactions to achieve substrate translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence library construction</title><p>To construct the sequence alignment at the basis of coevolution analysis, a representative sequence from each member of the SP family was taken as a seed for a sequence search against the Uniref90 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suzek et al., 2015</xref>) using PSIBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>).

After the number of visits at each point grows larger than the histogram size at that point, the initial phase is exited, after which the update size is continuously and exponentially decreased according to an exp-linear setting. All AWH simulations were run with four walkers in parallel with two starting in each conformational state at the extremes of each process.</p><p>Convergence of the AWH calculations was determined according to three criteria: the free-energy landscape was stable over time, the coordinate distribution along the minimum free-energy path reached a standard deviation of less than 0.1 from the mean coordinate distribution, and the changes in free-energy estimate were below 0.5 kJ/mol. The simulations were extended by 25 ns after these three criteria were met to ensure that these properties held true over time. The regions of high free energy (above the process-specific cutoff, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) of the free-energy landscape were excluded from the convergence analysis.

Our strategy was based on measuring the transition imbalance between neighboring bins in the 2D landscapes, which can then be used to estimate the standard error along the 1D free-energy landscape.</p><p>In adaptive bias simulations, the bias function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> approximates the underlying Hamiltonian <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> , meaning that the effective Hamiltonian should produce a flat coordinate distribution:<disp-formula id="equ12"><label>(12)</label><mml:math id="m12"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ξ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In this work, we track the point-wise deviation from this distribution and calculate the error due to this with the following procedure. Given that all points have been sufficiently sampled several times (which is part of the convergence criteria in AWH), we can calculate the transition matrices between adjacent frames, and thus obtain the transition probabilities which can be translated into free-energy errors in a similar spirit as in Markov-state modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Husic and Pande, 2018</xref>). For an optimally converged system, all transitions should be roughly equally probable, and the higher the imbalance the higher the free-energy estimate error is in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, it is important to quantify the sampling stemming from different walkers, and whether the free-energy estimate is consistent between different walkers.

The resulting distributions of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) and <italic>P</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>. The analysis shows that the majority of points are heavily visited by at least two to three walkers for all simulations, and only rarely, often in transition region do all walkers overlap. Importantly, it is in these transition regions that several walkers should overlap to produce a reliable estimate of the relative free energies between basins.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84805-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data necessary to reproduce this work is openly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7899203">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7899203</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mitrovic</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Sugar transporter mechanism</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.7899203</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (DD) and the Science for Life Laboratory (DD and LD), the Göran Gustafsson Foundation (DD and LD), and the Swedish Research Council (VR 2019-02433 to DD and LD).

protocols, and molecular dynamics simulations, to predict structures and energetics of the main states of the alternating access cycle of a family of membrane transporters, the sugar porters. The approach is compelling, especially the application of co-evolution and Alphafold to generate accurate models in different conformational states of a given protein, and will be of interest to the membrane transport and computational modeling communities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84805.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Stockbridge</surname><given-names>Randy B</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Stockbridge</surname><given-names>Randy B</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Reddy</surname><given-names>Krishna D</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Weill Cornell Medical College</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.24.509294">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.24.509294v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Krishna D Reddy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were very positive about the approach, and thought this was a potentially very valuable contribution to the field. They were especially enthusiastic about the application of co-evolution and Alphafold to generate highly accurate models in different conformational states, and the reviewers appreciated the extensive amount of modeling work. However, the reviewers also thought that the first point listed here was a considerable issue that could undermine important conclusions and would need to be fixed.</p><p>1. The most critical issue is that the procedure to calculate the free energy profile in Figure 5D appears to be fundamentally flawed. A properly calculated one-dimensional (1D) free energy profile must reflect the probability distribution of a single, well-defined collective variable and cannot generally be derived by stitching together 1D profiles from different variables. As the free energy landscape is an essential part of the manuscript, this will need to be corrected with extra analysis, providing the necessary information has been stored in the trajectories (see Kumar et al. J Comp Chem, 1992).</p><p>In addition, the reviewers identified several other &quot;essential revisions&quot; that they believe can be addressed in a revision:</p><p>2. The authors should soften their claims that this method is superior to homology modeling (without having done a quantitative analysis) and that this method is an order of magnitude faster than comparable methods (which has not been shown, and might be difficult to demonstrate).</p><p>3. The free energy landscapes in Figure 5A and Figure 5B do not seem consistent with each other, and the authors do not discuss whether errors in the calculations that may contribute to this. Upon discussion, the reviewers thought this might be in part due to confusing labeling of the minima. In order to clarify this point, it would be useful for the authors to quantitatively assess the differences by showing the relative probability (or free energy difference) between outward-occluded and occluded states from each of the two landscapes.</p><p>4. The reviewers also noted that the free energy landscapes in the companion paper also (<italic>eLife</italic>-84808) appeared significantly different. For example, the occluded state is a barrier in Figure 2E of the other work while looks essentially the most stable state in Figure 5A of this work and is again a barrier in Figure 5B. Also, the inward open state seems unstable in Figure 2E of the other work while there is a clear stable minimum in Figure 5C of this work. The authors should justify/discuss this.</p><p>5. Simulations started from predicted models tend to drift away from the native structure in the multi microseconds time domain, unless restraints are applied. the authors should show compelling evidence that the predicted models used in the simulation are of sufficiently high quality (Proteins 2012; 80:2071-2079). Therefore, the authors should show evidence that the predicted models used in the simulation are of sufficiently high quality, especially if the backbone RMSD deviates over 1 Å from the experimental structure.</p><p>6. As the free energy calculations are based on simulations started from different structures it would be useful to show free energy estimates from these individual simulations.</p><p>7. Since the quality of co-evolution analysis is largely dependent on the quality of the BLAST and sequence alignment, more detail regarding the methodology (trimming, manual editing, program parameters, sequence exclusion, etc.) is important to include. The actual sequence alignment and the list of proteins as a supplement should also be provided.</p><p>8. It is hard to fully conceptualize the extent of structural differences with 2D representations of aligned structures. A per-residue RMSD of various structure comparisons, mapped onto the experimentally solved structure, would help further illustrate the specific structural similarities and differences between the models and structures. This type of figure would be more helpful than the current Figures 4B and 4C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Can you expand on the thought on page 15/line 22 that &quot;even the rocker-switch bundle movement might utilize asymmetric rearrangements.&quot; I don't understand what the expectation for symmetry is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– As the authors mention, most people use homology models to model specific conformations. Though I agree that the presented analysis is likely superior to such techniques, it is essential to demonstrate this quantitatively, both before and after MD simulations. Given the improvements post MD simulation, it would be interesting to see if the superior starting point (biased AlphaFold2 models) leads to a more improved final model, or if MD simulations are sufficient to approach the free energy minimum. This would further demonstrate the necessity of the described methodology and argue for its wider adoption.</p><p>– Since the quality of co-evolution analysis is largely dependent on the quality of the BLAST and sequence alignment, I would like some more detail regarding the methodology (trimming, manual editing, program parameters, sequence exclusion, etc.). The actual sequence alignment and the list of proteins as a supplement should also be provided. I was unable to find this in the provided OSF link; therefore, as it stands, I am not able to assess this data.</p><p>– It is hard to fully conceptualize the extent of structural differences with 2D representations of aligned structures. A per-residue RMSD of various structure comparisons, mapped onto the experimentally solved structure, would help further illustrate the specific structural similarities and differences between the models and structures. This type of figure would be more helpful than the current Figures 4B and 4C, as the improvements are hard to get a sense of as currently presented. Furthermore, this would answer the related question regarding if MD simulations improve RosettaMP models in specific ways, or is it a more global improvement.</p><p>– The proposed model of proton-coupling suggests conformation-specific pKa's of the aspartate residue, so that the transporter can bind protons in the outward-facing state, yet release protons in the inward-facing state. If this is the case, the co-evolution analysis should reveal residues adjacent (or perhaps even more allosteric) to the aspartate that could regulate the pKa in a conformation-dependent manner. This would be interesting to describe.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A critical issue of this work is that the procedure to calculate the free energy profile in Figure 5D is fundamentally flawed. A properly calculated one-dimensional (1D) free energy profile must reflect the probability distribution of a single, well-defined collective variable and cannot generally be derived by stitching together 1D profiles from different variables. Namely the orthogonal space of one variable, is generally not the same of that of another variable (and there are overlap regions between different variables). To do this correctly the authors should first define a single, mathematically well-defined variable describing the gradual structural variation from outward-open to inward-open conformations. A possibility for example is to use a path variable (J Chem Phys 2007 Feb 7;126(5):054103) derived from consecutive configurations from the three different paths. The authors could then use a reweighting approach to properly calculate the free energy along this path from the sampling of all simulations. To do this rigorously, the authors could use the weighted histogram analysis or the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio method, so that biases on different variables and overlap regions are properly accounted for.</p><p>The free energy landscapes in Figure 5A and Figure 5B do not seem consistent with each other. Namely while the occluded state is a main free energy minimum in the landscape of Figure 5A, it seems to be a barrier region in Figure 5B. To quantitatively assess this, it would be useful that the authors show the relative probability (or free energy difference) between outward-occluded and occluded states from each of the two landscapes. To do this the authors could define a unique descriptor to discriminate outward-occluded and occluded states (using the same descriptor for each landscape) and evaluate their probability. A simple way to do this, assuming the overall bias potential is only a function of CV1 and CV2, is to calculate the cumulative weight of each state. Where the weight of a simulation frame can be calculated as exp{-F(i)/kT}/N(i), where F(i) is the free energy as a function of CV1 and CV2 in a small bin of those variables assigned to that frame and N(i) is the number of simulation frames in that bin. This simple scheme could be also used to project the 2D landscape on a single variable, but weighted histogram analysis or the multistate Bennett acceptance are generally more rigorous methods in this regard.</p><p>As the free energy calculations are based on simulations (walkers) started from different (endpoints) structures it would be useful to show free energy estimates from these individual simulations. If this is not possible because they cover different portions of the space, the authors should show a metric of overlap, to make sure that individual simulations do not explore completely separated regions of the configurational space, thus leading to unreliable free energies.</p><p>Based also on the previous considerations, there is no evidence that the methodology proposed leads to one order of magnitude speed up compared to other methods and it would be generally difficult to demonstrate for these types of systems.</p><p>Another important point is that the simulations are based on the predicted models rather than on experimental structures. Previous systematic studies (see for example Proteins 2012; 80:2071-2079) underline how simulations started from predicted models tend to drift away from the native structure in the multi microseconds time domain, unless restraints are applied, which could help structural improvements (see also Protein Science 2015 25:19-29). Therefore, the authors should show compelling evidence that the predicted models used in the simulation are of sufficiently high quality, especially if the backbone RMSD deviates over 1 Å from the experimental structure. For example, by showing that convectional MD simulations started either from the models or from the X-ray structures are both stable and sample similar conformations (e.g. based on pairwise RMSD of both side chains and backbone).</p><p>The results of the modeling part of the work seem encouraging, nonetheless a suggestion for the authors is that, besides the RMSD distribution in Figure 4A they show analogous data for a descriptor that can better differentiate structural differences between states, as for example based on state-specific contacts. In particular, is not uncommon that the backbone RMSD between different states of a transporter is 3 Å or smaller.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84805.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were very positive about the approach, and thought this was a potentially very valuable contribution to the field.

J Comp Chem, 1992).</p></disp-quote><p>The original idea behind Figure 5D was to visualize the free energy landscape rather than provide a thermodynamic picture of the process, but we certainly agree that this did not come across properly in the submitted version, and that a thermodynamically robust reweighting scheme would lend quantitative insights to the work. In principle, a global collective variable along which all the states along the conformational cycle are separable would have to be defined and the probability distribution (free energy) projected along it. While maximum margin hyperplanes were defined for adjacent conformational states in the original work, we quickly found that they were incapable of separating all the states along the conformational cycle and thus to appropriately describe the global conformational change. Therefore, we modified the canonical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) equation for maximal separation of multiple labels and optimized it with respect to all predicted structures. Details of the methodology have been provided in the method section, and the procedure is described in the main text.</p><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, once the so-called LDA CV had been defined, we could use the thermodynamic weights from the AWH simulations to reweight the samples via the recommended reweighting scheme (using cumulative weights as exp{-F(i)/kT}/N(i)). The procedure is described in detail in Lindahl et. al, PRE 2018, and has been summarized in the methods section of the revised manuscript. Moreover, all three AWH simulations were projected onto the same space, and a WHAM-like procedure was used to determine the free energy shift between different profiles. In brief, the different free energy landscapes were aligned to maximize the statistical weight overlap between them. This methodology is described in the methods section (page 24-26)</p><p>Lastly, Figure 5 was redesigned to show the new projection, and the Results section has been updated accordingly (page 10-11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the reviewers identified several other &quot;essential revisions&quot; that they believe can be addressed in a revision:</p><p>2.

However, we aimed to provide a rough estimate of the efficiency of the sampling that is achieved by the entire pipeline. Indeed, the same conformational change was tracked in the co-submitted paper by McComas et al. using the string-of-swarms method, leading us to believe that a comparison between these two methodologies is sufficient to suggest that the methodology provides a speed-up. Nevertheless we agree that a more comprehensive comparison would have to be made to provide the necessary quantifications. We have thus softened our claims to reflect this aspect. In addition, we have removed the claims about homology modelling completely given the difficulty in proving them, as correctly identified by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The free energy landscapes in Figure 5A and Figure 5B do not seem consistent with each other, and the authors do not discuss whether errors in the calculations that may contribute to this. Upon discussion, the reviewers thought this might be in part due to confusing labeling of the minima. In order to clarify this point, it would be useful for the authors to quantitatively assess the differences by showing the relative probability (or free energy difference) between outward-occluded and occluded states from each of the two landscapes.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the original positioning of the labels led to confusion and have implemented several changes to better characterize the free energy landscapes and, in particular, the localization of their local minima. To address the differences between the projections in 2 and 1D, we added a section discussing the spaces where the free energy estimation from different simulations overlapped. This was made possible thanks to the reweighting onto the LDA CV (see point 1 in essential revisions above), which lends a common framework along which the relative free energy differences can be compared. We also wanted to quantify whether any disparities where because of lack of confidence in the free energy estimates, or due to systematic errors due to e.g. initialization of simulations from different starting points. In order to quantify this, we estimated the errors of the 2D AWH free energy landscapes by utilizing the fact that the probability distribution after converging AWH simulations should be flat, and quantified the energetic imbalance between bins to quantify the local error (see methods for details). With the previously mentioned reweighting procedure, we could estimate the standard error at each point along the LDA CV. These changes are mostly reflected in figure 5 but are thoroughly described in the methods sections (page 24-26).</p><p>To comment on the perceived disparity between figure 5A and 5B in particular, the rocker switch simulations between the outward occluded and the inward occluded states correctly assessed (within the standard error margin of ~1-2 kJ/mol) the difference between the outward occluded and occluded basins. To our surprise, these simulations even sampled the outward open states, despite the fact that the CVs were not designed to extend outside of the rocker switch conformational change, albeit with significantly higher standard errors. Notably, however, free energy estimates from this simulation in this region do not overlap with the estimate from the outward opening simulations. Since we did not target sampling of the outward opening process when designing the CV for the rocker-switch simulations, we surmise that there are strong reasons not to use this estimate of the outward open energy into consideration for analysis. This is discussed in the main text in relation to figure 5 (page 10-11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The reviewers also noted that the free energy landscapes in the companion paper also (eLife-84808) appeared significantly different. For example, the occluded state is a barrier in Figure 2E of the other work while looks essentially the most stable state in Figure 5A of this work and is again a barrier in Figure 5B. Also, the inward open state seems unstable in Figure 2E of the other work while there is a clear stable minimum in Figure 5C of this work. The authors should justify/discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>With the new projection into the LDA space, we could make more quantitative estimates of the free energies of the different states. The projection in the LDA space reveals that the concatenation of the free energy surfaces in the original submission led to a wrong positioning of the occluded state at a high free energy ~22 kJ/mol. As a result, there are no highly populated states in the inward-facing region, which is consistent with the companion paper.</p><p>Regarding the occluded state, we appreciate the reviewers’ comments and provide a more extensive explanation of the way we have characterized and described it. To do so, we have clarified both the definition and placement of the occluded state in multiple occasions in the revised manuscript. Firstly, we have clarified how we define the occluded state, following the nomenclature introduced by the Drew lab and adopted by the Yang lab, as an outward-facing state where the TM7b helix is broken (refer to revised Figure 1). Then, an analysis of the structural determinants of each metastable state (defined as conformational ensemble extracted from the free energy basins in Figure 5) is included in the supplementary information.</p><p>Secondly, by definition, the occluded state in GLUT5 must localize in a free energy basin (i.e. be a metastable state), and as close as possible in CV space to where the experimental structures (PfHT1 in the occluded state) fall. In the LDA space, the PfHT1 occluded state still localizes before the highest free energy barrier, while when the projection is carried out in the gate distance space of the companion paper, the PfHT1 occluded state falls directly on the barrier, highlighting the effect of choosing different low-dimensional CVs. Clearly, the occluded state in PfHT1 is a model of a transition state in GLUT5, while the corresponding thermodynamically stable occluded state is located prior to the rocker switch motion, consistent with the predominantly outward-facing nature of the occluded state. While this difference between transition state model and thermodynamically metastable state was mentioned in the original version of our manuscript, we have attempted to improve this discussion in this revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>In addition, an analysis has been provided to show that the labelling of the basin is indeed consistent with the definition in figure 1, which agrees with previous descriptions of the various conformational states, and in particular of the occluded state as described in structural work on PfHT1.

Simulations started from predicted models tend to drift away from the native structure in the multi microseconds time domain, unless restraints are applied. the authors should show compelling evidence that the predicted models used in the simulation are of sufficiently high quality (Proteins 2012; 80:2071-2079). Therefore, the authors should show evidence that the predicted models used in the simulation are of sufficiently high quality, especially if the backbone RMSD deviates over 1 Å from the experimental structure.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess the stability of the models over time, we calculated the heavy-atom RMSD of the extended simulations starting in the GLUT5 predicted states, namely the outward open, outward occluded, inward occluded and inward open models. While most simulations are within the expected range of stability and exhibit little change over the majority of the trajectory, the outward open model seems to fluctuate the most. Since the nature of these fluctuations is relatively discontinuous, we explored whether alternative conformational states are explored. Indeed, while the RMSD is as high as 5-6Å to the starting outward open model, it is significantly lower, between 1.5-2.5Å to the outward occluded model, suggesting that over these timescales, it is possible to observe a conformational change towards the outward occluded state. In addition, projecting the time-evolution of these simulations in LDA CV space paints a similar picture, consistent with the slope of the 1d free energy landscape in this region (Figure 5 - figure supplement 7). Figures have been added in the supporting information to support these statements, and the text describing these features has been expanded (page 11)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. As the free energy calculations are based on simulations started from different structures it would be useful to show free energy estimates from these individual simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the above and find that it is not very informative to show free energy estimates from the individual simulations. In multiple walker AWH, the global free energy estimate is not easily decoupled from each individual walker, but is based on the compounded distribution and response to the adaptive bias. Thus, if we restrict the free energy estimate to a single walker we will simply get the same free energy surface in the space where the given walker has sampled.</p><p>In contrast, to attempt to follow the reviewer’s recommendation to directly report on the sampling from each walker, we calculated the overlap between regions sampled by each walker. To do so, we quantified the overlap by calculating bin-wise the number of walkers whose coordinate distribution exceeds 10%. This is shown in the supporting information (Figure 5 - figure supplement 4,5) and gives a clear picture, along with the calculated errors, of the regions of the free energy surface that can be trusted and the ones which have lower confidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Since the quality of co-evolution analysis is largely dependent on the quality of the BLAST and sequence alignment, more detail regarding the methodology (trimming, manual editing, program parameters, sequence exclusion, etc.) is important to include. The actual sequence alignment and the list of proteins as a supplement should also be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s comments, we have expanded the methods section and provided the necessary details (page 18). We have also uploaded the MSA used for coevolution to our open access Zenodo directory. We have also clarified which parts of the datasets were actually used for the coevolution analysis, and which were omitted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It is hard to fully conceptualize the extent of structural differences with 2D representations of aligned structures.

Following this suggestion, we added RMSD plots of the shown structures and labelled the relevant regions for comparison, as done in the 3D structures.

Though I agree that the presented analysis is likely superior to such techniques, it is essential to demonstrate this quantitatively, both before and after MD simulations. Given the improvements post MD simulation, it would be interesting to see if the superior starting point (biased AlphaFold2 models) leads to a more improved final model, or if MD simulations are sufficient to approach the free energy minimum. This would further demonstrate the necessity of the described methodology and argue for its wider adoption.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentions, it is difficult to provide a quantification of any potential improvement compared to other structure prediction methods such as homology modelling without systematically predicting all presented structures using homology modelling and comparing them to a ground truth. The necessary quantifications would thus require a wider study with different templates and an unambiguous estimate of transporter-specific features. While outside of the scope of this article, there are as of yet no set of transporter-specific features to validate against due to the lack of experimental structures of the solved transporters in all states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The proposed model of proton-coupling suggests conformation-specific pKa's of the aspartate residue, so that the transporter can bind protons in the outward-facing state, yet release protons in the inward-facing state. If this is the case, the co-evolution analysis should reveal residues adjacent (or perhaps even more allosteric) to the aspartate that could regulate the pKa in a conformation-dependent manner. This would be interesting to describe.</p></disp-quote><p>The coevolution analysis reveals all evolutionarily conserved contacts (more specifically, coupled residues) in the protein, whereas uncovering the state-specific function of each contact required the more extended analysis presented in the paper. To determine if and how there is an evolutionary record of a proton chain in this family would require a separate analysis that we deem is beyond the scope of this work, albeit very interesting. In fact, it is not even known whether a proton chain is necessary, or if deprotonation can occur at the same site when the protein is in the inward-facing state. A more focused study on e.g. XylE, a known proton-coupled transporter and relatively well-characterized protein would be more appropriate in this regard. We thus added this proposition in the outlook section of the paper.

We then analyze the conformational ensembles making up free energy minima with respect to these observables, contrasting them with reference values for each structurally-determined state.
