To date, the pathophysiology of PD and Dystonia is still debated. Traditionally, PD is attributed to the degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons which also disrupts other neuromodulary systems, including the cholinergic, serotoninergic and histaminergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolam and Ellender, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deffains and Bergman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fox et al., 2009</xref>). Although there is no degeneration of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons in Dystonia, an imbalance between the midbrain dopaminergic and striatal cholinergic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aosaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benarroch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pisani et al., 2007</xref>), as well as cerebellum dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Helmich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Helmich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tewari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu and Hallett, 2013</xref>) are present in both PD and Dystonia. Nevertheless, basal ganglia (BG) dysfunction is still regarded as the source of the cardinal symptoms of both diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mink, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wichmann, 2018</xref>) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the BG (subthalamic nucleus, STN and internal segment of the globus pallidus, GPi) is an effective invasive treatment for both diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Limousin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Odekerken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ostrem et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The striatum (i.e., the main input structure of the BG network) is the main recipient of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menegas et al., 2015</xref>) and also receives di-synaptic cerebellar projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bostan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>). Most [~95% and~70–80% in rodents and primates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graveland et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Petryszyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petryszyn et al., 2014</xref>)] striatal neurons are medium spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that receive afferents from the cortex and the thalamus, and together with the STN neurons, innervate the central (i.e., external segment of the globus pallidus, GPe) and output (i.e., GPi and substantia nigra reticulata, SNr) BG structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>). Therefore, alterations in striatal signaling disrupt normal BG activity and may lead to the manifestation of the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and Dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Dysregulation of BG activity may consist of changes in discharge rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerfen et al., 1990</xref>). Unlike in all other BG structures, extracellular recordings of spiking activity in non-human primates (NHPs) reveal that SPNs have a very low discharge rate (~1–2 Hz at rest) and are phasically active (i.e. emit short bursts) around relevant behavioral events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crutcher and DeLong, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deffains et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 1990</xref>). However, previous studies of the BG in the NHP model of PD have mainly focused on the STN, GPe and GPi which are structures with a high frequency tonic discharge (i.e. 25–70 Hz at rest) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filion and Tremblay, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wichmann and DeLong, 2003</xref>). These studies have reported excessive GPi/SNr discharge rates in PD that lead to an increase in BG inhibitory outputs to the thalamus and the frontal cortex motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wichmann and DeLong, 2003</xref>). Conversely, it is assumed that Dystonia (and other hyper-kinetic states) are characterized by reduced GPi/SNr activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guehl et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>More recent studies of the BG in animal (rodent and NHP) models of PD and human patients (undergoing DBS procedures) have dealt with changes in discharge patterns and synchronization. Parkinsonism-related β oscillations have been observed in local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in all BG structures, including the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Singh and Papa, 2019</xref>). Similarly, low frequency (4–12 Hz) LFP oscillations have been recorded in the BG network of dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Piña-Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Silberstein et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, synchronous β oscillations are commonly observed in the spiking activity of the STN, GPe and GPi of MPTP-treated monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Soares et al., 2004</xref>) and PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kuhn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moshel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaidel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, direct evidence of abnormal activity of the striatal SPNs is still elusive. Previous studies utilizing the NHP model of PD reported striking increases (~15 fold increase from the normal discharge rate of ~1–2 Hz) in the firing rate of the SPNs subsequent to striatal dopamine depletion and the induction of parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). The same research group also reported a high discharge rate of SPNs recorded in PD and dystonic patients (~30 Hz and 9 Hz, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). They also found a significant change in the firing pattern of striatal neurons, with many SPNs exhibiting bursting activity in PD patients and MPTP monkeys as compared to a smaller fraction in patients with Dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the SPNs of patients with an essential tremor (ET, regarded as a non-BG disorder) have a very low discharge rate (~2 Hz) and no tendency to burst, as reported in normal NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Singh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>These spectacular changes in the discharge rate and pattern of SPNs in the NHP model of PD run counter results obtained in our research group. We recorded the activity of SPNs and other BG neurons in Vervet monkeys before and after systemic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment and the induction of severe parkinsonian symptoms. Although we found robust changes in the discharge properties (rate, pattern and synchronization) of the STN, GPe and BG output structures, we did not observe any difference in the discharge rate (~2–3 Hz) or pattern of SPNs in the MPTP-treated monkeys in comparison to the recordings in the same monkeys before MPTP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deffains and Bergman, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Extracellular recordings of SPN spiking activity of anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>) and awake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kish et al., 1999</xref>) rats before and after striatal dopamine depletion by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment have revealed a significant, but very slight increase in the SPN discharge rate. Rodent studies make it possible to differentiate between SPNs expressing D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. A significant imbalance (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>) in the discharge rate and calcium dynamics of D1 and D2 SPNs was observed in the dopamine-depleted striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, D2 SPNs increased their discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mallet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>) and were also prone to being entrained to parkinsonian β oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the absolute increase in the discharge rate even of the D2 SPNs was still modest (from ~0.5 to~2.8 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have reported no significant increase in the low discharge rate of either SPN subpopulation in striatal dopamine-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maltese et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Since only one research group has recorded drastic increases in the spontaneous spiking activity in the striatum of PD patients in comparison to either dystonic patients or the normal levels of striatal activity reported in healthy animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>), we examined our human patient data to determine whether we could report similar changes. Our study goes beyond previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>) by utilizing a machine learning algorithm to automatically detect striato-pallidal border, and applying objective methods for the identification of units and the quantification of their isolation quality and stationarity. Although extracellular recording methods cannot discriminate between the spiking activity of striatal D1 and D2 SPNs, we assumed that if only one population of striatal neurons was strongly affected by the pathological state, we should observe a significantly higher discharge rate of SPNs than that reported in normal NHPs and ET patients, and/or distinct clusters of SPN activity in our patients. Using this data-driven automated approach, we carefully examined spontaneous single-unit activity from the posterior putamen (i.e., the sensorimotor domain of the striatum) of both PD and dystonic patients undergoing GPi-DBS surgeries and compared their discharge rates and patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Database and spike sorting results</title><p>In this study, 93 microelectrode trajectories (48 in PD and 45 in Dystonia) were used, yielding a total of 933 and 718 microelectrode recording (MER) segments within the posterior putamen (i.e., posterior to the anterior commissure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) of patients suffering from PD and Dystonia, respectively.

To assess the stationarity of the spike trains, we examined the temporal (linear) evolution of their firing rates and spike amplitudes (see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows three representative examples of well-isolated non-stationary units (left panels) and three representative examples of well-isolated stationary units (right panels) from the striatum of PD patients.

Since each LFP was Z-score normalized (using its mean and SD) prior to PSD and STA calculations, PSDs and magnitudes of the STA-LFPs are expressed in z-score^2/Hz and z-score, respectively.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57445-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TANs are hardly distinguishable from SPNs in our human databases</title><p>In order to differentiate between the SPNs and the striatal cholinergic interneurons, the tonically active neurons (TANs, presumably the cholinergic interneurons) were retrospectively identified by three experts (DV, HB and MD) from the well-isolated and stationary striatal units included in both the PD and Dystonia databases. This identification was based on offline visual inspection of their electrophysiological features. The 3D-classifications of the putative SPNs and TANs, using their firing rate, the CV of their ISI and the score of the first principal component (PC1) of their spike waveform did not clearly discriminate them in either PD or dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>, respectively). The same 3D-classification, but using the score of PC2 or PC3 (instead of PC1) yielded the same qualitative results. Unexpectedly, we found that the averaged spike waveform hardly varied between these two subtypes of striatal units in either PD or dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>, respectively).

However, the CV of the ISI was significantly smaller for the putative TANs than for the putative SPNs in both diseases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>, second column), thus corroborating the view that TANs fire in a more regular fashion than the SPNs which are thought to be phasically activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crutcher and DeLong, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deffains et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimura et al., 1990</xref>). The lack of significant differences in the spike waveform and the firing rate between our putative human SPNs and TANs can be accounted in several ways: misclassification of certain neurons, presence of other striatal interneurons (i.e., FSI) and/or differences in extracellular recording techniques (microelectrode type, position/placement, and impedance). Overall, it was difficult to distinguish the TANs from the SPNs in our human databases. Moreover, our spectral analyses did not reveal any significant differences between these two subtypes of striatal neurons in either disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>, third and fourth columns). Therefore, we considered our sorted striatal spiking activity to reflect SPN spiking activity and neglected the small fraction of TANs (which was probably smaller than our estimation).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Outliers and cluster analysis of the striatal spiking features</title><p>Since we did not have a control condition or baseline levels, we could not identify the significant changes in the spiking features of the striatal neuronal activity. Nevertheless, we searched for outliers (i.e., data points that differ significantly from other observations) of each distribution. We examined the extreme values in the distributions and characterized the data points that could belong to a different population than the rest of the sample set. For each distribution, the values of the spiking feature (i.e., firing rate, CV of ISI, β power of the MUA or β power of STA-LFP)≥2 or ≤ −2SDs of its mean value were considered outliers (empirical 68-95-99.7 rule). Remarkably, almost all of the outliers corresponded to feature values ≥ 2 SDs of the mean value, thus indicating (as already observed) that the distributions of the values of the striatal spiking features were skewed to the right in both diseases. Nevertheless, we found that the proportions of outliers (regardless of the spiking feature and the isolation level) were small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, we did not find any significant disease effect on the proportions (chi-square test, p&gt;0.05) or the values (Mann-Whitney U-test, p&gt;0.05) of these outliers when only considering the well-isolated or well-isolated stationary units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To further test whether two distinct SPN subpopulations could be observed in the current study, we performed 2D k-means cluster analysis with k = 2, using the discharge rate and the CV of the ISIs of each unit as input parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).The basic idea behind this 2D k-means clustering was to define 2 clusters of data points so that the total within-cluster variation (i.e., the sum of the Squared Euclidean distances from data points to the cluster centroid) would be minimized within each of the two clusters. Using k = 2 as the predefined number of clusters systematically enforced the separation into two distinct SPN subpopulations. To assess how well-separated the two resulting clusters were, we calculated the silhouette values to measure how close each data point in one cluster was to data points in the other clusters. Silhouette values range from +1 (data points are very distant from other clusters), through 0 (data points are not distinctly in one cluster or another), to −1 (data points are probably assigned to the wrong cluster). The results showed that the two predefined clusters were not well-separated, regardless of the quality of the isolation or the stationarity of the striatal units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, insets). In fact, in most of the scenarios, the second cluster contained a few data points with negative silhouette values, and if not, there were not enough data points to consider it a real cluster that represented a distinct and balanced SPN subpopulation. Equally important, in contrast with the view that discharge rate elevation and bursting activity coexist in the striatum of PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>), the tendency to burst (CV of the ISIs &gt; 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaneoke and Vitek, 1996</xref>) decreased for units with a high discharge rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Similar 2D or higher-order (3 or 4D) k-means cluster analyses (using the discharge rate, CV of the ISIs, MUA β power or STA-LFP β power as input parameters) also failed to reveal two well-separated clusters.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Cluster analysis using discharge properties does not reveal well-separated subpopulations of striatal units in parkinsonian (PD) and dystonic (DYST) patients.</title><p>2D k-means cluster analysis with k = 2, using the firing rate and the CV of the ISIs of each unit as input parameters.

Recordings of the activity of the SPNs are inherently difficult to perform given their very low firing rate and small size, leading to frequent loss and damage of these units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeLong, 1971</xref>). Thus, a particular feature of striatal in vivo extracellular recordings is frequent ‘injury activity’. These difficulties can distort the reported population averages of SPNs. For these reasons, we used an automated data-driven approach. A total of 933 and 718 MER segments from the posterior putamen [i.e., sensorimotor area of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>)] of PD and dystonic patients were analyzed. Here, striatal activity was not recorded in the caudate nucleus, but previous studies have shown that putaminal neurons fire at higher rate than the neurons of the caudate nucleus in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>). The striato-pallidal border was automatically detected using a machine learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Valsky et al., 2020</xref>). MER segments were regularly spaced within the striatum and no manual search for units with low or high discharge rates was performed. Spike detection was performed offline with fully automatic quantification of the isolation quality and stationarity of the identified units. In contrast to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref>), we found no drastic modulation in the SPN discharge rate and pattern (compared to values reported for normal/control animals or ET patients) in PD and dystonic patients.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Low discharge rate and similar levels of striatal activity in PD and Dystonia</title><p>We found that the firing rate of the SPNs of both the PD and dystonic patients was extremely sensitive to the quality of the isolation of the units. Specifically, we found a negative correlation between striatal firing rate and isolation score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The negative correlation between the discharge rate of the detected units and their isolation quality revealed that - unlike in the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deffains et al., 2014</xref>) - the spike detection and sorting algorithm used in this study and/or the physical properties of the striatal neurons tended to erroneously classify noise events as spikes (false positives) rather than missing real spikes (false negatives). The amplitude of the extracellular action potentials (or the signal-to-noise ratio) is mainly sensitive to the impedance of the microelectrode and the distance between the recorded neurons and the microelectrode, and is not related to firing rate of the neurons. Therefore, we can rule out the possibility that fast firing striatal neurons were less frequently well-isolated and under-represented in the high-score bins. Removing the non-stationary units also reduced the striatal firing rate of SPNs in both the PD and dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, first column first column). This may indicate that the inclusion of non-stationary (‘injured’) units can also erroneously increase the striatal firing rate in PD and dystonic patients. Our automatic approach to spike detection, sorting and quality assessment revealed that the median firing rate of the striatal well-isolated stationary units was 3.85 and 2.55 Hz in PD and dystonic patients, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, first column).</p><p>Thus, our results are inconsistent with a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref> where the SPN discharge rate in PD (30.2 ± 1.2 Hz) and dystonic (9.3 ± 0.6 Hz) patients increased by ~15 and 5-fold compared to the low striatal discharge rate (2.1 ± 0.1 Hz) found in patients suffering from ET (i.e., a disorder without any known BG malfunction). In the current study, we did not have a control condition, nor did we record the striatal activity from ET patients. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of an increase in the striatal firing rate of both PD and dystonic patients compared to human controls. Moreover, the small fraction of striatal interneurons (including the TANs, presumably the cholinergic interneurons) that was probably included in our sample may have slightly distorted our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, the putative TANs were hardly distinguishable from the putative SPNs in our human databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and most of the striatal neurons are SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graveland et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Petryszyn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petryszyn et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, in the normal NHP, the discharge rate of the TANs is higher than that of the SPNs, so that their possible inclusion would shift our results towards a higher striatal discharge rate. In any case, we did not find any significant difference between PD and dystonic patients that might reflect a distinct level of striatal hyperactivity in PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, first column). The different results between our study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Singh et al., 2016</xref> may be due to: (i) a difference between machine learning detection vs. manual electrophysiologist detection of the striato-pallidal border, (ii) different spike sorting and detection methods, (iii) the use of algorithms for the quantification of the isolation quality and stationarity of the units vs. manual electrophysiologist decision-making, and (iv) different recording techniques (microelectrode type, step size and regular spaced recordings vs. manual search of the recording sites).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lack of bursty and oscillatory pattern in the SPN spiking activity of PD and dystonic patients</title><p>The emergence of bursty and periodic oscillatory patterns after striatal dopamine depletion has been observed in other BG nuclei than the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Filion and Tremblay, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heimer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Raz et al., 2000</xref>).

Levodopa-induced increases or decreases of the SPN firing rate may be the result of D1 or D2 receptor activation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kitai and Surmeier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">West and Grace, 2002</xref>). Using the recognized responses to dopaminergic stimulation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Singh et al., 2015</xref> showed that most bursty SPNs in the parkinsonian NHP exhibited a D1 receptor response to levodopa, thus suggesting that the emergence of an abnormal firing pattern predominantly affected the D1 SPNs (i.e., the SPNs of the direct pathway). However, when using a single-cell juxtacellular recording-labeling technique in the 6OHDA rodent, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref> showed that in addition to their excessive firing rate, D2 SPNs (that primarily compose the indirect pathway) displayed aberrant phase-locked burst firing to cortical β oscillations. In that study, it might be assumed that D2 SPNs, rather than D1 SPNs, would exhibit an abnormal firing rate and pattern in the dopamine-depleted striatum. Therefore, technical advances and further studies in PD patients and animal models should be carried out to reach a consensus.</p><p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Piña-Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Silberstein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Singh and Papa, 2019</xref>), abnormal oscillations of the LFP have been recorded in the striatum of both PD and dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The LFP most likely represents the sub-threshold (e.g., synaptic input) activity, whereas the MUA reflects the efferent (output) activity of the local neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Logothetis, 2003</xref>). In both diseases, striatal SPNs were therefore bombarded with pathological oscillations by their major afferent neurons, thus suggesting that the emergence of striatal β LFP oscillations is network-driven. Interestingly, other studies have shown that changes in the intrinsic properties of striatal neurons (i.e., increasing SPN excitability through amplification of striatal cholinergic tone) is sufficient to induce robust β LFP oscillations in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCarthy et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the limitations of human extracellular recordings, we were not able to investigate the intrinsic properties of the striatal neurons and therefore cannot rule out the possibility that the intrinsic properties of the striatal neurons played a role in the emergence of β LFP oscillations in the striatum. In fact, it is likely that network-based and cell-autonomous mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In any case, we found no significant phase-locking between striatal spiking activity and monopolar recorded LFP β oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, fourth column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), thus suggesting that the striatal oscillating synaptic inputs were probably not strong enough to entrain the spiking activity of the striatal SPNs. Indeed, the striatal SPNs failed to express pathological β oscillatory activity in either PD or Dystonia. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that monopolar and bipolar BG LFPs may be contaminated by the volume conductance of cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marmor et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that BG LFPs, including the LFPs recorded in the striatum, do not accurately reflect local cellular activity and should be at best interpreted with caution. Exaggerated striatal LFP oscillations in PD and Dystonia cannot therefore be regarded as direct evidence for the presence of SPN spiking oscillatory activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Is the imbalance in the activity of SPN subpopulations evident in PD and Dystonia?</title><p>Obviously, striatal activity must be affected in PD and dystonic patients. A popular theory is that the hypoactivity of the direct pathway (originating from D1 SPNs) and the hyperactivity of the indirect pathway (originating from D2 SPNs) lead to excessive GPi/SNr inhibitory inputs to the thalamus in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wichmann and DeLong, 2003</xref>) and vice-versa in Dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guehl et al., 2009</xref>). These aberrant GPi/SNr inhibitory inputs to the thalamus lead to the release of abnormal output commands and result in the emergence of the clinical symptoms. Unlike in rodent studies [see e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sharott et al., 2017</xref>)], extracellular recordings of spontaneous activity cannot discriminate between the spiking activity of the striatal D1 and D2 SPNs. However, if striatal dopamine depletion drastically enhances the differences (in discharge rate and pattern) between the two distinct SPN subpopulations (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>), one would expect to see a bimodal distribution of SPN discharge properties after dopamine depletion and/or distinct clusters of SPN activity in our patients. Instead, visual inspection of the distributions of the discharge rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and the CVs of ISIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) revealed long-tailed unimodal distributions in both diseases. Moreover, the cluster analysis using SPN discharge properties failed to identify two well-separated SPN subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our results in patients extend our previous study in the MPTP NHP model of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>) and studies in the 6-OHDA rodent model (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ketzef et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maltese et al., 2019</xref>) and demonstrate that abnormal activity along both the direct and indirect pathways of the BG network is not caused by drastic changes in spontaneous SPN spiking activity. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maltese et al., 2019</xref> reported abnormal recruitment (e.g., during behavior) of D1 and D2 SPNs (which are mostly silent at rest in the healthy condition) in parkinsonism that resulted in an aberrant net balance of striatal outputs, although there were no changes in the firing rate of the individual neurons. Our experimental approach (i.e., extracellular recordings in awake patients in the operating room) does not allow us to estimate the sample size of activated neurons. Moreover, we did not have a control condition and recordings were not performed during behavior to minimize surgical procedure time. Therefore, further experiments in primates (at least in monkeys, if not in patients) are needed to validate or refute this possibility. It is likely that these small to moderate changes in spontaneous SPN discharge are amplified by BG downstream structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crompe et al., 2020</xref>), thus leading to the clinical symptoms of PD and possibly of Dystonia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and surgery</title><p>Patients with PD and Dystonia were recruited from the movement disorders clinics at the Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem.

Pre-operative imaging was performed on a 1.5T or 3T MRI and included a pre-operative T1 and T2 sequence. All patients received post-operative CT. The post-operative CT was co-registered to anchor modality with the pre-operative T1 MRI, using a two-stage linear registration (rigid followed by affine) as implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avants et al., 2008</xref>). Linear co-registration between the MR T1 and T2 modalities was done using SPM12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Penny et al., 2007</xref>). Pre- (and post-) operative acquisitions were spatially normalized into MNI_ICBM_2009b_NLIN_ASYM space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fonov et al., 2011</xref>) based on pre-operative acquisitions using the Symmetric Normalization (SyN) registration approach as implemented in Advanced Normalization Tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avants et al., 2008</xref>).

For each band-pass filtered spiking signal (multi-unit activity, MUA), spikes were detected using a negative voltage threshold trigger systematically set at 3SDs from the mean of its peak height histogram. Salient features of the detected spikes were extracted with principal component analysis, using the scores of the first two principal components as features for clustering. Then, identification of different spike clusters reflecting the activity of different units was done by an automatic k-means clustering algorithm (K-Means Scan with a number of clusters between 1 and 5 and a circular seed cluster pattern for choosing the initial cluster centers). The clustering that produced the best value of the Pseudo-F statistic was then chosen as the clustering pattern for that band-pass filtered spiking signal. Finally, the isolation quality of the units identified by the spike sorter software was systematically graded by measuring their isolation scores using an independent algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Joshua et al., 2007</xref>). The isolation score ranges from 0 (i.e. highly noisy) to 1 (i.e. perfect isolation).</p><p>To assess the stationarity of the firing rate and spike amplitude of each well-isolated unit (isolation score ≥0.6), we segmented the data comprised between the first and the last spike of its spike train into 10 equal non-overlapping time bins. Then, we Z-score normalized the firing rate and the average spike amplitude in each bin using the mean and the SD of either the firing rate or the average spike amplitude calculated over the 10 bins. Finally, the slope value of the linear regression line for the firing rate and the average spike amplitude were calculated and expressed in z-score/bin. Units with slope values of the linear regression line for the firing rate or average spike amplitude that were greater than or equal to the 70th percentile were defined as non-stationary units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Discharge pattern assessment of spike train</title><p>For each spike train of the sorted units, we calculated the inter-spike intervals (ISI) and generated their ISI histograms. In parallel, we also computed the autocorrelograms of the spike train of the well-isolated stationary units, calculated for ±500 ms offset with 10ms-bins. For each autocorrelogram, values were normalized so that autocorrelation values ranged from 0 to 1.</p><p>For burst detection, we applied the Poisson surprise method with the surprise maximization (SM) search algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Legéndy and Salcman, 1985</xref>) to each spike train of the well-isolated stationary units, using the following parameters: minimal burst length = 3 spikes; threshold surprise value (S) = 10; burst ISI limit = mean (ISI)/2; add limit = 150% of burst ISI limit and inclusion criteria (IC) = 5.</p><p>For each spike train of the well-isolated stationary units, the frequency (number of bursts/s) and mean duration (s) of the burst episodes were calculated over their entire recording span. These two metrics were used to determine the burst prevalence for each unit which was defined as the burst frequency * mean burst duration. For each unit, the burst prevalence (range: 0–1) represents the probability that the discharge pattern is bursty.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Power spectral density</title><p>Prior to power spectral density (PSD) calculations, each band-pass filtered spiking signal (multi-unit activity, MUA) recorded in the vicinity of a sorted unit was Z-score normalized (using its mean and SD) to obtain an unbiased estimate (by the electrode impedance, the A/D characteristics of the recording system, or the amplitude of the recorded neuronal activity) of the oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaidel et al., 2010</xref>). The Z-normalized signal was rectified by the ‘absolute’ operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deffains et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zaidel et al., 2010</xref>). The rectified signal follows the envelope of the MUA and therefore enables the detection of periodic oscillatory activities with frequencies below the range of the online band-pass filter. Since the LFP frequency domain was filtered out, the resulting PSD only represented the oscillatory features of the spiking activity. Although up to five units could be sorted from each MUA (see above in <italic>Offline spike sorting and assessment of isolation quality and stationarity of sorted units</italic>), each MUA was only analyzed once.</p><p>The PSD of each rectified Z-normalized signal (expressed in z-score^2/Hz) was calculated using Welch's method with a 1 s Hamming window (50% overlap) and a spectral resolution of 1 Hz (nfft = 44000 or 48000, sampling frequency = 44 or 48 kHz depending on the acquisition system). To evaluate the β power, the baseline values in the 13–30 Hz range of each PSD were linearly interpolated [based on the two closest points that flanked the 13–30 Hz band, namely the values at 12 and 31 Hz (spectral resolution of 1 Hz, see above)] and averaged. Then, the β power (i.e., the mean of the observed values between 13 and 30 Hz) was compared to the interpolated β power (baseline).</p><p>Similarly, we also calculated the PSD of the striatal monopolar (0.1–300 Hz) LFP. To do so, the PSD of each Z-normalized LFP was calculated using Welch's method recorded in the vicinity of the cells (see above for the parameters; but nfft = 1375, sampling frequency = 1.375 kHz) and without prior rectification by the absolute operator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spike-triggered average of the LFP</title><p>To investigate the spike-LFP relationship in the temporal domain, we also calculated the spike-triggered average (STA) of the LFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deffains et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldberg et al., 2004</xref>). To do so, the LFP was recorded in the vicinity of the sorted units (i.e., spiking activity and LFP were recorded on the same electrode). Each Z-normalized LFP was offline band-pass filtered from 4 to 12 Hz or from 13 to 30 Hz (4-pole Butterworth filter, filtfilt Matlab function). For comparison, STAs-LFP were also calculated after randomly shifting the timestamp of each spike of the spike train [i.e., random time (comprised between 0 and 1 s) was added to the timestamp of each spike of the spike train] in order to abolish any relationship between LFP and spiking activity (Shift predictor). The PSD of the STA-LFP was calculated as for the LFP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Software and statistics</title><p>Anatomical analysis was done with the open source LeadDBS program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lead-dbs.org">www.lead-dbs.org</ext-link>).

There is disagreement in existing literature as to whether the spiking activity of striatal projection neurons (SPNs) is grossly abnormal (as reported by Papas and colleagues) or not (as reported by several groups including some of the current authors). The authors recorded from SPNs in PD and dystonia patients during DBS implantation surgeries. The study is methodologically rigorous, using recordings from regularly spaced striatal locations, and highly automated recording and analysis procedures, thus avoiding sampling biases and the subjectivity of some data analysis steps. The authors show convincingly that firing rates and firing patterns of striatal neurons in PD patients do not differ significantly from those in patients with dystonia. Some disease-dependent differences were initially observed in firing rate and burst firing, but those differences disappeared when analysis was restricted to well-isolated stationary recordings, setting the bar for the level of rigor for data analysis that should be emulated by other groups. The recordings also showed no evidence of oscillatory firing (e.g., at β frequencies) or spike-field locking. Cluster analysis failed to yield evidence for the presence of subpopulations of SPNs. This is a significant study that may help us to better understand the discrepant literature results regarding striatal firing abnormalities in parkinsonism. The authors conclude that SPN activity is not grossly abnormal in PD and dystonia, as some investigators have reported. The finding that SPN neurons in PD patients do not show increased firing rates or changes in overall firing pattern challenges the long-standing theory that indirect pathway hyperactivity is caused by increased firing rates of D2-expressing SPNs and suggests that dopamine loss in parkinsonism may alter striatal processing more during active behaviours than at rest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Rebalance the number of main figures vs. supplementary figures: The rationale for having only three figures, but many supplementary figures, is an odd choice. Supplementary Figure 2A-D should be incorporated in the manuscript as figures, not supplements.</p><p>2) Revise the recording location figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) to provide clearer information about recording locations. The study is not concerned with DBS lead placement (as shown in the figure), but with microelectrode recordings. It would be more useful to show example microelectrode track trajectories in the figure, or to simply state in the text that the trajectories penetrated mostly the putamen, as they apparently did. It definitely is not necessary (and quite confusing) to show projections on 5 different brain atlases in the same figure. Is there a concern that the very different results of Singh et al. came from a different striatal territory? It would be useful to many readers if the authors explained the importance of recording location and any differences in recording locations between the current study and those in previous studies. The manuscript states that recordings were obtained from the sensorimotor part of putamen, but Figure 1—figure supplement 1 does not illustrate this point adequately. The small-scale 3-dimensional images do not provide adequate insight to the specific parts of putamen sampled from. The LeadDBS package provides a way to illustrate all recording trajectories, not just one as appears to be shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Why multiple atlases are shown in this figure is not clear. Given the double oblique approach described, it is likely that recording trajectories passed through the most dorsal-medial part of putamen, which in NHPs is the termination site for projections from SMA, not primary motor cortex. This does not raise serious problems for the impact of the current study, but the impact of the current study would be enhanced by better documentation of all recording locations.</p><p>3) Population-level comparisons vs. single units: Many of the results are presented as population medians/means.

Since we did not have a control/healthy condition or baseline levels, we cannot identify significant changes. Nevertheless, we decided to find the “outliers” of each distribution and then compare them (in terms of proportion and value). For each distribution, the values of the parameter (i.e., firing rate, CV of ISI, β power of the MUA or β power of STA-LFP) ≥ 2 or ≤ -2SDs of its mean value were considered outliers (empirical 68-95-99.7 rule). Remarkably, only one non well-isolated unit (Iso.sc&lt; 0.6) exhibited a parameter value (i.e. CV of ISI) ≤ -2SDs of the mean value of the parameter. In the subsequent analyses, we therefore only considered the outliers that corresponded to the parameter values ≥ 2SDs of the mean value of the parameter. The results showed that the proportions of outliers (regardless of the parameter and the isolation level) were small. Moreover, we did not find any significant disease effect on the proportions (chi-square test, p &gt; 0.05) or the values (Mann-Whitney U-test, p &gt; 0.05) of these outliers when only considering the well-isolated or well-isolated stationary units. These observations are now reported in the main text of the revised version of the manuscript and in one new figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Clarification of analysis procedures:</p><p>– The methods and analysis strategy for Figure 3 was hard to follow by aficionados.

Thus, it seems appropriate to provide a more detailed description of that automated procedure. It is possible to use Offline Sorter in non-automated ways that open up the potential for bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important issue. It is true that spike detection and sorting outcomes can vary from one experimenter to another if the procedure is not fully automatic. In fact, in most applications, the amplitude thresholds can be set manually for spike detection and the boundaries for the different clusters can also be manually delineated. Equally important, a posteriori visual inspection of the waveforms of the sorted units is commonly carried out to add or remove specific spikes (i.e. subjective “cleaning” of the spike train). Such approaches are problematic because they depend on subjective individual decision-making and may lead to potential errors (Pedreira et al., 2012; Rey et al., 2015); namely erroneously classifying noise events as spikes (false positives) or missing real spikes (false negatives). To avoid these human biases that could jeopardize our results, single-unit striatal activity was assessed by sorting spike trains from each MER segment recorded within the striatum using an automatic offline spike detection and sorting method (Offline Sorter v4.4.2.0, Plexon Inc, Dallas, Texas). For each band-pass filtered spiking signal (multi-unit activity, MUA), spikes were detected using a negative voltage threshold trigger systematically set at 3SDs from the mean of its peak height histogram. Salient features of the detected spikes were extracted with principal component analysis, using the scores of the first two principal components as features for clustering. Then, identification of different spike clusters reflecting the activity of different units was done by an automatic k-means clustering algorithm (K-Means Scan with a number of clusters between 1 and 5 and a circular seed cluster pattern for choosing the initial cluster centers). The clustering that produced the best value of the Pseudo-F statistic was then chosen as the clustering pattern for that band-pass filtered spiking signal. Finally, the isolation quality of the units identified by the spike sorter software was systematically graded by measuring their isolation scores using an independent algorithm (Joshua et al., 2007). The isolation score ranges from 0 (i.e. highly noisy) to 1 (i.e. perfect isolation). We added this more detailed description of our spike detection and sorting method to the Materials and methods section of the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2 and accompanying text: The authors should explain their method of z-scoring the power spectral density plots.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that we should clarify how the β power was expressed in z-score^2/Hz. Here, we did not Z-normalize the PSD plots themselves. In fact, each band-pass filtered spiking signal (MUA) recorded in the vicinity of a sorted unit was Z-score normalized prior to PSD calculations (Deffains et al., 2014). The Z-score normalization (or standardization) of each signal was performed using its mean and SD. This procedure is now described both in the Materials and methods and in the legend of Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2—figure supplement 2: The Z-normalization procedure for firing rates and amplitudes is not clear. Which mean and standard deviation are used for the z-scoring (normalization)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive comment and agree that the Z-score normalization procedure for firing rates and amplitudes was not clear in the text of our original manuscript. For each spike train, we segmented the data comprised between the first and the last spike of the spike train into 10 equal non-overlapping time bins. Then, we calculated the firing rate and the average spike amplitude in each bin. Finally, to compare patients and diseases, we Z-score normalized the firing rate and the average spike amplitude in each bin, using the mean and the SD of either the firing rate or the average spike amplitude calculated over the 10 bins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Although SPNs do not show significant phase locking to β oscillations, the authors state that in monkeys, TANs do show significant phase locking following MPTP treatment. TANs can be distinguished from SPNs based on waveform analysis. Can the authors use waveforms to isolate TANs from the human data set, and show that these neurons exhibit significant phase locking? This would strengthen their conclusions about the lack of phase locking observed in SPNs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that in our previous study in NHPs, we found that the spiking activity of the striatal TANs was synchronized (phase locked) to the LFP recorded in their surrounding areas. To address this issue in the current study, TANs were identified by 3 experts (DV, HB and MD) from the well-isolated and stationary striatal units included in both the PD and Dystonia databases. This identification was based on offline visual inspection of their electrophysiological features, including their spike waveforms. The 3D-classifications of the putative SPNs and TANs, using their firing rate, the CV of their ISI and the score of the first principal component (PC1) of their spike waveform did not clearly discriminate them in either PD or dystonic patients (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, respectively). The same 3D-classification, but using the score of PC2 or PC3 (instead of PC1) yielded the same qualitative results. Retrospectively, we found that, contrary to our expectations, the averaged spike waveform hardly varied between these two subtypes of striatal units in either the PD or dystonic patients (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, respectively). Moreover, we did not find significant differences in the firing rate of the putative SPNs and TANs in PD (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D, first column) or dystonic (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D, first column) patients. However, the CV of the ISI was significantly smaller for the putative TANs than for the putative SPNs in both diseases (Figures 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D, second column), thus corroborating the view that TANs fire in a more regular fashion than the SPNs that are thought to be phasically activated (Crutcher and DeLong, 1984; Deffains et al., 2010; Kimura et al., 1990). Alternatively, experts might be more biased by the discharge pattern of the units. The lack of significant differences in the spike waveform and the firing rate between our putative human SPNs and TANs can be accounted for in several ways: misclassification of certain neurons, presence of other striatal interneurons (i.e., FSI) and different extracellular recording techniques (microelectrode type, position/placement, and impedance). Overall, it was difficult to distinguish the TANs from the SPNs in our human databases. Since our spectral analyses did not reveal any significant differences between these two subtypes of striatal neurons in either disease (Figures 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D, third and fourth columns), we therefore decided not to exclude the fraction of putative TANs probably included in our samples.</p><p>Nevertheless, these spectral results should be interpreted with caution due to our inability to reliably identify the TANs in our human databases and in fact we cannot rule out the possibility that a small fraction of TANs probably included in our samples (which is most likely smaller than what we estimated) may have slightly distorted our results. We now address this important issue in the main text of the revised version of the manuscript and in the two new figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p></body></sub-article></article>
