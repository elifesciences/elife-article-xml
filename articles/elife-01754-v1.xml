The structural basis for the hijacking of AP-2 by Nef is revealed by a 2.9 Å crystal structure of Nef bound to the α and σ2 subunits of AP-2. Nef binds to AP-2 via its central loop (residues 149–179) and its core. The determinants for Nef binding include residues that directly contact AP-2 and others that stabilize the binding-competent conformation of the central loop. Residues involved in both direct and indirect interactions are required for the binding of Nef to AP-2 and for downregulation of CD4. These results lead to a model for the docking of the full AP-2 tetramer to membranes as bound to Nef, such that the cytosolic tail of CD4 is situated to interact with its binding site on Nef.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01754.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01754.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01754.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Infection by a pathogen, such as a bacterium or virus, activates both the innate immune response—which is immediate but not specific to the pathogen—and the adaptive immune response, which is stronger and specific to the pathogen.

This information could be used to develop drugs that work by blocking the amino residues on AP-2 that bind to Nef.

HIV-1 has a small genome encoding the main structural proteins Gag, Pol and Env, the regulatory proteins Tat and Rev, and the accessory proteins Nef, Vif, Vpr, and Vpu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frankel and Young, 1998</xref>). During viral maturation, Pol is proteolytically cleaved to generate three proteins with enzymatic activity: the viral protease, integrase, and reverse transcriptase. These enzymes are the main targets for chemotherapeutic agents currently in use for the prevention and treatment of AIDS. Combination therapies with these agents have dramatically reduced HIV-1 transmission as well as HIV-1-associated morbidity and mortality. However, concerns about the development of drug resistance in addition to their side effects have fueled a continued search for additional targets. The accessory protein Nef was recognized early on as a potential target for inhibition of the pathogenic effects of HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foster and Garcia, 2008</xref>). Although not essential for infection in cell culture, Nef enhances viral replication and disease progression in vivo. The pathogenic effects of Nef are underscored by the observation that patients infected with Nef-deficient strains of HIV-1 often do not develop AIDS for over 10 years even if untreated (these patients are referred to as ‘long-term non-progressors’ or ‘slow progressors’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deacon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirchhoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gorry et al., 2007</xref>). Inhibition of Nef thus holds the promise to have a similarly beneficial effect. To date, however, this potential has not been realized mainly because Nef has no enzymatic activity and its mechanisms of action are insufficiently understood.</p><p>At the cellular level, Nef has been ascribed multiple functions, of which the best characterized and most critical for pathogenesis is the downregulation of CD4 from the surface of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guy et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garcia and Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glushakova et al., 2001</xref>). CD4 is a transmembrane protein that acts as a co-receptor in both the host’s immune response and the initial binding of HIV-1 to their target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowers et al., 1997</xref>). Nef-induced CD4 downregulation interferes with the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skowronski et al., 1993</xref>), prevents superinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benson et al., 1993</xref>) and promotes virion release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lama et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ross et al., 1999</xref>), all of which contribute to enhanced HIV-1 propagation. HIV-1 Nef is a small, polymorphic protein of 200–215 amino acids having a myristoylated N-terminus. X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arold et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horenkamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jia et al., 2012</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grzesiek et al., 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1997</xref>) have shown that Nef has a folded core (residues 55–65 and 84–203), with flexible N-terminal (residues 1–54) and C-terminal (residues 204–206) segments, and a central flexible loop (residues 149–179) (residue numbers correspond to the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1). CD4 downregulation depends on both Nef myristoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiken et al., 1994</xref>) and specific residues in the loop, including Leu164 and Leu165 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresnahan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Craig et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greenberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janvier et al., 2003</xref>), which are in a sequence context fitting the [DE]XXXL[LI] motif for dileucine-based sorting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>), and the diacidic motif, Asp174-Asp175 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aiken et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindwasser et al., 2008</xref>). Myristoylation allows recruitment of Nef from the cytosol to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu and Felsted, 1992</xref>) while the loop engages the clathrin-associated adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindwasser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). The Nef:AP-2 complex interacts with the cytosolic tail of CD4, leading to the cooperative assembly of a tripartite Nef:AP-2:CD4 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaudhuri et al., 2009</xref>). This complex nucleates the formation of clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burtey et al., 2007</xref>) that mediate rapid internalization of CD4, followed by its delivery to lysosomes via the multivesicular body pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aiken et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhee and Marsh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">daSilva et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Biochemical analyses have demonstrated that binding of Nef to AP-2 is direct and dependent on the dileucine and diacidic motifs, and other residues, in the Nef loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindwasser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaudhuri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattera et al., 2011</xref>). AP-2 is a heterotetramer composed of α, β2, μ2 and σ2 subunits. The N-terminal ‘trunk’ domains of α and β2 together with the whole μ2 and σ2 subunits constitute the core of the complex, whereas the C-terminal ‘hinge’ and ‘ear’ domains of α and β2 form long projections that extend from the core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owen et al., 2004</xref>). The AP-2 core undergoes a large conformation change from a ‘locked’ to an ‘open’ conformation that allows it to bind sorting signals and to be recruited to membranes via interaction with the phosphatidylinositol lipid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). Nef has been shown to bind to the α–σ2 ‘hemicomplex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doray et al., 2007</xref>). The σ2 subunit (with a small contribution from the α subunit), harbors a binding site for [DE]XXXL[LI]-type signals from host cell proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattera et al., 2011</xref>). Mutational analyses have shown that this site is also required for Nef binding, most likely through recognition of the Nef dileucine motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattera et al., 2011</xref>). The α subunit has an additional site, comprising Lys298 and Arg341, which is also required for Nef binding and CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaudhuri et al., 2009</xref>). Although it is tempting to hypothesize that these basic residues interact with the Nef diacidic motif, there is currently no direct evidence for such an interaction. Importantly, this second site on α is not known to participate in any host cell function, making it a possible target for selective interference.</p><p>Despite progress in the identification of determinants of the Nef-AP-2 interaction, the conformation of the Nef loop when bound to AP-2 and the molecular details of the interaction are not known. To elucidate the structural basis for this interaction, we have solved the crystal structure at 2.9 Å resolution of Nef (residues 54–203) in complex with the α (residues 1–396) and σ2 (full-length) subunits of AP-2. The structure reveals that the entire central loop is well ordered, and that most of it contacts the α−σ2 hemicomplex. The Nef core is directly involved in contacts as well as serves as a scaffold to position the central loop. The structure leads to a model for the docking of HIV-1 Nef onto the plasma membrane in conjunction with AP-2, and suggests how the AP-2:Nef complex binds to the CD4 cytosolic tail in the membrane setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-affinity binding of HIV-1 Nef to the α–σ2 hemicomplex</title><p>In the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes, the AP-2 core is in a locked conformation that has low affinity for both physiological cargoes and Nef. Previously, we assayed a version of the AP-2 core in which the μ2 C-terminal domain was deleted so as to destabilize the locked conformation.

However, the conformational lability introduced into this construct made it unsuitable for crystallization. We built on the finding that Nef interacts with the α–σ2 hemicomplex as judged by yeast three hybrid (Y3H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhuri et al., 2007</xref>) and pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doray et al., 2007</xref>). Hemicomplex constructs including the full α trunk domain are poorly stable, because a large amount of hydrophobic surface area is exposed on the C-terminal part of the trunk domain when the hemicomplex is excised from the intact AP-2 core. A truncated version of the homologous γ-ζ hemicomplex of COPI including the first 17 helices of the γ trunk domain was found to be suitable for crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). We designed a construct comprising the first 19 helices (residues 1–396) of the α trunk domain and co-expressed it with full-length σ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

The intramolecular interactions of H4 are with other sections of the central loop, explaining why this helix has not been observed in other structures of Nef. The Leu164-Leu165 pair of the dileucine motif anchors the loop in a pocket on σ2 just as seen for a dileucine peptide bound to the unlatched AP-2 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The dileucine peptide in the unlatched structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>) used for comparison is derived from CD4, but it is important to emphasize that this binding mode is dependent on phosphorylation and is unrelated to Nef-dependent downregulation. The pocket walls are formed by hydrophobic residues of σ2. Nef Glu160 of the motif binds to basic residues on both σ2 and α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Residues of H4, notably Glu154, make electrostatic interactions with a second basic patch on σ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Their structure clearly depends on the interactions with α–σ2, since they are not otherwise visualized in this conformation. However, the Nef core also seems to have an important role in organizing this segment. H5 packs against the β-sheet of the core, and serves primarily to orient the hydrophobic loop with respect to the dileucine motif. The tight turns of the C-terminal part of the loop serve to project a number of charged and hydrophobic side chains into complementary interactions with both α and σ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This unusual sequence of turns is anchored at its ends by H5 and by the strand β5 of the core. The whole turn-rich section of the loop from 171–179 is anchored internally by a hydrogen bond between Nef Asp174 and the main-chain amide of Gln104, and by a partially buried salt bridge between Nef Asp175 of the loop and Nef Arg134 of the core β sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>The structure also reveals that residues of Nef helix H3 of the core directly contact AP-2. In particular, Gln104, Arg105, and Asp108 bind to a basic patch on α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This polar interface adjoins the mixed polar and hydrophobic interface created by the C-terminal turn segment of the central loop. There is one other minor interaction with the core region, involving Nef Pro129 of the β2-β3 loop. The Pro side-chain forms van der Waals interactions with atoms of the α Arg341 side-chain. While the central loop clearly dominates the interactions overall, the Nef core interactions are also significant, and represents one of the completely unexpected findings from the structural analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nef residues in AP-2 binding and CD4 downregulation</title><p>The Nef-AP-2 interaction is so central to CD4 downregulation that it has inspired exhaustive mutational analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aiken et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hua et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Craig et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Janvier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindwasser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chaudhuri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mattera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jin et al., 2013</xref>).

The present structure revealed that Nef Glu177 is the primary interaction partner for α Arg341. The Nef E177K mutant manifested a reduction in both α–σ2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>), consistent with its structural role. The deepened insight obtained from the crystal structure shows that this patch is better conceived of as a polar, rather than basic, patch. For example, the side chain of α Glu342 has a close approach to Nef Arg178.</p><p>The finding that Nef Asp174 and Asp175 do not contact AP-2 directly was a surprise. These two residues are required for AP-2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindwasser et al., 2008</xref>), and had been expected to interact with a basic patch on α. They are, in fact, in the general vicinity of a basic patch, close to α Lys298 and Lys299. Nevertheless, Asp174, while close to the interface, is not in direct contact with AP-2. Its key role appears to be to anchor the turn section to the N-terminus of helix H3. The partial positive charge at the helix N-terminus can form an interaction with Asp side-chains that is almost as energetically favorable as a salt bridge. In this case, a short hydrogen bond is formed with the main-chain amide group of Nef Gln104. Asp175 has a similar role in conformational stabilization. Asp175 is partially buried in a contact with the Nef core, and forms a salt bridge with Arg134. We hypothesized that the internal Nef Arg134-Asp175 internal salt bridge is important for stabilizing the C-terminal turn portion of the central loop in its AP-2 binding conformation. Indeed, mutation of Arg134 to Glu abrogated interaction of Nef with α–σ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, co-expression in HeLa cells of CD4 with Nef R134E followed by FACS analysis showed that this Nef mutant almost completely lost its ability to downregulate CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). These results phenocopy the D175A change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindwasser et al., 2008</xref>) and are consistent with a critical role for the salt bridge in stabilizing the conformation of the Nef loop required for AP-2 binding and CD4 downregulation.</p><p>While most mutational studies of the Nef-AP-2 interaction focused on the Nef central loop, one face of helix H3, including residues Gln104 and Asp108, contacts AP-2. The Nef mutant Q104A behaves like wild type in both binding to α–σ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This mutation does not alter the main-chain, and so will not affect the ability of the main-chain of residue 104 to help anchor the central loop via Asp174. The charge-reversal mutant D108K, however, eliminates α–σ2 binding as judged by Y3H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and CD4 downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This finding is consistent with the salt bridge seen between α Lys299 and Nef Asp108 in the structure. Another core residue, Pro129, has limited van der Waals interactions with α, thus it was not surprising that its mutation has no effect on the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results corroborate the importance of core helix H3 in the AP-2 interaction and CD4 downregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The membrane-bound AP-2:Nef complex</title><p>AP complexes function as membrane-bound, tetrameric assemblies.

Indeed, the exposed face of H1 conjoins with H2 and parts of the central loop of Nef and the membrane-proximal parts of AP-2 to form a bowl that is 30 × 30 Å across, with a clearance of ∼10 Å from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Strikingly, the exposed face of H1 contains residues Trp57 and Leu58 that have been implicated in direct binding to CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grzesiek et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Other residues implicated in CD4 binding, including Leu97, Arg106, and Leu110, also project into the bowl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grzesiek et al., 1996a</xref>). The edge of the bowl includes residues from α, σ2, and β2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). This suggests that multivalent interactions between Nef, CD4, and AP-2 likely drive cooperativity in the formation of the ternary complex.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01754.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Docking of the unlocked AP-2:Nef complex to the membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The unlocked conformation of AP-2 core bound to myristoylated Nef (orange).

The large majority of Nef residues that have been implicated in CD4 downregulation reside in the central loop. The structure shows that all of these residues are well ordered in the complex, in contrast to all previous structures of Nef–effector complexes. Nearly all of these Nef residues directly contact AP-2. One notable exception is Asp175, which had been anticipated to bind to a basic patch on the surface of the α subunit. The structure revealed an unexpected role for Asp175 in stabilizing the conformation of the central loop. The structure also shows that the Nef core has both a direct role in forming polar interactions with AP-2 and an indirect role in scaffolding the conformation of the central loop. The role of Asp174 and Asp175 amounts to the formation of an effector-specific polar core within Nef. This provides insight into the underlying reason for the unusual architecture of Nef, as a single domain protein with disproportionately large internal loops. This architecture gives Nef an exceptional degree of plasticity, allowing multiple functions to be encoded within a relatively small structure.</p><p>The structure is beautifully consistent with the emerging consensus picture that all activated AP complexes seem to bind to membranes in the same conformation and the same geometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Canagarajah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ren et al., 2013</xref>). The membrane-docking geometry suggested by the unlocked states of AP-1 and AP-2 places Nef such that it is touching the membrane, with its N-terminal region membrane proximal. This is consistent with its essential N-terminal myristoylation. One question still to be resolved is the disposition of the first helix of the β2-adaptin trunk, which collides sterically with Nef in the modeled conformation. It seems straightforward that this helix could pivot out of the way, but this has yet to be directly tested. The general proximity of Nef, and its N-terminal region in particular, to the membrane is similar to the model proposed for the AP-1:Nef complex that functions in MHC-I downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jia et al., 2012</xref>). However, the details of the molecular contacts between Nef and the membrane surface differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This suggests that Nef has more than one way to interact with membrane surfaces.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01754.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Nef uses different surfaces to bind to different regions of AP-1 and AP-2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nef binds to different subunits of AP-2 (top) and AP-1 (bottom), but docks onto the membrane in both cases.

Residues of Nef helices H1 and H3 that are implicated in CD4 binding form one edge of a cavern 10 Å high and 30 × 30 Å across, with the membrane serving as the floor. The Nef binding site on CD4 comprises an approximate 17-residue tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Preusser et al., 2001</xref>) that begins ∼10 residues C-terminal to the end of the transmembrane helix. The entirety of the cavern is within 10 Å of the membrane surface. Thus localization of the CD4 tail within the cavern would be completely consistent with the proximity of the Nef binding site and transmembrane domain of CD4. The N-terminal loop of Nef is required for high-affinity binding to the CD4 cytosolic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Preusser et al., 2001</xref>). We therefore propose that the N-terminal loop of Nef folds around the CD4 tail within or at the edge of the cavern. The dissociation constants for CD4:Nef and AP-2:Nef are known separately, and both are approximately 1 μM. The affinity and kinetics of CD4 binding to the AP-2:Nef complex are unknown, but this model suggests that the binding would likely be tighter than for these isolated components, and the off rate correspondingly slower. This would contribute to delivery of CD4 to the ESCRT machinery and its ultimate degradation in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">daSilva et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The search for ways to combat the emergence of resistance to antiretrovirals, and to ultimately eradicate HIV, has led to an intense interest in targeting the interactions of HIV and host proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaeger et al., 2011</xref>). Host proteins, unlike viral proteins, are not susceptible to rapid mutation nor are they under selective pressure to resist therapy. The ideal host protein target site would be essential for the viral replication cycle, yet dispensable for host function. Such a site would also be ‘groovy’, that is to say, highly invaginated and capable of binding small molecules. The interaction surface complementary to the C-terminal turn segment of the Nef central loop would appear to fit this criterion. Indeed, a deep pocket in AP-2 directly below the binding site for Nef Arg178 appears to be under-utilized by Nef (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Future analysis of the ternary AP-2:Nef:CD4 tail complex may reveal additional promising sites.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01754.013</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A highly concave pocket specific for the Nef interaction.</title><p>Nef is shown in a stick model and the highly concave AP-2 surface is shown in the vicinity of Nef Arg178.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors describe the structure and associated biochemistry of the complex between HIV Nef and the AP-2 “hemi-core” – i.e., the first 396 residues of α with σ tucked into its right-angle bend. Overall, this work is straightforward, of high technical quality, and represents an important advance.</p><p>The crystal structure reveals how an otherwise unstructured loop within Nef contacts both of the two AP-2 subunits and it nicely explains a large body of mutagenesis data, both published and performed within this study. Several aspects of the work are of particular interest and importance, including:</p><p>1) The structure provides the first ordered picture of the large internal Nef loop, presumably because the structure only becomes ordered when it binds AP-2.</p><p>2) As the authors note, CD4 downregulation is the “classic” function of Nef, and this study explains the molecular basis for half of that interaction, explaining how Nef recruits the AP-2 complex to initiate assembly of a clathrin coated pit. The Nef interaction with CD4 remains to be characterized, but the current structure is a very nice step forward and the Nef-AP-2 interaction interface is sufficiently complex that it could not have been understood without a crystal structure.</p><p>3) The supporting biochemistry, together with previous mutational analyses, makes a compelling case for the relevance and completeness of the structure.</p><p>4) Knowledge of adaptor complex structures and membrane binding interactions enables a sensible model for the entire Nef-AP-2 complex, revealing how an ancillary cargo adaptor like Nef can cooperate with a generalized heterotetrameric adaptor.</p><p>5) The authors also make a “groovy” suggestion about an inhibitor site on AP-2 that might, if occupied, selectively interfere with Nef association.</p><p>The work is generally of high technical quality and no changes are required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but we suggest that the authors consider the following issues.</p><p>1) Between the structure description and the descriptions of the mutations, the text is overly dense. For example, the comprehensive list of residues that line the “pocket walls”, the guided tour along the Nef loop and similar passages may prevent the more general reader from enjoying the paper. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> doesn't really help much because it shows the Nef interaction footprint, but doesn't show the positions of any residues. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> is a nice summary of the different mutational analyses, but it doesn't explain the structural role of any of the mutated residues. The authors should consider expanding/modifying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> to highlight the relevant mutation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and briefly explaining the interactions that they make (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). That would make the information more accessible, and also allow the authors to remove detailed descriptions of interfaces and contacts from the text.</p><p>2) In place of some of the structure description, the authors should consider adding a more sophisticated comparative analysis (and perhaps even a comparison figure) of the two Nef-AP complexes that have now been characterized structurally, i.e., their structure and the ternary complex of Nef with the MHC-I cytoplasmic domain and the μ1 subunit of AP-1 (Jia et al. NSMB 2012 19, 701).</p><p>3) A schematic version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, placed alongside the current versions, based on real molecular surfaces (not replacing them), would be helpful.</p><p>4) The interaction between R178 of Nef and E342 of α-adaptin is interesting in part because it is specific for Nef; the mutation E342K in alpha adaptin affects the binding to Nef but not to the cellular protein tyrosinase, and this interaction is emphasized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.
