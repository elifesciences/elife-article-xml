Here, we focus on understanding cellular mechanisms for elongation using an organotypic culture system as a model of mammary epithelial anlage. Isotropic cell aggregates broke symmetry and slowly elongated when transplanted into collagen 1 gels. The elongating regions of aggregates displayed enhanced cell proliferation that was necessary for elongation to occur. Strikingly, this locoregional increase in cell proliferation occurred where collagen 1 fibrils reorganized into bundles that were polarized with the elongating aggregates. Applying external stretch as a cell-independent way to reorganize the extracellular matrix, we found that collagen polarization stimulated regional cell proliferation to precipitate symmetry breaking and elongation. This required β1-integrin and ERK signaling. We propose that collagen polarization supports epithelial anlagen elongation by stimulating locoregional cell proliferation. This could provide a long-lasting structural memory of the initial axis that is generated when anlage break symmetry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epithelia</kwd><kwd>elongation</kwd><kwd>tubulogenesis</kwd><kwd>symmetry breaking</kwd><kwd>collagen 1</kwd><kwd>anisotropy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship 1136592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Alpha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1123816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Alpha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1140090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Alpha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP19010287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Alpha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>190102230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yap</surname><given-names>Alpha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FT190100516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stehbens</surname><given-names>Samantha J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Snow Medical Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudson</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katsuno-Kambe</surname><given-names>Hiroko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrin- and ERK signaling stimulates mammary epithelial cell proliferation when extracellular collagen condenses, causing asymmetric growth of multicellular aggregates that is necessary for elongation during branching morphogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Branched tubules represent one of the archetypal modes of epithelial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iruela-Arispe and Beitel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varner and Nelson, 2014</xref>). In organs such as the mammary gland and lungs, networks of hollow epithelial tubes mediate the physiological exchange of gases, nutrients, and solutes between the body and its external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung and Andrew, 2008</xref>). These definitive networks are established by a complex morphogenetic process, where tubules grow outward from their precursors until they are instructed to branch, after which outgrowth continues until the network is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Affolter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrew and Ewald, 2010</xref>). The branching and elongation of multicellular aggregates can thus be considered as fundamental processes in the generation of tubular networks.</p><p>Interestingly, different organs also use distinct strategies for tubulogenesis. For example, in the trachea, lumens appear early and accompany the growth of tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schottenfeld et al., 2010</xref>), whereas in the salivary and mammary glands tubules first begin as non-polarized cellular aggregates (or anlage), which then elongate as solid, multicellular cords before eventually forming lumens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastidas-Ponce et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nerger and Nelson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tucker, 2007</xref>). In the present study, we use the mammary epithelium as a model to analyze what guides the elongation of multicellular anlage.</p><p>Tubulogenesis is a highly regulated phenomenon. The decision to branch is recognized to be a critical checkpoint that is controlled by developmental signals and cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (cell-ECM) interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodwin and Nelson, 2020</xref>). The elongation of tubule precursors is also thought to be a regulated process controlled by receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Costantini and Kopan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gjorevski and Nelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sternlicht et al., 2006</xref>). However, elongation occurs over hours to days, time scales that are much longer than the underlying cellular processes and the signaling pathways that guide them. This raises the question of whether there may be mechanisms that can help guide elongation over longer time scales, effectively serving as a bridge between the rapidity of cell signaling and the slow progression of macroscopic anlage elongation. In this study, we show how collagen 1 within the ECM can provide such a bridge by stimulating cell proliferation.</p><p>The ECM comprises complex mixtures of proteins, glycosaminoglycans, and glycoconjugates that fill the extracellular spaces of tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frantz et al., 2010</xref>). One of the main components of ECM is collagen, particularly type 1 collagen (also called collagen 1), which is often the dominant form during epithelial tubulogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keely et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llacua et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakanishi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon-Assmann et al., 1995</xref>). Type 1 collagen exerts a diverse range of effects that can potentially influence epithelial elongation. Fibrillar collagen helps scaffold other molecules, such other ECM proteins and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanematsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wipff and Hinz, 2008</xref>). Adhesion between cells and ECM allows the chemical and mechanical properties of the ECM to regulate cell signaling and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). These cell-ECM adhesions also allow cell-based forces to reorganize the ECM. In particular, cells can rearrange collagen fibrils to influence cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, fibrillar components of the ECM, such as collagen 1, are relatively long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Price and Spiro, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verzijl et al., 2000</xref>), making them attractive candidates to bridge time scales during the elongation process. Indeed, rearrangement of collagen has been implicated in patterning epithelial branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harunaga et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ingman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is difficult to elucidate the specific contribution for collagen in the complex environment of an organ, where there are many additional contributions from other cell types and various chemotactic signals. Therefore, in this study we used three-dimensional (3D) organotypic cultures to test how the ECM regulates epithelial elongation. We report that a collagen 1 matrix induces the elongation of mammary epithelial anlage. This is accompanied by the polarization of the matrix itself, an event that sustains anlagen elongation by stimulating cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An experimental system to capture symmetry breaking and elongation of epithelial aggregates</title><p>To model the elongation of epithelial anlage, we induced multicellular aggregates to break symmetry by manipulating the ECM environment in which the cells were grown. When MCF10A cells are grown on Matrigel substrates and in media supplemented with soluble Matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Debnath et al., 2003</xref>), they proliferate from single isolated cells to form a multicellular aggregate, which then polarizes and clears the central mass of apoptotic cells, generating a central lumen in a process known as cavitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, when isolated cells were embedded in a gel of type 1 collagen, which is the major ECM component in the stromal environment during mammary tubulogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schedin and Keely, 2011</xref>), they proliferated to form elongated, solid cords of non-polarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krause et al., 2008</xref>). This indicated that some properties of the collagen 1 environment might provide an instructive cue for elongation.</p><p>In order to capture the process by which isotropic aggregates broke symmetry and then elongated, cells were first seeded in Matrigel until proliferation arrested at 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); aggregates were then isolated and embedded into collagen 1 (acid-solubilized rat type I collagen, 37℃ for 30 min). Lumens were apparent in some Matrigel-embedded aggregates, but most remained as solid spheres, resembling anlage. Live-cell imaging revealed that the transplanted aggregates displayed small jiggling motions for several hours, then spontaneously broke symmetry and elongated to form cord-like structures similar to those formed when cultured in collagen from the outset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These elongating aggregates were generally solid, with no evident lumens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Commonly, elongation began with a group of cells that protruded away from the more spherical original aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). In contrast, when aggregates were transplanted from Matrigel back into Matrigel, they grew slightly but did not elongate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, transplantation into a collagen 1 matrix effectively caused isotropic MCF10A aggregates to break symmetry and elongate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Type 1 collagen induces elongation of MCF10A anlage via cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon: transplantation of MCF10A cell aggregates from Matrigel into collagen gel.

We first examined cell proliferation, given the evident increase in the size of aggregates that elongated. Staining for Ki67, a nonhistone nuclear protein commonly used as a marker of proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soliman and Yussif, 2016</xref>), showed clear proliferation in aggregates that had elongated 8 days after transplantation into collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These elongating aggregates commonly consisted of elongated extensions as well as a rounded region that marked the original aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, Ki67-positive cells were more frequent in the elongating parts of the aggregates (41.00% ± 4.55% of all cells) compared with the non-elongating parts of the aggregates (18.86% ± 3.05%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This differential pattern of proliferation was also evident when we analyzed just the cells at the surface of the aggregates, which were in contact with the collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Live-cell imaging of cells expressing NLS-mCherry also showed that the proportion of nuclei that divided was higher in the elongating than the non-elongating areas within aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Thus, elongation was associated with locoregional differences in cell proliferation, which was enhanced in those parts of the aggregates that elongated.</p><p>More detailed inspection revealed that increased proliferation was first evident in aggregates 2 days after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and appeared to precede the onset of symmetry breaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). To quantitate aggregate elongation, we calculated a symmetry ratio, that is, the ratio of the maximum length (<italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub>) and width (<italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub>) of the aggregates. Completely round aggregates will have a symmetry ratio of 1, whereas for elongated aggregates <italic>L</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>2</sub> will be &gt;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The symmetry ratio first increased at day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), approximately 24 hr after an increase in proliferation was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To test if any locoregional differences in proliferation were to be found at these early stages of symmetry breaking, we analyzed aggregates that had broken symmetry (defined experimentally as a symmetry ratio &gt;1.5) after 3 days of culture. We compared the proportion of cells that were Ki67-positive in the elongating regions of aggregates with the proportion to be found in the non-elongating areas of the same aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Ki67 positivity was twofold greater in the elongating areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting that locoregional differences in proliferation were established early in the elongation process.</p><p>Importantly, elongation was inhibited when proliferation was blocked using the cell cycle inhibitors mitomycin C and aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In control cultures, the proportion of Ki67-positive cells increased progressively after transplantation into collagen (from 2.28% ± 0.85% at day 1 to 26.63% ± 3.34% at day 8). However, cell proliferation was significantly reduced by mitomycin C (3.88% ± 1.18%, day 8) and aphidicolin (11.54% ± 3.55%, day 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Aggregate elongation was also significantly reduced by both mitotic inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Whereas the symmetry ratio increased as control anlage elongated, this was blocked by both mitomycin C and aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Formally, cell proliferation might have been necessary to initiate symmetry breaking and cell elongation or ongoing proliferation might also have served to sustain elongation. To pursue this, we added mitomycin C or aphidicolin after the first signs of symmetry breaking were evident (at 3 days after transplantation). This reduced elongation by approximately threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Therefore, cell proliferation was required for elongation, with the capacity to contribute early in the symmetry-breaking process and also later to sustain elongation.</p><p>We then used live-cell imaging of labeled nuclei to evaluate other processes implicated in epithelial elongation. Cells within the elongating regions tended to divide along the axis of elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), as revealed by comparing the axis of cell division and the principal axis of the region. The angle difference between these axes was smaller in elongating areas compared with non-elongating areas within the same aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggested that polarized cell division accompanied enhanced proliferation during aggregate elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keller, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Tracking also revealed that cells were motile within elongating aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This was evident in rounded aggregates that had not broken symmetry as well as in aggregates that had elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). When we examined regional differences within aggregates that had undergone elongation, we found that the speeds of migration were identical in the parts that were elongating compared with the non-elongating regions of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). However, the straightness of the tracks, which was used as an index of the persistence of migration, was slightly greater in the elongating areas than in the non-elongating areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Furthermore, cells within regions of elongation appeared to orient better with the axis of the aggregate than did cells found in non-elongating areas. We measured this by comparing the orientation of the tracks with the principal axis of the aggregates (track displacement angle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). The track displacement angle was less in the elongating areas than in the non-elongating areas.</p><p>Inhibition of proliferation with either mitomycin C or aphidicolin did not affect cell migration speeds in either the rounded or elongated areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, blocking proliferation slightly reduced track straightness, implying a reduction in persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>) and increased the track displacement angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G</xref>). Therefore, the apparently orderly migration of cells was compromised by blocking cell proliferation. Together, these results suggest that proliferation was essential for the elongation process and may also have influenced aspects of directional migration that would be predicted to reinforce the elongation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Collagen 1 condenses around epithelial aggregates that break symmetry</title><p>To gain further insight into the process of elongation, we sought to identify changes in the ECM during this process. Consistent with the change in matrix environment associated with the transplantation process, re-embedded aggregates lost laminin V expression over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). They expressed fibronectin throughout the experiments without any evident regional differences in the elongating areas of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Then we visualized collagen 1 by labeling with the collagen-binding peptide CNA35 (mCherry-CNA35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krahn et al., 2006</xref>), mixed with soluble collagen 1 before the incorporation of MCF10A aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Collagen 1, in contrast to the basement membrane-like Matrigel, is composed of fibrillar polymers that can guide cell movement and whose organization is influenced by the application of cellular forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piotrowski-Daspit et al., 2017</xref>). Aggregate elongation appeared to coincide with change in fibril organization. Whereas fibrils appeared isotropic in acellular gels, collagen condensed around the aggregates that had begun to elongate, forming dense bands that extended away from the cells into the gel. However, it was seldom possible to visualize individual fibrils with the low-magnification, long-working distance lenses that were required to visualize aggregates within the gels.</p><p>Therefore, we measured the coherency (or co-orientation) of gels with Orientation J, which calculates the local orientation and isotropy for each pixel in an image based on the structure tensor for that pixel (see Materials and methods for details; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rezakhaniha et al., 2012</xref>). We interpret coherency as reflecting collagen bundling and condensation (which we shall call ‘bundling’ for short), such as has been observed elsewhere during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>). Then, we compared collagen coherency with aggregate shape, as measured by the symmetry ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), after 8 days culture, when elongation was established. Overall, collagen coherency increased with the increase in symmetry ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), implying that the degree of collagen bundling increased with aggregate elongation. Furthermore, closer examination around elongating aggregates showed that collagen coherency was greater in regions proximate to the elongating parts of the aggregates compared with the non-elongating parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, aggregates that remained spherical showed no regional differences in collagen organization. Similarly, earlier studies showed that collagen reorganized ahead of the tips of elongating aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>). This suggested that collagen became increasingly bundled and condensed where aggregates were elongating.</p><p>Increased collagen bundling was also evident at the early stages of elongation. Because aggregates varied in the timing of when they broke symmetry, we examined aggregates by live imaging in the first three days of the assays. We then subdivided these based on their symmetry ratio and compared the coherency of collagen 1 around the elongating areas of aggregates with that around the non-elongating areas (i.e., those that remained rounded, expressed as a fold difference). This showed that collagen 1 coherency increased around the elongating areas as they broke symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, from the early stages of symmetry breaking collagen 1 bundling increased around the sites where aggregates elongated.</p><p>Collagen bundling required cell proliferation, as coherency was reduced by treatment with either mitomycin C or aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Collagen bundling was also reduced when we inhibited cellular contractility with the myosin antagonist, blebbistatin, or the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y27632 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>), consistent with reports that cell contractility can condense collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, collagen condensation persisted around aggregates treated with the Rac1 GEF inhibitor NSC23766, which did not affect aggregate elongation or the speed with which cells moved within the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggested that aggregates exerted forces to reorganize their local collagen environment as they broke symmetry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Collagen polarity co-aligns with cell aggregates during elongation</title><p>We then asked if higher order organization in the collagen 1 gels was altered as aggregates elongated. For this, we used Orientation J to extract the principal axis of orientation in the gel, as a measure of its polarity, around elongating or non-elongating parts of an aggregate. Then we compared these gel orientations with the axis of elongation of the cell aggregate. First, we assembled histograms of gel orientation, setting the principal axis of elongation in the whole aggregate as 0<sup>o</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The gels around non-elongating areas of the aggregates showed a broad distribution of orientations relative to the axis of the aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). In contrast, the gel around the elongating regions of aggregates tended to orient with the principal axis of the aggregates. This suggested that the gel preferentially co-aligned with the aggregates around the regions of elongation. This notion was reinforced by comparing the angle differences between the principal axis (polarity) of the gel and of the aggregates. In this analysis, a decrease in the difference in angles between these two axes indicates an increase in their co-alignment. We found that the angle differences between the axes of collagen polarity and aggregate elongation was significantly smaller around the elongating regions than around the non-elongating regions of the aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Thus, the collagen matrix became polarized and co-aligned with the aggregates around regions of elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Collagen polarization stimulates cell proliferation to induce aggregate elongation</title><p>This led us to wonder if polarization of the collagen could itself influence the process of aggregate elongation. To test this, we developed a strategy that applied exogenous stretch to polarize the matrix independently of cell-generated forces. In this protocol, a collagen gel was created within a ring-shaped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) frame, then stretched uniaxially by expanding a stretcher inserted into the hole of the ring for 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Second harmonic imaging confirmed that collagen fibers were isotropically distributed in the unstretched gels and became more coherent (bundled) and more polarized immediately after stretching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), with their principal axes oriented in the direction of stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, polarization of the collagen fibrils could be preserved for at least 7 days after the application of stretch by re-embedding the collagen rings in a larger collagen gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, when gels were allowed to float in medium after stretching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), gel coherency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) reverted to that of unstretched gels.

The symmetry ratios of aggregates immediately after stretching were identical to those in unstretched aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Instead, aggregates broke symmetry many hours after the period of active stretching. However, symmetry breaking occurred earlier when stretched gels were allowed to retain collagen polarization by re-embedding (35.14 ± 3.28 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>) compared with aggregates that were allowed to break symmetry spontaneously in non-stretched gels (68.40 ± 5.88 hr, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, the degree of elongation was also enhanced once it had begun. The symmetry ratios of aggregates embedded in stretch-polarized gels were significantly greater than those seen with native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

This was accompanied by inhibition of elongation. After 3 days incubation, 49.19% ± 1.61% aggregates started to elongate in controls, whereas less than 20% of aggregates elongated when β1-integrins were inhibited (AIIB2: 17.86% ± 4.78%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

Finally, we asked if the ERK response required β1-integrins. Indeed, we found that the ability of stretch polarization to stimulate ERK signaling at early (day 2) and later stages (day 7) was reduced when β1-integrins were blocked with mAb AIIB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H and I</xref>).

We infer this because (1) locoregional cell proliferation was a striking feature of MCF10A elongation in our experiments, whose loss was not compensated for by other morphogenetic processes. (2) The pattern of proliferation within aggregates was critically influenced by the polarized organization of the surrounding collagen 1 matrix.

Increased proliferation was observed in elongating aggregates and, indeed, began to increase before elongation was detected. Furthermore, proliferation was greater in the regions of the aggregates that underwent elongation compared to those areas that did not. This suggested that a locoregional increase in cell proliferation might be important for the elongation process, a notion that was supported when elongation was inhibited by blocking proliferation. Elongation was reduced when mitomycin C and aphidicolin were added from the beginning of the assays, consistent with earlier evidence that inhibiting proliferation early in the culture process blocked branching morphogenesis in mouse mammary organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewald et al., 2008</xref>). We also found that elongation was compromised if proliferation was inhibited after the elongation process had begun, a later dependence that was not seen in organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huebner et al., 2016</xref>). Differences in cell system may therefore influence the impact of cell proliferation on elongation. Nonetheless, our data strongly suggest that locoregional stimulation of cell proliferation was required for epithelial elongation in our model.</p><p>This raised the question of how cell proliferation might be preferentially increased within specific regions of MCF10A aggregates. Several of our observations implicate polarized reorganization of the collagen 1 matrix in this specification process. First, locoregional polarization of the collagen 1 matrix accompanied aggregate elongation when cell aggregates spontaneously broke symmetry. This reorganization was distinguished by increased coherency of the matrix, consistent with an increase in collagen bundling, as well as polarization of the gel so that it became oriented with the axis of the elongating aggregate. Matrix reorganization concentrated where the aggregates were elongating and proliferating, as has been reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>). Second, aggregate elongation was stimulated when the gel was polarized by applying an external stretch. Similarly, collagen 1 orientation has been reported to induce mammary organoid branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>). But the stimulatory effect on elongation was lost if the stretched gels were allowed to lose their polarization or if aggregates were transplanted into a naïve, unstretched gel. This implied that the cells were responding to the altered organization of the gel, rather than simply exposure to collagen 1. Consistent with what we had observed when aggregates spontaneously broke symmetry, stretch-induced polarization of gels stimulated cell proliferation, and this was necessary for the accelerated elongation process to occur. This appeared to be mediated by a β1-integrin and ERK-dependent pathway.</p><p>What property of the polarized collagen 1 was being recognized by the cells to enhance their proliferation? The polarization of collagen networks can have complex effects on cells. Increasing fibril alignment in acellular collagen gels was reported to increase fiber stiffness and decrease pore size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Riching et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taufalele et al., 2019</xref>), even in the absence of externally applied forces. Moreover, in single-cell cultures aligned collagen fibers were associated with larger focal adhesions than non-aligned fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doyle and Yamada, 2016</xref>). One possibility, then, is that integrin signaling was responding to the increased stiffness of the polarized collagen gels. This is consistent with the well-characterized role for integrins to sense changes in matrix stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giannone and Sheetz, 2006</xref>). As well, collagen 1 can bind to, and sequester, a variety of growth factors. Whether this reservoir can be released when cells apply tension to collagen is an interesting question for further consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wipff and Hinz, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Cell migration is a key driver of branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huebner et al., 2016</xref>), and earlier experiments reported that the application of external stretch to collagen-embedded aggregates could promote elongation through cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>). We, too, observed cell migration in our aggregates and, although their speeds were not different, migrating cells within elongating parts of the aggregates tended to align with the axis of elongation and move slightly more persistently than cells moving within the non-elongating regions of the aggregates. These features of collective migration might be expected to contribute to aggregate elongation.</p><p>Interestingly, blocking cell proliferation decreased the apparent persistence of the migrating cells and their alignment with the principal axes of the aggregates. Therefore, rather than collective migration being enhanced to compensate for the decrease in proliferation, cell proliferation appeared to support these elongation-facilitating aspects of cell migration. One possible explanation is that persistence and directional alignment were being guided by the reorganized collagen that, in effect, served to create a 3D micropattern around the aggregates. Studies in 2D systems have shown that cells can orient their patterns of migration when collagen networks condense and form bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mohammed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). As collagen reorganization was reduced by inhibiting proliferation, mitomycin C and aphidicolin might have affected cell migration indirectly through matrix organization. Such micropatterning might also influence other aspects of cell behavior during elongation. Micropatterning experiments using 2D substrata have shown that anisotropic confinement can orient patterns of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Théry et al., 2005</xref>), potentially by orienting tensile stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>), as would also be predicted to accompany stiffer, condensed collagen bundles. Consistent with this, we observed that cells within the elongating areas appeared to orient their divisions with the axis of elongation, an effect that would also be predicted to enhance elongation. These observations reinforce the notion that interplay between cell proliferation and collagen (re)organization is a key contributor to epithelial elongation.</p><p>The reductionist model that we used in these experiments allowed us to focus on testing how collagen organization could promote epithelial elongation. How might the results from this system operate in the more complex environment of the tissue? One important factor to consider is the basement membrane, which can separate the epithelial cell compartment from collagen 1 in the stroma. However, earlier studies reported that the basement membrane thins substantially and is remodeled in regions of epithelial elongation, such as the tips of mammary or salivary gland buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Silberstein and Daniel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams and Daniel, 1983</xref>), potentially allowing elongating regions of epithelia to engage with collagen 1. Evaluating how cell proliferation and stromal collagen organization are coordinated with other components of the ECM in physiological models of developing glands will be an important question for future research.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose the following working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): regional polarization of the collagen 1 matrix begins in response to anisotropies in force that aggregates exert upon their ECM via their integrin adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Cell-based forces exerted through integrins can apply strain on collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brownfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorevski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2016</xref>) and, consistent with this, collagen reorganization in our experiments was compromised by inhibiting cellular contractility. However, compression of collagen by increasing cell numbers or cell movements could also have contributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchmann et al., 2021</xref>). By implication, collagen polarization will be greater around the parts of the aggregate that are generating more force. The consequent locoregional collagen polarization then stimulates further cell proliferation in the adjacent parts of the aggregate to sustain elongation. Biochemical contact with collagen may provide a basal stimulus for cell proliferation, which is further enhanced where collagen becomes polarized, to provide a boundary condition that promotes elongation. It was interesting to note that collagen reorganization was compromised when cell proliferation was blocked from the outset of the assays. Possibly, subtle differences in cell proliferation may have contributed to generating initial anisotropies in force to reorganize the gels. If so, we speculate that the increase in cell proliferation may have contributed to further collagen reorganization, with the capacity to develop a feedback system that might help sustain aggregate elongation. This would allow polarized collagen networks to effectively provide a structural memory of the initial axis of symmetry breaking, that is, a relatively long-lived spatial cue that directs further elongation of the epithelial anlagen.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and lentivirus infection</title><p>MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells (CRL-10317) and HEK293T human embryonic kidney 293 cells (CRL-3216) were obtained from ATCC.

AIIB2 antibody for blocking integrin β1 was purchased from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and treated at 15 μg/ml in this study.</p><p>Proliferation inhibitors mitomycin C (M7949; Sigma) and aphidicolin (178273; Merck) were used at 10 μM and 2 μM, respectively. Myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (203390; Sigma) and ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (688000; Sigma) were used at 25 μM and 30 μM, respectively. ERK1/2 inhibitor FR180204 (SC-203945; Santa Cruz) was used at 50 μM. Except for mitomycin C, cell aggregates were treated with the inhibitors after transplantation into collagen gels. Inhibitors were then replenished when medium was changed and left in the collagen culture until cell aggregates were ready to be fixed.

We analyzed collagen organization in these images using Orientation J, which calculates the local orientation and isotropy for each pixel in an image based on the structure tensor for that pixel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rezakhaniha et al., 2012</xref>). The structure tensor is evaluated for each pixel of the given image by calculating the spatial partial derivatives by using (a cubic B-spline) interpolation. The local orientation and isotropy for each pixel are computed based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the structure tensor. We characterized three features in the organization of collagen fibrils orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemons et al., 2018</xref>): (i) the coherency of fibrils, defined as co-orientation in the same direction, as a measure of bundling; (ii) isotropy, the distribution of fibril orientation in the field of analysis; and (iii) polarization, defined as the principal axis of fibril orientation in anisotropic gels, relative to a reference axis. 50 × 50 µm or 100 × 100 µm size of ROI were selected from SHG images or CNA35 probed images, respectively, and used for analysis. Elongation axis of aggregates was measured by the angle tool in ImageJ, and then we calculated the angle difference between principal axis of collagen fibrils or stretching axis. The fold difference of gel coherency was measured by dividing the coherency of fibrils in the elongating area by the non-elongating area.</p><p>The symmetry ratio of aggregates was measured by dividing the longest length by widest width of aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative analysis of proliferating cells and nuclear division angle</title><p>The number of cells co-stained with DAPI and anti-Ki67 antibody was counted by Imaris software (Bitplane). The number of Ki67-positive cells was divided by the total number of nucleus stained with DAPI to calculate percentage of Ki67-positive cells. For live imaging, cells were expressed with NLS-mCherry to count their number. The frequency and orientation of cell division were analyzed from the time-lapse images by ImageJ. We set the elongation axis of aggregate as a reference and measured the angle difference between elongation axis and dividing axis of nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of nuclear tracking</title><p>To obtain the migration speed of cells, we tracked individual cell nuclei using the Spot function in the Imaris software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huebner et al., 2016</xref>). The fluorescent images of cells expressing NLS-mCherry were acquired every 10 min for at least 50 hr. To obtain the track displacement angle, we first calculated the displacement angle of nuclei from the displacement of X and Y axis between first and last position, and then measured the angle difference from elongating angle of aggregates. Track straightness was calculated from track displacement by track length. Inhibitors were treated 1 hr before the imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantitative analysis of ERK/KTR biosensor</title><p>ERK activity was judged by the location of mClover fluorescent signal in individual cells. Briefly, fluorescent-tagged KTRs translocate between nuclei and cytoplasm depends on kinase activity. When ERK activity is high, KTR-mClover should localize in cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Cova et al., 2017</xref>). Aggregates expressing ERK/KTR-mClover were transplanted into collagen gel and were co-stained with phalloidin and DAPI after fixation. To judge the delocalization of KTR-mClover, we used line intensity scan in single-plane images and then manually scored ERK active cells as those where the fluorescent signal was excluded from the nucleus (compared with cells that showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, which were scored as inactive).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Significance was determined by unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test and one-way ANOVA by using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad software).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-67915-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated and analysed in this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

However, all three reviewers felt that there are several issues that need to be addressed before this paper can be published, most significantly those summarized below:</p><p>1) All reviewers felt the data did not fully support the conclusions in several areas.

Branching and elongation depends on region-specific cell proliferation and multicellular outgrowths are characterized by the local accumulation of collagen matrix after the initial symmetry break. 3D hydrogel stretching and preformed aligned collagen extracellular matrix is sufficient to direct elongated outgrowth, which is dependent on proliferation, β1 integrin and ERK signaling. While the work is quantitative and the imaging is of high quality, chemical and physical factors that affect the long axis bias of the developing mammary epithelium have been intensively studied in vivo and in vitro, and it is not clear that this work offers a significant conceptual advance.

Katsuno-Kambe et al. investigate the role of the extracellular matrix during the process of elongation, making use of 3D culture models of mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. These cells have previously been shown (e.g Krause et al., Tissue Eng Part C Methods 2008, and others) to form multicellular aggregates that polarize and eventually form lumens when cultured in Matrigel, and when embedded in Collagen I (a major component of the stromal environment) form elongated, solid cords of non-polarized cells. Therefore, to capture the process by which aggregates break symmetry and become elongated, the authors first seeded MCF10A cells in Matrigel until proliferation arrested (resembling anlage), after which aggregates where isolated and embedded into collagen I gels. The authors show increased proliferation of cells in elongating areas of aggregates, and that these elongated aggregates are not formed when proliferation is inhibited. The authors further show that this elongation is accompanied by collagen reorganization into polarized bundles around elongating areas, and by artificially polarizing collagen by application of external stretch show collagen polarization can increase proliferation and guide the direction of elongation. Finally, the authors demonstrate aggregate elongation requires beta1-integrin adhesion and downstream ERK activity.</p><p>The strength of this manuscript is the use of a reductionist approach to investigate the role of collagen alignment in the elongation of epithelial anlage, by transplanting MCF10A cell clusters from matrigel into Collagen I gels, and artificially manipulating collagen polarization by stretching these gels. In addition, the exploration of the underlying mechanism of elongation, requiring proliferation and integrin-ERK signaling, is of potential great interest to understanding the role of cues derived from the extracellular matrix in epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p>The main weakness of this study is that the data still insufficiently supports several conclusions, in particular on proliferation being a key driver of anlage elongation, and on the reciprocal interaction between proliferation and collagen polarization during this process. The induction of proliferation is only analyzed 8 days after cell clusters have been transferred to Collagen gels, and thus after symmetry break and elongation have already occured. Analyses of proliferation and collagen polarization during the different stages of symmetry break and elongation, and detailed analyses of the distribution of proliferative cells during these stages, are lacking. This is in particular relevant as also in non-elongated areas, cells that are in contact with Collagen appear to be proliferative. Alternative driver mechanisms, for instance the induction of collective migration, are not fully tested and it remains unclear whether proliferation is merely required for, or truly a driver event of aggregate elongation.</p><p>The authors investigate a role for integrin signaling and downstream ERK in the induction of proliferation and aggregate elongation in response to collagen polarization. While an integrin β 1 inhibitory antibody and ERK inhibitor indeed prevents elongation, key unanswered questions are whether this pathway is indeed activated by polarized collagen during elongation (i.e. in selective regions of the cell clusters) and whether it is required for the proliferation response itself.</p><p>Despite the elegance of the reductionist approach in MCF10A cells in vitro, it remains unclear to what extent these findings generally apply to mammary tubulogenesis under physiological conditions in vivo, which remains largely undiscussed in the manuscript.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. The authors conclude that cell proliferation is a key driver of epithelial anlage elongation. However, the induction of proliferation is only analyzed 8 days after transfer of cell clusters to Collagen I, after symmetry break and elongation have taken place. And here, analysis of proliferation is limited to cells in the elongated areas versus the remaining cell cluster. It is essential to include analyses of proliferation during the different stages of elongation (i.e. before and upon initial symmetry break and at different time points of elongation), as well as detailed analyses of the distribution of proliferative cells during these stages. This is in particular relevant as from the images (e.g. Figure 1C) it is apparent that also in the non-elongated areas the cells on the outside of the cell cluster (thus in contact with Collagen I) are proliferating (e.g. Figure 1C), yet do not form elongated strands (which also does not support the authors conclusions that &quot;proliferation is selectively increased in regions of aggregates that were elongating&quot;). Finally, analysis of the induction of proliferation should also include a control in which cell clusters are transferred back to matrigel.</p><p>2. Alternative driver mechanisms, in particular cell migration, are limited to analysis of migration speed that is similar in different regions of the aggregate. This does not exclude that induction of directional, collective migration could be the main driving event underlying elongation, which remains unexplored. As such, it remains undetermined whether proliferation is merely required for, or truly a driver event of aggregate elongation.</p><p>3. The authors mention in the discussion that &quot;the initial step of symmetry-breaking was associated with reorganization of collagen fibrils along the aggregate (…) which became increasingly bundled and aligned as elongation proceeded&quot;. However, data showing these changes in collagen during the different steps are not presented in the manuscript. This is in particular important as the authors conclude that collagen polarization induces proliferation, and therefore the authors should include a more detailed analyses of both processes (collagen reorganization and proliferation) over time after cell clusters are transferred to Collagen gels, and how they are associated with each other in individual cell clusters.</p><p>In addition, can the authors explain the induction of proliferation in cells in contact with collagen in the non-elongating areas (e.g. Figure 1C, see comment 1), as this suggest contact with collagen is sufficient to increase proliferation and collagen polarization is not required?</p><p>4. In line with the above comment, the conclusion that collagen polarization promotes proliferation is largely based on the experiments in which collagen gels were stretched. However, the effect on proliferation is again only assessed following 8 days of culture in these gels, and thus after aggregate elongation. To support their conclusion, proliferation should be analyzed at early time points following stretching. This would also address whether the earlier symmetry break observed after stretching is a consequence of increased/faster induction of proliferation, or involves the ability of already proliferating cells to drive epithelial elongation (which will affect the interpretation of these data).</p><p>5. The authors demonstrate that inhibition of proliferation prevents aggregate elongation. It is difficult to interpret from these experiments whether proliferation could truly be a key driver of elongation, as aggregates appear to remain much smaller following mitomycin C and Aphidicolin treatment (Figure 1H). It should be shown whether in the absence of the inhibitors, symmetry break and elongation is induced at this aggregate size (and thus whether the observed effect represents a direct or indirect of the inhibitors on elongation). In addition, proliferation inhibitors should also be given after the symmetry break has taken place, to test whether this prevents protrusions that are already present from elongating further.</p><p>6. The authors investigate a role for integrin signaling and downstream ERK in the induction of proliferation and aggregate elongation in response to collagen polarization. While indeed both integrin beta1 and ERK activity are necessary for aggregate elongation, whether this pathway is directly involved in aggregate elongation remains unclear, and analysis of cell proliferation is lacking. The authors should test with available antibodies whether this pathway is specifically induced by polarized collagen (by analyzing different regions of the aggregate during symmetry break and elongation). In addition, effect of inhibitors on the level and distribution of Ki67+ cells should be shown.</p><p>7. To control that effects observed in stretched collagen gels are truly mediated by the induced collagen polarization, the authors allowed gels to float in the medium to revert gel isotropy to that of unstretched gels. While collagen polarization is indeed reverted, cells cultured in floating gels will not able be able to generate stresses themselves (e.g. Halliday et al., 1995). From these experiments it can therefore not be concluded whether it is truly the collagen polarization or stresses generated by the cells that are needed for aggregate elongation.</p><p>8. It remains unclear to what extent the findings from this manuscript apply to mammary tubulogenesis in vivo, which remains undiscussed in the manuscript. While some experiments may be difficult to verify in vivo (e.g. to monitor collagen alignment), it would be relevant to at least to know whether in vivo mammary epithelial cells indeed come in contact with collagen I during anlage elongation, and preferably also show whether this is accompanied by a specific proliferation response.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Understanding tissue morphogenesis requires an understanding of underlying molecular and mechanical mechanisms. Many tissues form a network of branched tubules and understanding their origins is an important question for the field. Here the authors develop a simple, novel assay for exploring this. By plating MCF-10A mammary epithelia cell cysts in 3D collagen, they find that these cells rapidly reorganize, break symmetry, and send out streams of cells that proliferate as they move outward, forming solid cords. This behavior is particular for collagen and is not see in Matrigel. They then proceed to use this system to explore the causal links between collagen, proliferation, directed outgrowth and integrin signaling. They find that cell proliferation coincides with outgrowth and outgrowth is blocked in proliferation is inhibited. They find that collagen is re-organized as outgrowth occurs, altering fibril organization. They then carried out a set of clever experiments to use mechanical stretch to pre-orient fibrils, and found that aggregates preferentially elongated along the fibril preferred axis. Pre-oriented fibrils also sped elongation and proliferation. Finally, blocking integrin signaling reduced/delayed elongation. I found the new system interesting, and the data intriguing. However, I had two major concerns, about the measurements presented and the causality suggested.</p><p>1. Most of the experiments involve measuring collagen fibril orientation and coherency. However, in most of the images I could not see individual fibrils (the exception, Figure 3D, was strikingly different than the rest). I would like to see a clearer description in the main text of how orientation was measured and why this is difficult to see in most images.</p><p>2. Bigger picture was the issue of causality. The authors present seemingly a linear view – integrin signaling drives proliferation and outgrowth and this triggers fibril orientation that then feeds back into the process. However, I found causality difficult to discern. While proliferation is necessary for outgrowth, its role seemed to be more likely to be permissive rather than instructive. The observation that cells would follow oriented fibrils was interesting but perhaps not surprising, and I found it difficult to tease out whether elongation triggered polarization of collagen or vice versa – I guess the authors favor a feedback process.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Collagen polarization promotes epithelial elongation by stimulating locoregional cell proliferation.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

If needed, include a direct analysis of cells in contact with collagen in non-elongating vs elongating regions to support the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have taken steps to substantially clarify the core findings from their paper, driving home their central conclusion that regional proliferation stimulated by polarized collagen directs aggregate elongation. Importantly, the authors also distinguish the conclusions of this study from prior work that apply similar methods. They have added additional experiments that address most of my concerns regarding the role of proliferation in this process and altogether the manuscript is stronger.</p><p>Where I am still not clear is the relationship between collagen and the stimulation of proliferation. This conclusion is derived from reported regional differences in cell proliferation that coincide with elongation and collagen polarization. However, this quantification could be potentially misleading, as there is also a significant difference in the number of cells with surface area contacting the surrounding collagen in non-elongating regions yet those that do appear to be proliferative (Figure 1C, 1J). Further not all instances of accumulated collagen appear to lead to elongation.</p><p>The authors clearly demonstrate (Figure 5) that polarized collagen influences the kinetics of proliferation and elongation. Perhaps this can be explained by a slightly refined model in which collagen is sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation in anlagen and its concurrent polarization/remodeling provides boundary conditions that together support the emergent behavior of elongation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my main concerns in their rebuttal. The addition of new analyses strengthens the conclusion of the authors that locoregional proliferation is important for the elongation of multicellular aggregates. The data doesn't completely tease out whether this locoregional proliferation is instructive or merely permissive, but the data are more clearly interpreted and discussed in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67915.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In this paper, the authors used reductionist models to investigate the interplay between collagen extracellular matrix and the polarized elongation of mammary epithelial anlage and provide new mechanistic insights into this process, which are potentially of broad interest.

To summarize, we believe that the contribution of our study is to identify (1) A role for loco-regional cell proliferation as a driver of epithelial anlagen elongation; and (2) A role for local reorganization of the collagen 1 matrix as a stimulator of that cell proliferation.</p><p>This contrasts with earlier studies that used similar experimental systems. For example: Brownfield et al. (Current Biology, 2013) showed that stretching collagen gels induces the elongation of embedded epithelial aggregates, but they focused on cell motility and did not test cell proliferation. Gjorevski et al. (Scientific Reports, 2013) showed that aggregates can reorganize collagen by exerting tensile forces, but focused their analysis on the impact for cell migration. Similarly, Buchmann et al. (Nat Comms, 2021) did not observe loco-regional differences in cell proliferation, but these were tested after elongation was well established, not at the early stages of symmetry-breaking as we have now done. Finally, Huebner et al. (Development, 2016) reported a role for ERK in epithelial elongation, but did not test the role of ECM organization. Thus, our findings have identified a new driver of elongation that has not been identified before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Demonstrating the extent to which the findings from this work apply to mammary tubulogenesis in vivo is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our Discussion to consider how our findings may apply to the more complex environment of a tissue. In particular, earlier studies have reported that the basement membrane is remodelled and thins out substantially at the tips of elongating mammary epithelial buds (and this is also seen in other models, such as the salivary gland). This would be predicted to increase cell exposure to collagen 1 in the stroma, a context that could allow the process that we have identified to operate. It will be important to test our predictions in an in vivo model, but this was not something that was feasible in the time frame of a revision. Respectfully, we suggest that it is a problem that deserves a study of its own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Katsuno-Kambe and colleagues investigate the mechanism by which non-polarized MCF10A spheroids can be induced to extend multicellular aggregates when cultured within 3D type I collagen extracellular matrix hydrogels.

Such loco-regional stimulation of cell proliferation was not reported in earlier studies. For example, Brownfield et al. (Current Biology, 2013; Bissell group) showed that stretching collagen gels induces the elongation of embedded epithelial aggregates, but they focused on how this might occur through cell motility and did not test cell proliferation.

Of course, our system is explicitly reductionist and does not capture the complexity of the ECM in vivo, especially in terms of other ECM components as well as a basement membrane. However, it is noteworthy that studies in vivo have reported important roles for collagen 1 during mammary tubulogenesis (e.g. Kelly et al., Differentiation 1995) and that the basement membrane often thins in regions of elongation e.g. Williams and Daniel, Dev Biol 97, 274, 1983; Silberstein and Daniel, Dev Biol 90, 215, 1982), making these more likely to engage with stromal collagen 1. We have included this in the Discussion as ways in which our findings may have impact in vivo. While it would be important to test these concepts in the more complex environment of a tissue, we respectfully felt that this was beyond the feasible scope of a revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Methods and conclusions from this work are similar to those reported by the Bissell group (Brownfield et al.

It should be noted that we used this approach because our experiments required low-magnification, long working distance lenses to capture aggregates and their surrounding matrix.

Given the slow time course of the phenomena, it is entirely possible that multiple mechanisms (including tugging forces and pushing forces) may contribute. With respect, we feel that it is somewhat peripheral to the key point of our study, which is how interplay between cell proliferation and collagen reorganization drives epithelial elongation. It will be important to elucidate this issue, but may be better suited to an independent study.</p><p>iii) Unfortunately, we can’t address the question of what may control the choice of branching vs elongation, because our analyses focused purely on the elongation process. In our experience, collagen 1 gels commonly show some variability in density (as reflected in differences in the intensity of labelling), even in the absence of cells. This prompted us to compare organization features of the ECM in regions of interest that were placed either adjacent to the parts of aggregates which showed elongation or those parts that did not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is proliferation truly driving this behavior? In the representative images (Figure 1C, 1H) it appears that all peripheral MCF10A making basal matrix contact are Ki67 positive. It is a bit difficult to tell when proliferation arresting inhibitors were added in the evolution of these processes. Does acute addition of mitomycin halt, or regress, established outgrowths?</p></disp-quote><p>i) In our original experiments, we added mitomycin C or aphidicolin when aggregates were first transplanted into collagen 1 gels, so proliferation inhibitors were present throughout the experiments. To test whether proliferation might be required to sustain elongation once it had begun, for this revision we added the drugs at day 3, when elongation had begun. Even though the aggregates had already broken symmetry, inhibition of proliferation significantly reduced further elongation, consistent with the idea that proliferation is necessary to sustain elongation. In the revised manuscript, we:</p><p>a) Clarify the timing for when proliferation inhibitors were added.</p><p>b) Include this new data.</p><p>ii) To summarize the evidence for a important role of stimulated cell proliferation, we find that:</p><p>a) There is a regional difference in cell proliferation that coincides with elongation. Greater proliferation was found in the regions of aggregates that elongate compared with those regions that do not elongate. We measured this by quantitating both Ki-67 staining and also counting cell divisions by live-cell imaging.</p><p>b) Stimulation of elongation by stretching gels was also associated with stimulation of cell proliferation in a loco-regional pattern that paralleled the elongation.</p><p>c) Both spontaneous and stretch-stimulated elongation were reduced by blocking cell proliferation. Together, we feel that these data argue for a necessary role of proliferation in driving elongation in our experiments. We don’t exclude the possibility that other processes, including polarized cell divisions, contributed to the elongation process. But they clearly did not compensate to sustain elongation when proliferation was blocked.</p><p>ii) The relationship between proliferation and cell migration is something that we have analysed in greater detail for this revision (prompted by comments from Reviewer 2). Of note, migratory cells were found throughout elongating aggregates, both in the regions that were elongating and in those that did not elongate. In control cultures, we found no regional difference in migration speed but in the elongating regions cells tended to be a little more persistent in their movement and oriented with the principal axis of the aggregate, which is perhaps to be expected. Nor was there any change in the regional patterns of cell speed when we inhibited proliferation with Mitomycin C or aphidicolin. Surprisingly, these proliferation inhibitors slightly decreased the persistence of movement and decreased the alignment with the principal axis of the aggregates. This suggested that features of coordinated collective migration were compromised when proliferation was inhibited. Therefore, by some means coordination of migration may also mediate the impact of regional cell proliferation on epithelial elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Similarly, do stretch-induced elongations regress after removal from stretch and transfer to floating culture?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to do this experiment, but it was technically unsuccessful. This is because the gels shrank when they were transferred into floating culture, making it difficult to visualize the aggregates adequately with our microscope set up.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) AIIB2 implicates β1 integrin, but not α2β1.

This appeared to be uniform in control aggregates that elongated spontaneously, without any evident regional variation in regions that elongated compared with regions that did not elongate (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Nor did we see any evident increase in fibronectin staining when cultures were stretched (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>ii) A good point about AIIB2 implicating β1 integrin generally rather than α2β1 specifically: we’ve corrected our text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;This regional patterning would be necessary if proliferation drives elongation, as a global increase in cell number would cause aggregates to expand isotropically.&quot; It is important to acknowledge that a critical regulatory feature missing from this model is a developed basement membrane. in vivo, the local degradation and remodeling of basement membrane mechanically permit region specific expansion of developing branched tissues, such as in the embryonic salivary gland (Harunaga et al.

Katsuno-Kambe et al. investigate the role of the extracellular matrix during the process of elongation, making use of 3D culture models of mammary epithelial MCF10A cells. These cells have previously been shown (e.g Krause et al., Tissue Eng Part C Methods 2008, and others) to form multicellular aggregates that polarize and eventually form lumens when cultured in Matrigel, and when embedded in Collagen I (a major component of the stromal environment) form elongated, solid cords of non-polarized cells. Therefore, to capture the process by which aggregates break symmetry and become elongated, the authors first seeded MCF10A cells in Matrigel until proliferation arrested (resembling anlage), after which aggregates where isolated and embedded into collagen I gels. The authors show increased proliferation of cells in elongating areas of aggregates, and that these elongated aggregates are not formed when proliferation is inhibited. The authors further show that this elongation is accompanied by collagen reorganization into polarized bundles around elongating areas, and by artificially polarizing collagen by application of external stretch show collagen polarization can increase proliferation and guide the direction of elongation. Finally, the authors demonstrate aggregate elongation requires beta1-integrin adhesion and downstream ERK activity.</p><p>The strength of this manuscript is the use of a reductionist approach to investigate the role of collagen alignment in the elongation of epithelial anlage, by transplanting MCF10A cell clusters from matrigel into Collagen I gels, and artificially manipulating collagen polarization by stretching these gels. In addition, the exploration of the underlying mechanism of elongation, requiring proliferation and integrin-ERK signaling, is of potential great interest to understanding the role of cues derived from the extracellular matrix in epithelial morphogenesis.</p><p>The main weakness of this study is that the data still insufficiently supports several conclusions, in particular on proliferation being a key driver of anlage elongation, and on the reciprocal interaction between proliferation and collagen polarization during this process. The induction of proliferation is only analyzed 8 days after cell clusters have been transferred to Collagen gels, and thus after symmetry break and elongation have already occured. Analyses of proliferation and collagen polarization during the different stages of symmetry break and elongation, and detailed analyses of the distribution of proliferative cells during these stages, are lacking. This is in particular relevant as also in non-elongated areas, cells that are in contact with Collagen appear to be proliferative. Alternative driver mechanisms, for instance the induction of collective migration, are not fully tested and it remains unclear whether proliferation is merely required for, or truly a driver event of aggregate elongation.</p><p>The authors investigate a role for integrin signaling and downstream ERK in the induction of proliferation and aggregate elongation in response to collagen polarization. While an integrin β 1 inhibitory antibody and ERK inhibitor indeed prevents elongation, key unanswered questions are whether this pathway is indeed activated by polarized collagen during elongation (i.e. in selective regions of the cell clusters) and whether it is required for the proliferation response itself.</p><p>Despite the elegance of the reductionist approach in MCF10A cells in vitro, it remains unclear to what extent these findings generally apply to mammary tubulogenesis under physiological conditions in vivo, which remains largely undiscussed in the manuscript.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. The authors conclude that cell proliferation is a key driver of epithelial anlage elongation. However, the induction of proliferation is only analyzed 8 days after transfer of cell clusters to Collagen I, after symmetry break and elongation have taken place. And here, analysis of proliferation is limited to cells in the elongated areas versus the remaining cell cluster. It is essential to include analyses of proliferation during the different stages of elongation (i.e. before and upon initial symmetry break and at different time points of elongation), as well as detailed analyses of the distribution of proliferative cells during these stages. This is in particular relevant as from the images (e.g. Figure 1C) it is apparent that also in the non-elongated areas the cells on the outside of the cell cluster (thus in contact with Collagen I) are proliferating (e.g. Figure 1C), yet do not form elongated strands (which also does not support the authors conclusions that &quot;proliferation is selectively increased in regions of aggregates that were elongating&quot;). Finally, analysis of the induction of proliferation should also include a control in which cell clusters are transferred back to matrigel.</p></disp-quote><p>i) We have performed additional experiments to analyse proliferation early in the elongation process.</p><p>a) In order to assess when overall changes in proliferation became evident, we measured the proportion of cells that were Ki67-positive in the first 3 days of culture. An increase in Ki67-positivity was first evident on day 2 which was, interestingly, about a day before elongation was first detected.</p><p>b) To examine if there were locoregional differences in proliferation rates in these early aggregates, at day 3 we examined aggregates that had broken symmetry and begun to elongate (which we defined experimentally as a symmetry ratio of &gt;1.5). We compared the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in the elongating regions of aggregates with the proportion found in the non-elongating parts of the aggregates. This showed a significant increase in the proportion of Ki67-positive cells in the elongating regions compared with the non-elongating regions. These new data lead us to conclude that loco-regional differences in cell proliferation are evident early in the elongation process, as well as later (as we had initially demonstrated).</p><p>ii) Furthermore, as the reviewer notes, cell proliferation was certainly seen in regions of aggregates that did not elongate. However, proliferation was greater in the elongating areas. So, it is the loco-regional difference in proliferation that seemed to be significant in our experiments. We have endeavoured to clarify this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>iii) We also performed the control experiment where aggregates were extracted from Matrigel, then re-embedded in Matrigel. The data are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C: we found that the aggregates did not elongate and, although Ki67 positive cells were evident, they appeared to be distributed randomly in the aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Alternative driver mechanisms, in particular cell migration, are limited to analysis of migration speed that is similar in different regions of the aggregate. This does not exclude that induction of directional, collective migration could be the main driving event underlying elongation, which remains unexplored. As such, it remains undetermined whether proliferation is merely required for, or truly a driver event of aggregate elongation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and took the opportunity to measure a number of other parameters of cell motility for this revision (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-H). In addition to cell speed, we also measured the straightness of the tracks (as an index of persistence) and the orientation of tracks relative to the principal axis of the aggregates. For these parameters we compared cells in the elongating regions of aggregates with cells in the non-elongating regions. There was no difference in migration speed between these two areas, but cells in the elongating areas migrated slightly more persistently and tended to orient themselves with the axis of elongation. Such an enhanced orientation of the migrating cells would be predicted to facilitate elongation.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that, although it did not affect the speed of movement, inhibition of proliferation decreased the apparent persistence of movement and also caused cells to orient with less fidelity to the principal axis of the aggregates. Such changes in orderly migration could also have contributed to the defect in elongation. However, the implication is that these features of migration depend in some way upon cell proliferation. Our current data do not allow us to explain why this occurs. One possibility is that reorganization of the collagen matrix, which we show to be influenced by cell proliferation, influences cell movement. Polarized collagen could be regarded as a 3D micropattern that surrounds the elongating regions of the aggregates. Irrespective of the mechanism responsible, we suggest that this new data reinforces the concept that regional stimulation of proliferation is key to epithelial elongation in our system: and it may work both directly (by increasing cell number preferentially in the elongating areas) and also (directly or indirectly) by enhancing features of orderly cell migration that would also promote elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mention in the discussion that &quot;the initial step of symmetry-breaking was associated with reorganization of collagen fibrils along the aggregate (…) which became increasingly bundled and aligned as elongation proceeded&quot;. However, data showing these changes in collagen during the different steps are not presented in the manuscript. This is in particular important as the authors conclude that collagen polarization induces proliferation, and therefore the authors should include a more detailed analyses of both processes (collagen reorganization and proliferation) over time after cell clusters are transferred to Collagen gels, and how they are associated with each other in individual cell clusters.</p><p>In addition, can the authors explain the induction of proliferation in cells in contact with collagen in the non-elongating areas (e.g. Figure 1C, see comment 1), as this suggest contact with collagen is sufficient to increase proliferation and collagen polarization is not required?</p></disp-quote><p>i) We have now examined collagen organization earlier in the elongation process (Figure 2E). For this, we analysed aggregates within the first 3 days of the assays. Because aggregates do vary in the time when they broke symmetry we subdivided them based on their symmetry ratio, comparing the coherency of the collagen gel around aggregates that remained rounded (symmetry ratio ~ 1) or around those with progressively greater symmetry ratios. We found that gel coherency increased (which we interpret as reflecting collagen bundling) with the increase in symmetry ratio. This confirmed that collagen reorganizes during the earliest stages of aggregate elongation.</p><p>ii) It is important to emphasize that cell proliferation was observed throughout the aggregates, both in regions that failed to elongate as well as those that did elongate. This implies that it is the regional difference is one of degree, not all or nothing. In other words, the key is what may increase proliferation in the areas of aggregates which elongate. Therefore, it becomes noteworthy that the regions that show increased proliferation are those which are adjacent to the more polarized collagen. This was evident in aggregates that broke symmetry spontaneously. Also, when we induced collagen polarization by stretching the gels, proliferation was stimulated preferentially in the elongating areas.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that the regional increase in cell proliferation associated with elongation is not being stimulated by contact with collagen <italic>per se</italic>, but rather by some additional property of the collagen gels that is associated with their reorganization. What that property may be is not something which we can answer at the present time; and we’d respectfully suggest that it may be more suitable to a separate, future project. Instead, we discuss some possibilities – including changes in stiffness of the collagen matrix – in greater depth and explicitness in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In line with the above comment, the conclusion that collagen polarization promotes proliferation is largely based on the experiments in which collagen gels were stretched. However, the effect on proliferation is again only assessed following 8 days of culture in these gels, and thus after aggregate elongation. To support their conclusion, proliferation should be analyzed at early time points following stretching. This would also address whether the earlier symmetry break observed after stretching is a consequence of increased/faster induction of proliferation, or involves the ability of already proliferating cells to drive epithelial elongation (which will affect the interpretation of these data).</p></disp-quote><p>This was a good point and we have now done these experiments. We find that enhanced proliferation is detectable even one day after stretching. As shown in Figure 5A, proliferation begins earlier and to a greater degree in stretch-stimulated aggregates. This reinforces our interpretation that stimulation of proliferation is a driver of elongation, and we thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors demonstrate that inhibition of proliferation prevents aggregate elongation. It is difficult to interpret from these experiments whether proliferation could truly be a key driver of elongation, as aggregates appear to remain much smaller following mitomycin C and Aphidicolin treatment (Figure 1H). It should be shown whether in the absence of the inhibitors, symmetry break and elongation is induced at this aggregate size (and thus whether the observed effect represents a direct or indirect of the inhibitors on elongation). In addition, proliferation inhibitors should also be given after the symmetry break has taken place, to test whether this prevents protrusions that are already present from elongating further.</p></disp-quote><p>a. We have observed small control aggregates (with sizes comparable to those of proliferation-inhibited aggregates) that break symmetry. However, aggregates tended to break symmetry at different times in culture (and therefore at different sizes). So, we have not endeavoured to quantitatively compare the sizes when symmetry broke in controls vs proliferation-inhibited cultures. Accordingly, we include representative images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) , but would be happy to add them to the manuscript if the reviewer and editor consider it to be warranted.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67915-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>b. To test the impact of inhibiting proliferation after symmetry had broken, we added drugs at day 3, when symmetry breaking had occurred (Figure 1M). Elongation was significantly inhibited, implying that cell proliferation contributes to sustaining aggregate elongation once symmetry has broken. This observation reinforces our interpretation that proliferation plays a critical role in the elongation process, rather than differences in aggregate size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors investigate a role for integrin signaling and downstream ERK in the induction of proliferation and aggregate elongation in response to collagen polarization. While indeed both integrin beta1 and ERK activity are necessary for aggregate elongation, whether this pathway is directly involved in aggregate elongation remains unclear, and analysis of cell proliferation is lacking. The authors should test with available antibodies whether this pathway is specifically induced by polarized collagen (by analyzing different regions of the aggregate during symmetry break and elongation). In addition, effect of inhibitors on the level and distribution of Ki67+ cells should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a number of additional experiments in response to these suggestions.</p><p>i) To determine if ERK was, indeed, a downstream element in an integrin-dependent pathway, we used the ERK location sensor to measure how ERK signaling was affected by the β1-integrin-blocking antibody, AIIB2, when elongation was stimulated by stretching of the gels. We found that the proportion of cells showing ERK activation was significantly reduced by AIIB2, both early (day 2) and late (day 7) in the assays (Figure 7H, I). Thus, we consider that β1-integrin is driving proliferation via ERK.</p><p>ii) To test if there were loco-regional differences in ERK activation, we measured the proportion of ERK-activated cells in the elongating and non-elongating areas of aggregates (Figure 6A-C). Consistent with what we had observed for proliferation, a greater proportion of cells showed ERK activation in the elongating areas, than in the non-elongating areas. This loco-regional difference was evident when we measured ERK activation in cells throughout the aggregates (Figure 6B) and when we only analysed those at the surface, which were in contact with the collagen (Figure 6C).</p><p>iii) We measured the effect on proliferation of inhibiting ERK with FR180204 (Figure 6D,E) or blocking β1-integrin with AIIB2 (Figure 7D). These new data show that proliferation was reduced by these inhibitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. To control that effects observed in stretched collagen gels are truly mediated by the induced collagen polarization, the authors allowed gels to float in the medium to revert gel isotropy to that of unstretched gels. While collagen polarization is indeed reverted, cells cultured in floating gels will not able be able to generate stresses themselves (e.g. Halliday et al., 1995). From these experiments it can therefore not be concluded whether it is truly the collagen polarization or stresses generated by the cells that are needed for aggregate elongation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point, and one that indicates something which warrants clarification. We think that collagen polarization and stress-generation by cells are closely linked processes. When aggregates spontaneously break symmetry, we’d hypothesize that anisotropies in contractile tension are responsible for initiating collagen polarization. Conversely, the stretched gels that we use to exogenously polarize the gels are likely to apply stresses to the cell. Furthermore, as implied by the reviewer it is possible that cells generate different stresses when they are exposed to polarized compared with unpolarized collagen, and this “internal” stress is what is promoting proliferation.</p><p>However, the key point of our paper is that collagen polarization promotes elongation by stimulating cell proliferation in the areas of aggregates that are adjacent to the polarized collagen. The source of the stress that polarizes the collagen is less important, in this perspective, than the fact that polarization promotes proliferation. This was not clear in the original manuscript and we’ve endeavoured to correct this flaw in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It remains unclear to what extent the findings from this manuscript apply to mammary tubulogenesis in vivo, which remains undiscussed in the manuscript. While some experiments may be difficult to verify in vivo (e.g. to monitor collagen alignment), it would be relevant to at least to know whether in vivo mammary epithelial cells indeed come in contact with collagen I during anlage elongation, and preferably also show whether this is accompanied by a specific proliferation response.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we can draw guidance from the literature, which has reported that: (a) collagen is a major component of the ECM in morphogenetically-active mammary buds (Keely et al., Differentiation, 59: 1, 1995) and, also, (b) the basement membrane thins substantially at those growing tips, which would facilitate contact between cells and collagen, as reduce the mechanical impact of the basement membrane, compared with the surrounding ECM (Silberstein and Daniel, Dev Biol, 90, 215, 1982; Williams and Daniel, Dev Biol 97, 274, 1983). We’ve included discussion of this point in the final paragraphs of the Discussion, to highlight the physiological implications of our in vitro findings. With due respect, we feel that to extend our current observations into an in vivo model would be beyond the reasonable scope of a revision and better suited to a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Understanding tissue morphogenesis requires an understanding of underlying molecular and mechanical mechanisms. Many tissues form a network of branched tubules and understanding their origins is an important question for the field. Here the authors develop a simple, novel assay for exploring this. By plating MCF-10A mammary epithelia cell cysts in 3D collagen, they find that these cells rapidly reorganize, break symmetry, and send out streams of cells that proliferate as they move outward, forming solid cords. This behavior is particular for collagen and is not see in Matrigel. They then proceed to use this system to explore the causal links between collagen, proliferation, directed outgrowth and integrin signaling. They find that cell proliferation coincides with outgrowth and outgrowth is blocked in proliferation is inhibited. They find that collagen is re-organized as outgrowth occurs, altering fibril organization. They then carried out a set of clever experiments to use mechanical stretch to pre-orient fibrils, and found that aggregates preferentially elongated along the fibril preferred axis. Pre-oriented fibrils also sped elongation and proliferation. Finally, blocking integrin signaling reduced/delayed elongation. I found the new system interesting, and the data intriguing. However, I had two major concerns, about the measurements presented and the causality suggested.</p><p>1. Most of the experiments involve measuring collagen fibril orientation and coherency. However, in most of the images I could not see individual fibrils (the exception, Figure 3D, was strikingly different than the rest). I would like to see a clearer description in the main text of how orientation was measured and why this is difficult to see in most images.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point of clarification. Individual collagen fibrils were difficult to image in our experiments because low magnification imaging was necessary, for two reasons: (a) We were endeavouring to capture whole aggregates and their surrounding matrix in 3D videos; and (b) higher magnification lenses did not provide the depth of focus needed to image aggregates deep within the gels. (On this point, the fibrils are evident in Figure 3D because this floating gel allowed us to access the gel surface. In contrast, when gels were embedded – including after they had been stretched – then we had to image deeper.)</p><p>Accordingly, we analysed collagen organization using Orientation J, which calculates the local orientation and isotropy for each pixel in an image based on the structure tensor for that pixel. The structure tensor is evaluated for each pixel of the given image by calculating the spatial partial derivatives by using (a cubic B-spline) interpolation. The local orientation and isotropy for each pixel are computed based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the structure tensor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Bigger picture was the issue of causality. The authors present seemingly a linear view – integrin signaling drives proliferation and outgrowth and this triggers fibril orientation that then feeds back into the process. However, I found causality difficult to discern. While proliferation is necessary for outgrowth, its role seemed to be more likely to be permissive rather than instructive. The observation that cells would follow oriented fibrils was interesting but perhaps not surprising, and I found it difficult to tease out whether elongation triggered polarization of collagen or vice versa – I guess the authors favor a feedback process.</p></disp-quote><p>In revising the manuscript, we have taken the opportunity to perform additional experiments and also to present the data and our interpretation with greater clarity. In particular, we argue that polarized collagen exerts its impact on elongation by promoting proliferation in the parts of the cell aggregate that are adjacent to the polarized collagen. Our new data show that:</p><p>a) When aggregates elongate spontaneously, cell proliferation is detectable ~ 24 hours before elongation. And even in these early stages proliferation is greater in the elongating parts of aggregates, rather than in the non-elongating parts of the aggregates. Since inhibitors of proliferation reduce elongation, these correlations suggest that selective increase of proliferation within elongating areas is necessary for that elongation to occur.</p><p>b) Cell proliferation is also stimulated when we induce collagen polarization extrinsically, by stretching the gels (Figure 5). Strikingly, we find that an increase in cell proliferation occurs earlier with stretch-polarization than when aggregates are allowed to break symmetry and polarize spontaneously. And, as seen with spontaneous elongation, proliferation is greater in the elongating areas of the aggregates. We take this as evidence that polarization of collagen can stimulate cell proliferation in a loco-regional fashion.</p><p>c) We have performed further analyses to characterize cell migration within aggregates in greater detail. Interestingly, we find that although inhibitors of mitosis did not affect the speed of cell migration, they disrupted the directionality of migration. Cells treated with aphidicolin or Mitomycin C did not orient with the principal axis of the aggregates as well did control cells. This suggests that an effect on directional migration may have contributed to the disruption of epithelial elongation that occurs when proliferation is inhibited.</p><p>We propose that these data identify the capacity for polarized collagen to stimulate cell proliferation in the parts of the aggregates proximate to the polarized gel. And this is necessary for elongation to occur effectively. We have endeavoured to make this point more clearly in this revision than we did earlier, because we consider this to be a new insight into how elongation occurs. Earlier studies, using experimentally-similar systems, principally focused on how matrix organization might affect cell locomotion to promote elongation. Migration is unarguably important, but our data suggest that it is not enough. Migration did not compensate when proliferation is inhibited and, indeed, may be supported by proliferation in some way.</p><p>Finally, we agree that feedback is likely to be important when aggregates break symmetry and extend spontaneously. We found that collagen polarization was reduced when cell proliferation was blocked, suggesting that polarization may be initially induced by some mechanical change associated with proliferation. We discuss this briefly in the revision. Possibly, local variations in cell proliferation induce anisotropies of force to being to polarize the collagen. However, this is largely speculative at the present time: more detailed temporal and spatial analysis that compares proliferation with elongation and collagen polarization will be needed to answer this question. We respectfully suggest that these experiments would make the subject of a separate study in themselves.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We have received comments from two of the previous reviewers, both of whom indicate the manuscript is strengthened by the addition of new experiments, text clarifications, and discussion of results in context.

However, this quantification could be potentially misleading, as there is also a significant difference in the number of cells with surface area contacting the surrounding collagen in non-elongating regions yet those that do appear to be proliferative (Figure 1C, 1J). Further not all instances of accumulated collagen appear to lead to elongation.</p></disp-quote><p>To pursue this, we further analysed the data set of Figure 1C and J to measure proliferation just in the cells that were in contact with the collagen. We found that the proportion of cells which were Ki-67, was greater in regions of aggregates that were elongating, compared to the non-elongating regions. This confirmed our earlier analysis that encompassed all the cells in the respective regions. It further reinforces our conclusion that the rate of cell proliferation was greater in the elongating regions of aggregates.</p><p>This data (which extends the analysis in Figure 1C and 1J) is now included in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors clearly demonstrate (Figure 5) that polarized collagen influences the kinetics of proliferation and elongation. Perhaps this can be explained by a slightly refined model in which collagen is sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation in anlagen and its concurrent polarization/remodeling provides boundary conditions that together support the emergent behavior of elongation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good idea, which we have happily stolen for the final paragraph of our discussion (lines 542-544):</p><p>“The consequent loco-regional collagen polarization then stimulates further cell proliferation in the adjacent parts of the aggregate to sustain elongation. Biochemical contact with collagen may provide a basal stimulus for cell proliferation, which is further enhanced where collagen becomes polarized to provide a boundary condition that promotes elongation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
