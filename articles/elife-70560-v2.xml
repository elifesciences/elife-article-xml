ribosomal protein eS30 is synthesized as a fusion protein with the ubiquitin-like protein FUBI. However, FUBI is not part of the mature 40S ribosomal subunit and cleaved off by an as-of-yet unidentified protease. How FUBI-eS30 processing is coordinated with 40S subunit maturation is unknown. To study the mechanism and importance of FUBI-eS30 processing, we expressed non-cleavable mutants in human cells, which affected late steps of cytoplasmic 40S maturation, including the maturation of 18S rRNA and recycling of late-acting ribosome biogenesis factors. Differential affinity purification of wild-type and non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants identified the deubiquitinase USP36 as a candidate FUBI-eS30 processing enzyme. Depletion of USP36 by RNAi or CRISPRi indeed impaired FUBI-eS30 processing and moreover, purified USP36 cut FUBI-eS30 in vitro. Together, these data demonstrate the functional importance of FUBI-eS30 cleavage and identify USP36 as a novel protease involved in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>ribosome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>DUB</kwd><kwd>FUBI</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>nucleolus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_166565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutay</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR RNA and Disease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kutay</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endoproteolytic cleavage of the ribosomal precursor protein FUBI-eS30 is required for efficient maturation of small ribosomal subunits in the cytoplasm of human cells and involves the nucleolar deubiquitinase USP36.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the majority of eukaryotes, one ribosomal protein (RP) of each subunit is encoded as a linear fusion with an N-terminal ubiquitin (Ub). In addition to genome-encoded polyubiquitin chains, these Ub-RP fusion proteins serve as source of cellular ubiquitin, which is liberated from these precursors by endoproteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2021</xref>). The released ubiquitin constitutes a major fraction of the ubiquitin pool in both yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ozkaynak et al., 1987</xref>). From the perspective of the ubiquitin proteasome system, it is not entirely clear why ubiquitin is encoded as a fusion with RPs; but such a configuration seems suited to jointly determine the capacities of the protein degradation and protein synthesis machineries. From the perspective of the fused RPs, their N-terminal ubiquitin moieties seem beneficial as they have been suggested to serve as ‘in cis’ chaperones for folding and solubility of the respective RP partners, as shown by studies in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In humans, the ribosomal proteins eS31 (RPS27A) and eL40 (RPL40) of the small and large ribosomal subunit, respectively, are synthesized as Ub-RP precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker and Board, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kirschner and Stratakis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lund et al., 1985</xref>), similar to their yeast homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Pevida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2020</xref>). How cleavage of their ubiquitin portions is linked to the incorporation of the respective RPs into nascent ribosomal subunits is not understood, but it was shown to be important for ribosome functionality in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández-Pevida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2020</xref>). In general, ubiquitin deconjugation is performed by a large family of deubiquitinases (DUBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clague et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eletr and Wilkinson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). About 100 DUBs exist in mammalian cells, subdivided into seven distinct families based on their structural organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clague et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). Biochemical experiments have identified several candidate DUBs for processing of the two human Ub-RP fusions, including UCHL3, USP9X, USP7, USP5 and OTULIN, which may act post-translationally in a partially redundant fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, humans and other holozoan organisms, a group not containing yeasts, synthesize a third RP as a fusion protein, namely eS30 (RPS30/FAU). Yet, in case of eS30, its N-terminal fusion partner is not ubiquitin but the ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) FUBI (also known as MNSFβ, FUB1, or UBIM). The coding sequence of FUBI-eS30 was originally identified in the transforming retrovirus FBR-MuSV (Finkel-Biskis-Reilly Murine Sarcoma Virus), which coined the term <italic>Fau</italic> (<italic>F</italic>BR-MuSV-<italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>u</italic>biquitously expressed) for the FUBI-eS30 coding gene in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kas et al., 1992</xref>). FUBI displays 36% identity with ubiquitin. Similar to ubiquitin, FUBI possesses a C-terminal diglycine motif, which is crucial in ubiquitin for its conjugation to and removal from substrates including ubiquitin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sloper-Mould et al., 2001</xref>). However, in contrast to ubiquitin, FUBI contains only a single internal lysine residue, corresponding to the least accessible lysine residue 27 of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castañeda et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, FUBI chain formation has not been reported, and enzymes mediating conjugation of FUBI to other proteins, akin to those that mediate protein ubiquitylation, remain to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cappadocia and Lima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van der Veen and Ploegh, 2012</xref>). Some studies suggested a role for FUBI in the immune system of mammals, that is in the regulation of T cells and macrophages. Such functions may entail the conjugation of FUBI to partner proteins such as the pro-apoptotic factor Bcl-G and the endocytosis regulator endophilin A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamura and Shimosaki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakamura and Yamaguchi, 2006</xref>). However, since FUBI-eS30 is conserved in the holozoan subclade of Opisthokonta, which includes animals and their closest single-celled relatives, although not yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleshin et al., 2007</xref>), the cellular immune system of multicellular organisms is unlikely to be the major determinant for the presence of FUBI.</p><p>Of the FUBI-eS30 fusion protein, only eS30 becomes a part of mature ribosomes. It is positioned at the shoulder of the small ribosomal subunit, tucked in between helices h16 and h18 of the 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Three conserved basic residues near the C terminus of eS30 line the mRNA channel, where they may interact with the mRNA phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>). The N-terminal end of eS30 extends towards the A-site decoding center that is located near the base of h44. Therefore, a FUBI moiety attached to the N terminus of eS30 may sterically obstruct the access of tRNAs to the ribosome. However, it has remained enigmatic which enzyme separates FUBI and eS30, and how FUBI cleavage is coordinated with the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Also, the exact consequences of a lack of FUBI removal on ribosome function or synthesis are currently unclear.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mutant, non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 can be incorporated into (pre-)40S particles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structures (PDB ID: 4UG0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khatter et al., 2015</xref>) of the human 40S subunit shown from the subunit interface (top) and of the 80S ribosome viewed from the mRNA entry channel (bottom), highlighting the <italic>hypothetical</italic> location of FUBI (blue) at the N terminus of eS30 (orange).

Persistence of FUBI on nascent 40S subunits impaired late cytoplasmic steps of 40S maturation, leading to the accumulation of subunits that fail to join the pool of translating ribosomes. Differential proteomics of factors associated with wild-type versus cleavage-deficient FUBI-eS30 mutants identified the nucleolar deubiquitinase USP36 as a candidate processing factor, which was proven by depletion and biochemical reconstitution experiments. Collectively, we demonstrate that removal of FUBI from eS30 is important for 40S subunits to gain competence in protein translation and show that USP36 is a promiscuous enzyme whose activity extends from ubiquitin to the ubiquitin-like protein FUBI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To study the importance of FUBI-eS30 processing for ribosome biogenesis and function, we set out to explore the consequences of expressing cleavage-deficient FUBI-eS30 mutants. We reasoned that cleavage of the FUBI-eS30 fusion protein by an unidentified ubiquitin-like protease (ULP) could be impaired by mutation of FUBI’s C-terminal diglycine motif, akin to analogous mutations in ubiquitin that are known to affect endoproteolytic cleavage of linear ubiquitin fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmair et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2020</xref>). We generated tagged FUBI-eS30-StHA (tandem Strep II-hemagglutinin tag) wild-type (WT) or diglycine mutant constructs in which either both glycines were changed to alanines (G73,74A; AA) or the C-terminal glycine was changed to valine (G74V; GV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), inspired by mutations previously introduced into Ub-RP fusion proteins in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>). Using these constructs, we produced tetracycline-inducible HeLa and HEK cell lines in a cellular background containing endogenous FUBI-eS30 to uncouple the study of FUBI-eS30 processing from effects that could arise from lack of free FUBI or eS30. While most of FUBI(WT)-eS30-StHA was processed, alterations of the diglycine motif rendered both mutant constructs non-cleavable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This indicates that a FUBI-eS30-specific ULP also requires an intact diglycine motif for processing.</p><p>To test whether the non-cleavable mutants can be incorporated into ribosomal subunits and translating ribosomes, we analyzed the sedimentation behavior of the WT and AA mutant constructs in sucrose gradients of lysates prepared from inducible HEK293 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). WT FUBI-eS30-StHA was cleaved and successfully incorporated into small ribosomal subunits that can engage in mRNA translation, evident by its co-sedimentation with the 40S-specific ribosome biogenesis factor (RBF) NOB1 in the 40S peak, and with the RPS uS3 in the 40S, 80S and polysome-containing fractions. In contrast, a larger portion of FUBI(AA)-eS30-StHA was migrating in lighter gradient fractions that contain monomeric proteins and small protein complexes, suggesting that its incorporation into 40S subunits could be less efficient. Still, FUBI(AA)-eS30-StHA was also detected in 40S- and 80S-containing fractions, indicating that the mutant fusion protein can in principle be incorporated into ribosomal subunits. Importantly, however, its levels were decreased in gradient fractions containing actively translating ribosomes and the polysome pellet. Thus, while FUBI removal is not essential for incorporation of eS30 into pre-40S particles, it appears to be a prerequisite for proper function of 40S subunits in translating polysomes.</p><p>To investigate the effects of non-cleavable FUBI-eS30-StHA mutant constructs on ribosomal subunit ratio and translation, we next performed polysome profile analysis of HEK293 cells expressing FUBI-eS30 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While there were no significant differences between the A<sub>254</sub> profiles of cell extracts obtained from parental HEK293 cells and cells expressing FUBI(WT)-eS30-StHA, expression of the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30-StHA AA and GV mutants led to significantly decreased 40S and polysome levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Concomitantly, free 60S subunit levels were increased, which is commonly observed if eukaryotic 40S production is impaired such as upon depletion of various RPS or 40S RBFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Donohue et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, defective maturation of pre-40S subunits containing mutant, non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 could be the reason why this fusion protein does not appear in polysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>40S ribosome biogenesis is defective upon expression of non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Extracts from parental (P), wild-type (WT) or mutant (AA, GV) FUBI-eS30-StHA HEK293 cell lines were separated on a linear 15–45% sucrose gradient by centrifugation and analyzed by polysome profiling recording the absorption at 254 nm.

The processing of the initial 47S pre-rRNA occurs in a sequential manner along at least two parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henras et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To excise the 18S rRNA, the polycistronic 47S precursor is shortened at the 5’ and 3' ends and cleaved within the spacer between the 18S and 5.8S rRNAs. This yields the nucleolar 30S pre-rRNA which is readily detectable by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additional processing at the 5’ end produces the 21S pre-rRNA, which is then further matured at the 3’ end via the so-called 18S-E pre-rRNA intermediates in the nucleo- and cytoplasm. We assessed the cellular levels of the various 18S rRNA precursors using a probe hybridizing to the 5' region of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (5'ITS1). Whereas expression of FUBI(WT)-eS30-StHA did not significantly alter the levels of 18S rRNA precursors compared to parental cells, the non-cleavable mutants induced a strong increase in the levels of 26S and 18S-E pre-rRNAs and a significant decrease in the 30S and 21S precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This concomitant increase in the levels of both 26S and 18S-E pre-rRNA is reminiscent of their accumulation upon depletion of a subset of RPS termed progression (p-)RPS that are important for 21S and 18S-E processing as well as cleavage at site 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Donohue et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, expression of the non-cleavable mutants did not affect rRNA precursors specific to the 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as we only detected an accumulation of 43S pre-rRNA, a usually short-lived precursor common to both subunits. Thus, the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30-StHA mutants exert dominant-negative effects on 18S pre-rRNA processing, affecting both early and late steps of the processing pathway, with the major defect concerning processing at site 3.</p><p>To further characterize these 18S pre-rRNA processing defects, we examined the localization of 18S rRNA precursors by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization experiments using a Cy3-labeled probe against the 5’ end of ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In parental and WT cells, the 5’ITS1-positive precursors localized to nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rouquette et al., 2005</xref>), where most early processing steps during maturation of pre-40S subunits take place, as expected. 18S-E pre-rRNA-containing 40S particles are then transported from nucleoli to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Preti et al., 2013</xref>), where removal of the remaining 3’ overhang by NOB1 generates mature 18S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fatica et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pertschy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sloan et al., 2013</xref>).

It has therefore remained difficult to deduce whether eS30 is incorporated into pre-40S subunits in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. To test whether eS30 already joins nuclear pre-40S particles, we induced early 40S biogenesis defects by depletion of some key required factors (see below) and checked by immunofluorescence whether StHA-tagged eS30 derived from the FUBI(WT)-eS30-StHA fusion protein accumulates in the nucleus due to impaired subunit maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To control for the efficiency of the respective treatments on 40S subunit maturation, we used the RBF ENP1 (BYSL) as a marker.

Upon LMB treatment, a weak nucleoplasmic eS30-StHA signal became apparent in addition. Similarly, nuclear accumulation of eS30-StHA was also observed upon depletion of the pre-40S export receptor XPO1, suggesting that eS30-StHA is a part of nuclear pre-40S particles that accumulate in the nucleoplasm due to export inhibition. To exclude that this is simply due to the fact that eS30 itself is kept out of the nucleus by XPO1-mediated export, we directly interfered with nuclear 40S biogenesis by depletion of uS19 (RPS15), which is known to be required for late steps of nucleoplasmic pre-40S maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Léger-Silvestre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rouquette et al., 2005</xref>). This led to a prominent nucleoplasmic accumulation of eS30-StHA, indicating that eS30 responds to perturbations of nuclear 40S maturation and is incorporated into nascent subunits in the nucleus. To examine whether eS30 might join pre-40S particles already in nucleoli, we depleted the primary binding RPS eS4X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lastick, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wild et al., 2010</xref>), which is known to induce early nucleolar pre-40S subunit maturation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badertscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wild et al., 2010</xref>). This resulted in the retention of ENP1 in nucleoli in presence of LMB as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badertscher et al., 2015</xref>). Under these conditions, we observed both a nucleoplasmic and a nucleolar eS30-StHA signal, especially in presence of LMB, which could suggest that eS30 is targeted to nucleoli for its incorporation into pre-40S subunits. Collectively, the nucle(ol)ar accumulation of FUBI(WT)-eS30-StHA upon induction of nuclear 40S maturation and export defects suggests that eS30 assembles into nuclear pre-40S ribosomes, likely already in the nucleolus. This conclusion is supported by previous proteomic data that indicated an efficient accumulation of newly synthesized FUBI-eS30 in isolated nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lam et al., 2007</xref>). To directly test whether eS30 is a component of nuclear pre-40S, we examined its association with pre-40S particles isolated by pull-down of a HASt-tagged version of the nucle(ol)ar RBF C21orf70 (FAM207A) from HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>). Analysis of the pull-down eluates by immunoblotting revealed that eS30 is indeed associated with these nucle(ol)ar 40S precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) that also contained the early pre-40S RBF NOC4L, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>), and lacked eS26, which is incorporated into pre-40S subunits in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plassart et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants induce defects in late cytoplasmic 40S subunit maturation</title><p>We next examined changes in the steady state localization of some key 40S RBFs upon expression of the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants, as this allows to more clearly pinpoint the step affected by a certain perturbation of 40S maturation. Nucleolar 40S subunit biogenesis gives rise to early pre-40S particles that contain a number of RBFs including ENP1, PNO1 (DIM2), and RRP12, all of which remain associated during transit of premature subunits from nucleoli through the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Further RBFs join in the nucleoplasm before nuclear export, including LTV1, TSR1, the atypical protein kinase RIOK2, and the site 3 endonuclease NOB1. Accordingly, there are various 40S RBFs that accompany maturing subunits from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which are then successively released in coordination with structural rearrangements that shape the maturing pre-40S particles, supported by additional RBFs such as CK1, RIOK1, and EIF1AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitterer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plassart et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schäfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants have a dominant-negative effect on late cytoplasmic steps of 40S subunit biogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of pre-40S maturation focusing on late nucleoplasmic to cytoplasmic maturation steps and highlighting the RBFs mentioned in the text.

Strikingly, PNO1, an RBF that localizes to nucleoli under steady state conditions, relocated to the cytoplasm. Similarly, a prominent recycling defect was also evident for RIOK2 and NOB1. Both are cytoplasmic at steady state but in cells expressing non-cleavable FUBI-eS30-StHA, they failed to accumulate in the nucleus upon LMB treatment, reflecting a failure in their timely release from cytoplasmic pre-40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zemp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>). Also for RIOK1, which localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic retention was clearly discernible. The observed changes are indicative for a late, cytoplasmic 40S biogenesis defect in cells expressing the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants, and consistent with the observed defects in 18S-E pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C to F</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, those RBFs that are released at an earlier stage of cytoplasmic 40S maturation, namely LTV1, ENP1, and RRP12, remained largely unaffected by the expression of the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). LTV1, which is cytoplasmic at steady state, accumulated in the nucleoplasm of cells expressing either WT or mutant FUBI-eS30-StHA upon LMB treatment, demonstrating that its recycling is not perturbed by non-cleavable FUBI. For ENP1 and RRP12, two RBFs that predominantly localize to nucleoli and accumulate in the nucleoplasm upon LMB treatment, we observed a slight nucleolar retention in cells expressing the non-cleavable mutants. These changes together with the observed alterations in early pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) could be the result of a so-called ‘rebound effect’, that is a secondary effect arising from the lack of 40S RBFs like PNO1 in nucleoli due to their strong cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kofler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zisser et al., 2018</xref>). Lastly, the localization of the 60S RBF NMD3 was not perturbed by mutant FUBI-eS30-StHA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), whereas depletion of the 60S RBF AAMP (Sqt1 in yeast) led to a cytoplasmic retention of NMD3 as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the comprehensive examination of the (re)localization of various RBFs suggests that FUBI-eS30 cleavage is a prerequisite for recycling of the RBFs RIOK2, PNO1, NOB1, and RIOK1 in final steps of cytoplasmic 40S maturation. In contrast, recycling of 40S RBFs that are released earlier as well as 60S biogenesis remain by-and-large unperturbed by the presence of FUBI in pre-40S particles.</p><p>Interestingly, when analyzing the localization of FUBI-eS30-StHA WT and its mutant derivatives in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we noticed a noteworthy difference: In contrast to the cytoplasmic staining of WT eS30-StHA, both non-cleavable mutants showed a reduced cytoplasmic signal and also localized to the nucleoplasm. This may reflect their hampered incorporation into maturing subunits since we observed a larger pool of non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants in the light fractions of sucrose gradients compared to the mostly cleaved and 40S-associated WT (FUBI-)eS30-StHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As the partial nuclear accumulation of non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants seemed at odds with the observed 40S maturation defects in the cytoplasm, we analyzed the fate of the nuclear FUBI-eS30 constructs by adding a chase period in tetracycline-free medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). After the chase, the nuclear signal vanished and both mutants primarily localized to the cytoplasm like WT FUBI-eS30-StHA. Importantly, however, the late 40S subunit biogenesis defect persisted, as assessed by analysis of PNO1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistent with these data, immunoblot analysis of polysome profiles revealed that FUBI(AA)-eS30-StHA was mainly particle-associated after the chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and E</xref>). The disappearance of FUBI(AA)-eS30-StHA from lighter sucrose fractions could be due to its incorporation into pre-40S particles over time and/or degradation of the unincorporated protein, which may also be reflected by the generally weaker signal in immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, since PNO1 was still trapped in the cytoplasm of AA- and GV-expressing cells and matching polysome profiles indicated 40S biogenesis defects similar to unchased cells, we conclude that the observed 40S biogenesis defects are primarily caused by pre-40S-associated non-cleavable FUBI-eS30-StHA mutants in the cytoplasm. Although we consider it unlikely, we cannot formally exclude that unincorporated, uncleaved FUBI-eS30 could serve as an unspecific ‘sink’ for one or some of the affected RBFs.

Among the studied RBFs, RRP12, ENP1, and LTV1 were normally released from pre-40S particles in the cytoplasm in presence of the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants. Release of these RBFs is coupled to the maturation of the 40S head, accompanied by the stable incorporation of the uS3–uS10–eS10–uS14 cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heuer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larburu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitterer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Scaiola et al., 2018</xref>).

On the pre-40S subunit, based on the position of the N terminus of eS30, FUBI is expected to occupy a region close to the binding sites of RIOK2, RIOK1, and TSR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameismeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larburu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plassart et al., 2021</xref>), yet none of these factors seemed affected in subunit binding based on MS analysis and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, FUBI must influence 40S maturation by other means.

It is thus conceivable that impaired recruitment of EIF1AD causes some of the observed recycling defects.</p><p>Curiously, although both RIOK2 and RIOK1 are assumed to bind pre-40S particles in a mutually exclusive, successive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zemp et al., 2009</xref>), we observed that the recycling of both kinases was compromised by FUBI. This could indicate that a failure in FUBI processing does not result in the accumulation of one specific precursor species but rather a suite of successive pre-40S particles that are kinetically delayed in their maturation. Alternatively, it cannot be excluded that a single type of particle, on which both RIO kinases are simultaneously present, is trapped in presence of FUBI. Although such a pre-40S state has never been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heuer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larburu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>), this assumption would be consistent with the recent observation that incoming RIOK1 binds at the pre-40S shoulder before it eventually flips over to occupy the former position of RIOK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>). Perhaps, eS30-linked FUBI impedes structural rearrangements of pre-40S subunits at the stage of RIOK2 release, leading to retention of RIOK1 at its landing site. Notably, RIOK2 appears to be shifted to a higher molecular weight in cells expressing the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), possibly arrested on pre-40S subunits in an activated phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angermayr et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geerlings et al., 2003</xref>). This model would eventually explain why depletion of RIOK1 affects RIOK2 dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Widmann et al., 2012</xref>). Normally, repositioning of RIOK1 is followed by a series of events, including EIF1AD binding, PNO1 release, eS26 incorporation, 18S-E processing, and the subsequent release of NOB1 and RIOK1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Plassart et al., 2021</xref>), all of which seem affected by uncleaved FUBI. Thus, FUBI removal from eS30 is a crucial event for the final maturation of pre-40S particles.</p><p>Surprisingly, we also observed RPLs and an enrichment of several 60S RBFs on non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants. In yeast, the last pre-40S maturation steps have been suggested to involve the formation of 80S-like particles containing pre-40S together with mature 60S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lebaron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turowski et al., 2014</xref>). Such particles have not been described for human pre-40S subunits, on which RBFs including RIOK2, RIOK1, potentially TSR1, EIF1AD, and LRRC47 at the subunit interface are expected to counteract premature 60S joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ameismeier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Montellese et al., 2020</xref>). While the association of RPLs and 60S RBFs with non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 constructs may point at the formation of 80S-like complexes with (pre-)60S subunits in human cells, it remains unclear whether those present a biochemical artefact or are indeed physiologically meaningful. Clearly, as both subunits are likely immature, the subunit interface in such 80S-like complexes would have to be distinct from that of authentic 80S ribosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FUBI-eS30 processing is mediated by USP36</title><p>Of the 11 known protein-modifying UBLs in humans, FUBI remains the most poorly characterized in terms of (de)conjugating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van der Veen and Ploegh, 2012</xref>). To identify candidate FUBI proteases, we used a differential proteomics approach, presuming that ULPs are more readily released from the cleavage products of WT FUBI-eS30 than from the non-cleavable variants. And indeed, two candidate proteases, USP10 and USP36, were enriched on the non-cleavable mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Yet, only depletion of USP36 impaired FUBI-eS30 processing, whereas downregulation of USP10 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Based on these distinct results and the existing literature, it must be assumed that the underlying causes for enrichment of USP10 and USP36 on non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants differ fundamentally.</p><p>USP10 is known to remove regulatory monoubiquitylations from eS10, uS3, and uS5 of 40S subunits that are translationally stalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garshott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meyer et al., 2020</xref>). In so doing, it has been suggested to rescue 40S subunits from degradation by ribophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meyer et al., 2020</xref>). In analogy, one can speculate that the retrieval of USP10 may reflect its binding to cytoplasmic (pre-)40S particles stalled in maturation that are potentially marked by monoubiquitylation due to a failure in FUBI removal.</p><p>In contrast, our functional data suggests that USP36 was trapped directly on its processing substrate FUBI-eS30. Several lines of evidence in our data support the conclusion that USP36 acts as a protease that liberates FUBI from eS30: (1) The depletion of USP36 by RNAi impairs the processing of both endogenous and ectopically expressed FUBI-eS30. (2) Downregulation of USP36 by CRISPRi recapitulates the accumulation of uncleaved FUBI-eS30 and rescue experiments showed that cleavage depends on the catalytic activity of USP36. (3) Recombinant USP36 but not a catalytically deficient mutant can cleave FUBI-eS30 in vitro. Together, these results support the direct involvement of USP36 in cellular FUBI-eS30 cleavage.</p><p>The observation that 40S subunits carrying uncleaved FUBI are impaired in entering the pool of elongating ribosomes would predict that loss of USP36 affects 40S biogenesis, translation, and thereby cell proliferation and survival. Indeed, genetic ablation of mouse <italic>Usp36</italic> is lethal, and embryos die at the preimplantation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fraile et al., 2018</xref>). Whether this is due to a ribosome biogenesis defect or has other reasons is currently unclear. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that depletion of USP36 causes mild defects in pre-rRNA processing and reduced protein translation, explained by an effect of USP36 on the SUMOylation status of components of nucleolar snoRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryu et al., 2021</xref>). In light of our data, the observed deficiencies in pre-rRNA processing and protein translation could of course also be rationalized by deficient FUBI processing. Clearly, it will be interesting to investigate in the future if there is a link between FUBI processing and changes in snoRNP metabolism. It should be noted though that in our hands, downregulation of USP36 turned out to be insufficient to cause obvious defects in the recycling of RBFs, unlike the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 reporter constructs. However, the level of endogenous uncleaved FUBI-eS30 upon USP36 depletion is much lower than that of the expressed non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that USP36 depletion did not result in sufficient levels of uncleaved FUBI-eS30 to trigger a dominant-negative effect. Of course, it is also possible that there are other proteases working redundantly with USP36 on FUBI-eS30 processing.</p><p>While processing of the ubiquitin fusion proteins has been postulated to occur during their translation or rapidly thereafter in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmair et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>), newly synthesized FUBI-eS30 must translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus for cleavage by USP36, which is localized in nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Endo et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urbé et al., 2012</xref>). In support of this view, we readily detected uncleaved FUBI-eS30 in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that FUBI-eS30 persists in its unprocessed form after translation. In agreement with a nucle(ol)ar site of eS30 integration, it accumulated in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli upon inhibition of nuclear steps of 40S subunit synthesis. During the intracellular transport of eS30, the folded FUBI moiety may serve as in cis chaperone, limiting aggregation of its unstructured and positively charged fusion partner eS30, akin to the suggested role of ubiquitin for Ub-RP fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lacombe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martín-Villanueva et al., 2019</xref>). A ULP confined to the nucleolus such as USP36 seems perfectly suited to prevent premature FUBI-eS30 processing, although the existence of redundant FUBI-specific ULPs in other cellular compartments cannot be excluded at this point.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>USP36 – a multifunctional enzyme</title><p>The in vitro processing assays revealed that USP36 can cleave both FUBI and ubiquitin fusion proteins. Cross-reactivity of DUBs in vitro has been reported before, for instance for human UCHL3 and USP21, which not only act on ubiquitin but also on the UBLs NEDD8 and ISG15, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Larsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ye et al., 2011</xref>). Recombinant USP36 was active toward both Ub-EGFP and FUBI-EGFP, which is consistent with the observation that USP36 can act as a DUB on a variety of substrates (see below). USP36 was also active towards the FUBI-eS30 fusion protein, albeit less potently. We assume that this is due to the unfolded nature of the positively charged eS30 as compared to the compact fold of the larger EGFP. Based on this reasoning, it is conceivable that cleavage of FUBI-eS30 by USP36 might be stimulated once the fusion protein is incorporated into nascent ribosomal subunits. In such a setting, the nascent 40S subunit would contribute to specificity of USP36 towards FUBI-eS30.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that USP36 deubiquitylates and thereby prevents proteasomal degradation of several nucleolar factors modified with K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, such as Myc, FBL, NPM, or DHX33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Endo et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fraile et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Together with our cell-based assays on FUBI-eS30 processing, these data indicate that USP36 may indeed be a bispecific enzyme in vivo. As for other DUBs, a key question is how USP36 is targeted to its different substrates. The activity of DUBs towards specific substrates can be regulated by binding partners that present the ubiquitinated substrate to the enzyme, most prominently by interacting WD40 repeat (WDR)-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mevissen and Komander, 2017</xref>). A DUB interactome study has identified the nucleolar proteins and potential small subunit processome components WDR3 (UTP12) and WDR36 (UTP21) as high-confidence candidate interactors of USP36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). It remains to be seen whether they or other pre-40S-associated factors direct FUBI-eS30 processing, perhaps by guiding USP36 to FUBI-eS30 after its incorporation into an early 40S precursor.</p><p>Last but not least, it remains to be seen whether there is a function of FUBI as a ubiquitin-like factor once it is released from eS30 by USP36. If FUBI were indeed conjugated to protein partners in the many different cell types it is constantly generated in, then FUBI conjugation may well exploit the regular ubiquitin-directed machinery, in analogy to the use of the DUB USP36 for its deconjugation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A list of materials is provided in Appendix key resources table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>The coding sequences of FUBI-eS30 and ubiquitin were amplified from HeLa cDNA.

This is an important advance because correct processing of FAU is crucial for biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit. Knowing the identity of the processing enzyme now opens this step in ribosome biogenesis to molecular and mechanistic analysis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Processing of the Ribosomal Ubiquitin-Like Fusion Protein FUBI-eS30/FAU is Required for 40S Maturation and Depends on USP36&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor.

All three reviewers agreed that this was important work that adds to our understanding of ribosome biogenesis. Two of the reviewers thought that some of the specific conclusions need clarification. Most of these comments can be addressed by changing the text and/or tempering certain statements. We've included the individual reviews below. Addressing some of the individual points with experiments will likely strengthen the paper but are not necessary for acceptance of the revised manuscript.

To support USP36's role in FUBI-eS30 cleavage, ribosome biogenesis assays can be performed upon USP36 depletion. For example, polysome profiling, pre-rRNA processing Northern blots, and/or immunofluorescence (as in Figure 3) of RBFs can be performed to observe if USP36 depletion leads to similar defects as expression of the uncleavable FUBI-eS30 constructs.

At the very least, this caveat should be mentioned/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our combined proteomics and cell biological analyses demonstrates that presence of the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants causes very specific and persistent late phenotypes in 40S subunit biogenesis, accompanied by a failure in the release of a set of a very specific subset of RBFs from pre-ribosomal particles in the cytoplasm (Figure 4). Based on the presented experiments, we see no reason to assume that free non-cleavable FUBI-eS30, i.e. the fraction of mutant FUBI-eS30 that is not part of pre-40S particles, could serve as a ‘sink’ for late-acting RBFs, thereby indirectly causing the observed defects in 40S subunit maturation. For instance, in support of our conclusions, biochemical analysis of the sedimentation behaviour of the endonuclease NOB1, a late-acting RBF affected by the FUBI-eS30 mutants, demonstrates that this enzyme is further enriched on pre-40S particles upon expression of the non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants, rather than titrated away into the top fractions of the gradient where unincorporated FUBI-eS30 mutants migrate (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). We have now added a quantification of NOB1’s sedimentation behaviour as part of Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Similarly, although not systematically tested, we have not observed changes in the sedimentation behaviour of RIOK2, RIOK1 or PNO1 to the upper gradient fractions upon expression of non-cleavable FUBI-eS30. Importantly, we also note that in the chase experiments presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2, there isn’t any visible free pool of mutant FUBI-eS30 after the chase period (Panel C); yet the cytoplasmic 40S subunit biogenesis defect remains very penetrant (Panel B). Furthermore, early maturation steps, which involve the vast majority of RBFs, remain by-and-large unaffected, as is 60S biogenesis, also arguing against pleiotropic unspecific effects of the expressed constructs. Thus, in light of the observed RBF recycling defects, biochemical data, and structural considerations regarding the expected position of uncleaved FUBI-eS30 on the 40S subunit, our interpretation that non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 mutants induce the accumulation of pre-40S particles that act as a specific ‘sink’ for the associated RBFs seems consistent with the data.</p><p>Still, to address the concern of the reviewer and as we have not formally excluded such scenario for all late-acting RBFs, we have added a sentence to the respective section on p. 11, to read:</p><p>‘Although we consider it unlikely, we cannot formally exclude that unincorporated, uncleaved FUBIeS30 could serve as an unspecific ‘sink’ for one or some of the affected RBFs. However, at least NOB1 does not change its sedimentation behaviour towards the pool of free protein in sucrose gradient analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and D), consistent with our conclusion.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figures 3 and 4, imaging data is used to infer differences in ribosome biogenesis and/or association of certain factors with the pre-40S.

Furthermore, we now support our conclusion of eS30 incorporation into nuclear pre-40S subunits by biochemical data (new panel B in Figure 3).</p><p>Moreover, we have more carefully phrased the respective conclusions, to read:</p><p>p.9: ‘Collectively, the nucle(ol)ar accumulation of FUBI(WT)-eS30-StHA upon induction of nuclear 40S maturation and export defects <italic>suggests</italic> that eS30 assembles into nuclear pre-40S ribosomes, likely already in the nucleolus.’</p><p>p.10: ‘In summary, the comprehensive examination of the (re)localization of various RBFs <italic>suggests</italic> that FUBI-eS30 cleavage is a prerequisite for recycling of the RBFs RIOK2, PNO1, NOB1, and RIOK1 in final steps of cytoplasmic 40S maturation.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 7 and associated text: The authors make statements regarding the kinetics of the reaction; however, they do not quantify these results.

Since we are aware that the exact ratio between both forms largely depends on how efficient USP36 depletion is in different cellular backgrounds, we have rephrased the respective sentence in the discussion, to read:</p><p>‘However, the level of endogenous uncleaved FUBI-eS30 upon USP36 depletion <italic>is much lower than</italic> that of the expressed non-cleavable FUBI-eS30 constructs (Figure 6D), indicating that USP36 depletion did not result in sufficient levels of uncleaved FUBI-eS30 to trigger a dominant-negative effect.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Ribosome biogenesis assays should be performed to test whether disruption of USP36 results in similar defects as expression of the uncleavable FUBI-eS30 constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>As already mentioned in the discussion of our manuscript, we had performed such experiments, not observing effects on the steady state localization of select RBFs upon USP36 depletion. We explain this result by the insufficient accumulation of endogenous FUBI-eS30 upon deletion of USP36, either because depletion of the enzyme is too inefficient or/and because there are redundant DUBs, as stated in the discussion and now shown in the new Figure 6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Over-expression of the uncleavable form of FUBI-eS30 results in several dominant negative phenotypes.

Based on the observed ribosome biogenesis defects, we think that it is reasonable to assume that prolonged expression of the non-cleavable constructs may negatively affect cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1C is a bit unconvincing.

At this early time point, one would not yet expect a substantial effect on the levels of the endogenous proteins, as pre-existing subunits are stable, and we have thus not quantified the data.

We have now also added the second citation to our previous work.
