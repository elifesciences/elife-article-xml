calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and γ- aminobutyric acid (GABA). Several other neuropeptides and neurotransmitters have been detected in various species, but the number, targets, functions, and conservation of PNEC signals are largely unknown. We used scRNAseq to profile hundreds of the rare mouse and human PNECs. This revealed over 40 PNEC neuropeptide and peptide hormone genes, most cells expressing unique combinations of 5–18 genes. Peptides are packaged in separate vesicles, their release presumably regulated by the distinct, multimodal combinations of sensors we show are expressed by each PNEC. Expression of the peptide receptors predicts an array of local cell targets, and we show the new PNEC signal angiotensin directly activates one subtype of innervating sensory neuron. Many signals lack lung targets so may have endocrine activity like those of PNEC-derived carcinoid tumors. PNECs are an extraordinarily rich and diverse signaling hub rivaling the enteroendocrine system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pulmonary neuroendocrine cell</kwd><kwd>pulmonary carcinoid</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08HL129081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>Christin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000862</institution-id><institution>Doris Duke Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>Christin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krasnow</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01CA231851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuo</surname><given-names>Christin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krasnow</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and systematic analysis of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells identifies over 40 hormones and neuropeptides expressed in myriad combinations, and predicts their targets in mouse and human lung, revealing extraordinary sensory and signaling diversity and potential physiological functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are neuroepithelial cells scattered throughout the epithelium lining the airways, many as solitary cells and others in clusters of ~30 cells (called neuroepithelial bodies or NEBs) at airway branchpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Scheuermann, 1997</xref>). PNECs are thought to monitor airway oxygen and respiratory status, and rapidly signal this internal sensory information via afferent sensory neurons to the brain to regulate breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Garg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nonomura et al., 2017</xref>).

The lung expression patterns of these receptors are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, identifying dozens of lung cell types that can directly receive PNEC peptidergic signals. Indeed, every lung cell type expressed a receptor for at least one PNEC peptidergic signal, and most expressed receptors for multiple signals. This suggests that PNECs can function as a signaling hub broadcasting airway sensory information to cells throughout the lung. The richest targets by far were the innervating pulmonary sensory neurons PSN4 and PSN7, which expressed receptors for 17 and 19 PNEC peptidergic signals, respectively. Other rich targets included goblet cells (4 signals) and club cells (3 signals). PNECs themselves expressed IGF receptors, implying autocrine signaling. The results also suggest a broad neuroendocrine-immune signaling axis, with CGRP potentially targeting at least five different types of immune cells (monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells, and alveolar and interstitial macrophages) plus airway smooth muscle and goblet cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and other signals targeting NK cells, B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells (PCSK1N), basophils and neutrophils (IGFs), and dendritic cells (adrenomedullin).</p><p>We experimentally validated one of the inferred signaling interactions—the predicted angiotensin signal from PNECs to pulmonary sensory neurons. Angiotensin is among the most medically important hormones because of its key role in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and because one of its processing enzymes (angiotensin converting enzyme 2, ACE2) also serves as the entry receptor for SARS and Covid-19 coronaviruses. Indeed, the lung plays an essential role in this hormone pathway by providing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), the target of a ubiquitous class of anti-hypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors), that proteolytically processes circulating angiotensin I peptide (Agt I) into the potent vasoconstrictor Agt II. Our discovery that PNECs express angiotensinogen (<italic>Agt</italic>), the preprohormone for Agt II, reveals a pulmonary source of the hormone, and our molecular cell atlas points to three potential lung targets: pericytes, and the PSN4 and PSN7 pulmonary sensory neurons that innervate NEBs, each of which selectively expressed Agt II receptor gene <italic>Agtr1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed <italic>Agt</italic> expression in PNECs by smFISH, which showed expressing cells localized within NEBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also confirmed expression of its receptor <italic>Agtr1a</italic> in NEB-innervating sensory neurons by injecting <italic>Agtr1a<sup>2A-Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Leib et al., 2017</xref>) with a Cre-responsive reporter virus (AAV-<italic>flex-tdTomato</italic>) in the vagal nodose ganglion where cell bodies of pulmonary sensory neurons reside, and found their tdTomato-labeled termini ramifying on NEBs at airway branchpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). (PNECs within NEBs are the only lung cells known to directly contact <italic>Agtr1a</italic>-expressing pulmonary sensory neuron termini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). To determine if angiotensin can activate pulmonary sensory neurons, we labeled pulmonary sensory neurons by introducing a fluorescently-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-A647) into the lung, and allowing 4–5 days for label uptake at sensory neuron termini and retrograde transport to their cell bodies in the vagal ganglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We then isolated and cultured vagal ganglion cells and visualized their neuronal activity by Fluo-4 calcium imaging during perfusion of Agt II into the imaging chamber. Agt II activated 1–15% of cultured pulmonary sensory neurons, as well as rare sensory neurons from other organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We identified responding pulmonary sensory neurons as the PSN4 subtype: they expressed <italic>Agtr1a <sup>2A-Cre</sup></italic> lineage-label and stained positive for PSN4-specific marker neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (TRKA). PSN7 (<italic>Calb1+</italic>) neurons, which are larger but express <italic>Agtr1a</italic> at lower levels and do not express <italic>Ntrk1</italic>(TrkA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), were not activated under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The lower levels of <italic>Agtr1a</italic> expression may explain the selective activation of PSN4 neurons, although other explanations are possible including that PSN7 neurons are less healthy under our assay conditions. The results suggest that in addition to its classical role as a circulating vasopressor, Agt II can function as a local neuromodulator from PNECs directly to PSN4 sensory neurons, transmitting airway sensory information to the brain.</p><p>For one-third (36%) of the PNEC peptidergic signals (calcitonin/<italic>Calca</italic>, amylin/<italic>Iapp</italic>, ACTH/<italic>Pomc</italic>, neuropeptide W/<italic>Npw</italic>, galanin/<italic>Gal</italic>, urotensin 2/<italic>Uts2</italic>, gonadotropin-releasing hormone/<italic>Gnrh1</italic>, hypocretin/<italic>Hcrt</italic>, ghrelin/<italic>Grhl, oxytocin/Oxt, prokinectin 2/Prok2, leutinizing hormone, subunit B/Lhb,thrombopoietin/Thpo</italic>), we did not detect appreciable expression of their receptors in any lung cell type or PSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All of these classically function as circulating hormones with targets throughout the body, such as calcitonin (bones, kidneys), ACTH (adrenal cortex, adipocytes), amylin (brain stem), and inhibin (pituitary), so PNECs too may secrete these hormones into circulation. However, we cannot exclude that some have local targets but their receptors were expressed below detection or in rare or fragile cells not captured in our lung cell atlas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PNECs are diverse, multimodal sensors</title><p>Classical physiological studies of PNECs indicate that signal secretion is triggered by a variety of stimuli including hypoxia, hypercapnia, mechanical stimuli, and allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lembrechts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Livermore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Youngson et al., 1993</xref>).

And, because this tumor’s unusual expression profile nearly matched that of a rare normal PNEC (#50, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>), which like the tumor cells expressed <italic>NPW, NMB, CARTPT, KCNK3,</italic> and <italic>OPN1SW</italic> and lacked expression of common PNEC genes <italic>CALCA, GRP,</italic> and <italic>PIEZO2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), we suggest that this carcinoid arose by transformation of a cell similar to PNEC #50. Tumor cell expression of <italic>NPW</italic> may have caused the patient’s hypertension because the active peptide (NPW-23) is a circulating hormone that regulates vascular tone and has been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To determine the peptidergic signaling profiles of other lung carcinoids, we analyzed peptidergic gene expression in 111 human lung carcinoids profiled by bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcala et al., 2019</xref>). This revealed prominent expression of 70% (28 of 40) of the normal human PNEC peptidergic genes, including new genes we identified in rare subpopulations of normal PNECs, in at least some of the tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). Ten peptidergic genes expressed by lung carcinoids, including four previously detected in clinical samples (GHRH, PENK, TAC1, VIP), were not found in our normal PNECs; however, all of these were expressed in only rare carcinoids so may be expressed in rare PNECs and if so should be identified on further PNEC profiling. Interestingly, some of the peptidergic genes expressed in only minor subpopulations of normal PNECs (e.g. <italic>NPW, NPPA, SST, CARTPT</italic>) were detected in many carcinoids, whereas the nearly ubiquitous PNEC peptidergic gene <italic>CALCA</italic> was absent from most carcinoids. This suggests that not all normal PNECs are equally susceptible to carcinoid transformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By single-cell expression profiling of hundreds of the exceedingly rare PNECs in mouse and human, we discovered they express over 40 peptidergic genes, nearly half of all such genes including many classic hormones. Individual PNECs express up to 18 peptidergic genes, with almost every cell expressing a distinct combination. The diversity of expressed signals is further increased by alternative splicing, and by post-translational processing as inferred from expression of prohormone processing genes. These diverse signals can directly target a wide array of cell types in the lung, predicted by expression of the cognate receptors, including almost every cell type across all five tissue compartments: epithelial (including putative autocrine PNEC signals), endothelial, stromal, immune, and neural. The richest targets are pulmonary sensory neurons (PSNs) that innervate PNECs. We confirmed one predicted signal to PSNs, angiotensin (Agt II, mature product of <italic>Agt</italic>), can directly activate a recently identified PSN subtype (PSN4) that innervates PNECs, expresses its receptor (<italic>Agtr1a</italic>), and projects to the brainstem to regulate respiratory rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; Diaz de Arce, et al., unpublished data. Hence in addition to its classical role as a circulating vasopressor whose receptor is targeted by major anti-hypertensive drugs, Agt II may serve as a neuromodulator in the breathing circuit. Eighteen other PNEC signals are also classical hormones, but unlike Agt II their receptors are not expressed in any cell types in the lung cell atlases, suggesting that PNECs could contribute to the circulating pool of these hormones. PNECs are thus extraordinarily rich and diverse signaling hubs that produce scores of neuropeptides and peptide hormones that can signal directly to many cells in the lung, to the brain through pulmonary sensory neurons, and potentially to cells throughout the body through the circulation.</p><p>PNECs are scattered throughout the airway epithelium and form large clusters at bronchial branchpoints, so they are ideally positioned to serve as sentinels that monitor inhaled air and airway status. Our single-cell data imply that each PNEC is in fact a multimodal sensor, expressing a distinct combination of mechanical, thermal, and acid sensors along with carbonic anhydrases important in CO<sub>2</sub> sensing, diverse chemosensors including olfactory receptors, vomeronasal receptors and taste receptors, and even light-sensing opsins. Different combinations of sensors are co-expressed in individual PNECs along with different combinations of signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). Because the peptidergic signals are packaged in separate vesicles, secretion of each signal could be independently regulated, presumably in response to activation of a different sensor (or sensor combination). In this way PNECs can simultaneously monitor many aspects of airway status at many positions along the airway, and selectively transmit this information to target cells in the lung, the brain, and the rest of the body.</p><p>In many ways PNECs resemble enteroendocrine cells (EECs), the sentinels scattered along the gut epithelium to monitor nutrients, microbial products, and other luminal contents and signal that information locally in the gut to coordinate ingestion, absorption, metabolism, and disposal, and throughout the body and brain to regulate mood and appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellono et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaelberer et al., 2018</xref>). The enteroendocrine system is commonly called the ‘gut-brain axis’ and is considered the largest endocrine organ because of its many endocrine cells and signals. Our data suggest it may be rivaled or even surpassed by the pulmonary neuroendocrine system, which expresses more than double the ~20 signals produced by EECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beumer et al., 2020</xref>). Each EEC apparently expresses only one or a few peptidergic signals and neurotransmitters, which define 12 classical EEC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Worthington et al., 2018</xref>), whereas individual PNECs express 5–10 times more and their expression patterns define at least an order of magnitude more molecular subtypes. While PNECs have long been speculated to serve as local signaling centers in the lung and fast conduits of sensory information to the brain through afferent sensory neurons, our data suggest that like EECs they also serve a more global endocrine function. This would explain why the basal surface of some PNECs, where secretory vesicles are densely packed, are apposed to fenestrated capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lauweryns et al., 1973</xref>). Although PNEC contribution to circulating hormone pools under normal physiological conditions is yet to be demonstrated, they contribute at least under pathological conditions. Indeed, we found that the extensive PNEC signaling repertoire described here including most of newly identified peptidergic genes, were collectively expressed in the 111 available cases of profiled human lung carcinoids. An individual human carcinoid, however, expresses a discrete set of signals resembling that of a normal PNEC, suggesting that each such tumor amplifies the set of signals expressed by the tumor-initiating PNEC, thereby explaining the diversity of carcinoid syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Limper et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pernow and Waldenström, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shalet et al., 1979</xref>). PNECs may comprise a second global signaling axis we dub ‘the lung-brain axis’.</p><p>This new understanding of PNEC function and their extraordinary diversity, including many sensor and signaling genes detected in only a single profiled cell, required pre-enrichment (mouse) or massive profiling (human) to obtain just the first few hundred expression profiles of these exceedingly rare cells. The neuroendocrinology of the lung our study reveals has broad implications for medicine even beyond NE cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rudin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Travis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Young et al., 2011</xref>), including the many other pulmonary diseases such as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sui et al., 2018</xref>), SIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mou et al., 2021</xref>), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gillan and Cutz, 1993</xref>) that have been associated with PNEC abnormalities and perhaps now extending to diseases outside the lung. The results already have implications for the Covid-19 pandemic because SARS-CoV-2 virions use an angiotensin pathway regulator (ACE2) to enter and destroy lung cells and cripple gas exchange along with the ability of the patient to sense the deficit. Although expression of angiotensinogen and many other PNEC sensory and signaling genes are conserved so their functions can be explored in mice, we also uncovered 13 human-specific PNEC signaling genes encoding classical hormones (e.g. ACTH (<italic>POMC</italic>), GRP, TRH, AMH, CCK). Hence the lung-brain axis may be especially prominent in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Three to five days prior to PSN isolation, 50 µl (1 mg/mL) of a fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-647, Thermo Fisher, W32466) was instilled into the trachea to retrograde label PSNs. After 3–5 days to allow for WGA uptake by PSNs and retrograde transport to their cell bodies in the tenth (vagus) cranial nerve ganglia, mice were euthanized as above and the vagal ganglia were dissected and immediately placed in cold-buffered Hanks Balanced Salt Solution without calcium or magnesium (HBSS, ThermoFisher, 14190144). Ganglia were digested with 60 U papain (Worthington Biochemical, LS003126) in 1 ml HBSS (with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.4 mg/mL L-cysteine) for 10 min at 37 °C.

Tips were pre-coated with complete L-15 medium with 10% FBS (Gemini Bio Products, 100–50, diluted in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) to limit neuronal loss. The cell suspension was gently layered on 5 ml of 20% Percoll (Sigma, P4937) in L-15 medium (Gibco, 11415) and centrifuged for 9 min at 400xg to separate dissociated neurons from lower density connective tissue and smaller cells.

Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 60–90 min to initiate cell adherence to the inset; although only some neurons adhere during this period, incubations beyond 2 hr caused evaporation of the small volume of medium and decreased neuron viability.

Calcium imaging data (Fluo-4 flourescence) were collected every second with 488nm wavelength excitation and 500–550nm emission. After baseline recording for 60s, 500nM Angiotensin II peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, A9525) in HBSS with 10mM HEPES (pH 7.4) was perfused for 60s, followed by a wash and re-equilibration with HBSS buffered with 10mM HEPES (pH 7.4) for 3min, and finally a 15-s infusion of 50mM KCl in HBSS buffered with 10mM HEPES (pH 7.4) to assess cell excitability/viability. Following the infusions, the dish was removed from the perfusion chamber and cells immediately fixed with 4% PFA at 4°C for 30–60min for subsequent immunohistochemistry as above to confirm identity of the monitored neurons. For analysis of the time-lapse recordings, Image J software (v2.0) was used to define cell boundaries and determine the mean fluorescence intensity value for each cell in the imaging field at each time point; the obtained fluorescence values were normalized to the average baseline fluorescence value (prior to Angiotensin II exposure) for the cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Computational clustering and identification of mouse PNEC scRNA-seq profiles</title><p>Counts for each gene were normalized across cells, scaled per million and converted to logarithmic scale.

Only the incidence (presence or absence), and not the abundance, of each peptidergic gene RNA was used to estimate the underlying neuropeptide accumulation curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">García-Ortega and Martínez, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Conceived the project</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Sorted cells and prepared sequencing libraries, Processed and aligned sequencing data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Designed and performed pulmonary sensory neuron functional imaging experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Provided scRNA-seq receptor gene expression profiles and analysis of pulmonary sensory neurons</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing, Performed rarefaction analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Patient tissues were obtained under protocol and de-identified.

in mouse and human PNECs by single-cell RNA sequencing. Analyses revealed a myriad combination of neuropeptide, neurotransmitter, receptor and channel genes in PNECs. The authors also surveyed cognate receptors expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and pulmonary sensory neurons, identifying potential local targets for the PNECs signals. They showed one new signal, angiotensin II, directly activates a subpopulation of innervating pulmonary sensory neurons that project to the brain. The scRNA-seq profile of a lung carcinoid tumor suggests that selected PNECs are susceptible to carcinoid transformation and together, these data indicate that PNECs serve as sentinels to perceive multiple airway stimuli and express a variety of signals that either act locally, through pulmonary sensory neurons, or potentially through circulation to regulate homeostasis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78216.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Paul W</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pammg90</institution-id><institution>Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.08.483399">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.08.483399v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Paul Noble as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Shen (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers acknowledged the merit of the study from this outstanding group, but suggest additional clarification and function studies be performed. Please review the public reviewer comments when revising the manuscript and incorporate the salient points. This study catalogs the transcriptomic diversity of PNECs. Agt action on PSN neurons was included as a functional test. Additional functional experiments will enhance the impact of the study and warrant publication in this journal:</p><p>1. A rigorous definition of neuroendocrine cells should be stated clearly and applied consistently across all datasets. If cells are likely to be neuroendocrine but do not meet the complete definition (e.g., ZsGreen+ EpCAM- cells), then it might be helpful to indicate them in the figure(s) and explain how they do or do not differ in their properties from the rigorously-defined subset of PNECs.</p><p>2. The presentation of sensitivity and specificity of PNEC gene expression would benefit from a different graphical format. For example, some type of two-dimensional plots might illustrate these points about peptidergic gene expression more clearly.</p><p>3. Greater clarity on the number of samples examined and the addition of statistical analyses would be very helpful to include.</p><p>4. Pointing out which genes are expressed in PNECs but not in TNECs will be informative.</p><p>5. The statement that most peptidergic genes are &quot;expressed in rare PNEC subpopulations&quot; needs to be based on smFISH data, and not just scRNA-seq data given the drop-off effects. The lack of reads in the expected potassium channels also warrants further investigation by smFISH.</p><p>6. Neuropeptides are typically enriched in vesicles on the basal side of PNECs, and this is reflected in most of the staining results. However, in Figure 3C, this does not appear to be the case, which warrants re-investigation.</p><p>7. In Figure 4F, neuronal traces in the lower panel have 3 different colors (grey, dark grey, and black), what are the numbers of cells in each group? And what may explain why Agtr1a+ PSN7 neurons were not activated after Agt II application? Are these neurons activated at higher concentrations?</p><p>8. Agt is expressed by other cell types in the lung. Do Agtr1a+ neurons only target PNECs? What is the evidence that PNECs are the source of Agt that activates Agtra1 neurons?</p><p>9. Are there expression pattern differences between solitary and clustered PNECs in either mouse or human?</p><p>10. Is there any information in the single cell data that would explain the cause for rare PNEC types being amplified in the carcinoid?</p><p>11. Description of signature and staining localization of glial cells will be informative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should consider revising the title to give it encompass the overall conclusion and the context.</p><p>In the Abstract section:</p><p>It would be better to write the expanded form of the abbreviation at the first place throughout the text, for example, CGRP and GABA in the second line of the abstract.</p><p>The authors' statement &quot;release presumably regulated by the distinct, multimodal combinations of sensors expressed&quot; needs to have specificity with examples. What sort of sensors?</p><p>The authors' statement &quot;Expression of cognate receptors&quot; should include specific examples.</p><p>In the Introduction section:</p><p>Line 5: related functions should include a few specific examples.</p><p>Line 8-9: &quot;..several neuropeptides including CGRP, which can signal locally to lung goblet (GABA) and immune cells (CGRP)..&quot; the abbreviation CGRP should be expanded at its first appearance. Also, the sentence should be re-phrased to explain the context of GABA and CGRP shown in brackets.</p><p>Line 12: In the sentence, &quot;they can be transformed by loss of tumor suppressor genes&quot;, please mention a few examples of the tumor suppressor genes.</p><p>In the Results section:</p><p>Section 2: The sentence &quot;PNECs express dozens of neuropeptide and peptide hormone genes&quot; does not seem to be scientifically sound. Authors should consider revising it to infer a concise sub-heading for this part.</p><p>Section 2: In the sentence &quot;suggesting they can signal through serotonin imported from other sources.&quot;, the other source should be defined with precise citation, or is it just the authors' assumption?</p><p>Section 2: Along with the names of genes, authors should consider citing the references vouching for neurotransmitters' type-specific genes in the sentence &quot;PNECs may also use other neurotransmitters because rare cells expressed key dopaminergic (Th, Ddc), glutamatergic (Slc17a6), cholinergic (Slc18a3/VAChT), or histaminergic (Hdc) genes (Table S3).&quot;.</p><p>(A general comment/suggestion due to redundant appearance) The appearance of the phrase &quot;dozens of genes&quot; should be avoided throughout the text. Alternatively, authors can consider being specific about the numbers in their dataset.</p><p>Authors are recommended to cite specific references for 17 PNEC peptidergic genes; based on what these genes have been selected?</p><p>In the sentence &quot;over an order of magnitude more than previously known&quot;, authors are recommended to include the previously known percentage or the number of peptidergic genes precisely.</p><p>The Results sections 2 and 3 are overlapping. Authors should consider distinguishing the context.</p><p>The authors should consider either combining them or segregating the talk about the peptidergic genes from the part of neuropeptide and peptide hormone genes.</p><p>In section 4, the sentence &quot;PNECs are diverse&quot; should have specificity about the type. Depending on what, the PNECs are diverse. To me, the results seem to be direct towards the PNEC diversity in the context of their functions. Authors should consider editing the sub-heading to depict a more specific context.</p><p>In section 5, again there are too many overlaps and redundancy of the information with sections 2 and 3. Authors should consider to re-arrange the result parts to give a concise and meaningful context.</p><p>In section 6, the sentence &quot;The human lung cell expression patterns of receptors for the 32 PNEC peptidergic signals with known receptors are shown in Figure S10A, identifying potential direct targets in lung.&quot; What are the direct targets the authors are referring to?</p><p>In section 6, the sentence &quot;The predicted targets of the conserved PNEC signals were also largely conserved, for example, broad stromal and vascular targeting by inhibin, immune cell targeting by CGRP and VGF, and pericyte targeting by angiotensin.&quot;, the claim should also be supported with references.</p><p>In section 7, the sentence &quot;However, they did not recapitulate the full spectrum of PNEC diversity in their sensory and signaling gene profiles.&quot; Authors should consider explaining it briefly with specific citations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript would be considerably strengthened by the following:</p><p>1.

The confusion here arises from the two previously known markers (<italic>Ascl1</italic> lineage marker ZsGreen, EpCAM) we used for flow sorting to enrich for these rare cells for transcriptomic profiling (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Although most of the cells with PNEC transcriptomic profiles were from the ZsGreen<sup>hi</sup> EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> sorted population (as expected), some were from the ZsGreen<sup>hi</sup> EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> sorted population. The latter resulted from the EpCAM gating threshold we used during flow sorting, which excluded some PNECs with intermediate levels of surface EpCAM from the EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> population. Indeed, nearly all PNECs (&gt; 95%) expressed <italic>Epcam</italic> by scRNAseq, and there was no difference in <italic>Epcam</italic> transcript levels or transcriptomic clustering of PNECs that were obtained from the ZsGreen<sup>hi</sup> EpCAM<sup>hi</sup> vs. ZsGreen<sup>hi</sup> EpCAM<sup>lo</sup> sorted populations, as we now show in the two panels (C', C'') added to Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. This point is now clarified in the legend to Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, and it nicely demonstrates that transcriptomic profiling is a more robust method of identifying PNECs than flow sorting based on two classical markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The presentation of sensitivity and specificity of PNEC gene expression would benefit from a different graphical format. For example, some type of two-dimensional plots might illustrate these points about peptidergic gene expression more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we added a two-dimensional plot showing sensitivity and specificity of PNEC markers (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Because different marker features are important for different applications, to aid in selection of optimal markers we have provided several different graphical formats (Figures 1B,C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) and a table (Supplementary file 1) for comparing markers. This point is discussed further below in the response to point 3 of Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Pointing out which genes are expressed in PNECs but not in TNECs will be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we noted tracheal neuroendocrine cells (TNEC) markers (from the mouse tracheal cell transcriptomic atlas by Montoro et al., Nature 2018) that were not expressed in our profiled mouse PNECs. The converse (PNEC markers not detected in TNECs) are also of interest but more problematic to identify from the available data because the droplet-based scRNA-seq method used for profiling TNECs (in Montoro et al) is subject to greater technical dropout (no detection of mRNA from an expressed gene) than the plate-based profiling method we used for PNECs. Nevertheless, as detailed below in the response to point 1 of Reviewer 3, using stringent criteria that take dropout into account we were able to identify several genes (<italic>Igf2, Piezo2, Ptprn, Meg3</italic>) that are likely PNEC-selective markers. We have added this analysis to the paper (p. 5, Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, Supplementary file 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The statement that most peptidergic genes are &quot;expressed in rare PNEC subpopulations&quot; needs to be based on smFISH data, and not just scRNA-seq data given the drop-off effects. The lack of reads in the expected potassium channels also warrants further investigation by smFISH.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that technical drop-out is a consideration here as for any scRNA-seq dataset, and we addressed this issue in two ways. First, we analyzed a second PNEC scRNAseq dataset (Ouadah et al., 2019) in which PNECs were labeled, isolated, and processed by different methods (including microfluidic capture) but deeply sequenced like ours, and obtained similar results across the full set of peptidergic genes (Figure 1E, Supplementary file 4). Second, we used state-of-the art multiplex single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to analyze the expression in PNECs of eight peptidergic genes, including ones expressed in most or all PNECs (2 genes), some PNECs (2 genes), or only rare PNECs (4 genes) in the scRNA-seq analysis. This confirmed the peptidergic gene abundance results from the scRNA-seq analysis (Figure 1G), including the finding that many of the newly identified PNEC peptidergic genes are expressed only in rare subpopulations of PNECs (and that the latter result is not an artifact of technical dropout in scRNA-seq). This experiment (Figure 1G) also showed that smFISH is more sensitive than our scRNA-seq analysis in detecting gene expression, but only if quantification includes cells with only a few (1 – 4) expression puncta (close to the background level). We agree that, ideally, expression of each of the 37 other newly identified PNEC peptidergic genes as well as PNEC potassium channel genes (and the dozens of other genes we identified of biological interest in our PNEC scRNA-seq analysis) should be validated by smFISH, but at current costs (~$1000/gene) it would be prohibitively expensive and take months to analyze and quantify because PNECs are extremely rare (and minor subpopulations proportionately rarer) so laborious to find and quantify in serial lung sections. We feel that our smFISH experiments validating the expression levels and quantifying the abundance of expressing cells for a representative subset of identified PNEC genes (eight peptidergic genes spanning the full range of abundance in PNECs and one new PNEC marker <italic>Resp18</italic>) is a reasonable number for this stage (and cost) of the technology.</p><p>Potassium channel genes are not the focus of this paper so were not prioritized for smFISH confirmation or follow up studies. In one of the Results sections (&quot;PNECs are diverse, multimodal sensors&quot;), we noted in the paragraph on PNEC hypoxia sensing that two potassium channel genes (<italic>Kcnc3, Kcnd4</italic>), which prior studies suggested might encode a PNEC hypoxia-sensitive potassium current (Youngson et al. 1993, Fu et al., 2002; reviewed in Garg et al., 2019), were expressed at a low level (<italic>Kcnc3</italic>) or in only rare (<italic>Kcnd4</italic>) mouse PNECs, whereas many other potassium channel genes were expressed more robustly and selectively in the PNECs (Figure 5—figure supplement 1BC &lt;Figure S6B&gt;). Prior studies (Wang et al. 1996; Cutz et al., 2009) assessed expression in PNECs (by conventional in situ hybridization or RT-PCR) of a few potassium channel genes (including <italic>Kcnc3</italic>, <italic>Kcnd4</italic>) and only in fetal or infant lungs from rabbit and human so are not directly comparable to our adult mouse PNEC data (Figure 5—figure supplement 1BC). Identifying the channel(s) that mediate the proposed PNEC hypoxia-sensitive potassium current will require substantial follow up on the expression and function of each PNEC potassium channel gene. To help prioritize genes for such studies, we added a similar analysis of potassium channel gene expression in adult human PNECs (Figure 6—figure supplement 5B). Although beyond the scope of this paper, future studies of the expressed genes should identify the physiologically relevant PNEC channels and any stage- and species-specific expression and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Neuropeptides are typically enriched in vesicles on the basal side of PNECs, and this is reflected in most of the staining results. However, in Figure 3C, this does not appear to be the case, which warrants re-investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3C is a super resolution confocal optical section through an immunostained PNEC cluster that was selected to show that CGRP and calcitonin are co-expressed in individual PNECs but localize to distinct secretory vesicles. This was easiest to visualize in the apical region of these PNECs, where individual puncta (vesicles) were most readily resolved. The original image in Figure 3C was an oblique section of a PNEC with an extreme morphology (substantial apical domain with a slender projection to the basement membrane). We have now replaced it with a section that captures the full apicobasal extent of two PNECs with more typical columnar epithelial structures, which shows both the sub-cellular distribution of the individual peptides as well as their largely distinct vesicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4F, neuronal traces in the lower panel have 3 different colors (grey, dark grey, and black), what are the numbers of cells in each group? And what may explain why Agtr1a+ PSN7 neurons were not activated after Agt II application? Are these neurons activated at higher concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify Figure 4F, we now show the calcium-imaging traces of the three overlaid examples of PSN4 neurons (red traces), other PSNs (black traces), and non-PSNs (grey traces) in separate parts of the panel (top, middle, and bottom of panel F, respectively); the individual traces are provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. The results for all 189 viable PSNs analyzed across the 11 experiments are summarized in the source data file. The only other <italic>Agtra1a+</italic> pulmonary sensory neuron type is PSN7, which express lower levels of <italic>Agtra1a</italic> receptor gene than the PSN4 neurons; this could explain the selective activation of PSN4 neurons by Agt II, as we now note in the text (p. 12). However, because the results with PSN7 neurons are negative (no response to Agt II, but viable and responsive to KCl control, see Figure 4—figure supplement 2) including a trial at twice the standard Agt II concentration, there could be other explanations (e.g., the isolated PSN7 neurons analyzed were not fully healthy), so we consider the PSN7 result provisional and note this caveat in the text (p. 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Agt is expressed by other cell types in the lung. Do Agtr1a+ neurons only target PNECs? What is the evidence that PNECs are the source of Agt that activates Agtra1 neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>Across the entire mouse lung cell atlas, the only cell types with prominent expression of angiotensinogen (<italic>Agt</italic>) are PNECs and myofibroblasts (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The only known lung cell target of <italic>Agtr1a</italic>-expressing pulmonary sensory neurons (PSN4, PSN7) are PNECs (p. 11), which directly contact <italic>Agtr1a</italic>-expressing pulmonary sensory neuron termini (Figure 4D), supporting our model that they provide the Agt ligand to the receptor-expressing PSN4. There are also occasional alveolar projections from PSN4 that do not appear to target a specific cell type (Diaz de Arce et al., in preparation), but it is possible that ligand secretion from alveolar myofibroblasts could also activate PSN4 through these alveolar termini, as we now note in the legend to Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Are there expression pattern differences between solitary and clustered PNECs in either mouse or human?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting question but we have not yet identified such differences, although we are actively searching. Nothing obvious emerged from the initial analysis of PNEC scRNA-seq profiles, which likely include profiles of both clustered and solitary PNECs since our PNEC isolation strategy labels and should recover both. Identification of such expression differences will require careful comparison of the expression patterns of PNECs in situ. We have begun analyzing in this way some of the PNEC genes expressed in PNEC subsets, but so far have not found any that distinguish solitary from clustered PNECs. Such distinguishing markers must be rare.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Is there any information in the single cell data that would explain the cause for rare PNEC types being amplified in the carcinoid?</p></disp-quote><p>No, there is nothing obvious. Indeed, that prompted our speculation that sporadic oncogenic mutations in various PNECs can transform them and cause their amplification into carcinoid tumors, with the amplified cells retaining a memory (albeit imperfect) of the transformed cell's peptidergic expression profile (p. 20). This would explain the diverse endocrine effects of pulmonary carcinoid tumors found in different patients, a consequence that follows from this model and the large and diverse peptidergic profiles we uncovered for PNECs (Figures 6D, Figure 6—figure supplement 6)<italic>.</italic> However, because some peptidergic genes that are expressed in only minor subpopulations of normal PNECs were detected in many carcinoids, whereas a nearly ubiquitous PNEC peptidergic gene (<italic>CALCA</italic>) was absent from most, it appears that not all normal PNECs are equally susceptible to carcinoid transformation (p. 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Description of signature and staining localization of glial cells will be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that profiles and localization of pulmonary glial cells are of general interest, however since they are unrelated to the topic of this manuscript (neuroendocrine cells) that information forms the foundation of a separate manuscript in preparation (from the lab of first author C.S.K.) devoted to these glial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should consider revising the title to give it encompass the overall conclusion and the context.</p></disp-quote><p>We felt it was important to emphasize in the title both the main approach we employed (scRNA-seq) and our major conclusions (extraordinary diversity of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, signals, and potential targets in and outside the lung), and the title we settled on was constrained by journal limitations to character count.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Abstract section:</p><p>It would be better to write the expanded form of the abbreviation at the first place throughout the text, for example, CGRP and GABA in the second line of the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>Expanded forms of abbreviations have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors' statement &quot;release presumably regulated by the distinct, multimodal combinations of sensors expressed&quot; needs to have specificity with examples.

Hence the combined total for the two datasets shows 43 (47%) of the 91 peptidergic genes in mice are expressed in PNECs (Figure 1E, Supplementary file 4). On p. 7, we explain that 43 is likely a lower limit. We also identify 40 expressed peptidergic genes in our human PNEC scRNA-seq dataset (p. 17), and the details and expression values for each of the 91 neuropeptide genes analyzed across the 3 scRNA-seq datasets analyzed in mouse and human PNECs are provided in Supplementary file 4. We feel the term ‘dozens’ is appropriate here because it succinctly conveys this value in the sub-heading, without being overly precise about a value that depends on the sensitivity of the technique at detecting expression and how complete the PNEC dataset is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Section 2: In the sentence &quot;suggesting they can signal through serotonin imported from other sources.&quot;, the other source should be defined with precise citation, or is it just the authors' assumption?</p></disp-quote><p>Our suggestion of serotonin import by PNECs is simply an inference based on the detected expression of the serotonin reuptake transporter gene <italic>Slc6a4</italic> (but not serotonin biosynthetic genes <italic>Tph1</italic> and <italic>Tph</italic>2), as described in the first part of the sentence.

The converse (PNEC markers not detected in TNECs) are also of interest but are more problematic to identify from the available data because the droplet-based scRNA-seq method used for profiling TNECs (in Montoto et al) is subject to greater technical dropout than the plate-based profiling method we used for PNECs. We analyzed the expression profiles for mouse tracheal cells isolated from wild-type mice Montoro et al. (‘GSE103354_Trachea_dropblet_UMIcounts.txt’ in GEO), selecting only the TNECs that clustered distinctly from the other tracheal epithelial cells (69 TNECs) and eliminating transitional cells. We then searched for expression in these TNECs of the most robustly-expressed PNEC marker genes in our dataset, and found one gene (<italic>Igf2</italic>) with no expression in TNECs and others (<italic>Piezo2, Ptprn, Meg3</italic>) with very low or sparse expression. We added these apparent PNEC-selective markers to the text (p. 5) and to Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and Supplementary file 1, however this designation remains provisional (due to the technical dropout rate of the method used for profiling TNECs) until it is confirmed by direct comparison of their expression in PNECs vs. TNECs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The statement that most peptidergic genes are &quot;expressed in rare PNEC subpopulations&quot; needs to be based on smFISH data, and not just scRNA-seq data given the drop-off effects.
