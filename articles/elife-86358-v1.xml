Therefore, in this mixed methods study we explored perceived pandemic-related practice changes to cervical cancer screenings in federally qualified health centers (FQHCs).</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Between October 2021 and June 2022, we conducted a national web survey of clinicians (physicians and advanced practice providers) who performed cervical cancer screening in FQHCs in the United States during the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a sub-set of qualitative interviews via video conference, to examine perceived changes in cervical cancer screening practices during the pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 148 clinicians completed surveys; a subset (n=13) completed qualitative interviews. Most (86%) reported reduced cervical cancer screening early in the pandemic, and 28% reported continued reduction in services at the time of survey completion (October 2021- July 2022). Nearly half (45%) reported staff shortages impacting their ability to screen or track patients. Compared to clinicians in Obstetrics/Gynecology/Women’s health, those in family medicine and other specialties more often reported reduced screening compared to pre-pandemic. Most (92%) felt that screening using HPV self-sampling would be very or somewhat helpful to address screening backlogs. Qualitative interviews highlighted the impacts of staff shortages and strategies for improvement.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Findings highlight that in late 2021 and early 2022, many clinicians in FQHCs reported reduced cervical cancer screening and of pandemic-related staffing shortages impacting screening and follow-up.

However, lack of access to screening and treatment services results in geographic, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buskwofie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akers et al., 2007</xref>). A recent study of cervical cancer patients showed that over half were either never screened or were overdue for screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benard et al., 2021</xref>). Lack of screening remains the most common reason why individuals develop cervical cancer in the United States (US) and worldwide. In the US, cervical cancer screening is considered a critical element of preventive healthcare, and the addition of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) testing, along with Pap testing, can improve prevention programs by allowing longer screening intervals for patients testing negative, while providing more precise risk estimates to allow evidence-based management of patients with abnormal screening results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schiffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leinonen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayrand et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in the US in 2020, however, cancer screenings decreased for many cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poljak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Perkins, 2022</xref>), with cervical cancer screening decreasing more than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedewa et al., 2022</xref>). Early in the pandemic, patient fear of contracting COVID-19 and reduction in non-urgent medical services impacted the ability to perform cervical cancer screening and colposcopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Massad, 2022</xref>). Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the US are government funded health centers or clinics that provide care to medically underserved populations. Maintaining cancer screening in these and other safety net facilities is critical as they serve patients at the highest risk for cervical cancer: publicly insured/uninsured, immigrant, and historically marginalized populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher-Borne et al., 2021</xref>). A survey of 22 federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that conducted cervical cancer screenings in 2020 found that 90% reported cancelling cervical cancer screenings during the height of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher-Borne et al., 2021</xref>). While 86% reported rescheduling cancer screenings for future visits, the success of this strategy to maintain screening rates was not measured. FQHCs reported strategies such as switching to telehealth visits and implementing in-office structural changes, new waiting room protocols, and new referral processes to address pandemic restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fisher-Borne et al., 2021</xref>). Following widespread vaccination and the resumption of in person services, cancer screening rates have begun to rebound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McBain et al., 2021</xref>), but challenges still exist. Currently, medical staff shortages and backlogs of patients needing to catch up on preventive services lead to longer wait times for scheduling appointments and decreased screening rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Perkins, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Massad, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentzensen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Little work has explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinician perceptions of cervical cancer screening and staffing challenges in FQHCs. In order to identify characteristics that could be targets for future interventions or additional supports, this paper examines the association of clinician characteristics with perceived changes in cervical cancer screening and the impact of pandemic-related staffing changes on screening and abnormal results follow-up during the pandemic period of October 2021 through July 2022 in FQHCs and safety net settings of care.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participant recruitment and target population</title><p>The target population were clinicians, defined for the purpose of this study as physicians and Advanced Practice Providers (APPs), who conducted cervical cancer screening in federally qualified health centers and safety net settings of care (hereafter referred to as ‘FQHCs’) in the United States during the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians were eligible to participate if they: (1) performed cervical cancer screening, (2) were a physician or APP, and (3) were currently practicing in an FQHC in the US between October 2021 and July 2022, the post-acute period of the pandemic in the US when COVID-19 vaccination was widely available to the general population. We recruited clinicians for participation in the online survey hosted via Qualtrics through periodic recruitment email messages via the American Cancer Society Vaccinating Adolescents Against Cancer (VACs) program and the professional networks of the PIs (RBP, STV).</p><p>Survey participants were asked if they would also be willing to participate in qualitative interviews via phone. A random sample of those who indicated willingness were contacted for participation. This study was approved by Moffitt Cancer Center’s Scientific Review Committee and Institutional Review Board (MCC #20048) and Boston University Medical Center’s Institutional Review Board (H-41533). All survey participants viewed an information sheet in lieu of reading and signing an informed consent form, and interview participants provided verbal consent. All were compensated for their time completing the survey or interview.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Survey development and validation</title><p>Quantitative survey questions were developed based on recent literature exploring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer screening practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentzensen et al., 2021</xref>) and the investigators’ clinical observations. The draft survey was reviewed by an expert panel of FQHC providers (n=8), refined, piloted, and finalized after incorporating pilot feedback and testing technical functionality of the Qualtrics survey among the study team.</p><p>Clinician characteristics assessed included age, race/ethnicity, training, specialty, and geographic region. Age was measured in years and categorized for analysis as &lt;30, 30–39, 40–49, 50+. Gender identity was assessed as male, female, transgender, and other. Race was assessed as Asian, Black/African American, White, Mixed race, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Other. Ethnicity was assessed as Hispanic/Latinx or non-Hispanic/Latinx. Race/ethnicity was categorized for analysis as White non-Hispanic versus all others due to small cell sizes of non-White and Hispanic participants. For all variables assessed in this manuscript that allowed write-in/free responses, responses were re-classified within the pre-determined categories for each variable when possible.</p><p>Clinician training was assessed as physician (medical doctor [MD], doctor of osteopathic medicine [DO]) or advanced practice providers (APPs) (physician assistant [PA], nurse practitioner [NP], and certified nurse midwife [CNM]). Clinician training was categorized as: (1) MD/DO (doctors of medicine and osteopathic medicine) and (2) APPs (NPs, CNMs, PAs). Clinical specialty was assessed as Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN), family medicine, internal medicine (IM), pediatric/adolescent medicine, women’s health, and other (via write in). Based on prior literarature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neugut et al., 2019</xref>) and the number of respondents in each category, we created the following categories for clinician specialty: (1) Women’s Health/OBGYN, (2) Family Medicine, and (3) IM, Pediatrics/Adolescent Medicine. Geographic location included four US regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West) and a non-responder category for those who did not provide state or zip code. Based on national data indicating geographic variation in coverage rates by US region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buskwofie et al., 2020</xref>) as well and distribution of respondents, region was categorized as (1) Northeast, (2) South, and (3) West and Midwest.</p><p>We also assessed clinical behaviors and attitudes associated with cervical cancer screening. Questions captured the number of screens performed monthly, test(s) used for screening, attitudes toward using self-collected HPV testing for cervical cancer screening, barriers to screening, tracking systems, and staffing changes.</p><p>Qualitative interview guide questions were developed based on recent literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wentzensen et al., 2021</xref>) and the investigators’ clinical observations. The draft interview guide was reviewed by an expert panel of FQHC providers (n=8) and revised. Interview questions explored survey topics in depth, including experiences with providing cervical cancer screening at different points during the pandemic, barriers to providing care, as well as strategies for improving follow-up, including tracking systems and self-sampled HPV testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Quantitative survey data</title><p>We assessed descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) of clinician characteristics and outcome variables. We conducted separate exact binary logistic regressions (due to small cell sizes) examining the associations of clinician characteristics with (a) screening practices at the time of survey participation (the same/more versus less than pre-pandemic), and (b) pandemic-associated staffing changes impacting the ability to screen or follow-up (yes/no). The following variables were included in the full models for each outcome: race/ethnicity, age, gender, region, clinician training., clinician specialty. We used manual forward selection with a value for entry and significance of 0.10 because this strikes a balance between the commonly accepted method of using AIC (which assumes significance level of 0.157), and the often used alpha of 0.05, which could lead to failure to identify associations due to small sample size. Variables were added sequentially with the variable with the lowest p-value below 0.10 added at each step. We produced forest plots displaying odds ratios and confidence intervals from this model (Figure 2). Analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Qualitative interview data</title><p>Interviews were conducted by three co-authors (RBP, AM, HBF) trained in qualitative methodology via video conference (Zoom); interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were coded using thematic content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elo and Kyngäs, 2008</xref>). Based on the questions in the initial interview guide, a priori codes were developed and a codebook created to operationalize and define each code. The qualitative analysis team independently reviewed the data twice. The team hand coded the data with the initial codes and made notes on possible new codes in the first coding pass. Then, notes on possible new codes were discussed until consensus was reached. The codes were then revised and transcripts reviewed using the updated code categories. This second coding pass served to clean coding from the first coding pass and identify emergent themes not initially identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Unknown, 1998</xref>). At least two coders reviewed each transcript. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion in weekly group meetings. A centralized shared data sheet was used for coding to facilitate communication across different institutions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>This study was funded by the American Cancer Society, who had no role in the study’s design, conduct, or reporting.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Quantitative survey data</title><p>A total of 159 potential participants viewed the online study information sheet and completed screening items; 11 were excluded due to ineligible clinical training (n=5) or not conducting cervical cancer screening (n=6).

Another important barrier was pandemic-associated staffing changes impacting the ability to screen for cervical cancer, track abnormal results, or follow-up with their patients, which was reported by 45% of participants. Approximately half of participants reported current decreased staffing levels of medical assistants (56%), and office staff (43%) as compared to pre-pandemic while approximately one third reported decreases in physicians (35%), APPs (28%), and nurses (28%).

A total of 31% felt that self-sampling would be very helpful and 61% felt it would be somewhat helpful to address pandemic-associated screening deficits.

The most common perceived benefits of self-sampling were screening patients who had difficulty undergoing speculum exams (26% moderate benefit, 56% large benefit), or screening patients who had access to care issues (34% moderate benefit, 39% large benefit). However, clinicians reported concerns about patients collecting inadequate samples (33% moderate, 33% large concern), not returning specimens in a timely manner (35% moderate, 38% large concern), or not presenting for other primary care services (33% moderate, 31% large concern).

In primary care offices, early disruptions were associated with caring for persons with COVID-19: “People working, especially in family medicine, were distributed to the COVID clinic… And so non-essential visits including routine pap smears were put on hold” (APP, Family Medicine). Many clinics switched to telemedicine, which was helpful to address acute issues, but reduced opportunities for cervical cancer screening. One said: “If they had been in the clinic… I would have probably done cervical cancer screening at that time.” This participant noted that rescheduling well care was often unsuccessful: “I'll have the medical assistant call… but we have a really high no-show rate when people are just coming in for well exams” (APP, Women’s Health).</p><p>Clinicians also noted that patients were afraid to come for care early in the pandemic: “Patients were hesitant, especially in the first year of [the] COVID pandemic, to leave their home for unnecessary reasons, including screening tests such as Pap smear” (MD, Family Medicine). Later in the pandemic, when more patients were seen for primary care, clinicians described situations where other medical conditions took priority: “primary care visits were all like trying to catch up on everything else cause all of a sudden now everyone’s diabetes is out of control, and their anxiety is out of control, and cancer screening ends up being at the bottom of the list among the issues that they want to talk about” (MD, Family Medicine). As the pandemic moved into the endemic phase, clinicians described additional challenges: “The social determinants are still hitting some of our patients pretty hard… I don’t know that it’s COVID as much anymore that’s affecting their ability to access care” (MD, Family Medicine).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Ongoing barriers (system and staffing)</title><p>Several participants described current and ongoing limitations to existing systems: “Only if a patient has had an abnormal [result] are they actively being tracked… [otherwise] until they access the Health Center for their next visit we really have no idea” (APP, Women’s Health/OBGYN). Others described EMR functionality that went unused due to limited staff capacity or poorly functioning EMRs: “In our old system you could literally put a quick text [smart phrase that pulls patient information into a medical record note]… and it will just come up with all the history of the Paps. We can't do any of it in this new system… I'm literally going through the system, and looking at all the past Paps, and I'm writing them in the note” (MD, Family Medicine).</p><p>Participants described profound staffing shortages: “We're missing MAs, front desk, providers, nurses too. Pretty much literally everybody, every position, we're short” (APP, Family Medicine). Another said: “We stayed [open] without somebody cleaning the clinic 100%... so we had to do some of the work ourselves” (MD, Family Medicine). Staffing shortages also negatively impacted outreach: “We're not outreaching to patients and trying to get them in, we're just trying to get through the day… we just don't have the manpower to see everybody” (APP, Family Medicine). The relatively lower compensation at FQHCs posed an additional challenge both to staff retention and to creating and utilizing patient tracking systems: “As a federally qualified health center, we often are not the best payer for different roles. And so we tend to have a lot of turnover, particularly in our medical assistants, nurses, and it’s quite hard to hire.” Additionally, this participant also noted, “We also tend not to have the biggest or the most robust IT department… And any time we need to get information from these registries, we need to ask our IT department. But they're pretty understaffed. And also underpaid” (MD, Family Medicine). Childcare also posed challenges: “I'd say the majority of our staff in the nursing and medical assistant roles are moms and some of them are single moms. So we lost a few because… they had no childcare [realted to the pandemic] or they couldn't come in” (APP, Family Medicine). In contrast, COVID-19 vaccine mandates were not felt to be significant contributors to staff shortages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Facilitators and strategies for catching up on cervical cancer screening</title><p>The participants discussed how the availability of COVID-19 vaccinations shifted the risk-benefit ratio of seeing patients in person for routine care: “before we were able to be vaccinated… it felt like unnecessary risk” (APP, Women’s Health). As the pandemic continued into its second year, clinicians perceived the benefits of resuming in person visits outweighed the risk of contracting COVID-19 in healthcare settings; therefore, the focus shifted to catch-up measures: “When we realized that this was gonna be a long-term change… there was a big push to catch people up [with screening for cervical cancer]” (APP, Family Medicine).</p><p>Participants discussed strategies for patient outreach to catch-up on screening, including automated components within the EMR, dedicated staff who identify patients who are due to screen, providing evening or weekend hours, and mobile health units. One noted, “The health center as a whole has been trying to run lists of people that are due and bring them in” (APP, Family Medicine).Clinicians described strategies related to accountable care organizations, which are value-based care entities promoted by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, 2023</xref>), stating: “We're an accountable care organization, it incentivizes getting all of your quality metrics where you want them… The pap smears are tracked every quarter… If you hit above 75% of your pap smears, they give you an incentive quarterly” (APP, Family Medicine). Another suggested that healthcare systems and insurance plans could be utilized: “We [our practice] discussed perhaps using our accountable entity to try to do some outreach as well, because they do outreach right now for colon cancer and mammograms” (MD, Family Medicine).</p><p>Some participants described potential strategies to increase staff retention: “Increase in pay I feel will help. But also recognition for the staff, because some of the staff feel underappreciated…. and maybe more organized so that everything can run smoothly and uniformly” (APP, Family Medicine). Another added: “Better salaries, better benefits, better working conditions. In the sense that if somebody needed to take care of a child and go home early, then staggered staffing, flexible hours as part of the benefits, so that somebody else can cover. And, of course, monetary, icing on the cake, so to speak, always works” (MD, OBGYN).</p><p>Self-sampling for HPV testing is not currently FDA approved in the US, but may be an option in the future. Most participants thought self-sampling would be helpful to address pandemic-related screening deficits: “People are coming back with a lot of problems that they've been hanging on to for a couple of years. So that could help take care of some of their health maintenance and not further delay it because they're worried about X, Y, Z also. Then sure, that would help with the COVID deficit specifically” (APP, Family Medicine). Many noted that patients self-collected other specimens, and felt that HPV self-collection would be feasible: “We have a lot of our patients doing self-swabs right now anyways for vaginitis… and I'm used to having patients swab themselves for other things like in pregnancy we do GBS swabs, so I feel confident that people can correctly be instructed on how to self-swab” (APP, OBGYN). However, others were concerned about patients’ abilities to properly collect the specimens: “There’s certain populations, especially the underserved community that I do work in might face challenges to follow the instruction or even read on how to do it” (MD/DO, Family Medicine). Others described negative experiences using mailing for self-collected colon cancer screening: “It would be really clever if we could just send out swabs to patients. But I don't know. We tried that with FIT (fecal occult blood) testing, and we were told by the lab that they don't get a high enough return of the kits. And so it actually was cost prohibitive to just be sending out FIT tests” (MD/DO, Family Medicine).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined patterns of cervical cancer screening provision and abnormal results follow-up between October 2021 through July 2022 among clinicians practicing in federally qualified health centers. Over 80% of clinicians reported decreased screening during the start of the pandemic in 2020, but approximately 67% reported that screening had resumed to pre-pandemic levels at the time of the survey (2021–2022). Those who identified specialty as family medicine or other had decreased odds for, and those who identified training as APP, had increase odds for performing the same or more screening at time of survey (2021–22) as compared to before the pandemic. Clinician barriers, both reported quantitatively and qualitatively, focused on staffing shortages as well as structural systems to track and reestablish care for those who were overdue for screening and those who needed follow-up after an abnormal screening test.</p><p>Barriers to screening evolved over the course of the pandemic. In 2020, fear of contracting COVID was the primary barrier to provision of services by clinicians and health systems, and use of services by patients. Clinicians described near cessation of cervical cancer screening services early in the pandemic, as both clinicians and patients felt that the risk of contracting COVID when providing well care outweighed the benefits of cervical cancer screening in the short term. Vaccinations and the realization that COVID was becoming endemic changed this calculus, and clinics began re-opening services and recalling patients for screenings. In 2021/22, the primary barrier to cervical cancer screening shifted from contagion concerns to staffing shortages and the need for primary care clinicians to address other chronic health conditions. However, clinicians also noted that patients not scheduling or not attending appointments was an important barrier to screening. Quantitative findings indicated that cancer screenings were less often performed in specialties that did not focus on women’s health, such as internal or family medicine. Qualitative data indicated that this may have resulted from a need to provide direct care for COVID-19 patients or to focus on other chronic health conditions that had worsened due to lack of care during 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castanon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Network EHR, 2020</xref>). In addition, our findings noted that APPs performed more cervical cancer screening than physicians, which could indicate appropriate allocation of patients needing preventive care to APPs, while assigning sicker patients to physicians who could better address complex medical concerns. Additional research is needed to confirm and further explore these findings.</p><p>Staff shortages hindering the ability to provide cervical cancer screening and follow-up care were reported by nearly half of clinicians. Clinicians reported reductions in staffing at all levels: physicians/APPs, nurses, medical assistants, and front desk staff. Staff shortages, both clinical and non-clinical across many healthcare settings, have been reported in other contexts as a result of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holthof and Luedi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chervoni-Knapp, 2022</xref>). Two factors were felt to be the most important contributors to staff shortages: low salaries and lack of childcare. Because FHQCs typically pay lower salaries than other practice settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quinn et al., 2013</xref>), participants reported high levels of staff turnover and difficulties with recruitment. Pandemic-related remote schooling and rules related to infection control created childcare difficulties for many parents. Participants reported this to be a particular problem for female staff in lower salaried positions, such as medical assistants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boesch and Hamm, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Strategies for addressing pandemic-related screening deficiencies included improving staffing levels as well as systems for follow-up and tracking. Several clinicians described success associated with robust tracking systems including population management reports, system-wide incentives, automated patient outreach, and dedicated staff for patient recall and scheduling. Others, however, reported absent systems or being unable to utilize EMR capabilities due to staff shortages. Higher salaries, improved organization within the healthcare system, and ensuring that staff felt respected and valued by leadership were felt to be important strategies for improving care provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serrano et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sinsky et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Talbot and Dean, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Participants overall felt that HPV self-sampling would be a useful tool to address pandemic-related screening deficits, as has been noted in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuzzell et al., 2021</xref>). Many felt confident that patients could self-collect the swabs given their experience using self-swabbing with patients for vaginitis or group B strep in pregnancy. However, others were concerned that patients might not collect the specimen properly, leading to a false negative cancer screening result. Self-sampling when using PCR-based testing has demonstrated overall similar accuracy to clinician-based samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbyn et al., 2022</xref>), though studies to validate this in US populations are ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">National Cancer Institute, 2023</xref>). For some participants, clinic-collected sampling was viewed more favorably than home-testing via mailed kits due to negative experiences with home-based colon cancer testing. A meta-analysis of self-sampling indicated increased screening participation when self-sampling is offered, with clinic-based offering being more effective than mail-in kits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costa et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>As healthcare continues to face challenges including COVID-19, influenza, behavioral health, and exacerbation of chronic diseases, strategies are needed to ensure that patients are provided with cervical cancer prevention services. This is especially important in FQHCs, who serve patients at the highest risk of invasive cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hébert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry and Breen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradley et al., 2001</xref>). Maintaining adequate staffing is a critical need noted in our study and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frogner, 2022</xref>). Higher salaries were felt to be most important, as well as improved organization of clinic function and flexible scheduling to support working parents with childcare needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burrowes et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">U.S. Bureau of Cancer Statistics, 2023</xref>).</p><p>This study has several strengths and weaknesses. We surveyed clinicians practicing in FQHCs in the US on the perceived impact of the pandemic on screening and abnormal results follow-up. Few investigations thus far have examined perceptions of those practicing in FQHCS, in particular as it pertains to impacts of pandemic-related challenges to cervical cancer screening. Despite this, we note several limitations. We recruited our sample through FQHC networks; thus, we were unable to calculate a response rate, nor were we able to achieve a nationally representative sample and thus, findings cannot be widely generalized. Notwithstanding efforts to achieve a regionally diverse sample, 63% of responding clinicians were practicing in the Northeast at the time of their participation. Given that COVID-19 policies varied widely by state, this regional imbalance may limit the generalizability of our results. Despite the oversample of clinicians in the Northeast, region was not a significant predictor of either outcome. Similarly, our sample was 85% female and 70% White. Although ideally we would have included a sample that was more diverse with respect to race and gender, these characteristics are not disparate from the majority of clinicians who perform cervical cancer screening (e.g., race: Women’s Health NPs [77% White] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Healthcare Ws, 2018</xref>), active Ob/Gyns [67% White] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AAMC, 2022</xref>), all active physicians [64% White] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AAMC, 2022</xref>); gender: all NPs [92% female] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hooker et al., 2016</xref>), Ob/Gyns [64% female] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AAMC, 2022</xref>), all active physicians [37% female] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AAMC, 2022</xref>)). Importantly, we do not have data on the overall number of screenings provided by each FQHC. The majority of our sample reported that they personally were providing screening at pre-pandemic levels, but half also report staff shortages impacting screening and follow up. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether the efforts of remaining staff are sufficient to compensate for missing personnel in terms of the overall availability of services. Finally, the use of manual forward selection with our <italic>a</italic> priori determined significance level has limitations, including the possibility of overfitting. Additional studies would be useful to confirm these findings.</p><p>These findings highlight that in late 2021 and early 2022, clinicians in FQHCs are still perceiving impacts of the pandemic broadly to cervical cancer screening. They also still report experiencing pandemic-related impacts of staffing changes on screening and follow-up. If not addressed, reductions in screening due to staff shortages, and low patient engagement with the healthcare system may lead to increase in cervical cancer in the short and long term. Future research should closely tracktrends in provision of screening, colposcopy, and treatment services in underserved communities and settings in order to avoid future increases in cancer incidence.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was approved by Moffitt Cancer Center's Scientific Review Committee and Institutional Review Board (MCC #20048) and Boston University Medical Center's Institutional Review Board (H-41533).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-86358-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="repstand1"><label>Reporting standard 1.</label><media xlink:href="elife-86358-repstand1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Full human subjects data are unavailable via a data repository due to confidentiality concerns.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and I oversaw the evaluation in my dual role of Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Parker Tope (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is an edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction</p><p>The introduction contextualizes well previous literature on the impact of the pandemic on cancer screening services and introduces tangible examples of how the pandemic influenced factors along the screening continuum.</p><p>While the authors mention investigating the association between clinician characteristics and outcomes of interest in the methods, there is little justification for doing so. Are clinical characteristics meant to serve as proxies for determining the patient populations that are attended to by clinician participants?</p><p>Methods</p><p>I would suggest reorganizing the methods into the following sections for logical flow: Target population, Survey development and validation (which would include measures), survey administration (which would include Participant Recruitment), and finally analysis (Quantitative and Qualitative). This would aid the reader in following the process of the survey construction, dissemination, and finally, how obtained data were used.</p><p>What is the target population of the study? Explicitly stating the target population can help readers determine if sampling methods were appropriate given the sampling frame.</p><p>The authors mention federally qualified health centres (FQHC) as their participant sources, however, there is no explanation as to why participant recruitment was focused on FQHCs. Are there key populations served by FQHCs in the US? Including further explanation would allow for further assessment of the study's generalizability as well as comparability with other research outside of the US.</p><p>How was the survey administered? Was there a particular software or an electronic form used for the online survey? I suggest including this information in the Methods section for transparent reporting.</p><p>The authors state that the survey questions were piloted across an expert panel, however, it is unclear as to whether the platform that was used for the survey administration was also piloted for possible technical functionality issues. Not piloting the technology could lead to unknown sources of error and thus introduce bias. If piloting was conducted, I suggest that this be more clearly stated in the methods.</p><p>The authors collect race/ethnicity information from their survey participants, specifically collecting disaggregated race/ethnicity data. In their regression analyses, the researchers aggregated racial categories without explanation. In accordance with best practices in handling race/ethnicity data, when collecting disaggregated data, subsequent aggregation of race/ethnicity categories should be clearly justified (e.g., insufficient sample size).</p><p>There is no mention of missing data, or incomplete survey responses. Did the authors collect this information (i.e., whether survey responses that were started but not completed were captured in their final dataset?). Was data cleaned and assessed for unlikely or aberrant values?</p><p>With regards to the qualitative interviews, how were participants interviewed? In-person, via Zoom, or over the phone? Who conducted the interviews?</p><p>I have difficulty understanding why the authors conducted multivariable logistic regression, rather than univariate. Given the study design (i.e., survey) as well as the main objective of the study, which was to explore the perceived need for screening and appears to be descriptive, I am uncertain about the authors' adjustment for several covariates. The overarching concern is that adjustment for covariates (unclear as to whether these are theorized as predictors or confounders) conflates a descriptive research question with causal methods. If the objective were to determine how clinician characteristics causally affected (1) the level of screening pre- and during-pandemic times and (2) the severity of systemic difficulties (i.e., staffing), then adjustment for covariates should be justified and reflected in the study's objective. There appears to be little causality to be inferred through this study and rather a descriptive perspective, which would only appropriately justify univariate, descriptive analyses.</p><p>Even if adjustment for covariates were appropriate for this research question, the use of manual forwards selection using p-value as the selection criteria can lead to over-fitting and requires well-justified selection of potential covariates to be sequentially added to the model. If the authors proceed to include previously conducted analyses in this manuscript, I suggest that such limitations be acknowledged.</p><p>Results and Discussion:</p><p>The authors comprehensively present the descriptive findings of the survey data. I very much appreciated the inclusion of direct quotes from interviewees in addition to summarizing key qualitative pieces in the included table. These quotes provide a narrative component to the article and give voice to the challenges and frustrations experienced by clinicians.</p><p>Given the authors' emphasis on interviewees' difficulties in staffing, accommodating childcare for staff, and better compensating non-provider healthcare workers, I would suggest the inclusion of a section in the discussion emphasizing how the COVID-19 pandemic has also disproportionately affected the lived experiences of non-providers in healthcare, who have essential roles in facilitating the cancer care system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1. Provide a brief overview of what Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are and how they differ from other healthcare facilities in the US. It would help readers unfamiliar with the US healthcare system understand why safety net facilities like FQHCs are essential in cervical cancer screening.</p><p>2. Explain why the chosen period (October 2021 through July 2022) was significant or relevant to the study. This would help readers understand why this specific time frame was chosen for the study and how it might have impacted the findings. Was this period extra hard in the U.S?</p><p>Method:</p><p>3. The paper would benefit from discussing the choice of statistical method for analysing the quantitative survey data. Stepwise regression is a discussed method with the downside of overfitting. At the same time, an explanation or discussion should follow of choosing a significance value for entry at 0.10.</p><p>4. Why did the authors choose the p-values of 0.10 as significant?</p><p>Results:</p><p>5. Page 7, line 190: The author points out that “the most commonly reported barriers were limited in-person appointment availability (46%)…” However, this number cannot be found in Table 3, pages 20-21. I guess that it is a typo and should instead be 45%?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>6. Discuss whether the composition of responders represents the people who generally work at the safety net facilities. The sample contains an overrepresentation of white females, which could affect the results.</p><p>7. The paper would benefit from a discussion on the choice of statistical method for analysing the quantitative survey data. It is my understanding that stepwise regression is a discussed method with the downside of overfitting. At the same time, there should follow an explanation or discussion of the choosing of a p-value of 0.10, as this in my opinion is high.</p><p>Tables and figures:</p><p>8. In Table 1, under age, the sum of the numbers does not add up to N 148; instead, the sum is 147.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. General: inconsistencies in percentages between the manuscript text and tables were observed throughout. The manuscript needs to be checked carefully and corrections made. Some may be due to a lack of rounding; appropriate rounding should be applied on percentages noted in tables and footnoted.</p><p>2. Abbreviations are provided in the text (and abstract) without defining these in the first place. These may be familiar/standard in the US but not for an international audience.</p><p>3. Title: only 45% of the participants of this study were clinicians. Adding or replacing this term with 'health care providers' would more accurately describe study participants. This point should be applied throughout the article.</p><p>4a. General/abstract: although I appreciate the constraints of the word limit for the abstract, the current wording does not do justice to the work presented. Suggest re-writing sections of it.</p><p>4b. Abstract/methods section: lines 35-38 are not methods but results. Other information should be stated in this section e.g. how the national sample was obtained, how the survey was conducted, and domains of questioning.</p><p>4c. Abstract/results: Findings in the Results section for APPs and ethnicity did not reach statistical significance as presented in the paper. There were various interesting findings that could replace these statements.</p><p>4d. Abstract/conclusion: although I agree with the validity of the statement in the conclusion, it does not sum up the results presented.</p><p>5a. Results section</p><p>Line 170: it is stated that 38% reported suspension of colposcopy and 6% of LEEP services, based on denominators of 95 and 127 participants respectively, after taking the number of unsure answers out of the total of 148 participants (as per footnote of Table 1). However, Table 1 also stated that only 115/148 provided colposcopy on site and 46/148 provided LEEP which has not been taken into consideration. Please revise both the manuscript text and Table 1 entries accordingly.</p><p>5b. Line 180: the p-value has been incorrectly rounded.</p><p>5c. Lines 185-188: The text states that clinician training was significantly associated with increased odds of the same or more screening however the p-value provided is 0.06 which signifies weak evidence at best. Even 0.05 is considered borderline significance. The same applies to the association with clinician race/ethnicity. Please amend these statements accordingly or remove.</p><p>6a. Discussion general: findings of non-attendance and increased frequency of women not booking screening appointments (not even mentioned in the results but presented in Table 3), are important points to mention in the discussion and linked to observed cervical screening attendance in the US reported during a similar time period.</p><p>6b. Lines 327-328: Is this statement based on qualitative evidence? If so please include this in the Results section as well.</p><p>6c. Lines 331-333: Quantitative findings referred to in this sentence were not included in the Results section nor relevant tables. It would be informative to provide a breakdown of screens provided by speciality in Table 1.</p><p>6d. Lines 335-336: The statement that APPs performed more screens than physicians has not been included in the results. It would be informative to provide a breakdown of screens provided per training in Table 1.</p><p>6e. Lines 367-369 These themes have already been raised earlier in the discussion (lines 339-346). Suggest merging the two relevant paragraphs.</p><p>7. Table 1: No details on staffing are provided in this table; title 9 rows from the end of the table should be amended.</p><p>8a. Table 2: recommend adding zeros before the point for more clarity.</p><p>8b. Table 2: a footnote listing the variables for which regression was adjusted should be listed.</p><p>8c. Table 3: add 'adjusted' to 'odds ratio'.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86358.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The introduction contextualizes well previous literature on the impact of the pandemic on cancer screening services and introduces tangible examples of how the pandemic influenced factors along the screening continuum.</p><p>While the authors mention investigating the association between clinician characteristics and outcomes of interest in the methods, there is little justification for doing so. Are clinical characteristics meant to serve as proxies for determining the patient populations that are attended to by clinician participants?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We intentionally sought to examine clinician characteristics that may be associated with perceived changes in cervical cancer screening and the impact of pandemic-related staffing changes on screening and abnormal results follow-up during the post-acute pandemic period. The reason for doing so was to identify characteristics that could be targets for future interventions or additional support. For example, if more family medicine practitioners reported lower screening rates, that indicates a potential need for interventions focused on family medicine clinicians to help to avoid future disparities in cervical cancer. Similarly, characteristics like age, race, ethnicity, gender, region are worth exploring as statistically significant associations and could indicate that more supports and resources could be provided for providers in particular sub-groups. We now include a sentence on pg. 4 that indicates the reasoning behind exploring these associations:</p><p>“In order to identify characteristics that could be targets for future interventions or additional supports, this paper examines the association of clinician characteristics with perceived changes in cervical cancer screening and the impact of pandemic-related staffing changes on screening and abnormal results follow-up during the pandemic period of October 2021 through July 2022 in FQHCs and safety net settings of care.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods</p><p>I would suggest reorganizing the methods into the following sections for logical flow: Target population, Survey development and validation (which would include measures), survey administration (which would include Participant Recruitment), and finally analysis (Quantitative and Qualitative).

Explicitly stating the target population can help readers determine if sampling methods were appropriate given the sampling frame.</p></disp-quote><p>The target population was clinicians who conducted cervical cancer screening in federally qualified health centers and safety net facilities in the United States during the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is now noted on pg. 4 of the manuscript:</p><p>“The target population were clinicians, defined for the purpose of this study as physicians and Advanced Practice Providers (APPs), who conducted cervical cancer screening in federally qualified health centers and safety net settings of care in the United States during the post-acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors mention federally qualified health centres (FQHC) as their participant sources, however, there is no explanation as to why participant recruitment was focused on FQHCs. Are there key populations served by FQHCs in the US? Including further explanation would allow for further assessment of the study's generalizability as well as comparability with other research outside of the US.</p></disp-quote><p>The study focused on safety net settings of care. The most common safety net setting in the US are FQHCs, federally funded health centers or clinics that serve medically underserved areas and populations and often provide care at no or low cost to those with limited or no health insurance. During the pandemic, there was little research that focused specifically on FQHCs and ability to provide cervical cancer screening to these underserved populations who are at higher risk of cervical cancer than the general population. This is noted on pg. 3 of the manuscript:</p><p>“Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the US are government funded health centers or clinics that provide care to medically underserved populations. Maintaining cancer screening in these and other safety net facilities is critical as they serve patients at the highest risk for cervical cancer: publicly insured/uninsured, immigrant, and historically marginalized populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was the survey administered? Was there a particular software or an electronic form used for the online survey? I suggest including this information in the Methods section for transparent reporting.</p></disp-quote><p>The survey was administered via online survey designed and hosted via Qualtrics, a common platform for market and research surveys. This is now noted on pg. 4 of the manuscript:</p><p>“We recruited clinicians for participation in the online survey hosted via Qualtrics….”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that the survey questions were piloted across an expert panel, however, it is unclear as to whether the platform that was used for the survey administration was also piloted for possible technical functionality issues. Not piloting the technology could lead to unknown sources of error and thus introduce bias. If piloting was conducted, I suggest that this be more clearly stated in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify the process. The survey items were piloted with the expert panel prior to design of the Qualtrics survey. Once survey items were embedded into the Qualtrics platform, the research team internally tested the survey, making note of any technical errors that resulted from skip logic, select all versus single selection items, etc., and correcting any issues that were identified. They study also used the same Qualtrics survey platform to design a separate survey for over 1200 providers in the year prior and thus, had extensive experience identifying technical issues. The testing of technical functionality by the study team is now noted on pg. 4 in the Survey development and validation section:</p><p>“The draft survey was reviewed by an expert panel of FQHC providers (n=8), refined, piloted, and finalized after incorporating pilot feedback and testing technical functionality of the Qualtrics survey among the study team.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors collect race/ethnicity information from their survey participants, specifically collecting disaggregated race/ethnicity data. In their regression analyses, the researchers aggregated racial categories without explanation. In accordance with best practices in handling race/ethnicity data, when collecting disaggregated data, subsequent aggregation of race/ethnicity categories should be clearly justified (e.g., insufficient sample size).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point. Due to small cell sizes for persons of color (n of less than 15 each for Black, Asian, mixed race, and other race categories), we elected to categorize this variable with two groups: white non-Hispanic versus all non-white races (including Hispanic/Latinx). This is noted on pg. 5 and we’ve added the reasoning to the text (small cell sizes):</p><p>“Race/ethnicity was categorized for analysis as white non-Hispanic versus all others due to small cell sizes of non-white and Hispanic participants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no mention of missing data, or incomplete survey responses. Did the authors collect this information (i.e., whether survey responses that were started but not completed were captured in their final dataset?). Was data cleaned and assessed for unlikely or aberrant values?</p></disp-quote><p>Data were cleaned and examined for potential duplicate responses identified by repeat IP address and identical participant characteristics, nonsensical free responses, or randomly selected responses. See added explanation now included in text on pg. 7:</p><p>“Data were cleaned and invalid surveys were removed. Invalid surveys included potential duplicate responses identified by repeat IP address, nonsensical write-in free responses, and those with numerous skipped items.”</p><p>Overall, in the Qualtrics survey platform, if participants skipped an item purposely or unintentionally left an item blank, Qualtrics automatically prompted them to complete that item. They could either choose to complete it or select “ignore” to skip the item. There were very few skipped or missing items, but if a particular participant appeared to be missing more than a few errant responses, all of their responses were assessed to determine whether their participation was invalid and whether their survey should be removed. For each item included in analyses, Tables 1, 3, 4, and 5 include a “valid N” column. The total N for this sample was 148, thus any valid Ns less than 148 indicate missing responses for that particular item.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the qualitative interviews, how were participants interviewed? In-person, via Zoom, or over the phone? Who conducted the interviews?</p></disp-quote><p>Interviews were conducted via Zoom by three co-authors trained in qualitative methodology. This info is now indicated on pg. 6:</p><p>“Interviews were conducted by three co-authors (RBP, AM, HBF) trained in qualitative methodology via video conference (Zoom)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have difficulty understanding why the authors conducted multivariable logistic regression, rather than univariate.

Our team, including a biostatistician (NB), conducted these analyses with these goals in mind. We also confirmed there were no mentions of causality in the manuscript. Multivariable logistic regression is appropriate because we aimed to examine associations of multiple independent variables with a single dependent variable (perceived screening practices), and each association controls for confounding by the other variables in the model. If needed, we can provide univariate crude associations by request for supplementary material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even if adjustment for covariates were appropriate for this research question, the use of manual forwards selection using p-value as the selection criteria can lead to over-fitting and requires well-justified selection of potential covariates to be sequentially added to the model. If the authors proceed to include previously conducted analyses in this manuscript, I suggest that such limitations be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that manual forward selection has drawbacks, as do other approaches such as backward selection or AIC. With a small sample size (N=148), we chose manual forward selection because it begins with a null model and builds upon itself incrementally, rather than backward selection, which starts with a larger model. The biostatistician and study team carefully selected variables to be added to the model. The limitations of manual forward selection are now noted on pg. 16 in the limitations section of the discussion:</p><p>“Finally, the use of manual forward selection with our a priori determined significance level has limitations, including the possibility of overfitting. Additional studies would be useful to confirm these findings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results and Discussion:</p><p>The authors comprehensively present the descriptive findings of the survey data. I very much appreciated the inclusion of direct quotes from interviewees in addition to summarizing key qualitative pieces in the included table. These quotes provide a narrative component to the article and give voice to the challenges and frustrations experienced by clinicians.</p><p>Given the authors' emphasis on interviewees' difficulties in staffing, accommodating childcare for staff, and better compensating non-provider healthcare workers, I would suggest the inclusion of a section in the discussion emphasizing how the COVID-19 pandemic has also disproportionately affected the lived experiences of non-providers in healthcare, who have essential roles in facilitating the cancer care system.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this thoughtful feedback. On pgs. 14-15, we include discussion of staff shortages (both clinical and non-clinical staff) as a result of the pandemic, and the impact on these workers.</p><p>“Staff shortages hindering the ability to provide cervical cancer screening and follow-up care were reported by nearly half of clinicians. Clinicians reported reductions in staffing at all levels: physicians/APPs, nurses, medical assistants, and front desk staff. Staff shortages, both clinical and non-clinical across many healthcare settings, have been reported in other contexts as a result of the pandemic.<sup>29,30</sup> Two factors were felt to be the most important contributors to staff shortages: low salaries and lack of childcare. Because FHQCs typically pay lower salaries than other practice settings,<sup>31,32</sup> participants reported high levels of staff turnover and difficulties with recruitment. Pandemic-related remote schooling and rules related to infection control created childcare difficulties for many parents. Participants reported this to be a particular problem for female staff in lower salaried positions, such as medical assistants.<sup>33,34</sup>”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1.

The goal was to recruit approximately 150 clinicians. However, the Omicron wave hit in winter 2021-22, which overwhelmed healthcare systems and forced us to pause recruitment until approximately March 2022. We resumed recruitment efforts in the spring of 2022 and reached our target sample size by July. We have added information to the Methods section (Participant recruitment and target population) on pg.4 indicating the goal to focus on perceived cervical cancer screening practices during the post-acute period after vaccination was generally available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Method:</p><p>3.

Using a priori hypotheses would have included more potential variables and would have resulted in a larger model than what we ultimately utilized, with very small cell sizes for many of the variables. As suggested by the study biostatistician, we selected p of.10 as a significance value for entry. This strikes a balance between the commonly accepted method of using the AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion), which implicitly assumes a significance level of 0.157, and simultaneously mitigates the potentially low power corresponding to a level of 0.05 in a sample as small as ours, which is now noted on pg. 6:</p><p>“We used manual forward selection with a value for entry and significance of 0.10 because this strikes a balance between the commonly accepted method of using AIC (which assumes significance level of 0.157), and the often used α of 0.05, which could lead to failure to identify associations due to small sample size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Why did the authors choose the p-values of 0.10 as significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to our response above pertaining to entry p values of.10, we use a significance level of.10 to balance the tradeoff between high type I error inherent in other levels such as 0.157 (the level assumed when using the AIC to choose a model) and low power to conduct exploratory analyses with a smaller α. This small study was designed as a supplement to a larger quantitative study and was intended to be hypothesis generating for future, confirmatory studies. Given these goals, the study biostatistician and research team felt that 0.10 was an appropriate significance level selected a priori for our study.
