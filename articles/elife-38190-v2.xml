However, comparative analyses reveal common principles of limb movement control. Here, we report that a kinematic synergy involving the planar covariation of limb segment motion holds in 54 different animal species (10 birds and 44 mammals), despite large differences in body size, mass (ranging from 30 g to 4 tonnes), limb configuration, and amplitude of movements. This kinematic synergy lies at the interface between the neural command signals output by locomotor pattern generators, the mechanics of the body center of mass and the external environment, and it may represent one neuromechanical principle conserved in evolution to save mechanical energy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38190.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals have evolved very different body shapes and styles of movement that are adapted to their needs in the habitats they live in. For example, mice, lions and many other animals use four limbs to walk, while humans and birds only use two limbs.</p><p>The styles animals use to walk also differ in terms of how long each foot is on the ground during a single stride, and for four-legged animals, in how long a forefoot lags behind the hindfoot on the same side of the body during the stride. Yet, there are general principles in how walking is organized that are shared between animals of vastly different shapes and sizes. Many animals save energy during walking by swinging the center of their body mass back and forth like a pendulum.</p><p>Networks of neurons are responsible for controlling how and when animals move, and these networks have similar architectures and patterns of activity in many different mammals and birds. How do signals from the nervous system regulate the position of the center of body mass while an animal walks?</p><p>Here, Catavitello et al. addressed this question by analyzing how over 50 different species of birds and mammals walked around in zoo enclosures and other semi-natural or natural environments.

Anatomically, tetrapods may differ in the number of limbs used for locomotion (bipedal versus quadrupedal), limb length, shape, and mass. Functionally, locomotor styles may differ in terms of limb posture (more flexed or more extended), duty factor (percent of stride interval when each hind foot is on the ground), and for quadrupeds diagonality (percent of stride interval that a forefoot lags behind ipsilateral hind foot). Nevertheless, there might be general principles of organization that underlie the diversity of locomotor styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blickhan and Full, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Following the pioneering program set up by Marey, one important research goal in the study of comparative physiology of movement is ‘to point out the laws which are common for all forms and manifestations of locomotion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Marey, 1874</xref>). Although this ambitious goal has not been reached yet, some general principles for terrestrial locomotion have emerged that apply to a wide range of animal species, mainly related to energy saving mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>) on the one hand, and to the neural control of muscle activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lacquaniti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grillner, 2018</xref>) on the other hand.</p><p>With regard to energy saving mechanisms, the exchange between the gravitational potential energy and the forward kinetic energy due to pendulum-like oscillations of the centre of body mass (COM) has been shown to apply to walking of several legged animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavagna et al., 1977</xref>). With regard to neuromuscular control, four main activity patterns output by spinal motoneurones have been described that are common to different mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dominici et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wenger et al., 2016</xref>). They contribute to the different phases of gait cycle, that is limb extension at foot touch-down, body-weight support during stance, limb lift-off, and swing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ting et al., 2015</xref>). Also the architecture of the central pattern generators is highly conserved across animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grillner, 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, there is a gap in trying to relate the neural command signals to the mechanics of the COM. The COM is a virtual point in the trunk that shifts in space depending on the instantaneous configuration of the body. Its position is determined by the combined motion of the limb segments, as well as by trunk deformations. Therefore, in order to control the position of COM, the central pattern generators for locomotion must coordinate the motion of the limb segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lacquaniti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacquaniti et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Kinematic coordination of limb segments can be described by statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), which projects movements onto a low-dimensional space thereby helping to detect invariant properties of coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daffertshofer et al., 2004</xref>). Based on this approach, one law of inter-segmental coordination has been described in human locomotion, which involves the planar covariation of the temporal changes of the elevation angles of the lower limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borghese et al., 1996</xref>). Specifically, limb segment rotations covary so that the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the elevation angles lies close to a plane.</p><p>The findings pertaining to the planar law are very reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ivanenko et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ivanenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ivanenko et al., 2008</xref>) and have been replicated in several laboratories (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hicheur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Noble and Prentice, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barliya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barliya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hallemans and Aerts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maclellan and McFadyen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leurs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aprigliano et al., 2016</xref>). A planar law applies to both walking and running, as well as to other gait modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grasso et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ivanenko et al., 2007</xref>). It distinguishes between different developmental stages of human walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheron et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheron et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ivanenko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dominici et al., 2011</xref>), as well as between normal and pathological gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grasso et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Laroche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leurs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Degelaen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cappellini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wallard et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, it has been shown that the planar covariation in humans is not a trivial consequence of the geometrical and kinematic relationships between different limb segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ivanenko et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, newly walking toddlers lack an adult-like limb segment planar covariation, and children acquire it with walking experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheron et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dominici et al., 2010</xref>). In adults, the planar covariation can be violated in some conditions (e.g. when stooping and grasping an object during walking) or can collapse in a simple linear relationship in other conditions (e.g. during stepping in place, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ivanenko et al., 2008</xref>). Also, spinal cord injured patients often lack the planar covariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grasso et al., 2004a</xref>).</p><p>The functional relevance of the synergic control of segmental motions lies in a reduction of the degrees of angular motion to two, thus matching the degrees of freedom of linear motion of the COM in the sagittal plane. In fact, a significant correlation has been found between the specific orientation of the plane, or equivalently the phase shift between the angular motion at the shank and foot, and the net mechanical power output at the COM at different speeds of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 1998b</xref>). A consistent reduction of the degrees of angular motion has also been observed when additional segments are included in a principal component analysis of motion in the sagittal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mah et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borghese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daffertshofer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dewolf et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>How general across animal species is the planar law of intersegmental coordination? Does it happen to be a basic principle of terrestrial locomotion? One might expect this to be the case, given the potential connection linking the neuromuscular control patterns, the kinematic synergy, and energy saving at the COM. Initial evidence for the application of the planar law beyond the human species comes from the observation of a similar law in bipedal walking of Japanese macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ogihara et al., 2012</xref>) and common quails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ogihara et al., 2014</xref>), as well as in quadrupedal walking Rhesus monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courtine et al., 2005</xref>), dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>) and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shen and Poppele, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lacquaniti et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>However, apart from the above-mentioned studies, the planar law has received little attention so far in the context of comparative studies of animal locomotion. Our aim here was to look into the synergic control of segmental motions during terrestrial walking in a large set of mammals and birds. It is worth stressing that considering the large variety of body size, posture, limb configuration and segment proportions, one might not expect the same inter-segmental coordination across different animal species. Using a computational approach similar to that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatesy and Pollard (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> illustrates the examples of permissible combinations of elevation angles assuming a fixed endpoint and constant hip (or shoulder) height during stance (Notice that the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> do not change substantially if one relaxes the constraint of a constant hip (or shoulder) height during stance, since the vertical excursion of these proximal joints is relatively small during walking. Thus, the vertical oscillations due to the pendulum-like behavior of the limb during stance are 9.6±3.8% [mean±SD across all animals] of HL length for hip height, while the corresponding oscillations of shoulder height are 11.4±4.3% of FL length). Notice that the potential range of segment motions varies substantially across animals. For instance, the segment that can rotate the most is the foot for the mandrill while it is the shank for the avocet (see the relative size and shape of the ellipsoids in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the height of the hip (or shoulder) above ground and the limb segment proportions impose very different constraints on the range of angular motion across animals. Furthermore, the same planar covariation law may not apply to the forelimb (FL) angles and to the hindlimb (HL) angles of the same animal, nor may it apply to different animals. For instance, transfer of FL angles to HL angles in the cheetah results in aberrant trunk deformations, while transfer of HL angles of the camel to HL angles of the flamingo fails to predict a realistic hip height of the ipsilateral and contralateral limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38190.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interspecific comparison of angular movements during walking using a tri-segmented limb model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Potential range of angular segment motion for representative animals of different orders during stance assuming a fixed endpoint and constant hip (or shoulder) height (using a similar computation as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatesy and Pollard, 2011</xref>).

Next, we identify each species with a serial number and the first three letters of the corresponding taxonomic order, we report the number of analyzed animals, the typical body weight of adults (data from the literature), the mean speed for the recorded strides, the approximate dimensionless speed (Froude number, Fr), and the total number of analyzed strides for hindlimbs and forelimbs. For humans, we recorded both overground walking in one subject and treadmill walking (at 5 km/hr) in five subjects (data pooled together). For mice, video recordings were used from a previously published study (Movie S1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akay et al., 2014</xref>), while the kinematic data of the six mammals marked by asterisks are derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al. (2002)</xref>. In the latter case, the number of averaged strides varied: at least 15, but up to 300 step cycles were averaged.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"

Indeed, the elevation angles identify the orientation of each segment relative to the direction of gravity (vertical direction). Moreover, the time course of the anatomical angles of flexion-extension in human locomotion is more variable across subjects and trials than that of the elevation angles, and the planarity of the anatomical angles trajectories is weaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borghese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barliya et al., 2009</xref>). In our recorded animals, when we applied the PCA to the anatomical angles (hip, knee and ankle for HL, and shoulder, elbow and wrist for FL), the planarity indexes (PV<sub>3</sub>) were: 2.7 ± 2.3% for HL angles (ranging from 0.02% in guinea fowl to 8.0% in porcupine) and 4.0 ± 2.5% for FL angles (ranging from 0.7% in ox to 13.9% in porcupine). Therefore, although also the anatomical angles trajectories tend to be constrained close to one plane, the planar coordination of the elevation angles is stronger and less variable, in agreement with what was previously reported for human walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borghese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barliya et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the shape of the 3D trajectories generated by the three elevation angular waveforms differed across animals and limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

There were also differences in the temporal sequence of minima of elevation angles between the limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Even though the timing of minima for all segments occurred roughly around the stance-to-swing transition (since the relative stance duration was about 70% cycle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), the sequence of minima differed for HL and FL. For instance, one can notice that the distal segment (hand) of FL was the last to initiate the swing phase in contrast to the distal segment (foot) of HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, we reported the parameters of the inter-segmental coordination in all animal species. To obtain a general template of HL and FL angular motions for each animal species, we averaged limb segment elevation angles across strides. However, some inter-stride variability in the orientation of the covariation plane and timing of the minima of elevation angles exists. Also, there were some limitations of our measurements (e.g. due to some variability in the walking speed across strides). Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the key differences across limbs and species can be accounted for or masked by inter-stride variability. We quantified the inter-stride variability in the animal species in which we recorded more than 15 strides, namely: dog, donkey and human (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). First, the correlation between the averaged limb segment elevation angles and those of individual strides was high (on average r = 0.98, range 0.7-1, the data for all segments and animals being pooled together), consistent with repeatable kinematic data across steps in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Second, the sequence of timing of minima of elevation angles showed systematic features as well. For instance, the distal segment (hand) of FL always followed the lower arm segment (Δ<sub>hand-lower arm</sub> being positive in all strides), in contrast to the distal (foot) segment of HL (Δ<sub>foot-shank</sub> varied but was generally negative). Finally, the inter-stride and inter-individual variability in the orientation of the covariation plane (<italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic> vector) was relatively small in comparison with the differences across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For instance, the angular standard deviation of the parameter <italic>α</italic> (the angle of rotation of <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic>) across strides was 11° in dogs, 12° in donkeys and 6° in humans (the strides of all animals for each animal species being pooled together), and across animals it was 6° in dogs (n = 6), and 5° in humans (n = 6), while the differences in <italic>α</italic> across animal species were much larger (~180°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined limb kinematics during terrestrial locomotion of 54 different animal species.

Even though different recording systems were used in these previous studies, the planarity index (PV<sub>3</sub> ~1–3%) and the orientation of the covariation plane (<italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic> vector) for the bird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ogihara et al., 2014</xref>), human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi et al., 1998a</xref>) and dog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>) were similar to those reported in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), confirming the reliability of our kinematic recordings and suggesting that each animal adopted its own pattern of the inter-segmental coordination.</p><p>Since we recorded animals walking at their preferred speeds, some variability in the covariation plane orientation may be caused by variations in speed across strides. However, it is unlikely the relative invariance in the orientation at the forelimbs (which in theory might parallel changes in speed) and in the sequence of timing of minima of elevation angles suggests that the key differences across the limbs and species is accounted for or masked by inter-stride variability, consistent with repeatable kinematic data across steps in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Also, we verified the inter-individual variability in a few species (dogs and humans, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and the angular standard deviation in the covariation plane orientation (~5–6°) was much smaller than the differences in <italic>α</italic> (the angle of rotation of <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic>) across all animal species (~180°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are representative for each animal species. One should also consider that the effect of speed may be animal- or gait-dependent. For instance, in human bipedal walking there is some rotation (although relatively small) of the covariation plane with speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi et al., 1998a</xref>), while in human crawling the orientation of the covariation plane does not depend on speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">MacLellan et al., 2017</xref>). To obtain a general template of limb segment motion of animals walking at their preferred speeds, we analyzed averaged angles (as in other previous studies, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). Further studies may reveal a nuanced dependence of planar covariation parameters on walking speed or gait in different animals.</p><p>Specific limb proportions may play an essential role in the kinematics and energetics of walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Leurs et al., 2011</xref>), and they have an impact on a locomotor body schema used for controlling step length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ivanenko et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, in humans elongation of the shank segment relative to the thigh segment (either surgically or using specially designed stilts) affects the amplitude of distal vs. proximal segment oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dominici et al., 2009</xref>) and the optimal step length and walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Leurs et al., 2011</xref>). In line of principle, species with different limb proportions are free to employ identical angular movements, but there are biomechanical constraints of the articulated chains on the end effector positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gatesy and Pollard, 2011</xref>) and on the possibility of transferring angular changes between disproportionate limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). Limb segment proportions varied significantly across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For instance, the L<sub>shank</sub>/L<sub>foot</sub> and L<sub>thigh</sub>/L<sub>foot</sub> ratios showed 10-fold differences in our sample of animals (range 0.5–5). Therefore, it is important to stress that the planar covariation holds for animals with very different limb segment configurations.</p><p>While biomechanics contributes to the planar law of inter-segmental coordination (e.g. we found that the <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic> vector rotation correlated with L<sub>shank</sub>/L<sub>foot</sub> and L<sub>thigh</sub>/L<sub>foot</sub>), the orientation of the covariation plane reflects specific phase relationships in the control of segment motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacquaniti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ivanenko et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, birds form a group of animals with a compact orientation of the <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic> vector close to the thigh axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ogihara et al., 2014</xref>) while primates show rather variable <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic> orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, birds show characteristically wide gait loops, while for other animals the loops are much narrower for HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, for quadrupedal animals, the orientation of the covariation plane is noticeably different for HL and FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>The latter finding represents a particularly interesting phenomenon that may shed further light on the functional difference between the limbs and their control. HL and FL kinematics are characterized by limb-specific differences in the orientation of the covariation plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), the width of the gait loop (the FL<sub>low</sub> loop was wider than the HL loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) of angular motion of distal segments. These results confirm previous observations about different orientation of the HL and FL covariation planes in Rhesus monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Courtine et al., 2005</xref>), dog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>) and human crawling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">MacLellan et al., 2017</xref>), and point to the differential control of FL and HL segments in a wide range of mammals. The distinctive orientation of FL and HL segments (the elbow is facing posteriorly and the knee joint anteriorly), a stronger push-off function of HL (e.g. during jumping), and the differences in the leading segment (as assessed by temporal sequence of minima in the elevation angles around the stance-to-swing transition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) may impose specific phase-relationships of FL and HL segment oscillations. Finally, neurophysiological differences in the neurotransmitter systems of FL versus HL spinal locomotor controllers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gerasimenko et al., 2009</xref>), a strong asymmetry of projections from spinal controllers on neurons for FL versus HL areas of the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zelenin et al., 2011</xref>), and limb-specific features in the organization and coupling between FL and HL spinal controllers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shik and Orlovsky, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Miller et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamaguchi, 1986</xref>) point to limb-specific organization of central pattern generators, with propriospinal linkages facilitating the coordination between FL and HL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frigon, 2017</xref>). The temporal structure of FL and HL muscle activation patterns is limb-specific too, as is the orientation of the covariation plane (e.g. in the dog, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the orientation of the covariation plane (normal to the plane, <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic>) varies more for HL than for FL across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This finding is also compatible with larger kinematic changes in HL movements reported in previous studies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al. (2002)</xref> reported variable lift-off configuration of HL with respect to FL, when comparing different gaits of the same animal. Thus, main kinematic adaptations seem to occur in hindlimbs rather than in forelimbs both across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and across gaits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al., 2002</xref>). This implies considerable adaptability or flexibility in the phase relationships of HL segment motion, which will be considered in the following section.</p><p>We also searched for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in the scatter of <italic>α</italic>-values of rotation for HL across animal species, and we found only a weak one. Indeed, the <italic>α</italic>-values of close relatives were not more similar between each other than to the values of distant ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the planar covariation is a feature that has arisen independently several times during evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ogihara et al., 2014</xref>). A convergent evolution of this kinematic synergy may be due to both adaptation and constraints acting similarly in distantly related species. Adaptation would arise due to the advantage of a kinematic control law lying at the interface between neural commands and environment. Constraints would depend on the inherent biomechanical coupling between different limb segments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phase relationships and functional interpretation of principal components</title><p>The planar covariation law may emerge from the coupling of neural oscillators with limb mechanical oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacquaniti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lacquaniti et al., 2012</xref>), by adjusting the phase of unit burst generators for each joint, segment or groups of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grillner, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kiehn, 2016</xref>). The basic mechanism of rhythmic movements is a phase control of muscle activity. In particular, myoelectric signal analysis demonstrated a burst-like temporal organization of basic muscle activation patterns shared by many animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giszter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dominici et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lacquaniti et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the existence of a rhythm-generating layer or ‘time-keeping function’ of the central pattern generator for locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prentice et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McCrea and Rybak, 2008</xref>). Because the activation patterns are pulsatile, muscle activations intervene only during limited time epochs at specific phases of the gait cycle to re-excite the intrinsic oscillations of the system when energy is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lacquaniti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lacquaniti et al., 2012</xref>). This represents a fundamental energy-saving principle of control.</p><p>The dynamic behavior of the musculo-skeletal system can be modeled through a linear combination of these basic muscle patterns, activated sequentially at touch-down, body-weight support, limb lift-off, and swing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lacquaniti et al., 2012</xref>). The specific orientation of the planar covariation is related to the timing of basic muscle activation patterns. In humans, changes in the orientation of the covariation plane with walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 1998b</xref>) or across different gaits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ivanenko et al., 2007</xref>) are associated with changes in the timing of basic muscle activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ivanenko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cappellini et al., 2006</xref>). In dogs, the phase-coupling between the elevation angles differs systematically between HL and FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), just as the phase-coupling of the muscle activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, although it is often assumed that central pattern generators control patterns of muscle activity, an equally plausible hypothesis is that they control patterns of limb segment motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lacquaniti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacquaniti et al., 2002</xref>), since the phase relationships between them are inherently inter-related.</p><p>The full limb behavior can be expressed as the two degrees-of-freedom planar motion for each animal, plus the rotation of the plane about a defined axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ivanenko et al., 2007</xref>). An analytical formulation of the law of inter-segmental coordination in human walking was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barliya et al.

We found the highest correlation between the rotation of the covariation plane (<italic>α</italic>-angle) and Δ<sub>foot-shank</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

This kinematic synergy lies at the interface between two highly conserved phenomena in animal locomotion, the neural command signals output by central pattern generators on the one hand, and the mechanics of the body COM. The kinematic synergy may therefore represent one specific neuromechanical principle of control of the instantaneous position of the COM, thus contributing to net mechanical energy savings. Our study was exploratory (although extremely laborious, see Materials and methods), since our results were mainly obtained under natural conditions rather than the controlled conditions of a laboratory. Nevertheless, the results we found are grounds for further, more systematic investigations into why the principle of planar covariation might be conserved across animal species.</p><p>The present findings suggest a modular control organization whereby appropriate coordination of the limb segments for each animal can be reduced to two independent components. The orientation of the covariation plane remarkably differed between HL and FL and between animals, especially for HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The major changes in HL plane across animals were associated with the second PC related to the limb length covariation (<italic>u<sub>2</sub></italic> vector, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), probably reflecting different distribution of stiffness and phase control of oscillations and thus the relative rotation of limb segments. Specific limb segment phase relationships are likely advantageous for each individual animal species, and might be the result of evolution. For instance, birds master flight techniques, perform take-off and landing manoeuvres, and accordingly they could adopt a specific yielding kinematic synergy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The analyses were performed using custom-made algorithms implemented in Matlab. The kinematic data were low-pass filtered using a zero-lag, fourth-order dual-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff of 10 Hz. Next, we applied a custom model-based algorithm that uses the average segment length over all frames in each trial, and optimizes the locations of joint centres by constraining the changes in the limb segments lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sensitivity analysis of the markerless approach</title><p>Since we recorded animal walking under natural conditions and we included animals that are usually difficult to train and work with (e.g. lion, cougar, tiger) or have very large sizes (e.g. ostrich, addax, giraffe, elephant, hippopotamus), we could only apply the markerless approach to reconstruct the kinematic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>). We previously verified that this approach yields reliable results in the assessment of phase relationships between limb segment angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>). In this previous study, we compared the results of the kinematic analysis of canine locomotion obtained from a video camera with those obtained with a high-performance 3D motion-capture system (SIMI Motion system, Unterschleissheim, Germany, sampling rate 100 Hz), and we found very similar characteristics of the inter-segmental coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we compared the results in five species (goose, pigeon, guinea fowl, elephant, and cat) with published data on elevation angles in the same or related species walking at comparable speeds.

We scanned the graphs of limb segment elevation angles published in these reports, digitized them manually and time-interpolated to fit a normalized 100 points time base for the analysis of the inter-segmental coordination. We found a good agreement between our results and those obtained in related species in the previous publications. Thus, on average the root mean square (RMS) difference between the angular waveforms of our study and the corresponding ones of the previous studies was 5.5 ± 3.1°, and the average correlation coefficient between angular waveforms was 0.94 (obtained by pooling all segments and all steps together. Furthermore, the orientation of the covariation plane derived from both sets of studies was almost identical: the angular difference between u<sub>3</sub> vectors was on average 0.7° for HL and 0.5° for FL<sub>low</sub>.</p><p>In addition, in the present study, we compared the results obtained from the video camera recordings of the human subject in the laboratory with those reported in the literature.

To this end, we asked another researcher, very experienced in tracking kinematic data but unaware of the details of the present study, to track the videos of the avocet, camel, cheetah, gibbon and Sika deer. The mean RMS difference between the angular waveforms obtained by the two persons was 3 ± 3° and the mean correlation coefficient was 0.99 (all elevation angles and all strides being pooled together). The corresponding difference in the orientation of the covariance plane (<italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic>) obtained by the two persons was low: on average 0.8° for HL, 2.0° for FL<sub>upp</sub> and 2.5° for FL<sub>low</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>General gait parameters</title><p>The general model of the HL and FL segments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> (left panels). Whole limb and trunk orientations were defined from the HIP-HEP (HL), SCA-FEP (FL) and SCA-HIP (trunk) segments. The hindlimb was modeled as the multi-segmented limb from HIP to HEP, consisting of the thigh, shank, foot and toes segments, while the forelimb (from SCA to FEP) included the scapula, upper arm, lower arm, hand, and finger segments. Whole limb and limb segment elevation angles relative to the vertical were calculated and analyzed, angles being positive when the distal marker was located anterior to the proximal marker. Mean trunk inclination was defined as the mean angle between the trunk and the horizontal reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>The gait cycle for each limb was defined as the time-interval between two successive maxima of the limb orientation waveform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>). The stance phase (when the foot was on the ground) corresponded to the time window between the maximum and the following minimum of the limb orientation waveform. We considered the gait cycle defined by the ipsilateral HL and FL (facing the camera). The contralateral HL and FL endpoints were used only to characterize the interlimb coordination (diagonality of gait). The quadrupedal gait (inter-limb coupling) can be characterized by the footfall sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hildebrand, 1976</xref>). To this end, the phase lag was computed as the relative timing (t<sub>FL</sub>, t<sub>FLcontr</sub>) of the FL cycle onset with respect to HL, and expressed as a percentage of the gait cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The lateral gait is determined when the HL touchdown is followed by the ipsilateral FL touchdown, whereas in the diagonal sequence it is followed by the contralateral FL touchdown.</p><p>Limb endpoint excursion was determined separately for fore-aft and up-down (relative to the body) movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

We also assessed the dimensionless walking speed (Froude number, <italic>Fr</italic>), which is suitable for the comparison of the speed of locomotion in animals of very different size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander, 1989</xref>).

However, the scapula segment also undergoes significant rotations in the sagittal plane in most mammalian groups during locomotion. Accordingly, the tri-segmented model for HL included thigh (HIP-KNE), shank (KNE-ANK) and foot (ANK-MT) interconnected segments, while for FL we used two tri-segmental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fischer and Blickhan, 2006</xref>): 1) FL<sub>upp</sub> – scapula (SCA-SHO), upper arm (SHO-ELB), and lower arm (ELB-WRI), and 2) FL<sub>low</sub> – upper arm, lower arm, and hand (WRI-MC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Inter-segmental coordination</title><p>Our study was mainly focused on a general locomotor pattern in various species.

Nevertheless, even though the kinematic data tend to be repeatable across consecutive strides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Faber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), we also report the inter-stride variability for a few animal species, in which we recorded more than 15 strides (dog, donkey, human, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The inter-segmental coordination of the elevation angles of HL and FL segments was evaluated in position space using principal component analysis (PCA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borghese et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ivanenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catavitello et al., 2015</xref>).

The degree of alignment of the samples of <italic>u<sub>3</sub></italic> vectors was assessed by the concentration parameter <italic>k</italic>, which is a measure of the concentration of the sample about the mean direction (the higher is <italic>k</italic>, the more clustered the data), which we used to distinguish the population mean directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsagris et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phylogenetic considerations of kinematic traits</title><p>We also added an analysis of kinematic traits taking into account a consideration of the data variation in an evolutionary context. In this context, species are not independent data points. Indeed, closely related species derive from a common ancestor and should be weighted more than distant species, since they share common characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garland et al., 2005</xref>). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the orientation of the covariance plane for the HL (<italic>α</italic> angle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and its correlation with the phase shifts between limb segment movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). If traits under consideration of closely related species have similar values while the similarity decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance, one can infer the presence of a high phylogenetic signal of the trait. Vice versa, a weak phylogenetic signal corresponds to the situation when close relatives are not more similar on average than distant relatives. The latter may happen in the presence of a convergent evolution or when the traits are randomly distributed across a phylogeny.</p><p>We reconstructed a taxonomic tree with the data stored in the NCBI Taxonomy Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi</ext-link>). We used the Brownian motion model (random walk in continuous time) to estimate trait evolution: modifications of the trait value through time occur gradually and they are independent of the current state. At the tips of the phylogenetic tree, the expected covariance between trait values of the species is proportional to their common history. The history of each tip, that is species, is computed as the sum of their branch length. Then, a phylogeny can be represented as an <italic>n x n</italic> phylogenetic variance–covariance matrix, where <italic>n</italic> is the number of species in the phylogeny. The diagonals of the matrix correspond to the total length of the tree and they represent the species variances, while the off-diagonal elements are computed as the sum of their shared branch lengths and are the covariances between species pairs. We computed the branch lengths with the function ‘compute.brlen’ in the ‘phytools’ R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Revell, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We computed Blomberg’s K that measures phylogenetic signal by quantifying the amount of observed trait variance relative to the trait variance expected under Brownian motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blomberg et al., 2003</xref>). K is the ratio of the mean squared error of the tip data in relation to the phylogenetic mean of the data divided by the mean squared error extracted from a generalized least-squares model (PGLS, Phylogenetic Generalized Least-Squares) that uses the phylogenetic variance–covariance matrix in its error structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kamilar and Cooper, 2013</xref>). K can vary continuously from zero, indicating that there is no phylogenetic signal in the trait (i.e. the trait has evolved independently of phylogeny), to infinity. K = 1 indicates that there is strong phylogenetic signal and the trait has evolved according to the Brownian motion model of evolution, while K &gt; 1 indicates that close relatives are more similar than expected under a Brownian motion model of trait.</p><p>We performed the evolutionary phylogenetic correlation by fitting a linear module using PGLS. The correlations were computed using the ‘phytools’ and ‘geiger’ R packages. The ancestral states estimation was computed assuming Brownian motion, using the functions ‘fastAnc’ and ‘plotSimmap’ in the ‘phytools’ R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Revell, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Matlab and R software. Descriptive statistics included the calculation of the mean values and standard deviations. For each species, the parameters were first averaged across gait cycles and then across animals for the same species before subsequent analyses. The general gait parameters (trunk orientation, stride and stance duration, inter-limb coupling, Froude number and endpoint excursions) were not computed for animals marked by an asterisk in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> (since this information was not provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fischer et al. (2002)</xref>), so we performed statistics on these parameters for a smaller number of animals (n = 48) as compared with the analysis of the inter-segmental coordination (n = 54). To assess some general kinematic parameters, paired t-tests were used to evaluate differences between HL and FL in quadrupeds, while unpaired t-tests were used to assess differences between the groups of animals when appropriate (e.g. birds vs. mammals HL or FL). Statistical analysis of spherical data was used to characterize the mean orientation of the normal to the covariation plane. In spherical statistics, we distinguished the girdle distribution from the clustered distribution of the eigenvectors with the empirical shape criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fisher et al., 1993</xref>). Multi-way ANOVA and high concentration parameters test for spherical data were carried out with the R package built for directional statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsagris et al., 2017</xref>). A linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between limb parameters and rotation of the covariation plane. The correlation coefficients were Z-transformed before the statistical analysis. Reported results are considered statistically significant for p&lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data availability</title><p>We provided Source Data files for figures.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald L Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Raeed Chowdhury (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a kinematic analysis of 54 different species (10 birds and 44 mammals including man) performing free walking locomotion. The different animals present large differences in body size, mass (ranging from 0.030 Kg to 4,000 Kg), limb configuration, and amplitude of angular movements. Despite these differences, PCA analysis of covariation of the temporal changes of the elevation angles of the limbs during both stance and swing shows that ~95% or more of the variance is explained by two principal components so that covariation is coplanar in the three dimensional space of joint angles. In the Discussion section, the authors argue quite convincingly from simple modeling that these two components correspond to whole limb orientation changes and changes in limb length respectively. They also argue that the orientation of the covariation plane differed according to different phase relationships between elevation angles, and the third principal component of the covariation matrix being orthogonal to the best fitting plane characterizes its orientation. This orientation is correlated with the phase shift Δ<sub>foot-shank</sub>. The phase tuning of the planar covariation is relatively constant across mammals (tetrapods) at the forelimbs, whereas the phase at the hind limbs varies greatly across species, consistent with biomechanical and functional differences of the distal segments. Because this kinematic synergy lies at the interface between the motor pattern produced by locomotor pattern generators, the mechanics of the body center of mass and the external environment, it may represent one neuromechanical principle conserved in evolution to contribute saving mechanical energy.</p><p>The paper is clearly written and is nicely illustrated. It contains a wealth of comparative data, and its comprehensive comparative analyses and elegant conclusions, combined with this rich data set, assures that it will be of wide interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Chief among concerns is that the authors are performing so many statistical tests (correlations) on features of the data that it seems obvious that some of the tests will result in significant correlations. A typical defense against these potential false positives is to limit the number of tests and present only those driven by hypotheses based on physiological principles (or pilot data). However, that's not necessary in an exploratory study like this, where the goal is to find signs for conserved principles of gait across species. Instead, the authors should acknowledge in the discussion the exploratory nature of this study, focusing on the fact that the correlations found are grounds for further investigation into why these principles might be conserved, rather than a true set of rules for terrestrial gait.</p><p>2) Introduction: We are not convinced that the covariation plane implies that the limb length and orientation are being specifically controlled. On the subject of limb endpoint being encoded in the dorsal spinocerebellar tract, one recently published paper (Chowdhury, Tresch and Miller, 2017) suggests that the endpoint tuning described by Bosco and Poppele, (2001) can actually be a simple consequence of the musculoskeletal geometry of the hindlimb. Other studies in motor control of reaching suggest that neurons that look like they encode endpoint kinematics can be explained by the biomechanics of the limb (Lillicrap and Scott, 2013). This paragraph doesn't seem to be crucial to the manuscript and should be deleted or reframed to take into account the cited literature.</p><p>3) Although the literature typically uses the angle of each segment to a vertical line, but we wonder what these results would look like if the analyses were performed by using the actual joint angles, i.e. the angle between a segment and its neighbor. The results might be similar to those already described, but it would find it very useful for the manuscript to at least briefly describe what those results look like.</p><p>4 Add a consideration of size and phylogeny to the analysis, which might reveal novel patterns to help us understand the proposed conserved nature of neuromechanical control? See Revell, 2009. The careful consideration of the variation in an evolutionary context might reveal hints at control similar to the way that development and pathologies have tested the control law. Moreover, it is generally accepted that phylogenetic controls help avoid phylogenetic pseudoreplication (the exaggeration of the statistical significance of a set of measurements resulting from treating species data as independent observations when they are in fact interdependent because of their evolutionary history). Phylogenetic corrections can significantly change the view of relationships among diverse species (Garland, Bennett and Rezende, 2005). Put simply, many closely related species should be weighted more as a single data point, so as to not over-represent their statistical significance.</p><p>In the present data, the assumption of independent evolution of all species might not change the results, given the relatively small variation. Ogihara et al., (2104) have previously concluded that, &quot;The planar covariation of inter-segmental coordination has evolved independently in both avian and human locomotion, despite the different mechanical constraints&quot;.</p><p>5 The Introduction is very clear except on one point. The third paragraph attempts to present planar covariation succinctly, but I believe this is not enough for a general reader or even one like myself who follows the motor pattern generation literature. Please indicate what is meant more precisely by planar covariation, perhaps even referring to PCA and the 3D space of joint angles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>- Subsection “Planar covariation of limb segment elevation angles”: The orientation of the covariance plane depends entirely on how you orient your axes. In the figure, the scapula is the up/down axis for the upper forelimb, but the hand is the up/down axis for the lower forelimb, and it's unclear why those particular orientations are chosen.</p><p>- Subsection “Planar covariation of limb segment elevation angles”: I would have liked to see an explanation of why the forelimb was separated into two separate models, when PCA could have worked equally well in four dimensions. My assumed explanation is that this makes it easier to compare the synergies between forelimb and hindlimb, but I don't think this (or any other reasoning) was in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38190.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a kinematic analysis of 54 different species (10 birds and 44 mammals including man) performing free walking locomotion.

On the subject of limb endpoint being encoded in the dorsal spinocerebellar tract, one recently published paper (Chowdhury, Tresch and Miller, 2017) suggests that the endpoint tuning described by Bosco and Poppele, (2001) can actually be a simple consequence of the musculoskeletal geometry of the hindlimb.

This issue needs further investigations. Even though the biomechanics of the limb and musculoskeletal geometry contribute to the endpoint tuning, the CNS should take these geometrical considerations into account for the control of foot trajectory and limb movements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the literature typically uses the angle of each segment to a vertical line, but we wonder what these results would look like if the analyses were performed by using the actual joint angles, i.e. the angle between a segment and its neighbor. The results might be similar to those already described, but it would find it very useful for the manuscript to at least briefly describe what those results look like.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the planar covariation also for the relative joint angles.</p><p>We added to the Results section:</p><p>“We examined mainly the intersegmental coordination of the elevation angles, rather than that of the relative joint angles (so called anatomical angles), because the former capture the overall limb configuration in external space. Indeed, the elevation angles identify the orientation of each segment relative to the direction of gravity (vertical direction). Moreover, the time course of the anatomical angles of flexion-extension in human locomotion is more variable across subjects and trials than that of the elevation angles, and the planarity of the anatomical angles trajectories is weaker (Borghese et al. 1996; Barliya et al. 2009).In our recorded animals, when we applied the PCA to the anatomical angles (hip, knee and ankle for HL, and shoulder, elbow and wrist for FL), the planarity indexes (PV3) were: 2.7 ± 2.3% for HL angles (ranging from 0.02% in guinea fowl to 8.0% in porcupine) and 4.0 ± 2.5% for FL angles (ranging from 0.7% in ox to 13.9% in porcupine). Therefore, although also the anatomical angles trajectories tend to be constrained close to one plane, the planar coordination of the elevation angles is stronger and less variable, in agreement with what was previously reported for human walking (Borghese et al. 1996; Barliya et al. 2009).”</p><p>and to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Our main analysis was focused on the elevation angles that capture directly the limb configuration in external space. However, we also report the results of the PCA applied to the relative (anatomical) angles of the hip, knee and ankle for HL, and shoulder, elbow and wrist for FL.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 Add a consideration of size and phylogeny to the analysis, which might reveal novel patterns to help us understand the proposed conserved nature of neuromechanical control.?

Although the K index (Blomberg et al., 2003, see Materials and methods section) we used for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in the α-angle for HL was statistically significant, its value was rather low (K=0.10, n=54, p=0.04) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), suggesting that the pattern of α-angles distribution is hardly dependent on phylogenetic relatedness of the species considered. Such a pattern may occur when close relatives are less similar than distant ones.”</p><p>Also subsection “Relationship between limb parameters and rotation of the covariation plane”:</p><p>“After controlling for a potential phylogenetic signal in the response (and, hence, non-independence of the residuals, see Materials and methods), we found that the α-angle remained significantly correlated with Δ<sub>foot-shank</sub> (r<sup>2</sup>=0.37, p&lt;0.00001) and Δ<sub>upper arm-scapula</sub>(r<sup>2</sup>=0.31, p&lt;0.00001).”</p><p>and in the Discussion section:</p><p>“We also searched for the presence of a phylogenetic signal in the scatter of α-values of rotation for HL across animal species, and we found only a weak one. Indeed, the α-values of close relatives were not more similar between each other than to the values of distant ones (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This suggests that the planar covariation is a feature that has arisen independently several times during evolutionary history (Ogihara et al., 2014). A convergent evolution of this kinematic synergy may be due to both adaptation and constraints acting similarly in distantly related species. Adaptation would arise due to the advantage of a kinematic control law lying at the interface between neural commands and environment. Constraints would depend on the inherent biomechanical coupling between different limb segments.”</p><p>and in subsection “Phylogenetic considerations of kinematic traits”:</p><p>“We also added an analysis of kinematic traits taking into account a consideration of the data variation in an evolutionary context. In this context, species are not independent data points. Indeed, closely related species derive from a common ancestor and should be weighted more than distant species, since they share common characteristics (Garland et al. 2005). We performed a phylogenetic analysis of the orientation of the covariance plane for the HL (α angle, Figure 4A) and its correlation with the phase shifts between limb segment movements (Figure 5A). If traits under consideration of closely related species have similar values while the similarity decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance, one can infer the presence of a high phylogenetic signal of the trait. Vice versa, a weak phylogenetic signal corresponds to the situation when close relatives are not more similar on average than distant relatives. The latter may happen in the presence of a convergent evolution or when the traits are randomly distributed across a phylogeny.</p><p>[…]</p><p>We performed the evolutionary phylogenetic correlation by fitting a linear module using PGLS. The correlations were computed using the “phytools” and “geiger” R packages. The ancestral states estimation was computed assuming Brownian motion, using the functions “fastAnc” and “plotSimmap” in the “phytools” R package (Revell, 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 The Introduction is very clear except on one point. The third paragraph attempts to present planar covariation succinctly, but I believe this is not enough for a general reader or even one like myself who follows the motor pattern generation literature. Please indicate what is meant more precisely by planar covariation, perhaps even referring to PCA and the 3D space of joint angles.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we briefly introduced the PCA approach in the Introduction: “Kinematic coordination of limb segments can be described by statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), which projects movements onto a low-dimensional space thereby helping to detect invariant properties of coordination (Daffertshofer et al., 2004). Based on this approach, one law of inter-segmental coordination has been described in human locomotion, which involves the planar covariation of the temporal changes of the elevation angles of the lower limbs (Borghese et al., 1996). Specifically, limb segment rotations covary so that the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the elevation angles lies close to a plane.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>- Subsection “Planar covariation of limb segment elevation angles”: The orientation of the covariance plane depends entirely on how you orient your axes. In the figure, the scapula is the up/down axis for the upper forelimb, but the hand is the up/down axis for the lower forelimb, and it's unclear why those particular orientations are chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to this typo. We corrected the labels of Figure 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Subsection “Planar covariation of limb segment elevation angles”: I would have liked to see an explanation of why the forelimb was separated into two separate models, when PCA could have worked equally well in four dimensions. My assumed explanation is that this makes it easier to compare the synergies between forelimb and hindlimb, but I don't think this (or any other reasoning) was in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, indeed using a tri-segmented model makes it easier to compare the synergies between forelimb and hindlimb. As suggested, we added to the Results section:</p><p>“We used serially homologous HL and FL segments and models for comparing the kinematics of the HL and FL, starting from the distal segment: foot-hand, shank-lower arm, and thigh-upper arm. However, the scapula segment also undergoes significant rotations in the sagittal plane (Figure 2). While PCA can be applied also in 4 dimensions for FL, using a tri-segmental model makes it easier to compare the kinematic synergies between FL and HL. Therefore, for FL we used two separate tri-segmental models (Fischer and Blickhan 2006): FL<sub>low</sub> – 'upper arm–lower arm–hand’ and FL<sub>upp</sub> – ‘scapula–upper arm–lower arm’ (Figure 3A right panel).”</p><p>We also made a separate subsection: “Tri-segmented limb model”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
