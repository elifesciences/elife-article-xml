Here, we set up two quantitative delivery reporters to study cargo transfer between cells. We found that EVs are internalized by reporter cells but do not efficiently deliver functional Cas9 protein to the nucleus. In contrast, donor and acceptor cells co-cultured to permit cell contact resulted in a highly effective transfer. Among our tested donor and acceptor cell pairs, HEK293T and MDA-MB-231 recorded optimal intercellular transfer. Depolymerization of F-actin greatly decreased Cas9 transfer whereas inhibitors of endocytosis or knock-down of genes implicated in this process had little effect on transfer. Imaging results suggest that intercellular transfer of cargos occurred through open-ended membrane tubular connections. In contrast, cultures consisting only of HEK293T cells form close-ended tubular connections ineffective in cargo transfer. Depletion of human endogenous fusogens, syncytins, especially syncytin-2 in MDA-MB-231 cells, significantly reduced Cas9 transfer. Full-length mouse syncytin, but not truncated mutants, rescued the effect of depletion of human syncytins on Cas9 transfer. Mouse syncytin overexpression in HEK293T cells partially facilitated Cas9 transfer among HEK293T cells. These findings suggest that syncytin may serve as the fusogen responsible for the formation of an open-ended connection between cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative Genomics Institute, UC Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sergey Brin Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>Randy Schekman, Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic>.Randy Schekman, founding Editor-in-Chief, eLife..</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The other authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file.
