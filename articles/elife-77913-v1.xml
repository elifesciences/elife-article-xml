The difference was too large to be explained by random population differentiation, and is thus suggestive of local adaptation, a notion that is further supported by substantial transcriptome and metabolome changes in northern accessions.

These strategies have evolved to maximize fitness, but are constrained by trade-offs between components such as growth, survival, and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lande, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stearns, 1992</xref>). While most life history studies investigate differences between species, there is also variation found within species, including in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, where life history variation has been linked to climate parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estarague et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasseur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sartori et al., 2019</xref>). Less clear is how trade-offs are shaping this variation. In this article, we consider vegetative growth, a key component of life history, and use transcriptome and metabolome data to help explore potential trade-offs. We did this specifically in cold temperatures meant to simulate natural conditions in the northern regions of the species distribution.</p><p>Local adaptation studies in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have found important roles for life history traits such as seed dormancy and flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takou et al., 2019</xref>). Temperature is a major regulator of these traits and local populations are adapted to their local climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martínez-Berdeja et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simpson and Dean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hepworth et al., 2018</xref>). Plant growth is also affected by temperature, and previous studies have detected genetic variation underlying growth-related traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bac-Molenaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchadier et al., 2019</xref>), as well as signals of polygenic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wieters et al., 2021</xref>). How vegetative growth is adapted to local temperatures remains unclear, however.</p><p>Growth can be seen as the end sum of a vast number of physiological processes. All of these are genetically determined but can also be heavily influenced by environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bac-Molenaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fritz et al., 2018</xref>). Growth is therefore not only genetically a complex trait but also enormously plastic. The most straightforward environmental effect is when conditions are so adverse that growth reaches a physiological limit, making it impossible for the plant to grow any further. This is called ‘passive plasticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forsman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Kleunen and Fischer, 2005</xref>). Yet, when survival is at stake, it may also be in the interest of the plant to actively inhibit growth upon deteriorating environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Claeys and Inzé, 2013</xref>), called ‘active plasticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forsman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Kleunen and Fischer, 2005</xref>). Since vegetative growth ultimately determines photosynthetic surface and thus energy input that can be invested in the next generation, it is directly related to fitness, and is typically in trade-off with survival. Allocation of resources towards either growth or survival is thus an important balance to keep, and plants are expected to be adapted to constantly perceiving and responding to specific environmental changes as cues for looming adverse conditions.</p><p>Cold acclimation is a well-studied mechanism in plants, in which decreasing temperatures induce freezing tolerance in preparation for winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thomashow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes and Dunn, 1996</xref>). This temperature response is typically studied at 4°C, but has been observed in temperatures up to 12°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bond et al., 2011</xref>). The increased freezing tolerance is accomplished by changing membrane composition, producing cryoprotective polypeptides such as COR15A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Artus et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steponkus et al., 1998</xref>) and accumulating compatible solutes with cryoprotective properties such as raffinose, sucrose, and proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nanjo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilmour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taji et al., 2002</xref>). Main regulators of cold acclimation are CBF1/DREB1b, CBF2/DREB1c, and CBF3/DREB1a, three AP2/ERF transcription factors, for which allelic variation in CBF2 has been linked to natural variation in freezing tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oakley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2005</xref>). Nothing is known, however, about whether natural variation in freezing tolerance regulation also influences a trade-off with growth responses to cold temperatures.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of growth in adaptation to cold temperatures by comparing vegetative growth of 249 accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) grown in daily maximum temperatures of 16 and 6°C for a period of 3 weeks following seedling establishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rosette growth of each plant was measured twice a day during temperature treatments using automated phenotyping. The experiment generated rosette growth estimates at a high temporal resolution in two ecologically realistic temperature conditions in a wide set of accessions, allowing us to look for patterns of local adaptation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Geographic origin of the 249 accessions.</title><p>Map color shows winter temperature (mean temperature of coldest quarter).

These data were used to model plant growth and estimate growth parameters for further analysis. Unlimited growth should be exponential, but plant growth is known to slow down with increasing size, and therefore a power-law function, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is typically a better fit than a pure exponential function (for which <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> — in the equation, <italic>M</italic> is the size, <italic>r</italic> is the growth rate, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is a scaling factor that allows rate of size increase to change with size). Growth according to a power-law function typically describes early stages of plant growth especially well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paine et al., 2012</xref>), and our rosette size measurements were no exception (see ‘Materials and methods’). To calculate the rosette size from a power-law function at a given time point, only three parameters are required: the initial size (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, growth rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.

We used a nonlinear mixed model to obtain estimates for the initial size, growth rates, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Accession was added as fixed effect for initial size and growth rate, temperature and accession × temperature interactions were added as fixed effects for growth rate only. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was considered to be constant over accessions and temperatures. The ‘temperature response’ of the growth rate was calculated for each accession as the slope between the growth rate at 16 and 6°C. As expected, all accessions grew faster when it was warmer. The observed phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) is to a large extent explained by genetic variation; broad-sense heritabilities are 0.41 for initial size, and 0.57 and 0.32 for growth rate at 16 and 6°C, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Growth parameters correlate with the environment of origin</title><p>If growth rates are locally adaptive, they may reflect the environment of origin of each accession.

We detect genetic variation for the different growth parameters, and environmental correlations that suggest local adaptation. GWAS analyses reveal, not surprisingly, a polygenic trait architecture. We speculated that the slower growth measured in accessions from colder climates reflects relocation of resources from growth towards cold acclimation. Both metabolome and gene expression data are consistent with accessions from colder climates preparing for a harsh winter. In our temperature experiment, we see that the growth of northern lines is affected less than southern lines by switching from 16°C to 6°C.</p><p>Our conclusion that slower growth is likely adaptive in populations facing fiercer winters is in line with recent results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wieters et al., 2021</xref>, who concluded that the reduced growth in northern lines was adaptive and not a consequence of an accumulation of deleterious mutations at the species border. If slower growth were indeed a consequence of accumulated deleterious mutations, we would expect to see slower growth also during the initial seedling establishment, which we measured here as the initial size. On the contrary, we saw a fast seedling establishment for accessions from colder regions. We speculate that the fast seedling establishment is a potential adaptation for short growth seasons, which often coincide with colder climates (high latitude or high altitude). This fast seedling establishment seems to be partly supported by larger seeds. These larger seeds may provide more nutrients to initiate faster seedling establishment, while this is of less importance in warmer climates with longer growth seasons. Further work is needed to disentangle initial growth from seed size effects and confirm that there is a causal relationship between seed size and fast seedling establishment, whether this is due to seed nutrient storage, and whether it is adaptive.</p><p>The adaptation of growth to local climates is likely to be influenced by a trade-off with cold acclimation. General growth-survival trade-offs have long been observed and are described in general ecological strategy schemes such as Grime’s C-S-R triangle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grime, 1979</xref>) and the leaf–height–seed scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westoby, 1998</xref>).

Here, we observed higher expression of genes involved in cold acclimation in accessions from colder regions. This is clearest at 6°C, but is also happening at 16°C, suggesting that activation of cold acclimation is stronger in accessions from cold climates and may be triggered more easily. More generally, it establishes that geographic differentiation exists in the expression of known cold-response genes. Accessions from warm climates may instead activate cold acclimation as a stress response rather than as a preventive measure. Even though this is based on a limited set of 8 accessions, metabolome measurements in all 249 accessions lead to the same conclusion. Metabolites involved in cold acclimation such as raffinose, sucrose, and proline were found in higher concentrations in accessions from colder climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weiszmann et al., 2020</xref>). We believe that accessions from colder environments are relocating more energy and resources from growth towards preparations for upcoming freezing temperatures, which is a clear example of active plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forsman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Kleunen and Fischer, 2005</xref>). Even though we have no direct survival measurements, we speculate that this results in stronger cold acclimation and consequently increased freezing tolerance in the accessions from colder regions. Indeed, accessions originating from colder environments show increased freezing tolerance upon cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zuther et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horton et al., 2016</xref>). This fits with observations of northern and colder regions favoring slower growing, more stress-tolerant plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vasseur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Estarague et al., 2022</xref>). Also, biogeographic studies in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> found that winter temperatures are a major determinant of suitable habitats for this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoffmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yim et al., 2022</xref>), and reciprocal transplant experiments detected an important role for freezing tolerance in fitness variation in northern sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ågren and Schemske, 2012</xref>). The high variability we observed in our data does, however, show that there is more at play than selection for cold resistance alone. What these factors are we can only speculate about. Phenotypes are shaped by a mixture of neutral and adaptive processes, with a plethora of trade-offs between traits. Investigating phenotypes at different organismal scales in specific and realistic environments will further elucidate how phenotypes and, ultimately, life history strategies are shaped. We speculate that the reduced growth plasticity observed for accessions from colder climates is due to the stronger growth reduction at 16°C in these accessions compared to accessions from warmer climates. They may well be anticipating winter, whereas accessions from warmer climates do not, and hence show a stronger difference between 16 and 6°C. Although both metabolite and gene expression data suggest an involvement of cold acclimation, we note that it is impossible to rule out that accessions from colder climates grow slower due to reduced resource efficiency as they become larger or, for example, increase leaf thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2016</xref>). Further work is needed to understand the mechanism underlying the growth response observed here.</p><p>There is strong evidence from QTL mapping that genetic variation in the CBF2 gene is one of the drivers for adaptation to freezing stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oakley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gehan et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we looked at growth phenotypes and did not detect associations with the CBF loci. In the transcriptome analysis, we did pick up a role for CBF and other known cold-acclimation genes. The most significant locus detected in our GWAS analysis (for growth rate at 16°C) lies in the vicinity of <italic>COL5</italic>, a gene that is part of a leaf growth regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vercruyssen et al., 2014</xref>) and whose expression is induced by both cold treatment and <italic>CBF1</italic>, <italic>CBF2,</italic> and <italic>CBF3</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2015</xref>). It is however unclear what its exact regulatory role in growth in cold conditions might be. In summary, we detected adaptive differentiation for growth between accessions from warm and cold climates. Our transcriptome data and previous metabolome data suggest that resources are relocated from growth to cold acclimation in accessions from colder regions. This allows these accessions to be fully prepared for the coming of winter.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth and phenotyping</title><p>Seeds of 249 natural accessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> described in the 1001 genomes project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>) were sown on sieved (6 mm) substrate (Einheitserde ED63).

Each temperature treatment was repeated in three independent experiments. Five replicate plants were grown for every genotype per experiment. Plants were randomly distributed across the growth chamber with an independent randomization pattern for each experiment. During the temperature treatments (14–35 days after stratification), plants were photographed twice a day (1 hr after/before lights switched on/off), using an RGB camera (IDS uEye UI-548xRE-C; 5MP) mounted to a robotic arm. Rosette areas were extracted from the plant images using Lemnatec OS (LemnaTec GmbH, Aachen, Germany) software. Plant growth profiles were visually inspected, and datapoints with smaller rosette areas than earlier time points (negative growth) were discarded from further analyses. At 35 days after stratification, whole rosettes were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80°C until further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Nonlinear modeling</title><p>Nonlinear modeling was used to describe plant growth in a minimum number of parameters.

For initial size (<italic>M</italic><sub>0</sub>), we added accession as fixed effect. Temperature treatment only started from the initial time point onwards, and thus could not have an effect on the initial plant size. The growth rate, on the other hand, should be affected by temperature; therefore, we included accession, temperature, and their interaction as fixed effects for growth rate (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf36"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). No fixed effects were added for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. The idea here is that it is an adjustment factor for decreasing growth rates (when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) with increasing plant sizes, which is general for plant growth, or at least for our data in this case. Individuals nested within experiment were added as random effects for each of the model parameters. The correlation structure intrinsic to measuring the same individuals over time was accounted for by adding the first-order continuous autoregressive correlation structure (corCAR1). The estimated fixed effects of this model were then used to obtain initial size estimates for each accession and growth rate estimates for each accession in both temperatures. These estimates were used for all further analyses apart from broad-sense heritability calculations (see below). For each accession, we calculated the growth rate response as the slope between the growth rate at 6°C and the growth rate at 16°C. The slope was obtained from linear regression with the <italic>lm</italic> function in R (4.0.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">R Development Core Team, 2017</xref>) using temperature as an ordered categorical variable (6°C &lt; 16°C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Climate correlations</title><p>The different phenotypes were correlated with each of the different (bio)climate variables downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.worldclim.org">https://www.worldclim.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fick and Hijmans, 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Regina S Baucom as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Landry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The work needs significant re-framing for broad relevance in the introduction. As is currently written, the manuscript is perhaps of more interest to a plant biology journal. Re-framing will be essential for <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad audience. Each reviewer provides suggestions to this end.</p><p>(2) Each major conclusion needs better justification (ie need to see the results of analysis, F-values, P-values). Many of the conclusions were presented without such results; a supplemental document is likely needed in this regard. Reviewers felt results from the phenotype data, metabolome data, transcriptome data etc all were a bit weak in this regard.</p><p>(3) A number of conclusions drawn were questioned by reviewers, with suggestions for re-analysis and clarity surrounding analyses. Each of these in turn should be considered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed reading this work; it is a very extensive set of data nicely pulled together into a story and it will add a useful examination of plant growth adaptation to the literature. I list areas of improvement below according to line number.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>1. Lines 29-46 lack a clear and novel hypothesis that the authors are addressing; I suggest reframing here in terms of life-history adaptation and trade-offs between growth for reproduction and survival.</p><p>2. Line 48 for clarity, remove ‘upcoming’ and ‘consequently’.</p><p>Results</p><p>3. Presentation of sample sizes is sometimes unclear. Line 71 rephrase to 'Our replicated experiment yielded dense…' and '(5 replicates X 249 accessions X 2 treatments X 3 experiments)'.</p><p>4. In Line 74-80, unclear why authors chose power law here – is this based on their own data or previous analyses? Methods make it apparent that authors have modeled this themselves, yet there is no presentation of model fit analysis in the results. This section really needs data in support of conclusions – report AIC, etc, explaining why power law is appropriate. Or, develop this in supplemental text.</p><p>5. Lines 91-94. The authors jump back and forth between using accession as a fixed effect in some analyses, and then random effect in others. Explanation of these choices would improve the manuscript.</p><p>6. Lines 105-115. This is a pretty significant section yet the data are not shown – estimates of the strength of the correlation between growth parameters and winter temperature if authors assert 'strongly correlated' should be shown in text as a range. Figures S1 and S2 are very nicely displayed but the assertion of a strong correlation should have a number associated with it so that readers can form their own conclusions. Typically 'strong' correlations are 0.5+ but often 0.7+. Lower than 0.4 are most often considered moderate.</p><p>7. Lines 117-145. It appears from the regressions that Asian populations are doing a lot of the work. This is certainly biologically relevant (although not discussed enough in the discussion!) so I am not suggesting the authors should remove these populations but they should report how much of their overall conclusions are driven by the populations experiencing the coldest temperatures. How much are these populations driving overall trends?</p><p>Additionally, the data in this section are discussed predominantly as the outcome of regressions, with R2 values reported on the figure. In the methods, it is clear that authors modeled effects using fixed and mixed analyses of variance, yet none of these results are apparent in text or in supplemental. Readers, myself included, want to see effect sizes, F- and p-values associated with the claims made; without them, the work appears analyses-lite.</p><p>How much of the variation in size was due to seed size? Numbers are necessary to back up claims such as 'seed size alone' etc. What proportion of the variance is leftover once seed size is corrected? I would suggest modeling seed size as a fixed covariate, unclear why the choice to model it as a random effect was made.</p><p>Line 138. Why aren't resources limiting? Do the authors mean resources in this particular growth chamber study aren't limiting?</p><p>Lines 141-145. The conclusion here is hard to accept given that the Swedish populations show a huge range in response to temperature changes.</p><p>8. Lines 147+. A metabolome experiment is mentioned yet there was not a metabolomics section in the methods, nor was there clear data analysis of a metabolome experiment. I assume authors are referencing a previously published dataset but details should be present in this work as well.</p><p>9. Line 196. Remove 'so-called'.</p><p>10. Lines 208+. The influence of the Asian populations should be assessed in the test of adaptive differentiation.</p><p>11. Figure 2. This figure is difficult to interpret. I like the idea of having a conceptual map of the experimental design, but the 'seedling establishment' banner is odd (perhaps put this text on the x-axis during seedling establishment phase and not within the temps on the y axis?). The inlay showing the light/temp acclimation period is hard to interpret, why are the y-axes off-kilter from the overall figure? Y-axis should be labeled 'Temperature'.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>12. Line 227 'Despite high plasticity' &lt;- unclear where this conclusion comes from – current data of temperature response? If so, then plasticity needs to be discussed at more length in the results. Or, if authors are concluding this from previously published work, a citation is needed.</p><p>13. Lines 237-239. This statement is difficult to accept given the wide variation among Swedish populations.</p><p>14. Lines 245-255. The discussion of seedling establishment is a bit long especially since I didn't see seedling establishment data presented per se. How was fast seedling establishment measured and was it compared between northern and southern latitudes?</p><p>Methods.</p><p>15. Most comments above on data presentation can be applied to the methods.</p><p>Line 419 'each replicate' is unclear – I believe the authors meant replicate experiment here not replicate plants. The overall transcriptome sampling is unclear – how many total libraries were developed?</p><p>Was there a metabolome experiment? If so it should be explained briefly in the methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The metabolome analysis is mentioned in the discussion (lines 270-272) but not reported in the results.</p><p>2. There are a number of crucial pieces of information missing from the presentation of the gene expression results. How were the dendrograms in figure 5 made? How were these clusters generated? Is this figure only for the 251 genes or for a larger set of genes? What was the background set of genes for the Chi-square reported in line 161? Please provide additional details to answer these questions.</p><p>3. The information presented in Figure S5 seems very relevant and interesting to the main results, but this figure could be improved. It is very hard right now to read the trend line between the temperature of origin and expression for each cluster/treatment, and this would be clearer if the lines were a contrasting color.</p><p>4. We were confused about the statistical tests reported in Figure S5, since they do not appear to be described in the methods. It seems like this figure reports the correlation between the temperature of origin and expression for every gene in the cluster. This analysis would be pseudoreplication since the expression of different genes from the same genotype is not independent. A more appropriate analysis would be to estimate the correlation of temperature of origin with the mean expression or eigengene for all genes in the cluster. Alternatively, the correlation between the temperature of origin and expression could be independently calculated for each gene in a cluster, and then the number of significant correlations and/or mean slope of these correlations within each cluster could be reported.</p><p>5. In the paragraph beginning in line 261, it is clear how a slower growth rate in accessions from cold regions at 6C is consistent with cold acclimation literature but not how the reduced growth rate plasticity in these accessions is connected to the literature. The discussion could be added to explain why the accessions from cold regions also grow more slowly when never exposed to cold (expand on line 138) and why they might have less plasticity in the growth rate.</p><p>Additional line comments:</p><p>6. The paragraph starting on line 47 could use more context for how the information relates to the broader argument.</p><p>7. Line 123 should cite where the seed size information is from.</p><p>8. It would be useful to report the p-value and effect size of the &quot;most significant&quot; association (line 179).</p><p>9. What are the &quot;inflated significance levels&quot; referred to on lines 180-181?</p><p>10. Should include statistics to justify the model choice in lines 348-351.</p><p>11. Lines with potential typos: 344, 360, 462.</p><p>12. Figures should have larger axes and labels, and all panels should be labeled within a figure. For example, label the panels in Figures3 and 4.</p><p>13. In figure 4, what impact does the x-axis outlier (coldest temp) have on the patterns we see? It would be nice to know that the outlier is not driving the trends and to have an explanation of why that accession is much colder than the rest (for example, where is this accession from?).</p><p>14. The Qst vs Fst analysis was used appropriately but there could be an additional explanation for how to interpret figure 7 in regards to how the gray fields are calculated</p><p>15. Unclear what &quot;high plasticity&quot; means in line 227.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 35: remove so-*</p><p>Line 47-58: the emphasis on CBFs is maybe excessive here as you don't provide compelling evidence for their involvement. Maybe swap for an introduction of the main ecological strategy of Nordic vs Southern adapted accessions?</p><p>Line 74-82: Provide the AIC/BIC/deviance or RMSE to justify the use of power vs exponential growth model in materials, but keep it simple here so that the interpretation of the parameter is clearer.</p><p>Figure 2: Upon vernalisattion? I believe you mean cold stratification?</p><p>Line 94: This is peripheral but I wonder if there is no biological insight to be gained from fitting a β for each accession. Wouldn't this be informative about the rate of resource accumulation?</p><p>Line 103-128: I understand that some metrics are provided in the figures associated with these sections but it would be clearer to provide some quantitative support (and tests) in the main text.</p><p>Line 147: how does the metabolite measurement fit?</p><p>Line 154: which accessions? Give the rationale for selection based on Figure S4.</p><p>Line 162: the null hypothesis of the test is not known.</p><p>Line 171-174: I find this argument circular: these genes were identified as differentially expressed in the very same accession I presume (although this is not explicitly stated in the paper).</p><p>Line 134: relocation of resources towards… I think there could be some information in analysing β's inferred for each accession here.</p><p>Line 360: typo</p><p>Line 372: Put the rest of the section in the heritability section.</p><p>Line 392: grammar issue.</p><p>Line 462: grammar again.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Locally adaptive temperature response of vegetative growth in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Christian Landry (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The clarity of the manuscript has been improved particularly in the descriptions of the methods and figure design. A few additional analyses to explore subsets of the data that drive trends in growth rate are included which strengthens the overall conclusion that temperature response of vegetative growth is locally adaptive. However, the manuscript has not addressed two of our initial concerns about the broad framing of the manuscript and the gene expression analyses.</p><p>1. The manuscript has been reframed in the context of ecological and life history strategies with a focus on the growth and survival tradeoff, based on feedback from us and other reviewers. While the growth rate results are potentially consistent with what is expected for a growth/survival tradeoff, there is no evidence for the other side of the tradeoff, survival. The manuscript should make this clear. In addition, the current framing includes references to active and passive plasticity, but we are not convinced that faster growth of accessions from warm temperatures &quot;proves&quot; that slow growth of accessions from cold temperatures is active plasticity (lines 125-127) as opposed to another explanation such as less efficient use of resources in accessions from cold temperatures at a later life stage. Additionally, the manuscript notes that &quot;plant growth is known to slow down with increasing size&quot; when justifying its model choice for estimating growth rates. With this in mind, is it a surprise that the populations with initial larger rosettes now show slower growth?</p><p>2. The gene expression results should be better integrated to support the conclusion that growth rate response is locally adapted. The main results described in the text are (1) the cold acclimation genes are more likely to be differentially expressed between temperatures compared to background genes. This is unsurprising since these genes were initially identified as being differentially expressed in the cold. (2) Gene expression clustering separates accessions from warmer and colder climates and the expression of some clusters is correlated with the temperature of origin. It is unclear if this pattern differs from background genes or the trait divergence expected under neutrality. (3) Genes that were up-regulated in cold (from published experiments) are also generally upregulated in accessions from cold climates. This last result is potentially the clearest link to the adaptive story, but it is not emphasized here and it's also unclear to us if upregulating these genes is a sign of adaptive or maladaptive plasticity. Overall, there is not a clear link between these results and the conclusion about adaptation to cold temperatures.</p><p>In addition, while Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 does address our concern about pseudoreplication, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 still reports misleading p values that should not be included due to pseudoreplication.</p><p>Line Comments:</p><p>The statements made in lines 41-43 should have citations.</p><p>Lines 154-156 seem circular.</p><p>Line 181 change &quot;both&quot; to &quot;all&quot;.</p><p>Line 198-199. The phrase &quot;across the genome we detect adaptive differentiation for certain growth parameters.&quot; seems unsupported by the data. While the Qst-Fst results show evidence that phenotypic variation is adaptive, there is still no evidence that this trait is shaped by loci 'across the genome'.</p><p>Line 273 should read 160 µmolm−2s-1?</p><p>It is not clear how the growth rate temperature response was calculated. Line 91-92 suggests that it is &quot;the slope between the growth rate at 16ºC and 6ºC&quot; but examining specific points in figure 2B, C, and D makes it look like something else is going on. For example, the far left point has a growth rate of ~0.16 in 16C and ~0.052 in 6C, but the response is ~0.072 when we would expect something closer to 0.1 based on the text.</p><p>Please include percent variance explained on figures with PCs as axes (Figure 5 and Figure 5 supplement).</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is somewhat confusing with the y axis referring to the experiment timeline on the x-axis and to the inset graph of a single day.</p><p>The inclusion of the previously published metabolite data is still somewhat confusing. The results report that metabolite measurements were different between accessions from different climates (line 137) but these results are not presented in a figure anywhere. If the authors want to present previously published data that has been reanalyzed to this paper in a figure, that would be fine. However, without that, it seems like this statement should be moved to the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The work needs significant re-framing for broad relevance in the introduction.

Lower than 0.4 are most often considered moderate.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation coefficients for growth parameters and winter temperature are actually given in Figure 4.

It appears from the regressions that Asian populations are doing a lot of the work. This is certainly biologically relevant (although not discussed enough in the discussion!) so I am not suggesting the authors should remove these populations but they should report how much of their overall conclusions are driven by the populations experiencing the coldest temperatures. How much are these populations driving overall trends?</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent question. As noted above, we tried this, and it turns out not to matter. We did a similar analysis for the Swedish accessions with similar results – see comments below. We note this in the text, and provide supplemental figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 4,6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the data in this section are discussed predominantly as the outcome of regressions, with R2 values reported on the figure. In the methods, it is clear that authors modeled effects using fixed and mixed analyses of variance, yet none of these results are apparent in text or in supplemental. Readers, myself included, want to see effect sizes, F- and p-values associated with the claims made; without them, the work appears analyses-lite.</p></disp-quote><p>The mixed-model analysis was only used for the population structure-corrected climate correlations in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. The other analyses are standard regressions. We adjusted the Materials and methods section on climate correlations to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How much of the variation in size was due to seed size? Numbers are necessary to back up claims such as 'seed size alone' etc. What proportion of the variance is leftover once seed size is corrected? I would suggest modeling seed size as a fixed covariate, unclear why the choice to model it as a random effect was made.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a variance decomposition to see how much of the variation in initial size is explained by winter temperature and by seed size (32.7% and 11.9% of the variation, respectively). Together with the significant correlation when correcting for seed size, this shows that winter temperature is still strongly correlated with initial size when seed size is taken into account.</p><p>We chose to add seed size as a random effect since we only wanted an estimate for the correlation between initial size and winter temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 138. Why aren't resources limiting? Do the authors mean resources in this particular growth chamber study aren't limiting?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a reference to the higher growth rates of the accessions from warmer climates. Those higher growth rates prove that resources are not limited and thus accessions with slower growth could in principle also exhibit similarly high growth. We clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 141-145. The conclusion here is hard to accept given that the Swedish populations show a huge range in response to temperature changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The Swedish accessions are indeed showing a very large spread for the temperature response of the growth rate. We added a supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 6) showing the coefficient of variance for each of the subpopulations and its correlation with winter temperature, plots of correlation between the growth rate's temperature response and winter temperature for all except the Swedish subpopulations, and the same correlation for only the Swedish subpopulations. These plots show that accessions from colder temperatures still have lower plasticity for this trait, also within the Swedish subpopulations the conclusion still holds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The influence of the Asian populations should be assessed in the test of adaptive differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, thanks for this suggestion. We assessed the influence of the Asian accessions on the detected adaptive differentiation by excluding them. It is important to note here that the principal components needed to be recalculated after doing this, and are thus not the same as the principal components in the original analysis.</p><p>In summary, we still detect adaptive differentiation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). For initial size there is significant adaptive differentiation along 3 different axes of genetic differentiation (PC1, PC5 and PC9). PC1 is mainly splitting northern Swedish and to a lesser extent also southern Swedish accessions from the rest, with both showing higher initial sizes compared to the other accessions. PC5 is differentiating southern Swedish and to some extent northern Swedish from central European accessions. PC9 is more enigmatic, splitting up two subgroups of the western European accessions. For both growth rate at 16ºC and its temperature response we detect adaptive differentiation along PC5, splitting up southern Swedish, northern Swedish and central European accessions. Linking back to the initial analysis, we can say that there is adaptive differentiation for initial size, growth rate at 16ºC and its temperature response. Asian accessions are driving part of this adaptive differentiation, however, also for the Swedish accessions we detect significant signals of being differently adapted in terms of these growth parameters.</p><p>This analysis is added to the manuscript (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, line 267-271).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

There are a number of crucial pieces of information missing from the presentation of the gene expression results. How were the dendrograms in figure 5 made? How were these clusters generated?

The information presented in Figure S5 seems very relevant and interesting to the main results, but this figure could be improved.

This has been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. We were confused about the statistical tests reported in Figure S5, since they do not appear to be described in the methods. It seems like this figure reports the correlation between the temperature of origin and expression for every gene in the cluster. This analysis would be pseudoreplication since the expression of different genes from the same genotype is not independent. A more appropriate analysis would be to estimate the correlation of temperature of origin with the mean expression or eigengene for all genes in the cluster. Alternatively, the correlation between the temperature of origin and expression could be independently calculated for each gene in a cluster, and then the number of significant correlations and/or mean slope of these correlations within each cluster could be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed.

In the paragraph beginning in line 261, it is clear how a slower growth rate in accessions from cold regions at 6C is consistent with cold acclimation literature but not how the reduced growth rate plasticity in these accessions is connected to the literature.

A few additional analyses to explore subsets of the data that drive trends in growth rate are included which strengthens the overall conclusion that temperature response of vegetative growth is locally adaptive. However, the manuscript has not addressed two of our initial concerns about the broad framing of the manuscript and the gene expression analyses.</p><p>1. The manuscript has been reframed in the context of ecological and life history strategies with a focus on the growth and survival tradeoff, based on feedback from us and other reviewers. While the growth rate results are potentially consistent with what is expected for a growth/survival tradeoff, there is no evidence for the other side of the tradeoff, survival. The manuscript should make this clear. In addition, the current framing includes references to active and passive plasticity, but we are not convinced that faster growth of accessions from warm temperatures &quot;proves&quot; that slow growth of accessions from cold temperatures is active plasticity (lines 125-127) as opposed to another explanation such as less efficient use of resources in accessions from cold temperatures at a later life stage. Additionally, the manuscript notes that &quot;plant growth is known to slow down with increasing size&quot; when justifying its model choice for estimating growth rates. With this in mind, is it a surprise that the populations with initial larger rosettes now show slower growth?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we cannot make hard claims on the survival aspect, therefore we were always careful in our wording. We now also added explicitly that we did not measure survival itself. (line 238). At the same time, we note (line 245-246) that reciprocal transplant experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> did detect an important contribution of freezing tolerance to fitness variation in sites with strong winters.</p><p>We also added a disclaimer paragraph (line 255-259) to make clear that a reduced resource efficiency in later development may cause a similar growth reduction. We still believe that our data is pointing towards active inhibition in trade-off with cold acclimation, however, further work is required to nail down the exact resource relocation and the regulation of this growth inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The gene expression results should be better integrated to support the conclusion that growth rate response is locally adapted. The main results described in the text are (1) the cold acclimation genes are more likely to be differentially expressed between temperatures compared to background genes. This is unsurprising since these genes were initially identified as being differentially expressed in the cold. (2) Gene expression clustering separates accessions from warmer and colder climates and the expression of some clusters is correlated with the temperature of origin. It is unclear if this pattern differs from background genes or the trait divergence expected under neutrality. (3) Genes that were up-regulated in cold (from published experiments) are also generally upregulated in accessions from cold climates. This last result is potentially the clearest link to the adaptive story, but it is not emphasized here and it's also unclear to us if upregulating these genes is a sign of adaptive or maladaptive plasticity. Overall, there is not a clear link between these results and the conclusion about adaptation to cold temperatures.</p><p>In addition, while Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 does address our concern about pseudoreplication, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 still reports misleading p values that should not be included due to pseudoreplication.</p></disp-quote><p>1) We agree that this is unsurprising, but in our opinion it is important to show that also in this specific setup this group of genes is more affected by temperature than expected by chance.</p><p>2) We added figure 3 - figure supplement 5, which is showing that for most clusters (except cluster F in 16ºC), the correlation coefficients are stronger than expected from random sets of background genes. For this we performed 10,000 permutations using random sets of background genes for each of the clusters, in each temperature.</p><p>That the correlations are stronger than expected under neutrality is in our opinion proven by the fact that the correlations are (for most clusters) more significant than expected by chance, which was now tested by doing 10.000 permutations of winter temperature correlations for each of the clusters of cold acclimated genes. These p-values are now corrected in figure 3 —figure supplement 2, which is also tackling the problem of the misleading p-values in that figure.</p><p>2) These results could be interpreted many ways, however, they do demonstrate that the expression of known cold-response genes differ geographically, consistent with local adaptation. We now note this in the Discussion (line 229-230).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line Comments:</p><p>The statements made in lines 41-43 should have citations.</p></disp-quote><p>We added citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 154-156 seem circular.</p></disp-quote><p>We don't think this sentence is circular.

Line 91-92 suggests that it is &quot;the slope between the growth rate at 16ºC and 6ºC&quot; but examining specific points in figure 2B, C, and D makes it look like something else is going on. For example, the far left point has a growth rate of ~0.16 in 16C and ~0.052 in 6C, but the response is ~0.072 when we would expect something closer to 0.1 based on the text.</p></disp-quote><p>A value closer to 0.1 is indeed expected when the categorical variables '6C' and '16C' are recoded to 0 and 1. Because we wanted to obtain the slope from 6C towards 16C, we specified temperature to be an ordered factor with 6C the lower order and 16 the higher order. The linear regression used to define the slope works a little bit differently with ordered categorical variables, encoding the categorical variables not to 0 and 1, but to -0.70 and 0.70. The slopes we obtained are thus different but perfectly correlated with the slopes obtained from non-ordered categorical variables.

However, without that, it seems like this statement should be moved to the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that mentioning the findings of the previously published metabolite data is important to introduce why we look into the expression of cold acclimation genes. Therefore we prefer to keep this sentence for its introductory value in the gene expression analysis.</p><p>We added to the text that the metabolite measurements are presented in a previous publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
