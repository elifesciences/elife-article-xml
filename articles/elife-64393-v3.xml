osteocytes mediates bone formation in response to mechanical cues and parathyroid hormone (PTH). To date, the regulation of sclerostin has been attributed exclusively to the transcriptional downregulation of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene hours after stimulation. Using mouse models and rodent cell lines, we describe the rapid, minute-scale post-translational degradation of sclerostin protein by the lysosome following mechanical load and PTH. We present a model, integrating both new and established mechanically and hormonally activated effectors into the regulated degradation of sclerostin by lysosomes. Using a mouse forelimb mechanical loading model, we find transient inhibition of lysosomal degradation or the upstream mechano-signaling pathway controlling sclerostin abundance impairs subsequent load-induced bone formation by preventing sclerostin degradation. We also link dysfunctional lysosomes to aberrant sclerostin regulation using human Gaucher disease iPSCs. These results reveal how bone anabolic cues post-translationally regulate sclerostin abundance in osteocytes to regulate bone formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteocyte</kwd><kwd>sclerostin</kwd><kwd>parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>mechanical load</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR071614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name><name><surname>Stains</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012443</institution-id><institution>Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-MSCRFD-4246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feldman</surname><given-names>Ricardo A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19POST34450156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joca</surname><given-names>Humberto C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR071618 HL142290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM008181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Nicole R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lyons</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR007592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Katrina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical loading and the bone anabolic action of parathyroid hormone result in rapid, lysosomal degradation of sclerostin protein, revealing physiologically important post-translational control of this critical regulator of bone formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The osteocyte-derived protein, sclerostin, is a fundamentally important inhibitor of bone formation, with decreases in abundance mediating mechanically and hormonallyÂ induced bone formation. Sclerostin (gene name <italic>Sost</italic>) is a secreted 27 kDa glycoprotein that inhibits the differentiation and activity of bone-forming osteoblasts by antagonizing the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron and Gori, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drake and Khosla, 2017</xref>). Genetic deletion of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene in mice results in extraordinarily high bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2008</xref>). In humans, mutations in the <italic>SOST</italic> gene underlie high bone mass and bone overgrowth in patients with sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balemans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balemans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appelman-Dijkstra et al., 1993</xref>). Accordingly, regulating sclerostin bioavailability has tremendous therapeutic potential for conditions of low bone mass, such as osteoporosis. Indeed, targeting sclerostin protein with neutralizing antibodies is incredibly effective at increasing bone mass, and Romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin, has been FDA approved to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women at a high risk for fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McClung, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandeira et al., 2017</xref>). Despite this critical role for sclerostin in skeletal homeostasis and its therapeutic potential, there are substantial gaps with respect to the molecular control of this key regulatory protein.</p><p>In response to bone mechanical loading, osteocytes sense and respond to fluid shear stress (FSS) in the lacunar canalicular network by ultimately decreasing sclerostin protein abundance, de-repressing Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, andÂ unleashing osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. When administered intermittently, parathyroid hormone (PTH) causes net bone formation in part by decreasing sclerostin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller and Kneissel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellido et al., 2005</xref>). This has been exploited in the clinic through the established osteoanabolic drug, teriparatide (PTH, amino acids 1â34). Despite their clinical application, little is known about how mechanical load and PTH, two disparate bone anabolic signals, directly regulate sclerostin protein. To date, the regulation of sclerostin protein abundance has been attributed to the transcriptional downregulation of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene that occurs on an hour timescale after mechanical load or PTH exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sebastian and Loots, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonnet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meakin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using a recently established osteocyte-like cell line, Ocy454 cells, which is one of the few cell lines that reliably express detectable sclerostin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spatz et al., 2015</xref>), we previously described a mechano-transduction pathway that regulates osteocyte sclerostin protein abundance in response to FSS in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2020</xref>). Using this in vitro model, we found that osteocyte mechano-signaling required a subset of detyrosinated microtubules, which transduce load signals to activate NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. These ROS signals then elicit a transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)-dependent primary calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is activated in response to this primary Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and is required for reduction of osteocyte sclerostin protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While these discoveries integrated with and extended several established models of the osteocyte mechanical response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaffler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geoghegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baik et al., 2013</xref>), we found the loss of sclerostin protein was surprisingly rapid (minute scale) and was likely wholly distinct from the well-characterized transcriptional regulation of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene, which occurs on the hour timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sebastian and Loots, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonnet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonnet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meakin et al., 2014</xref>). Despite its physiologic significance, little is known about the post-translational control of sclerostin protein. Additionally, given the in vitro nature of our prior work on this pathway, the contribution of this mechano-transduction pathway to in vivo bone mechano-responsiveness remained unresolved. Here, we examined the kinetics of sclerostin protein degradation in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism regulating the rapid decline in osteocyte sclerostin protein, its relevance in vivo in bone physiology during ulnar load, and its dysfunction in skeletal disease. We also extended the observation of the FSS-induced rapid degradation of sclerostin protein to PTH, another clinically relevant bone anabolic signal.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sclerostin protein is rapidly degraded after mechanical stimulus in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FSS causes the rapid loss of sclerostin protein through a number of molecular mediators.

To more precisely characterize the dynamics of mechanically stimulated sclerostin protein loss in osteocytes, we examined two sclerostin expressing cell lines: Ocy454 osteocytes and UMR106 osteosarcoma cells. Consistent with our previous work, we observed the mechano-activated increase in CaMKII phosphorylation and decrease in sclerostin protein abundance in both Ocy454 osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and UMR106 osteosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) within 5 min of the acute application of FSS. To establish the relevance of a load-induced loss of sclerostin protein in vivo, we examined if this rapid loss of sclerostin abundance, as determined by western blot or sclerostin immunofluorescence in sectioned bone, occurred following an acute bout of ulnar loading. Sclerostin protein abundance was assessed in 16Â weekÂ old female or 17Â weekÂ old male mice subjected to a single bout of ulnar load. Ulnae were harvested 5 min post-load, a time frame consistent with in vitro observations, and osteocyte-enriched cortical bone lysates were profiled by western blotting or ulnae were sectioned to evaluate sclerostin-positive osteocytes by immunofluorescence. As occurred in vitro, sclerostin protein abundance was rapidly reduced and CaMKII activated in loaded versus contralateral non-loaded limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and the percent of sclerostin positive osteocytes was decreased in loaded limbs versus contralateral non-loaded limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), establishing that rapid sclerostin protein loss also occurs in vivo following a single bout of mechanical stimulus.</p><p>A temporal assessment of sclerostin protein abundance following FSS in Ocy454 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and UMR106 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) revealed a decrease in sclerostin protein as early as 1 min post-FSS, with the nadir of protein expression occurring at 10 min, followed by a subsequent rebound. This rapid regulation strongly suggested post-translational control of sclerostin abundance. Consistent with the possibility of post-translational control of sclerostin, we recently reported that a single 5 min bout of FSS, as used here, does not decrease <italic>Sost</italic> mRNA levels despite a decrease in sclerostin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm the post-translational control of sclerostin, Ocy454 cells were transfected with either a myc- or GFP-tagged sclerostin expression vector under control of a CMV promoter, which is not controlled by the same transcriptional elements that regulate <italic>Sost</italic> transcription. Like endogenous sclerostin, overexpressed sclerostin protein was rapidly and transiently decreased by FSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Inhibition of NOX2 with apocynin blunted the rapid degradation of sclerostin protein in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), supporting that NOX2 ROS is necessary for sclerostin degradation.</p><p>Second, to compliment the NOX2 targeting data in vivo, we next wanted to examine the impact of targeting lysosomal degradation on load-induced bone formation and sclerostin degradation in vivo. Ulnar loading was performed on 15Â weekÂ old male mice treated with vehicle or the lysosome inhibitor bafilomycin A1 once a day for four consecutive days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). After the final day of loading, inhibitor treatment was ceased, the bone surfaces were labeled with alizarin red and calcein, and dynamic histomorphometry was performed to assess de novo bone formation. As for apocynin, bafilomycin A1 was not administered during the inter-label period when bone formation was monitored. Acute administration of bafilomycin A1 4 hr prior to each bout of ulnar load reduced the subsequent load-induced increase in Ps.BFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) and Ps.MAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>) observed 14 days after the initiation of the experiment. In contrast, the administration of bafilomycin A1 during the first four days of the experiment had no effect on the Ps.BFR or Ps.MAR in the contralateral non-loaded limb. To validate the effect of lysosomal inhibition on sclerostin degradation, we treated animals acutely with bafilomycin A1 prior to a single bout of ulnar loading to examine sclerostin protein abundance. Ulnae were harvested 5 min post-load, a time frame consistent with in vitro and in vivo observations, and osteocyte-enriched cortical bone lysates were profiled by western blotting. Inhibition of lysosomal degradation with bafilomycin A1 blunted the rapid degradation of sclerostin protein in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), supporting that lysosomal function is necessary for the rapid degradation of sclerostin.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Lysosomal function is necessary for load-induced sclerostin degradation and subsequent bone formation and is implicated in human disease.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fifteen week old male C57Bl/6 mice treated with vehicle (saline + 4% DMSO, nÂ =Â 7 mice) or bafilomycin A1 (1 mg/kg, nÂ =Â 7 mice) to inhibit lysosomal degradation were forearm loaded (2000Â Î¼Îµ, 90 s, 2 Hz) and labeled with calcein and alizarin red at the indicated times for dynamic histomorphometry.

(<bold>F</bold>) FSS causes the rapid degradation of sclerostin protein by the lysosome through a number of molecular mediators.

Icons outlined red are molecular mechanisms controlling sclerostin abundance that have been described within this manuscript that integrate into our previously described mechano-transduction cascade. Osteoanabolic stimuli, working through reactive oxygen (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), direct sclerostin to the lysosome for degradation. This results in reduced sclerostin to allow for bone formation.

These data strongly support the relevance of post-translational control of sclerostin to skeletal physiology and adaptation to mechanical loading in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Disrupted lysosomal function in Gaucher disease leads to sclerostin dysregulation</title><p>Having defined sclerostin regulation by the lysosome, we probed the clinical relevance using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived osteoblasts from Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder in which patients lack the lysosomal hydrolase glucocerebrosidase (GCase). As with many lysosomal storage disorders, patients with Gaucher disease exhibit skeletal dysplasias and low bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>). Gaucher disease iPSC-derived osteoblasts display defective osteoblast differentiation and mineralization caused by defects in Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, an effect that is reversed by treatment with recombinant GCase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panicker et al., 2018</xref>). We speculated that this suppression of Î²-catenin signaling, osteoblast differentiation, and osteoblast function may be a consequence of defects in sclerostin control, as sclerostin inhibits these processes. Consistent with lysosomal degradation of sclerostin, we observed that iPSC-derived osteoblasts from Gaucher patients had significantly increased levels of sclerostin compared to iPSC-derived osteoblasts from healthy patients without Gaucher disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, treating Gaucher iPSC-derived osteoblasts with recombinant GCase, which restores lysosomal function, Î²-catenin signaling, and osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panicker et al., 2018</xref>), also restored sclerostin abundance to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Since sclerostin acts as an inhibitor of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, these data suggest sclerostin as a therapeutic target for bone loss in Gaucher disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that osteocytes respond to distinct osteoanabolic cues, mechanical load and PTH, by redirecting sclerostin from a secretory pathway to the lysosome for rapid degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In response to mechanical load, this signaling event is mediated by activation of ROS and nitric oxide signaling, a CaMKII-dependent increase in lysosomal activity, and the post-translational degradation of sclerostin by the lysosome. For PTH, CaMKII is likely a common integrator upstream of lysosomal degradation of sclerostin protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both lysosomal activity and activation of the upstream of mechano-signaling pathway are required for mechanicallyÂ induced decreases in sclerostin protein and bone formation in vivo. These findings inform a new model of osteocyte mechano-transduction and shuttling of sclerostin to lysosomes that integrates many of the molecular effectors of the osteocyte mechano-response, including calcium, the cytoskeleton, nitric oxide, and sclerostin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaffler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geoghegan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baik et al., 2013</xref>) and unifies many important discoveries related to osteoanabolic signals that act through sclerostin. These findings also describe a role of nitric oxide production, a canonical response to mechanical load in bone of previously unclear functional consequence, in the regulated degradation of sclerostin protein. Finally, we link sclerostin degradation not only to skeletal physiology in mice but also to human disease using Gaucher disease iPSCs.</p><p>These data do not preclude a transcriptional control of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene by osteoanabolic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sato et al., 2020</xref>). Rather, they add an important downstream check point for regulating sclerostin protein bioavailability with remarkable temporal control. It may be that post-translational control is the first line response to a bone anabolic stimulus, whereas long-term stimulation leads to genome level transcriptional control of the <italic>Sost</italic> gene. Indeed, longer periods of loading are required to observe <italic>Sost</italic> mRNA decreases than are required for loss of protein described here. Our brief, 5 min FSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2020</xref>) and short, 30 min duration PTH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) are insufficient to decrease <italic>Sost</italic> mRNA abundance hours after the stimulus. However, the contribution of longer duration stimulation of this NOX2-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaMKII pathway to <italic>Sost</italic> mRNA is not yet known.</p><p>In isolation, the effects of inhibiting either NOX2-dependent ROS or lysosomal function on load-induced bone formation and sclerostin abundance could be influenced by the broad pharmacological impact of these drugs. However, that two distinct pharmacological inhibitors targeting different steps in the pathway controlling sclerostin yielded a similar effect on bone formation and sclerostin protein abundance following load supports our conclusions. This conclusion is strengthened by two other important considerations: firstly, there was also no statistical effect of either apocynin or bafilomycin A1 on bone formation rate or mineral apposition rate in the contralateral, non-loaded limb. Secondly, the inhibitors were only present for each bout of ulnar load but were absent during the 7Â day bone forming period, indicating that disruption of the acute downstream response to the mechanical cue, not the ability of the osteoblasts to build bone, caused the reductions in bone formation.</p><p>The rapid, controlled degradation of osteocyte sclerostin has intriguing parallels to crinophagy, a specialized autophagic process in peptide-secreting cells in which cellular cues elicit the re-routing of secretory proteins to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Crinophagy is well described in pancreatic beta-cells, in which Rab27a-positive, insulin-filled secretory vesicles can be shuttled to the lysosome for degradation when not needed, an effect triggered by nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waselle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sandberg and Borg, 2006</xref>). Rab27a is associated with secretory granules and other lysosome-associated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukuda, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tolmachova et al., 2004</xref>), and, given the localization of nearly all the endogenous sclerostin with Rab27a, suggests sclerostin is packaged in vesicles. Thus, analogous to crinophagy, our data support that sclerostin is directed through a Rab27a-positive secretory pathway for exocytosis or is trafficked to the lysosome for degradation, an effect that can be regulated by CaMKII and mechano-activated nitric oxide. Notably, this Rab27a-associated secretory pathway functions in osteoblasts to control RANKL secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kariya et al., 2011</xref>). Whether this mechano-pathway and regulated degradation extends to osteocyte-derived RANKL was not analyzed in the present study, but may be physiologically significant as osteocytes are the primary source of bioactive RANKL directing bone resorption in response to physiologic cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using Gaucher disease as a model system, this work links lysosomal function to sclerostin regulation in disease. Gaucher patients experience many skeletal dysplasias, including low bone mass and osteoporosis. Though this cell autonomous defect in Gaucher osteoblasts has previously been linked to dysregulated Î²-catenin that impaired osteogenic differentiation and mineralization capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panicker et al., 2018</xref>), the present findings reveal a possible mechanism by which Î²-catenin is suppressed. Sclerostin is a canonical Wnt/Î²-catenin antagonist; therefore, the increased sclerostin levels observed here in Gaucher disease iPSCs are likely to lead to the previously reported decrease in Î²-catenin activation and osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panicker et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, we showed that restoring expression of the missing hydrolase, glucocerebrosidase, in Gaucher disease iPSCs lowers sclerostin abundance, which could explain the rescue in Î²-catenin activation and osteoblast differentiation reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panicker et al., 2018</xref>). Our data support the exploration of therapeutics that target sclerostin to treat low bone mass symptoms in patients with lysosomal storage disorders.</p><p>That sclerostin protein abundance is post-translationally controlled may have important implications in age-related osteoporosis and the reduced sensitivity of osteocytes to mechanical cues with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hemmatian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haffner-Luntzer et al., 2016</xref>). Lysosome activity is diminished with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stead et al., 2019</xref>), including in the osteocyte during age-related bone loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), an effect that could impair sclerostin degradation and new bone formation even in the face of osteoanabolic signals. While undoubtedly multifaceted in its impacts, targeting autophagy and lysosome activity to improve bone mass in aging has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and these data suggest that impacts on sclerostin bioavailability might contribute mechanistically to its efficacy.</p><p>Together, these discoveries provide key insights into the unexpected, rapid regulation of osteocyte sclerostin protein by the lysosome and reveal new therapeutic targets that can be exploited to improve bone mass in conditions such as osteoporosis. Additionally, targeting sclerostin may be important to interventions to improve bone mass in lysosomal storage disorders, like Gaucher disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Sost</td><td>National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td>AAK13455</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Sost</td><td>National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td>AAK16158.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>Sost</td><td>National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td>EDM06161.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Bos Taurus</italic>)</td><td>Sost</td><td>National Center for Biotechnology Information</td><td>NP_001159986.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male and female)</td><td>C57Bl/6</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>000664</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ocy454</td><td>P.

surprisingly little is known about how biomechanical load to bone leads to decreased sclerostin protein abundance in the osteocytes. In this elegant study, the authors have systematically examined the concept that two distinct, clinically relevant bone anabolic cues (mechanical load and parathyroid hormone) regulate sclerostin degradation post-translationally by directing sclerostin protein to the lysosome using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo mode The study is elegantly designed, clearly communicated, and rigorously conducted. Additional data and the authors revisions are found to be appropriate in addressing the recommendations of the reviewers. The identified concept mechanical loading and PTH regulate osteocyte sclerostin protein levels acutely by the lysosome can be exploited to develop new drug targets to improve bone mass in conditions such as osteoporosis</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Disparate Bone Anabolic Cues Activate Bone Formation by Regulating the Rapid Lysosomal Degradation of Sclerostin Protein&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gabriel L Galea (Reviewer #1); Tamara N Alliston (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The article by Gould et al. breaks new ground by demonstrating a role for lysosomal-mediated degradation in the mechanosensitive repression of Sclerostin levels in bone. Though the post-translational repression of Sclerostin has long been apparent, no one has yet unraveled the mechanisms. Therefore, this discovery is important to the skeletal biology community â both because of the findings themselves, and because the conditions/models used by this team to make these discoveries will be useful for other investigators, including their ability to manipulate and observe the rapid lysosome-dependent control of Sclerostin levels in vitro and in vivo in response to PTH or mechanical stimulation. In addition to the importance within this field, the work has broad impact on multiple levels including (a) the clinical relevance for understanding and potentially treating osteoporosis and the skeletal phenotypes in individuals with lysosomal disease, and (b) the mechanoregulation of lysosomal function and its relationships to crinophagy, which has implications not only for the regulation of Sclerostin, but also for other factors in and beyond the skeleton (RANKL, insulin).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study is elegantly designed, clearly communicated, and rigorously conducted. However, the reviewers require additional data to support the overall conclusion on the significance of lysosome-mediated degradation of sclerostin in skeletal biology.</p><p>First, it is important to elaborate on what gives the authors confidence that the inhibitors were effective and act as expected throughout the study â but especially Bafilomycin A1 and Apocynin in vivo. If BafA1 and Apocynin treatment in vivo work as expected, they should prevent the rapid load-dependent repression of Sclerostin levels (shown in Figure 1D).</p><p>Second, the authors demonstration of mechanical load-dependent changes in sclerostin localization in osteocytes lysosomes in vivo by immunohistochemistry would be important to support the in vivo relevance of this pathway in the acute regulation of sclerostin levels. While the western blotting of mechanically loaded mouse ulnas showing previously-undocumented acute reductions in lysate sclerostin levels is interesting, it is unclear if these changes are caused by mechanical loading-induced lysosomal function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64393.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study is elegantly designed, clearly communicated, and rigorously conducted.

In these experiments, we showed that the acute effects of a single dose of drug (apocynin to inhibit NOX2 or Bafilomycin A1 to inhibit lysosomes) prior to a single bout of ulnar loading prevented downregulation of sclerostin protein in bone. These data fully support our proposed mechanisms of action and complement the previous data that chronic dosing of these drugs impaired bone formation, as well.</p><p>Additionally, new data in Figures 2B and 6A support that activation of this pathway results in the rapid loss of sclerostin protein ex vivo, confirming our mechanisms of action. Together, these data confirm that sclerostin is rapidly degraded in situ by load and that inhibiting early or late stages of the pathway, not only decreases load induced bone formation but also prevents the load induced loss of sclerostin protein in bone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors demonstration of mechanical load-dependent changes in sclerostin localization in osteocytes lysosomes in vivo by immunohistochemistry would be important to support the in vivo relevance of this pathway in the acute regulation of sclerostin levels.

As expected, we observed that a single bout of loading results in the rapid loss of sclerostin protein in osteocytes (% sclerostin positive osteocytes). These data mirror those attained with western blotting of bone extracts. I still contend western blotting of this bone derived protein is a far more sensitive and quantitative assessment for tracking sclerostin than immunofluorescence.</p><p>We could not co-localize sclerostin and lysosomes in situ as suggested due to technical obstacles. Namely, our lysosome staining tools (e.g., siR-Lysosome or Lysotracker) failed to work in fixed bones processed for sectioning and antibody staining. We tried several methods of detecting lysosomes in fixed, permeabilized bone sections but were unable to detect specific signal. Regardless, we think the new experiments in Figures 6E, Figure 7D, and Figure 1- supplement 1A present a convincing body of evidence that sclerostin downregulation occurs in osteocytes in situ (new data) and that inhibitors targeting distinct aspects of a mechano-signaling pathway (NOX2 or lysosomes, respectively) both block the downregulation of sclerostin in bone (new data) in addition to blunting load induced bone formation (in previous version).</p></body></sub-article></article>
