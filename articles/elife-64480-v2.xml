and is secreted mainly by the kidney upon hypoxic or anemic stress. The paucity of EPO production in renal EPO-producing cells (REPs) causes renal anemia, one of the most common complications of chronic nephropathies. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is commonly observed in several renal and hematopoietic disorders, the mechanism by which mitochondrial quality control impacts renal anemia remains elusive. In this study, we showed that FUNDC1, a mitophagy receptor, plays a critical role in EPO-driven erythropoiesis induced by stresses. Mechanistically, EPO production is impaired in REPs in <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice upon stresses, and the impairment is caused by the accumulation of damaged mitochondria, which consequently leads to the elevation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and triggers inflammatory responses by up-regulating proinflammatory cytokines. These inflammatory factors promote the myofibroblastic transformation of REPs, resulting in the reduction of EPO production. We therefore provide a link between aberrant mitophagy and deficient EPO generation in renal anemia. Our results also suggest that the mitochondrial quality control safeguards REPs under stresses, which may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of renal anemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Fundc1</kwd><kwd>mitophagy</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>renal EPO-producing cells</kwd><kwd>stress

regulated process in which red blood cells are generated from immature progenitors in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>). This process is mainly driven by the cytokine glycoprotein erythropoietin (EPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhrt and Wojchowski, 2015</xref>). Upon the engagement of EPO with its receptor, erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), the Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is activated to prevent committed erythroid progenitors from apoptosis and to facilitate their proliferation and differentiation into red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nandakumar et al., 2016</xref>). During the final maturation step of erythropoiesis, reticulocytes need to remove all of the remaining organelles, including mitochondria, endocytic vesicles, ribosomes, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gronowicz et al., 1984</xref>). Among them, mitochondria are the most abundant organelles for removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Prior studies have demonstrated that defects in mitochondrial removal are linked to the dysfunction of red blood cells and can lead to anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kundu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schweers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sandoval et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of mitochondrial quality control is of great significance for dissecting normal erythropoiesis and could elucidate the pathogenesis of dyserythropoietic diseases.</p><p>As one of the key regulators of erythropoiesis, EPO is primarily secreted by the kidneys during adulthood by the renal EPO-producing cells (REPs) located in the renal cortex and outer medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>). REPs possess functional plasticity for EPO production in response to hypoxia and other microenvironmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Souma et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, hypoxic stresses stabilize hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), especially HIF2α, which binds to the enhancer region of HIF binding element of the <italic>EPO</italic> gene and upregulates its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhrt and Wojchowski, 2015</xref>). Upon inflammation or with chronic diseases, however, proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa and IL1b, promote the myofibroblastic transition of REPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asada et al., 2011</xref>), concomitantly repress EPO production in REPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frede et al., 1997</xref>), and ultimately lead to anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiss and Goodnough, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue et al., 2010</xref>). Although mitochondrial quality control exerts protective roles in a variety of renal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), whether and how it might be implicated in REPs during chronic or inflammatory diseases remain unclear.</p><p>Mitochondria are essential organelles that maintain cellular energy and redox homeostasis and are the major source and target of intracellular oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). They also play central roles in regulating innate immunity and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). Maintaining normal mitochondrial activities and homeostasis is of great importance for cellular and organismal metabolisms and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yakes and Van Houten, 1997</xref>). Mitophagy, a selective type of autophagy that allows the elimination of unwanted or damaged mitochondria, is the major mechanism sustaining mitochondrial homeostasis and quality control. Mitophagy can be mediated by the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1-Parkin (PINK1-PAKN) pathway and/or by mitophagic receptors residing in the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu and Chen, 2015</xref>), such as BCL2 Interacting Protein 3 Like (BNIP3L, also named as NIX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Novak et al., 2010</xref>), BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanna et al., 2012</xref>), FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), Prohibitin2 (PHB2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wei et al., 2017</xref>), and FKBP Prolyl Isomerase 8 (FKBP8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saita et al., 2013</xref>) in mammalian cells. It has been demonstrated that receptor-mediated mitophagy is important for erythroid maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kundu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schweers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sandoval et al., 2008</xref>). For example, <italic>Bnip3l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit anemia and reticulocytosis with defective mitophagy due to the persistence of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the resultant depolarization in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schweers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sandoval et al., 2008</xref>). However, in the reticulocytes of the <italic>Bnip3l<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, mitochondrial removal still occurs, raising the possibility that additional factors are also required for mitochondrial degradation during red blood cell maturation.</p><p>We have previously shown that FUNDC1 functions as a specific mitophagy receptor in response to mitochondrial stresses, such as hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). FUNDC1 regulates mitochondrial homeostasis, including mitochondrial fission and fusion, content alteration, quality surveillance and physical interactions with other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Fundc1</italic> results in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and the activation of inflammasomes and is associated with a wide range of pathological conditions, such as hepatocarcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2018</xref>) and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Although the role of FUNDC1 has been studied in an array of cellular processes, whether it functions during EPO-driven erythropoiesis is still unexplored. In this study, using <italic>Fundc1</italic> germline deletion mice (<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice), we found that despite being dispensable for erythroid maturation, FUNDC1 regulates EPO production during stress erythropoiesis. Mechanistically, enhanced inflammatory responses in REPs lead to insufficient EPO production as a consequence of compromised mitophagy.

These findings led us to examine the potential link between EPO and HIFs in PHZ-treated <italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. To this end, we first measured the expression of HIF2α and its downstream targets, <italic>Vegf</italic> and <italic>Slc2a1</italic>, in the kidneys of PHZ-treated <italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Although HIF2α protein levels were sharply enhanced in kidneys of both WT and <italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice after PHZ treatment, the levels between WT and <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> kidneys were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar results were observed for the HIF2α targets <italic>Vegf</italic> and <italic>Slc2a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, the reduction of EPO secretion is unlikely to be caused by the aberrant transcriptional regulation of <italic>Epo</italic>. We also excluded the possibility of apoptosis in the kidneys of PHZ-<italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>How is EPO supply attenuated in PHZ-<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice? The key role of FUNDC1 in mitophagy led us to further test the efficiency of mitophagy. In immunohistochemical analysis of mitochondrial membrane protein Prohibitin 2 (PHB2), we found that PHZ treatment generally reduced the accumulation of total mitochondrial mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that PHZ stress could promote the mitophagic process. In contrast, <italic>Fundc1</italic> deletion resulted in more retainment of mitochondria in the kidneys than in the WT controls after PHZ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that mitophagy was attenuated in <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> kidneys under PHZ-induced stresses. To further support this notion, we found that the mitochondrial membrane proteins TIMM23, COXIV, and TOMM20 were more abundant in PHZ-<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> renal cells than in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).</p><p>The excessive mitochondrial accumulation may be due to either enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis or inefficient mitochondrial elimination. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we next examined mitochondrial biogenesis by determining the expression of the mitochondrial constitutive components of ATP synthase, including F1 subunit delta (<italic>Atp5d</italic>), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (<italic>Nrf1</italic>), and transcription factor A mitochondria (<italic>Tfam</italic>), and found no apparent differences between the kidneys of the PHZ-<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and the PHZ-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, <italic>Fundc1</italic> deletion has little impact on mitochondrial biogenesis. Instead, the expression of autophagic proteins of LC3-II and P62 in PHZ-<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> renal cells was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), suggesting that the accumulation of mitochondrial content is caused by defective autophagy.</p><p>The mitochondria, when damaged, are retained in the cytoplasm and inclined to release their DNA (mtDNA). Thus, to further confirm that deficient mitophagy was the cause of the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in PHZ-<italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse kidneys, we examined the level of total and leaked cytosolic mtDNA from the lysed kidneys in PHZ-<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. With this aim, we removed the nuclei (to exclude the genomic DNA contamination) and mitochondria (to exclude intrinsic mitochondrial DNA contamination) (see Materials and methods) and discovered that the total level of mtDNA was elevated, while the cytosolic mtDNA was indeed induced in PHZ-<italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> renal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Because cytosolic mtDNA acts as a critical trigger for cellular inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison, 2019</xref>), we then determined the level of inflammatory markers in renal cells and observed significant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including <italic>Il6</italic>, <italic>Tnfa</italic>, and <italic>Il1b</italic> in PHZ-treated kidneys of <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

We found that in WT REPs, the levels of mitochondrial membrane proteins (TIMM23, COXIV, and TOMM20) were sharply reduced upon hypoxic stress, concomitant with the enhanced conversion from LC3 I to II, a hallmark of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kabeya et al., 2000</xref>), indicating that hypoxia promotes the degradation of mitochondria by enhancing mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>).

Similar to hypoxia, PHZ also induced the accumulation of mitochondrial mass as revealed by MitoTracker staining in <italic>Fundc1</italic>-deleted REPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Furthermore, to quantify the efficiency of mitophagy more directly, we crossed <italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with the mitophagy reporter (mito-Keima) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), a mitochondrial-targeted transgenic mice, and generated the mito-Keima/<italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Because Keima, a coral-derived fluorescent protein, exhibits both pH-dependent excitation and resistance to lysosome proteinases, the mito-Keima mice allow for <italic>in vivo</italic> assessment of mitophagy based on the state of mitochondria. In mito-Keima mice, the free mitochondria (pH ~8.0) without undergoing mitophagy are green, while damaged or superfluous mitochondria are encapsulated in the lysosomes (pH ~4.5) through mitophagy, and with the altered pH value (from pH 8.0 to 4.5) the mitochondria become red. In a single cell, both green and red colors can be seen if substantial mitochondrial biosynthesis and mitophagy occur. Thus, the ratio of red and green fluorescent intensity reflects the efficiency of mitophagy <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>We next used flow cytometry to examine PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> REPs isolated from the mito-Keima/<italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and mito-Keima/WT mice treated with either PBS or PHZ, respectively. Although the fraction of mitochondria in the lysosome was elevated in PHZ-REPs from both mito-Keima/<italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (34.1 vs 48.4%) and mito-Keima/WT (32.7 vs 35.8%) mice, the proportion of encapsulated mitochondria was lower in PHZ-mito-Keima/<italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> than in PHZ-mito-Keima/WT mice (48.4 vs 35.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

Consequently, an elevation of the ROS level and the release of mtDNA from damaged mitochondria in REPs incur inflammatory responses by enhancing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including <italic>TNFa</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, and <italic>IL1b</italic>. These changes in the inflammatory milieu promote myofibroblastic transformation of REPs and the concomitant loss of EPO production capacity and, ultimately, lead to renal anemia. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first link between mitophagy and the inflammatory state in REPs, demonstrating that mitophagy and mitochondrial quality control play protective roles in REP function and renal anemia.</p><p>Additionally, it is somewhat surprising that FUNDC1 is dispensable for the programmed mitochondrial elimination in the final step of erythroid maturation, whereas another mitophagy receptor BNIP3L is required for the removal of mitochondria in reticulocytes during terminal erythroid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schweers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sandoval et al., 2008</xref>).

Thus, it appears that the function of FUNDC1 and BNIP3L is highly context- and cell-type dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mitochondrial quality and EPO production in REPs</title><p>Renal EPO production is central for erythropoiesis. It has been well-established that HIF2α plays essential roles in hypoxia-induced <italic>EPO</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Semenza et al., 1991</xref>). In this study, we found that the expression of HIF2α is largely unaffected by <italic>Fundc1</italic> deletion, indicating that reduced EPO production in <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is likely to be unrelated to the oxygen-sensing mechanism. Instead, the low yield of EPO may be due to the reduced number of REPs and/or compromised function during REP transformation to myofibroblasts.

We argue that inefficient mitophagy caused by <italic>Fundc1</italic> deletion results in the loss of EPO production in REPs, resembling the clinical manifestations of renal anemia. Therefore, by selectively removing the damaged mitochondria, mitophagy represents an essential element of mitochondrial quality control in response to renal injury or anemia caused by UUO, PHZ, or cisplatin. Although PDGFRβ is the most frequently used surface marker to identify or isolate REPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broeker et al., 2020</xref>), PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> cells are heterogenous and dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the role of mitophagy in REPs awaits future investigation.</p><p>In addition, defective mitophagy might also result in metabolic reprogramming, which is widely observed in renal epithelial cells or myofibroblast transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livingston et al., 2019</xref>), and the alteration in mitochondrial metabolism may regulate EPO production epigenetically. In line with this speculation, DNMTs, including DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, are upregulated, suggesting that altered epigenetic modifications might be responsible for the reduced EPO production in <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> REPs, consistent with previous observations in mouse myofibroblast-transformed REPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Souma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2016</xref>) and the cell lines generated from EPO-producing cells without the capabilities of EPO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yin and Blanchard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steinmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sato et al., 2019</xref>).

Renal anemia adversely affects the quality of patients’ life and is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 1998</xref>). The treatment of renal anemia has long been dependent on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron supplement in chronic kidney diseases, raising the concerns of increased patients’ death and cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Solomon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlius et al., 2009</xref>).

Despite the established correlation between inflammation and REP fibrotic conversion, it is largely unclear how the upstream pathological inflammatory pathways are triggered in REPs and how mitochondrial quality control is linked to REPs in chronic kidney disorders or injuries. In this study, we showed that the kidney of <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice displays a more severe fibrotic phenotype in UUO model. Concomitant with the inability of REPs to secret EPO, these cells undergo myofibroblastic conversion. Thus, receptor-mediated mitophagy protects against renal anemia and possible renal fibrosis. In addition, we found that <italic>Fundc1</italic> is abundantly and widely expressed in the kidney. It is therefore highly likely that FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy might also play crucial roles in other types of renal cells besides REPs, and that these cells might also contribute to the death of <italic>Fundc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice under PHZ stresses. For example, during this study, it was reported that FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy in tubule cells plays protective roles in ischemic acute kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). It appears that targeting FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy should have pleiotropic therapeutic impacts by ‘killing two birds with one stone’. In renal fibrosis, enhanced mitophagy might not only ameliorate anemia by attenuating inflammation in REPs, but also alleviate fibrosis by preserving and protecting the mitochondrial quality from other fibrogenic contributing cells. These exciting possibilities should be examined in future investigations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse experiments</title><p>Mice were maintained in the animal core facility of College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.

The study reveals that FUNDC1 loss results in the accumulation of impaired mitochondria in renal EPO producing cells, inflammation, myofibroblastic transformation, and reduced EPO production and anemia in experimental models of acute anemia or kidney injury. The results suggest that FUNDC1 is required for mitochondrial removal during erythropoiesis, and provide new insights into the anemia of kidney disease. The reviewers have raised several major concerns related to the strengths of the main conclusions. The complete comments are included.</p><p>Reviewer 1 also suggested that the title of the manuscript and other relevant texts need to be revised to better reflect the main findings or additional evidence is needed to support the conclusions related to stress erythropoiesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It is important to provide more convincing evidence to support the conclusions related to severe anemia or stress erythropoiesis observed in FUNDC1-deleted mice, or the major conclusions should be significantly revised.</p><p>2. Evidence is needed to show whether defective mitophagy results in reduced Epo production, thus supporting the conclusion that the defective mitophagy observed in FUNDC1-deleted kidney is responsible for the decreased Epo production and associated phenotypes. A more direct experiment is required to assess the effect of PHZ on Epo production in Fundc1-/- kidney cells. To further support the hypothesis, supplemental Epo administration should be performed to examine the effects on the abnormalities observed in the Fundc1-/- mice.</p><p>3. It is important to provide evidence for mitochondrial retention in a model for kidney disease that is accompanied by anemia. Such studies will strengthen the conclusion that FUNDC1 deficiency contributes to anemia associated with kidney disease by regulating mitophagy.</p><p>4. Given the modest effects on blood cell production, the conclusions that FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy is not required for reticulocyte maturation need to be qualified or significantly revised.</p><p>5. PHZ leads to significant reduction of Epo transcript in FUNDC1-deleted kidney cells but only a mild reduction of serum Epo level. This discrepancy should be explained.</p><p>6. Given the modest effects observed in FUNDC1-deleted mice and the limitations of the PHZ-induced acute anemia, it is important to include studies using a model for chronic anemia, and examine the effects of modest Epo deficiency effects over time.

Repeated phlebotomy may help to assess the role of Fundc1 in chronic anemia could have a more profound effect than what was observed after a single PHZ treatment.</p><p>7. Given the limitations of analyzing p62 and LC3 expression to represent altered autophagy, additional experiments are required to support conclusions related to autophagy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have contributed substantially to the understanding of FUNDC1 as a mitophagic receptor in multiple cell types and disease conditions including hypoxia-mediated mitophagy in mammalian cells, inhibition of inflammasome activation, ischemia-reperfusion injury to the heart. Here the authors turned their attention to the kidney and showed that lack of FUNDC1 results in the accumulation of impaired mitochondria in EPO producing cells (REPs), leading to an inflammatory response, a myofibroblastic transformation of REPs, resulting in reduced EPO production and anemia in two experimental models including PHZ and UUO. Work presented here indicates that FUNDC1 does not play a role in mitochondrial removal during erythropoiesis. Overall, the paper is well written and presents strong evidence showing the importance of FUNDC1-mediated mitophage in renal fibrosis-mediated anemia by reducing the Epo production. However, the paper can be improvde by addressing following major concern:</p><p>The title and manuscript's emphasis of FUNDC1-mediaetd mitopahge regulting &quot;stress eythropoiesis&quot; are misleading. One of major complications of renal fibrosis is anemia due to the reduced production of Epo. Thus, simply because a particular protein deficiency results in renal fibrosis and reduced EPO production does not mean that such a protein should be considered as a regulator of &quot;stress erythropoiesis&quot; as implied by the title and multiple places in the manuscript. The findings showed here support that FUNDC1 protects against the accumulation of impaired mitochondria, inflammation, renal fibrosis and reduced EPO production and thus the development of major complication of anemia but not stress erythropoesis. Please consider to revise the title and text to avoid misleading and confusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Shi et al., analyzes the effect of deletion of mitophagy receptor FUNDC1 in mice on erythropoiesis and kidney production of erythropoietin (Epo). The authors have performed a considerable amount of work and generated a large set of data. Since the authors did not find any effect of FUNDC1 deletion on hematopoiesis or erythropoiesis, they subjected mice to erythroid stress by inducing hemolytic anemia using the established phenylhydrazine (PHZ) treatment. Mice survival in response to phenylhydrazine was reduced and attributed to severe anemia. They noticed a mild reduction in Epo production in response to phenylhydrazine. They then focused on kidney production of Epo. They confirm that FUNDC1-deleted kidney cells exhibit defective mitophagy, and PHZ treatment enhanced defective mitophagy in FUNDC1-deleted kidney cells. They attributed this defect to reduced Epo production. There are two major problems in this manuscript. One is that in contrary to the authors assertion, it is unclear whether FUNDC1-deleted mice exhibit anemia (hemoglobin is not reported in PHZ-treated mice and other RBC indices are very mild) but possibly only a reduced compensated red blood cell production in response to phenylhydrazine treatment. The other is that although the authors confirm that FUNDC1-deleted kidney cells exhibit defective mitophagy that is more pronounced in PHZ-treated animals, they do not show that reduced Epo production results from defective mitophagy. My specific comments are below:</p><p>– There is no evidence of mitochondrial retention in the spleen, BM and PB. The authors use CD71 as a marker but it is unclear on which cells.</p><p>– Although the survival in response to phenylhydrazine is reduced which was achieved by using 100mg/kg (instead of the usual dose of 50mg/kg) and including 30 mice (p=0.04), there was no severe anemia. In fact Hb levels are normal and the slight reduction in red blood cell indices suggest that there was a mild reduced red blood cell production that did not reach the definition of anemia. So, in the absence of anemia the claim that Fundc1-mediated mitophagy is not required for reticulocyte maturation is not accurate.</p><p>– It remains unclear what animals die from.</p><p>– The authors FACS-sort reticulocytes 5 days post phenylhydrazine. This is an interesting experiment. What conditions for the FACS sorting do they use?</p><p>– From Figure S2 it seems that the authors FACS-sorted immature erythroblasts but not reticulocytes, the data on mitochondria in these cells also seems to be from immature erythroid cells. The authors should clarify how they distinguish reticulocytes from immature erythroblasts.</p><p>– The authors state: &quot;Together, our results suggest that FUNDC1- mediated mitophagy is</p><p>dispensable for programmed mitochondrial elimination in reticulocytes during</p><p>erythroid maturation.&quot; It is difficult to assess the validity of this statement given that it is unclear which cells were used in these experiment.</p><p>– The authors examine differential gene expression in R2 erythroblast subpopulation between cells from mice subjected to PHZ treatment or not. They use RNA-Seq analysis of R2 and identify among others JAK-STAT pathway to be differentially expressed in PHZ treated Fundc1-/- spleens. They conclude that JAK-STAT is hypoactivated in Fundc1-/- R2 cells. Given that the reduced RBC production seem to be compensated (see R3, R4) does not seem to be highly affected this result seems to indicate compensated JAK-STAT hypoactivation.</p><p>– How do the authors explain that Epo reduction in Fundc1-/- cells has an effect solely on R2 spleen cells?</p><p>– The significant reduction of Epo transcript in kidney cells in response to PHZ is interesting but how does this correlate with a mild reduction of Epo in PB?</p><p>– To determine the role of defective mitophagy on Epo production, the authors selected PDGFRB+ and – cells and subjected to hypoxia. A more direct experiment is to assess the effect of PHZ on Epo production in Fundc1-/- kidney cells instead they have measured mitochondrial mass which does not address their hypothesis.</p><p>– How are experiments in 4M and 3A different? What is missing is the effect of PHZ on Fundc1-/- PDGFRB+ cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors show that loss of the mitophagy receptor Fundc1 in mice causes defects in stress erythropoiesis by impairing the production of Epo by the kidney, with defective mitophagy of Epo-producing cells. This is interesting work that has the potential to provide insights into the anemia of kidney disease. However, the overall effects seem to be fairly modest and several of the studies must be investigated further to support the claims to a reasonable level. Notably, modest impairment of Epo production could lead to significant anemia over time, but this is not shown. Perhaps the most important problem is that study does not examine a model for anemia of kidney disease.</p><p>1. Following PHZ administration to the <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the reductions in blood HCT and RBC, splenic erythroblast number and serum Epo concentration relative to WT mice are very mild. So while Fundc1 may have a role in maintaining Epo production during stress, the effect seems to be relatively minor, at least as revealed in the current assay. As the authors point out, Fundc1 may have a role in chronic stress erythropoiesis. In this regard, they may want to examine a more chronic model for anemia to examine the effects of modest Epo deficiency effects over time (see point #3).</p><p>2. To support further their hypothesis that delayed recovery from PHZ is not due to erythroid-intrinsic problems, the investigators should show that supplemental Epo administration eliminates the abnormalities observed in the <italic>Fundc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>3. The effects of Fundc1 loss on serum Epo levels after PHZ are relatively modest (Figure 2I), while the effects on kidney Epo mRNA are more extreme (Figure 3A). How can this discrepancy be explained? Perhaps measuring the kinetics of these parameters at a few timepoints after PHZ administration would help to reconcile these differences and be informative.</p><p>4. It might be useful to examine a different model for stress anemia. PHZ is a strong oxidant. Therefore, its effects on REPs could be due to oxidative stress rather than the erythropoietic demand of anemia. Investigating the effects of phlebotomy might be useful to distinguish the effects of oxidative stress from pure anemia. Additionally, repeated phlebotomy might allow the investigators to assess the role of Fundc1 in chronic anemia where the effects of Epo deficiency over time could have a more profound effect than what was observed after a single PHZ treatment.</p><p>5. The authors use one week of UUO treatment as a model for acute kidney disease. They show in this model that loss of Fundc1 causes enhanced accumulation of inflammatory markers, increased mitochondrial ROS and modest reductions in Epo compared to WT mice. However, they do not show that the model causes anemia in WT or Fundc1-/- mice. In order to substantiate a major claim of this manuscript, it is essential that the investigators examine the effects of Fund1c loss in a model for anemia of kidney disease, preferably a chronic one.</p><p>6. One central hypothesis is that Fundc1 deficiency promotes retention of abnormal mitochondria, inflammation and transformation to myofibroblast (abstract and line 470). However, the data do not show this. Rather, they report induction of some fibroblastic markers but constant numbers of REPs. Would it be possible to show this data?-- specifically co-staining of kidney cells for Epo mRNA or protein and PDGFb to quantify the number of REPs and their Epo induction.</p><p>7. In general, all of the histology slides in this manuscript are not well explained. For example, the histology in Figure S4C should be interpreted. What are the signs of renal injury? Is there evidence of injury throughout the kidney or specifically in Epo producing cells? The figure legends of all micrographs should include interpretation of the histopathology with the abnormal regions indicated on the micrograph.</p><p>8. Figure 3 Western blots – it is difficult to appreciate some of the differences in protein expression between WT vs mutant kidney. All western blots should include quantification of multiple experiments.</p><p>9. In several experiments, the authors interpret altered expression of p62 and LC3 as representing altered autophagy. This is not correct. Autophagy rates cannot be inferred by steady state measurements of these proteins. Enhanced autophagy could also deplete these proteins! Use of the Keima reporter seems more correct. Along the same lines, if Fundc1 is the mitochondrial autophagy adaptor in kidney, then what is the role of LC3 or p62 and how would their altered expression relate to mitophagy versus other autophagy pathways?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64480.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>All the reviewers find the work of interest by analyzing the erythroid defects caused by deletion of mitophagy receptor FUNDC1 in mice.

This is interesting work that has the potential to provide insights into the anemia of kidney disease. However, the overall effects seem to be fairly modest and several of the studies must be investigated further to support the claims to a reasonable level. Notably, modest impairment of Epo production could lead to significant anemia over time, but this is not shown. Perhaps the most important problem is that study does not examine a model for anemia of kidney disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Following PHZ administration to the Fundc1-/- mice, the reductions in blood HCT and RBC, splenic erythroblast number and serum Epo concentration relative to WT mice are very mild. So while Fundc1 may have a role in maintaining Epo production during stress, the effect seems to be relatively minor, at least as revealed in the current assay. As the authors point out, Fundc1 may have a role in chronic stress erythropoiesis. In this regard, they may want to examine a more chronic model for anemia to examine the effects of modest Epo deficiency effects over time (see point #3).</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to Essential revision 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To support further their hypothesis that delayed recovery from PHZ is not due to erythroid-intrinsic problems, the investigators should show that supplemental Epo administration eliminates the abnormalities observed in the Fundc1-/- mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to Essential revision 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The effects of Fundc1 loss on serum Epo levels after PHZ are relatively modest (Figure 2I), while the effects on kidney Epo mRNA are more extreme (Figure 3A). How can this discrepancy be explained? Perhaps measuring the kinetics of these parameters at a few timepoints after PHZ administration would help to reconcile these differences and be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to Essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It might be useful to examine a different model for stress anemia. PHZ is a strong oxidant. Therefore, its effects on REPs could be due to oxidative stress rather than the erythropoietic demand of anemia. Investigating the effects of phlebotomy might be useful to distinguish the effects of oxidative stress from pure anemia. Additionally, repeated phlebotomy might allow the investigators to assess the role of Fundc1 in chronic anemia where the effects of Epo deficiency over time could have a more profound effect than what was observed after a single PHZ treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to Essential revision 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors use one week of UUO treatment as a model for acute kidney disease. They show in this model that loss of Fundc1 causes enhanced accumulation of inflammatory markers, increased mitochondrial ROS and modest reductions in Epo compared to WT mice. However, they do not show that the model causes anemia in WT or Fundc1-/- mice. In order to substantiate a major claim of this manuscript, it is essential that the investigators examine the effects of Fund1c loss in a model for anemia of kidney disease, preferably a chronic one.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated a cisplatin-induced renal anemic model to measure the role of Fundc1.

One central hypothesis is that Fundc1 deficiency promotes retention of abnormal mitochondria, inflammation and transformation to myofibroblast (abstract and line 470). However, the data do not show this. Rather, they report induction of some fibroblastic markers but constant numbers of REPs. Would it be possible to show this data?-- specifically co-staining of kidney cells for Epo mRNA or protein and PDGFb to quantify the number of REPs and their Epo induction.</p></disp-quote><p>It is an excellent idea.

In several experiments, the authors interpret altered expression of p62 and LC3 as representing altered autophagy. This is not correct.
