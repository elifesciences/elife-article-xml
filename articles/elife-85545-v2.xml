DEAD-box protein Dhh1 has been implicated as an activator of decapping, in coupling codon non-optimality to enhanced degradation, and as a translational repressor, but its functions in cells are incompletely understood. RNA-Seq analyses coupled with CAGE sequencing of all capped mRNAs revealed increased abundance of hundreds of mRNAs in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells that appears to result directly from impaired decapping rather than elevated transcription. Interestingly, only a subset of mRNAs requires Dhh1 for targeting by Dcp2, and also generally requires the other decapping activators Pat1, Edc3, or Scd6; whereas most of the remaining transcripts utilize nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factors for Dcp2-mediated turnover. Neither inefficient translation initiation nor stalled elongation appears to be a major driver of Dhh1-enhanced mRNA degradation. Surprisingly, ribosome profiling revealed that <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ confers widespread changes in relative translational efficiencies (TEs) that generally favor well-translated mRNAs. Because ribosome biogenesis is reduced while capped mRNA abundance is increased by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ<italic>,</italic> we propose that an increased ratio of mRNA to ribosomes increases competition among mRNAs for limiting ribosomes to favor efficiently translated mRNAs in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells. Interestingly, genes involved in respiration or utilization of alternative carbon or nitrogen sources are upregulated, and both mitochondrial function and cell filamentation are elevated in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells, suggesting that decapping sculpts gene expression post-transcriptionally to fine-tune metabolic pathways and morphological transitions according to nutrient availability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decapping</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>Dcp2</kwd><kwd>Dhh1</kwd><kwd>NMD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL117880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>Miriam L</given-names></name><name><surname>Onu</surname><given-names>Chisom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vandermeulen</surname><given-names>Matthew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Cullen</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1951332</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Zhenguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The yeast mRNA decapping enzyme Dcp1/Dcp2 repressses many genes whose products are required on poor carbon or nitrogen sources in nutrient-replete cells by mRNA decapping and degradation or translational repression, adding post-transcriptional controls to the transcriptional repression of these functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The translation and degradation of mRNAs are intertwined, as the 5′ m<sup>7</sup>G cap and 3′ poly(A) tail are involved in both mechanisms. In general, translation is initiated by association of initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4G with the capped 5′ end of mRNA followed by recruitment of the small (40S) subunit of the ribosome pre-loaded with other initiation factors and initiator methionyl tRNA. Interaction between eIF4G and poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) stabilizes a ‘closed-loop’ mRNP conformation that both protects the mRNA from degradation and enhances translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ghosh and Jacobson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). In yeast, degradation is generally initiated by shortening of the poly(A) tail (deadenylation), catalyzed by the Pan2/Pan3 and Ccr4–Not deadenylase complexes. Deadenylation is followed by either 3′ to 5′ exonucleolytic degradation by the cytoplasmic exosome or decapping by the Dcp1/Dcp2 holoenzyme with attendant 5′ to 3′ degradation by the exoribonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parker, 2012</xref>). Dcp2-mediated decapping is critical for multiple mRNA decay pathways including bulk 5′ to 3′ decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker and Parker, 1993</xref>), nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) triggered by premature termination codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He and Jacobson, 2001</xref>), AU-rich mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barreau et al., 2005</xref>), microRNA-mediated turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>), and transcript-specific degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badis et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Dcp2 consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) followed by a Nudix superfamily hydrolase domain, attached to an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region (IDR) that contains short leucine-rich helical motifs (HLMs). Dcp1 enhances Dcp2 catalytic activity by interacting with the Dcp2 NRD and is essential for mRNA decapping in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beelman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steiger et al., 2003</xref>). Although Dcp1 promotes the closed conformation of Dcp2, the active site is not fully formed and the RNA-binding site is blocked by the NRD, thus forming a catalytically incompetent enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wurm et al., 2017</xref>). Additional factors stimulate the catalytic activity of the Dcp1/Dcp2 complex, including enhancer of decapping (Edc) proteins. Interaction of Dcp1 with yeast Edc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borja et al., 2011</xref>) stabilizes the active conformation of the Dcp1/Dcp2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wurm et al., 2017</xref>). Autoinhibitory motifs in the IDR interact with the core domain of Dcp2 and stabilize the inactive conformation of Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He and Jacobson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paquette et al., 2018</xref>). Edc1 alone cannot overcome the inhibitory effect of the IDR, requiring additional stimulation by Edc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paquette et al., 2018</xref>). The LSm domain of Edc3 binds to HLMs located in the IDR and activates decapping by alleviating autoinhibition and promoting RNA binding by Dcp2 in yeast, and deleting the autoinhibitory region bypasses activation by Edc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He and Jacobson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paquette et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Dhh1, Pat1, Scd6, and Lsm1–7 also activate Dcp1/Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parker, 2012</xref>). Edc3 and Scd6 may act interchangeably in recruiting Dhh1 to the same segment of the Dcp2 IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2022</xref>). HLMs in Dcp2 additionally mediate interaction with Pat1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charenton et al., 2017</xref>), although the Pat1/Lsm1–7 complex can also bind to the 3′ ends of deadenylated mRNAs to stimulate decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tharun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tharun and Parker, 2001</xref>). Numerous contacts were identified among the decapping activators, as Dhh1 interacts with Pat1, Scd6, and Edc3, and Pat1 interacts with Scd6 in addition to Lsm1–7, as well as with Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nissan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He and Jacobson, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, Dhh1 and the Pat1/Lsm1–7 complex appear to target distinct subsets of mRNAs with overlapping substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2018</xref>). From these results and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2022</xref>), it can be proposed that the decapping activators assemble distinct decapping complexes that target different subsets of mRNAs for degradation. Dhh1, Pat1, Scd6, and Lsm1–7, along with Dcp1/Dcp2, are found concentrated in processing bodies (PBs) with translationally repressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>), consistent with a role in translational repression in addition to mRNA turnover. Recently, Edc3 and Scd6 were shown to retain Dcp2 in the cytoplasm, preventing import of Dcp1/Dcp2 into the nucleus where it cannot function in cytoplasmic mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tishinov and Spang, 2021</xref>). Thus, decapping activators can stimulate decapping by multiple, distinct mechanisms.</p><p>Dhh1 is a conserved ATP-dependent DEAD-box helicase involved in translation repression and mRNA decay in yeast. Dhh1 and its orthologs in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (Ste13), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (CGH-1), <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (Xp54), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (Me31b), and mammals (RCK/p54) interact with factors involved in deadenylation, decapping and translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maillet and Collart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Weston and Sommerville, 2006</xref>). Dhh1 promotes decapping-mediated mRNA turnover, as deadenylated capped mRNAs are stabilized in <italic>dhh1</italic>Δ cells. Moreover, recombinant Dhh1 stimulates the decapping activity of the purified decapping enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer and Weis, 2002</xref>). The mRNAs preferentially targeted for decay by Dhh1 or Pat1/Lsm1–7 appear to be inefficiently translated at the elongation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although most yeast mRNAs are targeted by a common degradation pathway, the half-lives of individual mRNAs vary greatly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coller and Parker, 2004</xref>). Specific sequence and structural elements present in 5′ or 3′ UTRs, and poly(A) tail lengths, can modulate the degradation rate; however, these features alone do not explain the variation in half-lives among all transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Muhlrad and Parker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geisberg et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, codon optimality—the balance between the supply of charged tRNA molecules in the cytoplasmic pool and the demand of tRNA usage by translating ribosomes—was identified as a determinant of mRNA decay. Evidence indicates that non-optimal codons, which are decoded by ribosomes more slowly than optimal codons, accelerate mRNA decay co-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence support the model that Dhh1 binds to ribosomes elongating slowly through non-optimum codons to trigger decapping and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, cryo-EM analysis revealed that the N-terminal region of Not5 interacts with the E-site of ribosomes stalled at suboptimal codons with an empty A-site, leading to the model that ribosomes stalled at suboptimal codons are detected by Not5/Caf1 and targeted for degradation via Dhh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>). Much of the evidence indicating that codon non-optimality is a major determinant of mRNA instability derives from reporter transcripts with relatively long strings of non-optimal or optimal codons, which likely does not pertain to many native mRNAs.</p><p>A different model proposes that translation initiation and decay are inversely related, with functional initiation complexes impeding both decapping and deadenylation. Thus, mutations impairing the cap-binding eIF4F complex or initiation factor eIF3 that reduce translation initiation accelerate degradation of particular yeast mRNAs via elevated deadenylation and decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schwartz and Parker, 1999</xref>). Strong secondary structures in the 5′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Muhlrad et al., 1995</xref>) and poor start codon context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LaGrandeur and Parker, 1999</xref>) increased decapping. Moreover, binding of eIF4E to the cap structure was sufficient to inhibit decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schwartz and Parker, 2000</xref>). From these findings it can be predicted that translation initiation, directly or indirectly, competes with the decay machinery in a manner that influences mRNA turnover rates. Indeed, non-invasive measurements of mRNA half-lives suggested that competition between translation initiation and mRNA decay factors is a major determinant of yeast mRNA turnover, whereas global inhibition of elongation generally led to stabilization vs. degradation of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Starving yeast for glucose engenders a rapid loss of protein synthesis, accompanied by a shift of mRNAs from polysomes to free mRNPs and an increase in both size and number of PBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arribere et al., 2011</xref>). Deletion of <italic>DHH1</italic> or <italic>PAT1</italic> partially impaired the loss of polysomes evoked by glucose depletion, whereas deletion of both genes simultaneously abrogated translational repression, indicating that both Dhh1 and Pat1 are required for repression of translation initiation during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of Dhh1 or Pat1 in wild-type (WT) cells conferred a general repression of translation with attendant PB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). These findings suggested that Dhh1 and Pat1 act as general repressors of translation in glucose-starved yeast. Consistent with this, Dhh1 can inhibit translation initiation in vitro by blocking assembly of 48S preinitiation complexes (PICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, the recovery of polysomes during stress in <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ and <italic>pat1</italic>∆ mutants could result indirectly from a broad stabilization of mRNAs that helps to restore 48 S PIC assembly by mass action and overcome inhibition of PIC formation during stress produced by other means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, impairing the functions of RNA helicases eIF4A and Ded1, which normally stimulate 48S PIC assembly, is involved in suppressing translation during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iserman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sen et al., 2021</xref>). Other evidence indictes that Dhh1 can directly impede translation elongation by associating with slowly moving ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, the Not4 subunit of Ccr4–Not complex, as well as Dhh1 and Dcp1, were implicated in translational repression of mRNAs that exhibit transient ribosome stalling in a manner that limits protein misfolding during nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that multiple factors that stimulate mRNA decay can also repress translation at the initiation or elongation steps during nutrient starvation. Interestingly, Dhh1 helicase activity was reported to enhance, not repress, translation of <italic>ATG1</italic> and <italic>ATG13</italic> mRNAs required for autophagy during nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Ribosome profiling of <italic>dhh1</italic>Δ cells grown in rich medium uncovered hundreds of mRNAs displaying either increased or decreased relative TEs, suggesting that Dhh1 can function as a translational repressor or activator for distinct sets of mRNAs, even in nonstarvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jungfleisch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeidan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on its central role in mRNA decapping, most studies on Dcp2 have focused primarily on mRNA decay, and the participation of Dcp2 in regulating translation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that in nutrient-replete cells Dcp2 modulates translation in addition to mRNA turnover by pathways both dependent and independent of decapping activator Dhh1. Surprisingly, a large fraction of mRNAs appear to be targeted for degradation by Dcp2 independently of Dhh1, Pat1, Edc3, or Scd6, which are enriched for NMD substrates; whereas the remaining fraction is controlled concurrently by all four decapping activators. Codon non-optimality does not appear to be a major driver of mRNA degradation for either set of Dcp2-targeted mRNAs. Unexpectedly, ribosome profiling revealed that <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ confers widespread TE changes that generally favor mRNAs well translated in WT cells at the expense of more poorly translated mRNAs. This competition can be attributed to increased mRNA abundance, resulting from impaired decapping/decay, coupled with reduced ribosome production. Superimposed on this general reprogramming is a Dhh1-dependent translational repression of certain poorly translated mRNAs by Dcp2. Finally, we provide evidence that Dcp2 helps to repress the abundance or translation of many mRNAs encoding proteins whose functions are dispensable during growth on glucose-replete rich medium, involved in catabolism of non-preferred carbon or nitrogen sources, mitochondrial respiration, or cell filamentation and invasive growth. These findings support the emerging model that regulators of mRNA turnover add a layer of post-transcriptional control to well-established transcriptional repression mechanisms that control various responses to nutrient limitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dcp2 controls mRNA abundance via both Dhh1-dependent and -independent pathways</title><p>To determine the role of Dcp2 and Dhh1 in regulating mRNA abundance and translation in nutrient-replete cells, we interrogated our previous ribosome profiling and RNA-Seq datasets obtained from isogenic WT, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ, <italic>dhh1</italic>Δ and <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ<italic>dhh1</italic>Δ strains cultured in nutrient-rich YPD medium at 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeidan et al., 2018</xref>).

These results are significant in revealing two groups of mRNAs whose abundance is repressed by Dcp2 in a manner that (1) generally requires the concerted action of Dhh1, Pat1, and Edc3/Scd6 (Dhh1-dependent group) or (2) frequently requires the NMD factors but none of the other four decapping activators, nor even one of the Edc3/Scd6 and Dhh1/Pat1 pairs of activators, for repression by Dcp2 (Dhh1-independent group).</p><p>As noted above, previous findings have suggested that a key determinant of decapping and mRNA decay is the rate of translation at either the initiation or elongation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanson et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, Dhh1 has been implicated in targeting mRNAs enriched for slowly decoded non-optimal codons for decapping and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>).

However, these mRNAs have only a slightly lower species-specific tRNA adaptation index (stAI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, col. 2), a measure of codon optimality that quantifies the relative cellular supply of cognate and near-cognate tRNAs for a given codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that their lower TEs generally reflect slower rates of initiation vs. elongation. Importantly, the Dhh1-dependent subset of Dcp2-repressed mRNAs exhibits average TEs and stAI values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>, col. 3). We found that the mRNAs elevated by <italic>dhh1Δ</italic> in two other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jungfleisch et al., 2017</xref>) similarly exhibit average median TEs and stAIs.

Our findings here that the mRNAs repressed most strongly by Dcp2 exhibit average codon optimality might be explained if these mRNAs contain short runs of suboptimal codons that trigger Dhh1-dependent decapping despite an average frequency of poor codons; alternatively, other properties besides codon optimality could be more important in dictating preferential degradation by Dcp2/Dhh1.</p><p>Consistent with previous results on NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celik et al., 2017</xref>), the Dhh1-independent transcripts exhibit lower median TE and stAI values compared to all Dcp2-repressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>, cols. 4 vs. 2).

It is unclear whether any of these attributes of Dhh1-independent mRNAs are instrumental in enhancing decapping/degradation, or in targeting NMD factors to the Upf1-dependent members of the group; however, it has been suggested that low codon optimality may increase frameshifting errors that lead to premature termination events recognized by the Upf proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celik et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Both Dhh1-dependent and -independent repression of mRNA abundance by Dcp2 appears to involve decapping and degradation rather than reduced transcription</title><p>It was shown previously that <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ and many other slow-growing yeast mutants exhibit changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O’Duibhir et al., 2014</xref>) that correspond to the Environmental Stress Response (ESR), wherein hundreds of mRNAs are either repressed (rESR, 545 genes) or induced (iESR, 283 genes) stereotypically in response to diverse stress or starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>).

Recent findings indicate that many transcripts decapped by Dcp1/Dcp2 undergo 5′ to 3′ degradation while associated with translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2009</xref>), with Xrn1 following the last translating ribosomes loaded on mRNA prior to decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). Such decapped degradation intermediates may account for ~12% of the polyadenylated mRNA population in WT yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). We reasoned that mRNAs targeted preferentially for decapping and degradation by Dcp2 should be enriched for such decapped degradation intermediates and hence exhibit a greater than average proportion of uncapped transcripts in WT cells, which will be eliminated in the <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ mutant. In contrast, mRNAs that are up-regulated indirectly as the result of increased transcription in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells should exhibit an average proportion of uncapped isoforms in WT. These predictions are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> for an idealized scenario of enhanced mRNA decapping/degradation (model (i)) vs. elevated transcription (model (ii)). To evaluate these predictions, we measured the abundance of capped isoforms for all expressed transcripts by CAGE (cap analysis of gene expression), using a revised no-amplification-nontagging technique (nAnT-iCAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murata et al., 2014</xref>), and subjected the same RNA samples from WT and <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells to standard RNA-Seq. We calculated the ratios of capped transcripts per million (TPM) from nAnT-iCAGE to the total TPMs calculated from RNA-Seq (dubbed C/T) as a proxy for the fraction of capped transcripts for each gene in the two strains. (Because the nAnT-iCAGE and RNA-Seq data were normalized individually, the C/T ratios are relative rather than actual proportions of capped transcripts). If increased mRNA levels in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells result from impaired decapping/decay vs. increased transcription, we expect to observe lower than average C/T ratios in WT cells for the mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>∆ transcripts up-regulated by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆. To validate this approach, we similarly compared WT and isogenic <italic>xrn1</italic>Δ cells, reasoning that eliminating Xrn1-mediated 5′ to 3′ degradation should lead to accumulation of decapped, rather than capped, intermediates for the set of transcripts preferentially targeted for degradation by Dcp1/Dcp2 and Xrn1.</p><p>We observed strong correlations (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.99) between biological replicates for WT, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ, and <italic>xrn1</italic>Δ cells, for both nAnT-iCAGE-Seq and parallel RNA-Seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>).

Decapped mRNA degradation intermediates exhibit three-nucleotide periodicity generated by Xrn1 exonucleolytic cleavage behind the last translating ribosomes, and the CPI metric captures the prevalence of such intermediates for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ group exhibits higher than average CPIs, indicating a greater than average involvement of decapping and co-translational degradation by Xrn1 in their decay, whereas the mRNA_dn_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ transcripts exhibit lower than average CPI values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), consistent with the involvement of an alternative degradation pathway controlling their abundance.</p><p>Finally, to investigate the possible contribution of increased transcription to increased mRNA abundance conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ, we performed ChIP-Seq on RNA Polymerase II subunit Rpb1 to measure Pol II occupancies across the CDSs of each gene.

We observed excellent correlations among the Rpb1 occupancies determined in three biological replicates (<italic>r</italic> = 0.99, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). To measure absolute changes in mRNA abundance, we repeated the RNA-Seq experiments by adding a fixed amount of External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) transcripts to equal amounts of total RNA from WT and <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells prior to preparation of cDNA libraries. Importantly, the spike-in normalized RNA-Seq data revealed a median increase of 24% in bulk mRNA in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, col. 1), indicating elevated total mRNA levels in cells lacking Dcp2. We identified groups of transcripts with &gt;1.4-fold absolute changes in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells (FDR &lt;0.01), dubbed mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ_A and mRNA_dn_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ_A, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, cols. 3 and 5). (The ERCC spike-in shrank the group of down-regulated mRNAs while expanding the group of up-regulated mRNAs because many mRNAs that show reduced relative abundance compared to the average gene exhibit increased absolute abundance after spike-in normalization.) Interestingly, <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ confers a 1.3-fold reduced median Rpb1 occupancy for all expressed genes, indicating a global reduction in transcription rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, col. 2). This is consistent with previous results indicating that decreased mRNA turnover in mutants lacking mRNA degradation enzymes is buffered by decreased rates of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, the increased mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ_A transcripts show reduced absolute Rpb1 occupancies in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, cols. 3–4), which applies broadly to individual transcripts within the mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ_A group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and is exemplified by <italic>ATG8</italic>, <italic>FLO5</italic>, and <italic>CAT8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Supporting this, the mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ group is 9.4-fold depleted for a group of 930 transcripts showing similar changes in Rpb1 occupancies and mRNA levels conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These results confirm our conclusion that most mRNAs are increased in abundance by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ owing primarily to decreased mRNA turnover vs. increased transcription.</p><p>A departure from this last generalization occurred for a subset of the iESR genes known to be activated by transcription factors Msn2/Msn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elfving et al., 2014</xref>), which exhibit increased median Rpb1 occupancies in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ vs. WT cells, whereas the remaining iESR genes show decreased Rpb1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref> cols. 3-4).

Thus, it appears that activation of certain iESR genes by Msn2/Msn4 partially overrides the effect of transcriptional buffering to yield a net increase in transcription in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells. The mRNA_dn_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ_A group shows a lower median Rpb1 occupancy that is similar in magnitude to its decreased median mRNA abundance (0.68- vs. 0.61-fold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, cols. 5–6), suggesting that decreased transcription contributes to the decreased abundance of these transcripts down-regulated by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dcp2 modulates the TEs of many mRNAs</title><p>Because the possible role of Dcp2 in translational control was largely unexplored, we determined the changes in translation for all mRNAs conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ using our previous ribosome profiling analysis (Ribo-Seq) of the same WT and <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ strains subjected to RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeidan et al., 2018</xref>).

All peptides in the mutant and WT extracts were covalently labeled with different isobaric tags, which have the same mass but yield distinguishable reporter ions in the tandem MS mode. Analyzing a mixture of differentially labeled mutant and WT samples yields the ratios of peptide abundance in the two strains. We determined changes in abundance for ~4600 different proteins, with highly reproducible results for three biological replicates of each strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

To provide additional support for this last conclusion, we analyzed the expression of Nano-luciferase (<italic>nLUC</italic>) reporters constructed for particular genes by inserting <italic>nLUC</italic> CDSs immediately preceding the stop codon of each gene, preserving the native 5′UTR and 3′UTR sequences.

Previously, we observed this pattern of translational reprogramming in yeast cells impaired in different ways for assembly of 43S PICs, including (1) increased phosphorylation of eIF2α in WT cells induced by isoleucine/valine starvation using the drug sulfometuron methyl (SM), which decreases formation of the eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex required to assemble 43S PIC; and (2) deletion of genes <italic>TMA64</italic> and <italic>TMA20</italic> encoding factors that recycle 40S subunits from termination complexes at stop codons to provide free 40S subunits for PIC assembly. The translational reprogramming was explained as resulting from increased competition for limiting PICs that allows ‘strong’ well-translated mRNAs, highly efficient in recruiting PICs, to outcompete ‘weak’ poorly translated mRNAs that recruit PICs less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). Supporting that a similar competition exists among mRNAs translationally altered by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ, we found that the TE_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ group of mRNAs shows increased median TE in response to both SM treatment of WT cells and deletion of <italic>TMA64/TMA20</italic> (<italic>tma</italic>ΔΔ), whereas the TE_dn_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ mRNAs exhibit the opposite changes in median TE in response to these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hierarchical clustering analysis reveals that the majority of mRNAs showing significant TE changes in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells exhibit changes in the same direction in response to the <italic>tma</italic>ΔΔ mutations or SM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). There are numerous exceptions to this trend, however, suggesting that perturbations specific to each condition can differentially affect the translation of particular mRNAs and alter their responses to increased competition for limiting PICs.</p><p>We considered that increased competition among mRNAs for limiting PICs might exist in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells for two main reasons: (1) impairing decapping-mediated mRNA decay will stabilize most transcripts and elevate bulk cellular mRNA abundance; and (2) reduced ribosome content arising from the repression of rESR mRNAs, which encode ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, a recent study demonstrated reduced ribosome content in mutant cells undergoing the ESR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Terhorst et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that the combination of increased mRNA abundance and reduced ribosomal content will increase competition among mRNAs for limiting PICs and confer the observed translational reprogramming that favors strong over weak mRNAs in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, our spike-in normalized RNA-Seq data revealed a median increase of 24% in bulk mRNA in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), indicating elevated mRNA abundance in cells lacking Dcp2. Considering that all mRNAs should be capped in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells, whereas a fraction of mRNAs are uncapped in WT, the increase in capped mRNA abundance conferred by <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> should be even greater than 24%. Evidence that <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ reduces ribosome content came from our findings that the group of 139 ribosomal proteins exhibits ~twofold lower RPFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and a ~25% reduction in median abundance determined by TMT/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells. We then measured the abundance of assembled ribosomal subunits by resolving whole cell extracts of mutant and WT cells by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients, using an extraction buffer lacking Mg<sup>+2</sup> to dissociate 80S ribosomes into free 40S and 60S subunits. Normalizing the <italic>A</italic><sub>260</sub> absorbance of ribosomal subunits to the number of OD<sub>600</sub> units (cellular volume) of extracted cells, revealed ~30% lower levels of 40S and 60S subunits in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The significant reduction in ribosome levels coupled with the increased capped mRNA content in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells should increase competition among mRNAs for limiting PICs to favor well-translated mRNAs at the expense of poorly translated ones, as we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Dhh1 is required for translational repression of a subset of transcripts by Dcp2</title><p>To examine whether Dhh1 contributes to this indirect mechanism of translational reprogramming, we asked whether mRNAs translationally dysregulated by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ are dependent on Dhh1 for their TE changes.

Flocculation typically results from increased cell adhesion due to the up-regulation of <italic>FLO</italic> genes, whose products promote cell adhesion. Indeed, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ confers increased mRNA levels and translation for a group of 16 genes encoding cell wall proteins, which include multiple <italic>FLO</italic> gene products and other agglutinins (exemplified by <italic>FLO5;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E, H</xref>).

Cell adhesion is critical for filamentous growth wherein cells switch from separated round cells to adhesion-linked ‘chains’ of elongated cells, which allows them to penetrate substrates (invasive growth). The <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ mutant showed elevated invasive growth compared to WT in a plate-washing assay, which was complemented by WT <italic>DCP2</italic> on a plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

Microscopic examination revealed that the <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ mutant formed clumps of cells that were larger and more abundant than WT; and that <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells exhibit an elongated morphology, which generally results from enhanced apical growth due to a delay in the cell cycle during filamentous growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loeb et al., 1999</xref>). This last phenotype was observed both in cells scraped from colonies before washing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> and 100×, Surface) and in cells excised from the invasive scar after washing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> and 100×, Wash). These cellular phenotypes, all of which were diminished by plasmid-borne <italic>DCP2</italic>, suggest that Dcp2 controls other aspects of filamentous/invasive growth besides cell adhesion. Importantly, we observed similar, less pronounced invasive growth in the mutant lacking Pat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I-J</xref>). Thus, mRNA decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2 and its activation by Pat1 contributes to the control of filamentous growth by the regulation of cell adhesion genes and other associated mechanisms. Only small fractions of the sets of agglutinin genes, autophagy genes, and the NCR or glucose-repressed genes that are up-regulated by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ belong to the iESR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C-F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Dcp2 stimulates expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, glycosylation, and the unfolded protein response on rich medium</title><p>In addition to reducing production of ribosomes, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ also diminishes mRNA and RPF levels of genes encoding various translation initiation and elongation factors, and of proteins involved in sulfate assimilation into methionine and cysteine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1B, H</xref>), which together should reduce rates of protein synthesis in the mutant cells.

Roughly one-half of the mRNAs increased in abundance by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ were similarly increased by <italic>dhh1</italic>Δ<italic>,</italic> with no further derepression seen in the <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ<italic>dhh1</italic>Δ double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>), as expected if these mRNAs are dependent on Dhh1 to stimulate their decapping by Dcp1/Dcp2 and attendant 5′–3′ degradation by Xrn1. Generally, these Dhh1-dependent mRNAs were also elevated by elimination of the decapping activators Pat1 or both Edc3 and Scd6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that these four factors frequently act together to stimulate decapping, such that eliminating any one stabilizes most of the entire group of transcripts. One way to account for this finding is to propose that the autoinhibition of Dcp2 activity exerted by its C-terminal IDR must be overcome by simultaneous, independent interactions of these four decapping activators with the IDR. In this view, an active decapping complex comprised of the Dcp1/Dcp2 holoenzyme and Dhh1, Pat1, and Edc3 or Scd6 would be assembled on such mRNAs to accelerate decapping and degradation in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with recent findings indicating that repression of certain Dhh1-target mRNAs is mediated by Edc3 and Scd6 acting interchangeably to recruit Dhh1 to the same segment of the Dcp2 IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2022</xref>). Close inspection of the mRNA changes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> suggests that certain of the Dhh1-dependent transcripts are targeted differentially by Pat1 vs. Dhh1, Edc3, or Scd6, which is also consistent with evidence for distinct complexes of Dcp2 bound to particular subsets of these decapping activators together with Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2022</xref>). The remaining one-half of the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ appear to be degraded independently of Dhh1, Pat1, and Edc3/Scd6, whereas most are elevated in mutants lacking Upf proteins to the same extent as in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells. These latter transcripts thus appear to be among the natural NMD substrates defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our data seem at odds with the model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2022</xref> that the Dcp1/Dcp2 complex containing Upf1 also contains Edc3; however, it is possible that Edc3 is present in the complex but dispensable for Upf1-mediated targeting of most Dhh1-independent mRNAs, as observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>As would be expected if their abundance is controlled by decapping, Dcp2-repressed transcripts exhibit highly similar increases in response to <italic>dcp2</italic> point mutations that inactivate Dcp2 catalytic activity compared to the <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, combining CAGE sequencing with RNA-Seq revealed that these mRNAs exhibit greater than average proportions of uncapped molecules in WT cells, regardless of whether they are dependent or independent of Dhh1 for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Accumulation of decapped intermediates presumably reflects the fact that 5′–3′ degradation by Xrn1 is frequently delayed, for example by the presence of elongating ribosomes that initiated translation prior to decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, mRNAs preferentially targeted for degradation by decapping should exhibit a greater than average proportion of uncapped transcripts in WT cells that is eliminated by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆<italic>,</italic> which we observed for both Dhh1-dependent and -independent mRNAs repressed by Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>∆ transcripts are significantly depleted for exosome substrates defined previously based on association with exosome subunits Rrp44, Rrp41, and Rrp6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>), supporting the presumption that these transcripts are primarily degraded 5′ to 3′ by Xrn1 following decapping rather than 3′ to 5′ by the exosome.</p><p>Our parallel analysis of spike-in normalized Pol II occupancies in chromatin by Rpb1 ChIP-Seq and of mRNA abundance by ERCC-normalized RNA-Seq revealed that the great majority of transcripts elevated in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells exhibit reduced, rather than increased Pol II occupancies in the CDSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), confirming that decreased mRNA turnover rather than increased transcription underlies the elevated mRNA levels. Even for iESR genes activated by transcription factor Msn2, which show slightly greater Rpb1 occupancies in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells, the median increases in mRNA levels greatly exceed the increased Rpb1 occupancies (3.71- vs. 1.16-fold; cf. col. 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>), implying a substantial contribution from reduced decapping/degradation in elevating transcript levels. Supporting this, iESR transcripts, whether Msn2 activated or otherwise, exhibit greater than average proportions of uncapped mRNAs (lower C/T ratios) in WT cells that are reversed by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>, cols. 3–4 vs. 1), indicating preferential targeting by Dcp2 for decapping/decay. The entire cohort of 199 Msn2 targets, most of which are not iESR genes, does not show such evidence for enhanced decapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>, col. 5 vs. 1). Thus, the relatively greater transcript derepression of iESR- vs. non-iESR Msn2 targets in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4D</xref>, cols. 3–4) likely reflects a combination of Msn2-dependent transcriptional activation (in response to slow growth) and loss of Dcp2-mediated mRNA decay.</p><p>The mRNAs dependent on Dhh1 for Dcp2 repression of abundance generally exhibit average TEs in WT cells, which seems inconsistent with the possibility that enhanced decapping and degradation results from low rates of translation initiation and attendant greater access of the cap structure to Dcp1/Dcp2. These mRNAs also exhibit an average proportion of non-preferred codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that pausing during translation elongation is not a key driver of their enhanced decapping and degradation. As discussed further below, a third possibility is that Dcp1/Dcp2 are recruited to these mRNAs by one or more RNA-binding proteins that interacts with specific sequences in their 3′UTRs. The Dhh1-independent group of mRNAs, by contrast, tend to have lower than average TEs and codon optimality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>), as noted previously for natural NMD substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celik et al., 2017</xref>). Presumably, aberrant splicing or transcription initiation, or non-canonical translation initiation or elongation, leads to out-of-frame translation and premature termination that triggers activation of Dcp1/Dcp2 by the Upf proteins on most Dhh1-independent mRNAs. Interestingly, this group is enriched for transcripts involved in DNA repair or recombination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1D</xref>), distinct from the cellular functions involving Dhh1-dependent mRNAs, which include stress responses, metabolism of energy reserves, and the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1C</xref>).</p><p>Our ribosome profiling analysis revealed widespread changes in translation of many mRNAs in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). The increased ribosome density observed for the Dcp2 translationally repressed mRNAs in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells was generally associated with increased steady-state protein abundance measured by TMT-MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which was supported for particular mRNAs by increased expression of <italic>nLUC</italic> reporters for the corresponding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). As a group, the Dcp2 translationally repressed mRNAs do not appear to be preferentially targeted by Dcp2 for mRNA turnover, as they exhibit decreased rather than increased relative abundance in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). At odds with the possibility of translational repression via decapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), Dcp2 translationally repressed mRNAs exhibit higher, not lower, than average proportions of capped mRNAs in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Searching for a different mechanism, we noted that these mRNAs tend to be efficiently translated in WT cells, and also that <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells have two key attributes that could confer increased translation of such mRNAs owing to increased competition for limiting ribosomes. First, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells have reduced ribosome content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G</xref>), which probably reflects reduced expression of rESR transcripts—highly enriched for mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins or biogenesis factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gasch et al., 2000</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, E</xref>). Although RPG transcripts show increased TEs in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells, this is outweighed by their reduced transcript abundance, to yield a net decrease in translation (RPF occupancies) in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and ~30% reduced ribosome content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Second, <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells have ~24% higher than WT levels of total mRNA, as determined by spike-in normalized RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), as might be expected from decreased decapping and mRNA turnover. It has been reported that reduced mRNA turnover in mutants lacking mRNA decay factors is buffered by decreased transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), which likely limits the increase in mRNA levels we observed in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells. The decreased ribosome content coupled with increased capped mRNA abundance should enhance competition among mRNAs for limiting 43S PICs and favor mRNAs most efficiently translated in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Supporting this idea, first predicted by mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lodish, 1976</xref>), the TE changes conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ are mimicked by other conditions that limit 43S PIC assembly: phosphorylation of eIF2α and impairment of 40S recycling at stop codons by eliminating Tma64/Tma20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). While other explanations are possible, this indirect mechanism is a plausible way to account for the bulk of translational programming conferred by eliminating Dcp2.</p><p>There is precedent for our proposal that elevated mRNA levels in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells promote translational reprogramming. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holmes et al., 2004</xref> showed that suppression of bulk translation initiation under different stress conditions is diminished in various mutants that either lack decapping factors, accumulate free 40S subunits, or overexpress eIF4G, and concluded that increased amounts of mRNA, free 40S subunits or eIF4G can drive assembly of 48S PICs and counteract regulatory responses (e.g., eIF2α phosphorylation) that diminish PIC assembly during stress. It is possible therefore that the increased mRNA levels conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ mitigates the effects of decreased ribosome levels conferred by the ESR on 48S PIC formation; however, our results suggest that the increased mRNA:40S ratio still favors translation of the mRNAs best able to compete for limiting PICs in <italic>dcp2∆</italic> cells.</p><p>Just as observed for changes in mRNA abundance, alterations in TE conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ can occur dependently or independently of Dhh1, with the minority, Dhh1-dependent group showing relatively greater translational repression by Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The Dhh1-independent group exhibits the key features associated with the indirect mechanism of translational repression involving increased competition for limiting PICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). The ~100 mRNAs belonging to the Dhh1-dependent group, by contrast, exhibit much lower than average TEs in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which seems incompatible with the competition mechanism. They are however preferentially targeted by Dcp2 and Dhh1 for degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>) and show higher than average proportions of uncapped degradation intermediates in WT, which are reversed by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ and <italic>dhh1</italic>Δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>)—features compatible with the model of translational repression via decapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>An alternative mechanism to account for the ~100 Dhh1-dependent Dcp2 translationally repressed mRNAs would be to propose that Dcp2 and Dhh1 sequester them in PBs, where translationally silent mRNAs can be enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luo et al., 2018</xref>), without stimulating their decapping. In this model, association with Dcp2/Dhh1 would be sufficient for translational repression without a requirement for Dcp2 catalytic activity. This mechanism seems unlikely because PBs are rare in non-stressed WT cells growing exponentially in rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, our Ribo-Seq analysis of the <italic>dcp2-EE</italic> catalytic mutant indicates highly similar TE changes conferred by this point mutation and the <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the scenario that <italic>dcp2-EE</italic> impairs Dcp2 association with mRNAs to reduce PB formation, nor that the increased mRNA abundance conferred by <italic>dcp2-EE</italic> interferes with the ability of Dcp2 to sequester this specific subset of translationally repressed mRNAs in PBs. Additional work is required to elucidate the mechanism of Dhh1-dependent translational repression by Dcp2.</p><p>Accumulation of mRNA degradation intermediates in <italic>dcp1</italic>Δ or <italic>xrn1</italic>∆ cells greatly elevates PB assembly during exponential growth in glucose medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>).

Moreover, <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ does not increase PBs in glucose-grown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>), yet we observed highly similar up-regulation of Dhh1-dependent mRNAs between <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ and <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> preferentially derives energy from glucose via fermentation, producing ethanol, and represses aerobic respiration in glucose-rich medium such as YPD. Importantly, we found that Dcp2-translationally repressed mRNAs are enriched for transcripts encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in respiration, including a majority of those encoding components of the ETC and mitochondrial ATPase; and that eight mRNAs encoding TCA cycle enzymes and three encoding ETC components are also repressed by Dcp2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1A, B</xref>). Indeed, a group of ~50 such mitochondrial proteins directly involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) shows increased median ribosome occupancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and steady-state protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1K</xref>) in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ vs. WT cells, which we confirmed for several proteins by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These findings suggest that respiration is up-regulated in the <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ mutant on YPD medium, which was supported by demonstrating increased mitochondrial membrane potential in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ vs. WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> also preferentially utilizes glucose and represses catabolism of alternative carbon sources on glucose-replete medium, in part by deactivating transcriptional activators Adr1 and Cat8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zaman et al., 2008</xref>). We observed increased mRNA abundance and translation of <italic>ADR1, CAT8</italic> and a group of ~100 glucose-repressed or Adr1/Cat8 target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells. Similarly, a group of ~36 genes that are transcriptionally repressed in the presence of preferred nitrogen sources (NCR genes) showed elevated median mRNA levels and translation in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells on YPD medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These findings suggest that Dcp2 post-transcriptionally enhances fermentation of glucose and catabolism of preferred nitrogen sources on rich medium. Consistent with this, Dcp2 helps to suppress the generation of amino acids from proteins via autophagy on rich medium by repressing levels of certain <italic>ATG</italic> mRNAs encoding proteins required specifically for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), which we confirmed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ also increased the abundance of multiple cell adhesion genes and conferred increased cell filamentation and invasive growth on rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–I</xref>), processes that are normally suppressed when nutrients are plentiful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roberts and Fink, 1994</xref>). The same phenotypes are also displayed to a lesser degree by elimination of Pat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I, J</xref>). If filamentation and invasive growth are regarded as strategies for nutrient foraging, then the repression of these processes by Dcp2 and Pat1 on rich medium supports the model that mRNA decapping and attendant translational repression by Dcp1/Dcp2 participates in repressing multiple pathways that are dispensable in cells growing on nutrient-rich medium.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that the yeast Pumilio family RNA-binding protein Puf3 coordinately represses the expression of multiple mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins that support the synthesis or assembly of the complexes of OXPHOS during fermentative growth on glucose. Puf3-targeted mRNAs encode components of mitochondrial ribosomes and factors involved in import, folding, or maturation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, but only two proteins (Atp1 and Atp18) directly involved in OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lapointe et al., 2018</xref>). Puf3 reduces the abundance of these mRNAs by enhancing their deadenylation, decapping and degradation in glucose-grown cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Olivas and Parker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). We found that Dcp2 represses a sizeable group of 52 OXPHOS transcripts, primarily at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) in a manner consistent with the indirect ribosome competition model for translational reprograming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), as they exhibit greater than average median TE in WT cells. About 10 of these transcripts are also repressed by Dcp2 at the level of mRNA abundance, but the two Puf3 targets <italic>ATP1</italic> and <italic>ATP18</italic> are not among them. It seems unlikely therefore that Puf3 plays a key role in the Dcp2-mediated repression of OXPHOS mRNAs.</p><p>Interrogating a group of 91 mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins that both bind Puf3 and exhibit increased protein expression in <italic>puf3</italic>∆ cells (Puf3 ‘cis’ targets of Lapointe et al.), we found that most displayed derepression of TE but not mRNA in <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>), with only five exhibiting comparable &gt;1.5-fold increases in RPF and mRNA abundance: <italic>IMG2</italic>, <italic>SDH5</italic>, <italic>MPM1</italic>, <italic>CIR1</italic>, and <italic>MSC6</italic>. Thus, it seems likely that Puf3 could be involved in Dcp2-mediated mRNA degradation for only these five Puf3 ‘cis’ targets. While Puf3 might play a role in repressing the translation of the other Puf3 ‘cis’ targets whose TE is increased by <italic>dcp2</italic>Δ, these mRNAs are well translated in WT cells and may conform to the ribosome competition mechanism instead. It seems plausible that other RNA-binding proteins besides Puf3 mediate the repression of mRNA abundance by Dcp2 for many of the ~1330 other transcripts in the mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2</italic>Δ group or members of the 100 mRNAs translationally repressed by Dcp2 in a manner requiring Dhh1, which were identified in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

RNA was purified from the 80S monosome fractions using an RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo, R1018), resolved by electrophoresis on a 15% TBE-Urea gel, and 25–34 nt fragments isolated from the gel were dephosphorylated using T4 Polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, M0201L). For each library sample, barcoded 5′-pre-adenylated linkers were added to the 3′ ends of footprints using T4 Rnl2(tr) K227Q (New England Biolabs, M0351S), and excess unligated linker was removed using 10 U/µl 5′ deadenylase/RecJ exonuclease (Epicentre, RJ411250), followed by pooling and purification of ligated footprints using an Oligo Clean and Concentrator column (Zymo Research, D4060). Ribosomal RNA contamination was removed by biotinylated primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGlincy and Ingolia, 2017</xref>), followed by reverse transcription using Protoscript II (New England Biolabs, M0368L) and circularization of cDNA using CircLigase ssDNA Ligase (Epicenter, CL4111K). Each pooled library was PCR amplified using Phusion polymerase (F-530) (New England Biolabs, M0530S). Quality of the libraries was assessed with a Bioanalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent, 5067-4626) and quantified by Qubit. Single-end 50 bp sequencing was done on an Illumina HiSeq system at the NHLBI DNA Sequencing and Genomics Core at NIH (Bethesda, MD).</p><p>For RNA-Seq library preparation, total RNA was extracted and purified from aliquots of the same snapped-frozen cells described above using the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator kit. Five mg of total RNA was randomly fragmented by incubating with Ambion Fragmentation Reagent (Ambion, AM8740) at 70°C for 12 min. The reaction was stopped by adding Stop Solution (Ambion, AM8740) and precipitated by adding one part of isopropanol followed by precipitation with 70% ethanol.

Briefly, cDNAs were transcribed to the 5′ ends of capped RNAs, ligated at the 5′ and 3′ ends with barcoded linkers, followed by second strand synthesis, and the resulting DNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq500 (Single-end, 75 bp reads) platform.

CAGE reads with a mapping quality score (MAPQ) &gt;20 were considered uniquely mapped reads, which were used for subsequent analyses. CAGE signals of biological replicates were then merged as a single sample. The transcription abundance of each TSS was quantified as the numbers of CAGE tags/reads supporting the TSS per million mapped reads (TPM). Only TSSs with TPM ≥0.1 were used to infer TCs, representing putative core promoters.</p><p>The ‘peakclu’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2021</xref>) was used to infer TCs for each sample, with the following options ‘peakDistance = 50, extensionDistance = 25, localThreshold = 0.01’. A set of Consensus TCs of all samples were generated by using the ‘consensusCluster’ function in TSSr with an option of ‘dis = 100’. Consensus TCs were then assigned to their downstream genes if they are within 1000 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the start codon of annotated ORFs. The TPM value of a consensus TC in a sample is the sum of TPM values of all TSSs within its range. The TPM value of a gene was calculated as the sum of all consensus TCs assigned to the gene.</p><p>RNA sequencing libraries were produced in parallel from the same RNA samples subjected to CAGE sequencing by the NHLBI DNA sequencing Core at NIH (Bethesda, MD) using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Paired-end 50 bp reads) and sequenced using the NovaSeq6000 Illumina platform.

To calculate C/T ratios, RNA-Seq reads assigned to each gene were normalized as TPM reads by dividing the read counts by the length of each gene in kilobases (reads per kilobase, RPK), summing all the RPK values in a sample and normalizing, to generate ‘per million’ scaling factors. Further, RPK values were normalized by the ‘per million’ scaling factor to give TPM. Because a single read/tag is generated for each transcript in CAGE, its TPM (tags per million mapped tags) is equivalent to the TPM value obtained from RNA-Seq, allowing comparisons of the two types of TPM values. The C/T ratio of each gene was calculated by dividing CAGE TPMs by RNA-Seq TPMs in each strain after first removing all genes with zero CAGE reads in either the <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ or WT samples being compared. In interrogating C/T ratios for the groups of mRNAs increased or decreased by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆, the same two groups defined using the RNA-Seq data obtained in parallel with ribosome profiling were examined to allow changes in mRNA abundance, C/T ratios, ribosome occupancies, and TEs to be compared for the same two sets of mRNAs.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Peter Ashe (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see, all the reviewers were quite positive about the work as was the reviewing editor.

This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of yeast's mRNA decapping enzyme. Throughout the literature it has generally been understood that dcp2∆ strains fail to decap mRNAs and that this defect promotes the stabilization of mRNAs ordinarily subjected to the major 5' to 3' mRNA decay pathway. Previous evidence supporting this conclusion includes data demonstrating that, in dcp2∆ cells, several specific mRNAs maintain their 5' caps, increase their steady-state levels, and extend their half-lives. In this manuscript, the authors seek to beat a dead horse with more sophisticated transcriptome-wide methods, ultimately proving the original point, but also uncovering substantially interesting new results.</p><p>The initial experiments (Figure 1) first examined the authors' (and others') prior RNA-Seq datasets to determine the number of transcripts that either increase or decrease in abundance in dcp2∆ cells, ultimately identifying 1376 mRNAs that increase in abundance (so-called &quot;derepressed mRNAs&quot;) and 1281 mRNAs that decrease in abundance (so-called &quot;repressed mRNAs&quot;). The respective changes were then validated by qRT-PCR for 10 out of 11 mRNAs tested. To be certain that the RNA-Seq results reflected a loss of mRNA decapping activity, they also evaluated RNA-Seq data from cells expressing catalytically dead Dcp2, an experiment that yielded results almost identical to those obtained with dcp2∆ cells.</p><p>Next, the authors sought to determine the role of Dhh1, a decapping activator, in Dcp2-mediated regulation by examining RNA-Seq results for dhh1∆ and dcp2∆dhh1∆ cells. These experiments showed that 752 of the 1376 mRNAs that increased in abundance in dcp2∆ cells could do so when only DHH1 was deleted (albeit to a lesser extent), with 607 mRNAs relatively unaffected by that deletion. These experiments, too, were consistent with previously published results indicating that only a subset of yeast mRNAs were targeted for decapping by Dhh1. Comparable analyses of strains deleted for UPF1, PAT1, PAT1/DHH1, or EDC3/SCD6 yielded results indicating that all of these strains, except for upf1∆ cells, stabilized significant fractions of the Dhh1-dependent mRNAs. upf1∆ cells, however, only appeared to stabilize mRNAs that were Dhh1-independent, results that were also consistent with published data on NMD substrates.</p><p>Subsequent experiments employed CAGE analysis and Rpb1 ChIP-seq to further evaluate the basis for increased or decreased levels of the populations of mRNAs identified in the RNA-Seq studies. CAGE analysis was employed to determine whether inferred cap status (capped vs decapped) was correct, and whether there existed subtle differences in cap status of distinct populations of mRNAs. The ChIP-seq experiments were used as an alternative means to testing whether increases or decreases in specific mRNAs reflected changes in transcription of their genes vs. mRNA stabilization. These experiments largely confirmed that mRNAs which accumulated in dcp2∆ cells (and other mutants affecting mRNA decapping) were capped (albeit to different extents) and that RNA polymerase loading differences could not, for the most part, account for the observed changes in mRNA levels.</p><p>An additional set of experiments evaluated ribosomal profiling data to assess translational efficiency (TE) of the mRNAs in the expanding subsets of mRNAs that changed in abundance as a consequence of mutations in genes regulating or catalyzing mRNA decapping. These analyses identified 541 mRNAs with TEs that increased in dcp2∆ cells (median increase: 1.65-fold), as well as 659 mRNAs whose TEs decreased in the same cells (median decrease: 0.59-fold). Much of the rest of the paper sought to explain these changes in TE. Agreement between the ribosomal profiling data and TMT/MS-MS analyses indicated that the TE differences reflected actual changes in the synthesis rates of the respective proteins. Subsequent analyses indicated that the translationally-repressed mRNAs generally had lower than average TE in WT cells whereas those that were translationally activated tended to have higher than average TE in WT. The authors' mass spec analyses also indicated that ribosomal protein levels decreased ~25% in dcp2∆ cells, suggesting that the TE differences in dcp2∆ cells might reflect competition caused by limiting ribosomes (or other translational factors) between mRNAs that normally were efficiently vs. inefficiently translated inherently. Numerous other experiments indicated that this indirect model for translational regulation in dcp2∆ cells was likely correct and also identified fine tuning of the expression of genes regulating respiration, alternative carbon and nitrogen sources, mitochondrial function, and filamentation.</p><p>During my first reading I was overwhelmed by the length of this manuscript (almost 140 pages!). It was by far the longest paper I had ever reviewed and I was feeling pity for its future readers. That feeling vanished as I reread the paper and absorbed the extent to which the authors had chased down so many details for the phenomena they were tracking, ultimately coming up with a thorough and convincing story, and making it clear to me that cutting this &quot;whole&quot; story up into distinct chapters would be a waste of both the authors' and future readers' time. Hence, I'm supportive of publishing this substantive manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic>, but here are a few revisions that might make it even better:</p><p>1. I'm not fond of the use of the terms &quot;repressed&quot; and &quot;derepressed&quot; to describe mRNAs that respectively decrease or increase in abundance in dcp2∆ cells. I understand that the terms comprise technically correct genetic nomenclature, but we know from prior work that there's no need to opt for vagueness here, i.e., these are mRNAs that go down or up in abundance. Please modify the text to make the observation more precise and describe the repressed class as mRNAs whose abundance decreases and the derepressed class as mRNAs whose abundance increases.</p><p>2. The CAGE analysis was quite informative, but the reliability of its measurements of &quot;percent capped&quot; is suspect. This comment follows from the data of Figure 3D, where steady-state levels of capped mRNAs appear to be ~40% of all mRNAs. This figure is at least half of what has been seen in other publications so the authors have an obligation to validate their CAGE analyses with measurements of the extent of capping in individual mRNAs. I recommend the use of cap IPs, but other methods could also work. Also, it's necessary to provide the capped/total data for the dcp2∆ cell samples.</p><p>3. On p. 13, the authors note that an &quot;in-depth analysis&quot; of pat1∆, pat1∆dhh1∆, and edc3∆/scd6∆ strains is to be published elsewhere. Is that really necessary? In light of the enormous amount of useful information already in this manuscript why the hesitancy to add a little more?</p><p>4. The authors' &quot;old school&quot; models in Figure 8 —figure supplement 1 appear to ignore the recent results and the model for multiple decapping complexes published recently by He et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 2022 and FEBS Letters 2022). Do the authors think that their data conflicts with that of He et al? If so, the significant disagreements should be noted.</p><p>5. Is it possible that the reduced TE observed for a class of mRNAs in dhh1∆ cells that the authors explain as samples having enhanced decapping may also be targeted specifically by other decapping activators such as Edc3, Scd6, or Pat1? This data may already exist in the set designated for publication elsewhere.</p><p>6. Please explain the likely reason for the differences in absolute vs. relative differences in RNA polymerase binding to mRNAs. It's understood that the two datasets differ by the use or not of spike-in controls. However, since there are such large differences in the two datasets it would be helpful to have validation for some of the transcripts in the spike-in datasets that show large changes in abundance.</p><p>7. Some figure legends note that outliers have been omitted. Please provide an n for each case of outlier omission.</p><p>8. In Figure 3D columns 4 and 5 the authors compare Dhh1 dependent and independent decapping levels for the up_dcp2 mRNAs. Since iESR substrates are 24% of the Dhh1 dependent group they should be removed from the respective datasets to get a clearer picture of what's actually happening.</p><p>9. The authors continually refer to one of their datasets (GSE220578) as &quot;unpublished.&quot; One cannot examine it in GEO (it's private) so we need to know whether additional authors should be added to this paper. Further, if that dataset is included in this manuscript can we please stop using the term &quot;unpublished.&quot;</p><p>10. Abstract, line 30: nothing about Lsm2 was addressed in this manuscript.</p><p>11. P. 4, line 81: there's nothing about an autoinhibitory region in Fromm et al., 2012. The second reference that's needed is Paquette et al., 2018, ie, the same reference listed on line 78.</p><p>12. P. 4, line 63: calling Dcp2 a &quot;bi-lobed enzyme&quot; is probably much too simplistic. The rest of that sentence does a fine job of summarizing Dcp2's structure so I recommend deleting the &quot;bi-lobed&quot; thought.</p><p>13. P. 13, line 265: please correct spelling of &quot;trasnscripts;&quot; p. 15, line 299 (&quot;versusvs.&quot;); p. 23, line 474, Figure 4F should be 3F; and p. 27, line 556, &quot;do not&quot; should be &quot;does not&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript details a whole range of proteomic, transcriptomic, and ribosome profiling studies comparing mutants in the decapping enzyme, Dcp2 with a parental yeast strain. Furthermore, a careful, logical and scholarly assessment of the implications of the 'omics data are presented. The manuscript gives unprecedented detail at the transcription, mRNA stability and mRNA translation levels concerning the implications of a deficiency in mRNA decapping. The data show widespread mRNA accumulation due to reduced mRNA degradation and consequent alterations in the fine balance of translation regulation. Two areas that are not covered in great detail are the implications of higher level of P-bodies in the mRNA decay mutants and the potential role of the cytosolic exosome in mRNA degradation. However, no paper can cover everything and this manuscript already considers so many angles!</p><p>The authors don't mention that mRNA decay mutants such as dcp2delta have constitutive very high levels of P-bodies (Teixeira et al. 2007. PMID: 17429074). This means much of the material that is measured could be present in different contexts within the cell between the mutant and wild type. For instance, do the authors generally spin their whole cell lysates before they conduct their 'omics experiments – if so at least some of this material could have been lost. In my view the connections with P-bodies and biological condensates should be discussed, and any limitations in the study given the presence of these condensates covered.</p><p>The idea that increased expression of mRNA and ribosomes in yeast could alter the translational profile in mutants of the mRNA decay pathway has been put forward before in the pre-'omics era. In the paper, the mRNA decay mutants were resistant to the effects of glucose and amino acid starvation. This paper (Holmes et al. 2004. PMID: 15024087) is cited in the manuscript, but not in this context. In my view the authors should cite and discuss this mass action model given the similarities to their hypothesis.</p><p>Have the authors cross-compared their datasets with datasets from the Tollervey group looking at exosome substrates?</p><p>More specific points</p><p>Line 46- eIF4F does not really exist in this context in yeast – i.e. eIF4A is only quite weakly associated and does not generally accompany eIF4G and eIF4E at anywhere near a stoichiometric level- it might be better to get away from mentioning eIf4F</p><p>Line 55- the authors state that the exosome pathway is a minor pathway of mRNA decay – while this narrative exists in the literature – I am not clear what the evidence is and, if it exists, it should be cited here. Otherwise, while Delan-Forino et al., 2017. PMID 28355211, don't directly assess the relative contribution of different mRNA decay pathways, they do show that substantial numbers of cytoplasmic mRNAs interact with the exosome.</p><p>Line 148- 'suggesting that either Dhh1 or Pat1 is sufficient for repression of translation initiation in glucose starvation'. While Dhh1 and Pat1 may be sufficient to allow repression of translation- the mechanism of repression more likely involves targeting of eIF4A and/or Ded1 (PMID: 33053322, PMID: 21795399, PMID: 34946015). So the impact of the mRNA decay mutants is more likely indirect -see comments above.</p><p>Line 214- 'all but one mRNA' – I may have missed it but what is this mRNA?</p><p>Line 245- this conclusion implies that the increases in mRNA levels observed are due to a direct impact of DCP2 deletion on mRNA degradation. At this stage in the manuscript, the authors haven't addressed potential transcriptional effects and so the conclusion needs to be more accurately worded.</p><p>Line 250- maybe change 'Edcs' to 'Edc1-3'.</p><p>Line 483, the authors state most studies have focused on mRNA decay – they need some citations here if they word it in this manner.</p><p>Line 495 'These results suggest that Dcp2 broadly controls gene expression at the translational level in addition to regulating mRNA stability'. Given that the authors will later conclude that the impact of the mutant on translation is due to indirect effects on mRNA and ribosome levels – this conclusion is too strongly worded for me.</p><p>Line 496 'in an effort to establish' sounds like the result was already known before the experiment. 'In order to evaluate whether' – or something like this would sound better.</p><p>Line 519 – relating to Figure 4D- do the authors have controls they could add to this – an mRNA where RPF levels are reduced or are maintained in the mutant relative to the parent strain?</p><p>Line 536- YLR361C-A?</p><p>Line 569 – is this sulfometuron or sulfometuron methyl?</p><p>On Figure 6E, there appears to be an error on the y-axis of the plo.t</p><p>Overall though an excellent paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Vijjamarri et al., is focused on the role of the Dcp2 decapping enzyme in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Using a Dcp2 disrupted strain (dcps∆) they address the downstream consequences of the absence of the primary fungal decapping enzyme Dcp2. Although the lack of Dcp2 decapping is expected to result in the accumulation of mRNAs that would have otherwise been degraded and lead to indirect downstream consequences on gene expression and cellular physiology, these outcomes have not been addressed. Here the authors undertake a very thorough analysis. One important and surprising contribution is the association of Dcp2 to decreased translation efficiency. Rather than an expected mechanism of reduced stability contributing to reduced translation, the authors show that this is an indirect effect of Dcp2 by modulating ribosomal protein mRNA stability that in turn leads to a reduction of ribosomal protein levels and competition for limiting ribosomes for translation. A network of mRNAs that are regulated by Dcp2 that are involved in modulating the repression of aerobic growth in glucose-rich media were also uncovered. These discoveries further unravel the indirect contribution of Dcp2 decapping during respiratory growth under non-glucose carbon sources. This is an extremely thorough evaluation of Dcp2 function in yeast and will be an important contribution to the field.</p><p>1. Can the authors further elaborate on why they think they do not see (or minimally see) the contribution of codon optimality to Dhh1 directed mRNA decay contrary to current publications.</p><p>2. In Figure 5E, the terms &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; mRNA nomenclature should be further clarified or changed.</p><p>3. The authors should consider altering Figure 8 to present the functional contribution of Dcp2 rather than the outcome of dcp2 disruption. It seems more informative (to me at least) to state what Dcp2 does rather than what it's not doing when it is absent (as currently depicted in Figure 8).</p><p>4. Figure 5C: A brief explanation of C/T should be provided in the text or figure legend to avoid having to search through the M&amp;M section to figure it out.</p><p>5. Define TE in the abstract.</p><p>6. Lastly, I found the manuscript to be extremely long (more than double the recommended manuscript length for <italic>eLife</italic>). Although I don't recommend it for this manuscript, I would strongly suggest the authors consider splitting such a manuscript into at least two papers in the future. It is hard to envision most readers retaining everything that is presented in the manuscript by the time they are finished reading it and it simply dilutes the impact.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85545.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see, all the reviewers were quite positive about the work as was the reviewing editor.

This is analogous to the inference of translation efficiency (TE) obtained by dividing normalized ribosome footprint reads by independently normalized RNA sequencing reads. Thus, C/T is a relative, not actual, measure of the proportion of capped molecules, and we revised the manuscript to make this clear. Similar to TE values, the change in C/T ratios for a given gene can be used to infer relative changes in % capped transcripts between different strains. If increased mRNA levels in <italic>dcp2∆</italic> cells are driven by impaired decapping and decay vs. transcription, then we should observe an increased proportion of capped transcripts for the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dcp2∆</italic>. To test this prediction, the true proportion of capped molecules is not needed and can be evaluated using the C/T ratios we obtained for each gene. Our results in Figure 3E showing a ~1.6-fold higher median C/T ratio in <italic>dcp2∆</italic> vs WT cells for the mRNAs up-regulated by <italic>dcp2∆</italic> vs. all mRNAs supports the decapping mechanism.</p><p>To provide independent evidence that impaired decapping drives transcript abundance changes conferred by <italic>dcp2∆</italic>, we have now calculated the ratios of CAGE TPMs between mutant and WT and the corresponding ratios of total RNA TPMs. If changes in mRNA abundance result primarily from altered transcription, we expect similar changes in both ratios for most up-regulated transcripts, ie. TPM_CAGE<sub><italic>dcp2∆</italic>/WT</sub> ≈ TPM_RNA<sub><italic>dcp2∆</italic>/WT</sub>. If instead impaired decapping is responsible, then we expect to find TPM_CAGE<sub><italic>dcp2∆</italic>/WT</sub> &gt; TPM_RNA<sub><italic>dcp2∆</italic>/WT</sub> for the mRNAs elevated by <italic>dcp2∆.</italic> Consistent with the latter, the majority of mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2∆</italic> transcripts show TPM_CAGE<sub><italic>dcp2∆</italic>/WT</sub> ratios exceeding the corresponding TPM_RNA<sub><italic>dcp2∆</italic>/WT</sub> ratios, as shown in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The authors' &quot;old school&quot; models in Figure 8 —figure supplement 1 appear to ignore the recent results and the model for multiple decapping complexes published recently by He et al. (eLife 2022 and FEBS Letters 2022). Do the authors think that their data conflicts with that of He et al? If so, the significant disagreements should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have modified Figure 8 —figure supplement 1 to reflect recent advances from the Jacobson lab on the network of interactions of decapping activators with distinct segments in the C-terminal tail of Dcp2 and formation of different decapping complexes that recognize distinct mRNAs targeted by the activators. Our genome-wide RNA-seq data from mutants lacking different activators suggests that many of the group of Dhh1-dependent targets of Dcp2 are frequently recognized by a Dcp1-Dcp2 decapping complexes containing all four decapping activators Dhh1/Edc3/Scd6/Pat1, which is reflected in panel B of our revised model. However, as now mentioned in the DISCUSSION, close inspection of the cluster analysis of mRNA changes shown in Figure 2B suggests that certain Dhh1-dependent transcripts are targeted differentially by Pat1 versus Dhh1, Edc3, and Scd6, which is consistent with evidence for distinct complexes of Dcp2 bound to particular subsets of decapping activators (He et al. 2022). Our data further suggest that the Dhh1-independent set of mRNAs appear to be targeted by the Upf proteins independently of Dhh1/Edc3/Scd6/Pat1. This might represent a departure from the model proposed by He et al. (2022) wherein the complex containing Upf1/Xrn1 also contains Edc3. It is possible however that the Upf1-containing complex contains Edc3, as they proposed, even though Edc3 is not required for Upf1-mediated targeting of the majority of Dhh1-independent mRNAs, as we found. We have tried to depict this subtlety in the new version of the figure and added new text to the DISCUSSION on this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Is it possible that the reduced TE observed for a class of mRNAs in dhh1∆ cells that the authors explain as samples having enhanced decapping may also be targeted specifically by other decapping activators such as Edc3, Scd6, or Pat1? This data may already exist in the set designated for publication elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We do observe that transcripts showing TE derepression in <italic>dcp2∆</italic> cells dependent on Dhh1 (Dhh1-dep. TE_up_dcp2) also tend to be targeted for decapping and degradation by Pat1 in addition to Dhh1, which will be explained in our subsequent manuscript on functional interplay between Pat1 and Dhh1 in mRNA turnover and translational repression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please explain the likely reason for the differences in absolute vs. relative differences in RNA polymerase binding to mRNAs. It's understood that the two datasets differ by the use or not of spike-in controls. However, since there are such large differences in the two datasets it would be helpful to have validation for some of the transcripts in the spike-in datasets that show large changes in abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>It’s important to note that applying spike-in normalization with <italic>S. pombe</italic> chromatin does not change the ranking of genes according to their changes in Rpb1 occupancies in mutant vs. WT compared to the ranking established using relative Rpb1 occupancies normalized only for library depth, as spike-in normalized occupancies are obtained simply by multiplying the observed occupancies for each gene by a single size factor calculated from the sum of Rpb1 occupancies for all <italic>S. pombe</italic> genes in that sample. By revealing absolute changes in Pol II occupancies, the spike-in normalized data showed that transcription is reduced overall in the decapping mutants, such that genes showing moderate increases in relative Rpb1 occupancies (ie. normalized only for library depth) actually undergo moderate reductions in absolute occupancies (spike-in normalized data). Regardless of whether relative or absolute Rpb1 occupancies were considered however, we arrived at the same conclusion that nearly all transcripts up-regulated by <italic>dcp2Δ</italic> do not exhibit increased Pol II occupancies for the corresponding genes. Thus, to simplify and condense the presentation, we have revised the RESULTS to describe only the spike-in normalized Rpb1 data because it reveals the absolute changes in transcription rate that can be compared directly with the absolute changes in mRNA abundance determined using the ERCC-normalized RNA-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Furthermore, a careful, logical and scholarly assessment of the implications of the 'omics data are presented. The manuscript gives unprecedented detail at the transcription, mRNA stability and mRNA translation levels concerning the implications of a deficiency in mRNA decapping. The data show widespread mRNA accumulation due to reduced mRNA degradation and consequent alterations in the fine balance of translation regulation. Two areas that are not covered in great detail are the implications of higher level of P-bodies in the mRNA decay mutants and the potential role of the cytosolic exosome in mRNA degradation. However, no paper can cover everything and this manuscript already considers so many angles!</p></disp-quote><p>We are gratified by the reviewer’s positive assessment of the manuscript, and his/her appreciation that the manuscript covers multiple aspects of post-transcriptional control exerted by Dcp2, even though it did not address the implications for P-bodies and role of the cytoplasmic exosome.

PMID: 17429074). This means much of the material that is measured could be present in different contexts within the cell between the mutant and wild type. For instance, do the authors generally spin their whole cell lysates before they conduct their 'omics experiments – if so at least some of this material could have been lost. In my view the connections with P-bodies and biological condensates should be discussed, and any limitations in the study given the presence of these condensates covered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this important point. All of the -omics experiments described here involved clarifying cell lysates by high-speed centrifugation, which might have resulted in depletion of P-bodies to an extent that differs between <italic>dcp2</italic> mutant and WT cells. We have added text to the Discussion section to acknowledge this limitation of our study and the likelihood of its importance to our final conclusions: “Accumulation of mRNA degradation intermediates in <italic>dcp1</italic>Δ or <italic>xrn1</italic>∆ cells greatly elevates PB assembly during exponential growth in glucose medium (Sheth and Parker 2003; Teixeira and Parker 2007). Our RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq experiments involved centrifugation of cell extracts to remove cellular debris, which might have depleted mRNAs associated with PBs preferentially in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ vs. WT cells (Kershaw et al. 2021). This may not be an important limitation of our study however, because <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ leads to much smaller PBs compared to <italic>dcp1</italic>Δ or <italic>xrn1</italic>Δ in glucose medium (Teixeira and Parker 2007). Moreover, <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ does not increase PBs in glucose-grown cells (Teixeira and Parker 2007), yet we observed highly similar up-regulation of Dhh1-dependent mRNAs between <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ and <italic>dhh1</italic>∆ cells (Figure 2B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The idea that increased expression of mRNA and ribosomes in yeast could alter the translational profile in mutants of the mRNA decay pathway has been put forward before in the pre-'omics era.

PMID: 15024087) is cited in the manuscript, but not in this context. In my view the authors should cite and discuss this mass action model given the similarities to their hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for reminding us of this important study and have added the following text to the Discussion. “There is precedent for our proposal that elevated mRNA levels in <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ cells promote translational reprogramming. Holmes et al. (2004) showed that suppression of bulk translation initiation under different stress conditions is diminished in various mutants that either lack decapping factors, accumulate free 40S subunits, or overexpress eIF4G, and concluded that increased amounts of mRNA, free 40S subunits or eIF4G can drive assembly of 48S PICs and counteract regulatory responses (eg. eIF2α phosphorylation) that diminish PIC assembly during stress. It is possible therefore that the increased mRNA levels conferred by <italic>dcp2</italic>∆ mitigates the effects of decreased ribosome levels conferred by the ESR on 48S PIC formation; however, our results suggest that the increased mRNA:40S ratio still favors translation of the mRNAs best able to compete for limiting PICs in <italic>dcp2∆</italic> cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors cross-compared their datasets with datasets from the Tollervey group looking at exosome substrates?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not make this comparison because we assumed that mRNAs targeted by Dcp2 would be degraded 5’-to-3’ by Xrn1 rather than 3’-to-5’ by the exosome. At the referee’s suggestion we have determined that the mRNAs we identified as targeted by Dcp2 for degradation (mRNA_up_<italic>dcp2∆</italic>) are significantly depleted for exosome substrates defined by Tollervey et al. based on their association with exosome subunits Rrp44, Rrp41 and Rrp6 by Schneider et al., (PMID: 23000172). This finding suggests that most mRNAs that undergo decapping-mediated 5’ to 3’ decay are not preferentially targeted for 3’ to 5’ degradation by the exosome.

Using a Dcp2 disrupted strain (dcps∆) they address the downstream consequences of the absence of the primary fungal decapping enzyme Dcp2. Although the lack of Dcp2 decapping is expected to result in the accumulation of mRNAs that would have otherwise been degraded and lead to indirect downstream consequences on gene expression and cellular physiology, these outcomes have not been addressed. Here the authors undertake a very thorough analysis. One important and surprising contribution is the association of Dcp2 to decreased translation efficiency. Rather than an expected mechanism of reduced stability contributing to reduced translation, the authors show that this is an indirect effect of Dcp2 by modulating ribosomal protein mRNA stability that in turn leads to a reduction of ribosomal protein levels and competition for limiting ribosomes for translation. A network of mRNAs that are regulated by Dcp2 that are involved in modulating the repression of aerobic growth in glucose-rich media were also uncovered. These discoveries further unravel the indirect contribution of Dcp2 decapping during respiratory growth under non-glucose carbon sources. This is an extremely thorough evaluation of Dcp2 function in yeast and will be an important contribution to the field.</p><p>1. Can the authors further elaborate on why they think they do not see (or minimally see) the contribution of codon optimality to Dhh1 directed mRNA decay contrary to current publications.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there is no discrepancy with the previous work implicating codon non-optimality in Dhh1-mediated mRNA decay. Previously, in Zeidan et al. (2018), we observed an inverse correlation between sTAI values and changes in mRNA abundance in <italic>dhh1∆</italic> versus WT cells evident in our RNA-seq data and also that of Radhakrishnan et al., consistent with the model that Dhh1 targets mRNAs occupied by elongating ribosomes paused at slowly decoded codons. Our current findings that the group of mRNAs most highly repressed by Dcp2 dependent on Dhh1 exhibit average codon optimality could be explained if they contain concentrated runs of non-optimal codons that don’t register in the averaged values (as we suggested), or might simply indicate that other properties besides codon nonoptimality are more important in dictating their preferential degradation by Dcp2/Dhh1.
