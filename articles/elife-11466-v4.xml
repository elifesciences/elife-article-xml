We now explored the cargo-spectrum of CRM1 in depth and identified surprisingly large numbers, namely &gt;700 export substrates from the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, ≈1000 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and &gt;1050 from human cells. In addition, we quantified the partitioning of ≈5000 unique proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. The data suggest new CRM1 functions in spatial control of vesicle coat-assembly, centrosomes, autophagy, peroxisome biogenesis, cytoskeleton, ribosome maturation, translation, mRNA degradation, and more generally in precluding a potentially detrimental action of cytoplasmic pathways within the nuclear interior. There are also numerous new instances where CRM1 appears to act in regulatory circuits. Altogether, our dataset allows unprecedented insights into the nucleocytoplasmic organisation of eukaryotic cells, into the contributions of an exceedingly promiscuous exportin and it provides a new basis for NES prediction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11466.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11466.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11466.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms subdivide their cells into compartments that carry out specific tasks. For example, the cell nucleus hosts the genome and handles the genetic information, whereas the surrounding cytoplasm is specialized in making proteins. These proteins are then either used in the cytoplasm or transported to the nucleus and other cell compartments. Since proteins are not made in the nucleus, all proteins in this compartment must be imported from the cytoplasm.</p><p>Two layers of membrane separate the nucleus and cytoplasm from each other. Any exchange of material must therefore proceed through channels called nuclear pore complexes, or NPCs for short. The NPCs have filters that allow only small molecules a free transit, while larger ones are typically rejected. However, larger proteins may also rapidly pass through the nuclear pore complexes if loaded onto dedicated shuttle molecules; for example, “exportins” transport proteins out of the nucleus.</p><p>Kırlı, Karaca et al. used an approach called proteomics to measure the levels of 5,000 different proteins within the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Such a census helps to predict where a given protein works and where it might cause problems. Further experiments also used proteomics to identify which proteins are carried by an exportin called CRM1. This revealed that a remarkably large number of different proteins (around 1,000) are exported by CRM1 from either yeast, human or frog cell nuclei. Most of these “cargo” proteins were previously thought to never leave the cytoplasm. It now seems, however, that these proteins can leak into the nucleus, but CRM1 recognizes them as cytoplasmic proteins and expels them from the nucleus.</p><p>These findings suggest that the border control at NPCs is less perfect than was previously believed. If not remedied, this would pose a serious problem for the cell, because the accumulation of &quot;wrong&quot; proteins inside the nucleus would disturb the processes that occur there and could destabilize the genome. Kırlı, Karaca et al. propose that the export of such accidentally displaced proteins by CRM1 is a crucial measure to protect the nucleus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11466.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11466.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>XPO1/CRM1</kwd><kwd>NES</kwd><kwd>protein localization</kwd><kwd>protein transport</kwd><kwd>exportin</kwd><kwd>Nup</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>&lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kırlı</surname><given-names>Koray</given-names></name><name><surname>Karaca</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name><name><surname>Dehne</surname><given-names>Heinz Jürgen</given-names></name><name><surname>Samwer</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Kuan Ting</given-names></name><name><surname>Lenz</surname><given-names>Christof</given-names></name><name><surname>Urlaub</surname><given-names>Henning</given-names></name><name><surname>Görlich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Urlaub</surname><given-names>Henning</given-names></name><name><surname>Görlich</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new resource quantifying the distribution of 5,000 individual proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm, as well as identifying 2,800 yeast, human and frog proteins that are exported from the nucleus by the exportin CRM1/Xpo1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear envelope (NE) separates the cell nucleus from the cytoplasm. Although its lipid bilayers are impermeable for macromolecules, embedded nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) allow an exchange of material between these compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feldherr, 1962</xref>). The NPC permeability barrier controls this exchange. It grants small molecules a free passage, but becomes increasingly restrictive as the size of the mobile species approaches or exceeds a diameter of ≈ 5 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>). Shuttling nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) are not bound by this restriction (for review see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimura and Imamoto, 2014</xref>). They can traverse NPCs by facilitated translocation and have the capacity to ferry even large cargoes, such as newly assembled ribosomal subunits, across the barrier.</p><p>Active transport of cargoes against concentration gradients requires an intact NE and NPC-barrier for retaining already transported cargoes in the destination compartment. In addition, it requires an input of metabolic energy, typically by the RanGTPase system. The corresponding duty cycles include not only a switch of Ran between its GDP- and GTP-bound states, but also one round of Ran-shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm. The energetic coupling occurs through a primary RanGTP-gradient, which is generated through NTF2-mediated import of RanGDP, nucleotide exchange by the nuclear RanGEF (RCC1) and cytoplasmic RanGTP-depletion by RanGAP and RanBP1/RanBP2. This gradient then directly fuels importin- and exportin-mediated transport cycles.</p><p>Exportins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Güttler and Görlich, 2011</xref>) bind their cargo molecules cooperatively with RanGTP inside nuclei, carry them as trimeric RanGTP·exportin·cargo complexes to the cytoplasm, where GTP-hydrolysis triggers release of cargo and Ran. The free exportin can then re-enter nuclei and export the next cargo.</p><p>CRM1, also called exportin 1 or Xpo1, is the most conserved nuclear export receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adachi and Yanagida, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fornerod et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stade et al., 1997</xref>). It is structurally well characterised, whereby structures of free CRM1, of certain cargo•CRM1•RanGTP complexes as well as their assembly- and disassembly-intermediates have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Monecke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Koyama and Matsuura, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Monecke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Saito and Matsuura, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koyama et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>CRM1 recognises its cargoes through short linear nuclear export signals (NESs), which comprise 4–5 critical hydrophobic (Φ) residues with characteristic spacings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Monecke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Güttler et al., 2010</xref>). CRM1 is essential for viability and is the target of the potentially lethal bacterial toxin leptomycin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nishi et al., 1994</xref>), which blocks NES-binding by covalently modifying a conserved cysteine residue within the NES-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kudo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Monecke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). CRM1 is known to carry multiple cargoes, including newly assembled 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, the signal recognition particle SRP, U snRNAs, or the genomic RNA of HIV1 via the Rev protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Moy and Silver, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ciufo and Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ho et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ohno et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Thomas and Kutay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rouquette et al., 2005</xref>). It is also known to regulate key cellular events by conditional export of transcription factors or cell cycle regulators from the nucleus (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hagting et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Cell nucleus and cytoplasm are prime examples for the division of labour in a eukaryotic cell. The cytoplasm hosts the machineries of the secretory pathway, many metabolic activities as well as the cytoskeletal structures that account for cell motility and long-range transport. It has also specialised in protein synthesis and <italic>de novo</italic> protein folding.</p><p>The nucleus lacks protein synthesis and thus depends on protein import from the cytoplasm. It has specialised in DNA replication and repair, nucleosome assembly, transcription, ribosome assembly, as well as in mRNA splicing and processing. Such specialisation critically relies on a spatial separation of interfering activities: Intranuclear protein synthesis, for example, would be a particularly wasteful process, because ribosomes would then also translate unspliced or incompletely spliced mRNAs, consequently read into introns, add inappropriate residues to the nascent chains, eventually encounter premature stop codons and thus produce truncated protein fragments. Such aberrant translation products would not only be non-functional, but probably also toxic, because they fail to fold, or act in a dominant-negative fashion.</p><p>It is thus not very surprising that eukaryotic cells have implemented several lines of defence against intranuclear translation, whereby the NE acts as a primary barrier to keep cytoplasmic translation activity out of nuclei. Likewise, even though the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits assemble inside the nucleus, they gain full translation competence only following late maturation steps in the cytoplasm (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thomson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A very general problem is, however, that the NPC barrier is not perfect. Instead, also objects larger than the nominal exclusion limit can leak—albeit slowly—into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>). Such slow mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents would become a problem if the leaked-in proteins would interfere with nuclear functions or dysregulate cellular activities. Countermeasures might be selective degradation or inhibition in the inappropriate compartment, or, when mis-localised to the nucleus, recognition by an exportin and subsequent retrieval to the cytoplasm.</p><p>Indeed, precedents for such exportin-mediated back-sorting of cytoplasmic proteins from the nucleus are already known. Animal Xpo6, for example, keeps actin out of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stüven et al., 2003</xref>), while Xpo4 and Xpo5 do the same for the translation elongation factors eIF5a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lipowsky et al., 2000</xref>) and eEF1A respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohnsack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calado et al., 2002</xref>). CRM1 was shown to expel several cytoplasmic factors from the nuclear compartment, including the RanGTPase system components RanBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Plafker and Macara, 2000</xref>) and RanGAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 1999</xref>) as well as the translation factor subunits eIF2β, eIF5, eIF2Bε and eRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohnsack et al., 2002</xref>). The full extent of active cytoplasmic confinement has, however, not yet been assessed.</p><p>We report here global scale analyses of nucleocytoplasmic partitioning in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and of CRM1-mediated nuclear export. According to stringent criteria, we identified ≈ 1000 potential CRM1 cargoes from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, ≈ 1050, from human HeLa cells, and ≈ 700 from the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We tested a subset of cargo candidates for CRM1-dependent nuclear export in cultured human cells and thereby validated a majority of them as true cargoes. For a subset, we also confirmed direct CRM1-interaction and mapped the corresponding NESs, some of which turned out to have unusual features. The majority of identified CRM1 cargoes are proteins and protein complexes with a very strong bias towards a cytoplasmic localisation, suggesting that their active back-sorting from the nucleus is a major cellular activity. This applies to nearly all translation factors (including the largest translation factor complexes like eIF2B), to factors involved in final ribosomal maturation steps, which might prevent ribosomes from acquiring translation competence already in the nuclear compartment, as well as to regulatory proteins, autophagy-linked factors, peroxisome biogenesis factors and to centrosomal proteins, in both, humans and frogs. Another major functional group of CRM1 cargoes with perfect nuclear exclusion is represented by vesicle coat proteins, which points to a strong evolutionary pressure to preclude the budding of vesicles from the inner nuclear membrane. We also identified numerous new instances, where CRM1 appears to act in regulatory circuits. More generally, these data represent a very rich resource for other researchers seeking information about nucleocytoplasmic distribution and CRM1-controlled localisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nucleocytoplasmic protein partitioning in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes</title><p>We were interested in a global view of how soluble proteins and protein complexes partition between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In order to tackle this question, we applied a deep proteome analysis to the isolated compartments. A problem for such endeavour is that standard cell fractionation procedures rely on shearing forces, often combined with hypotonic lysis or even treatment with detergents (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blobel and Potter, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dignam et al., 1983</xref>). All these treatments compromise the integrity of the NE. Nuclear proteins, which are not firmly associated with solid structures like chromatin, will then leak out and contaminate the cytoplasmic fraction—just as the nuclear fraction will be contaminated by cytoplasmic components.</p><p>In order to avoid these problems, we turned to <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> stage VI oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumont, 1972</xref>). These cells measure ≈1.3 mm in diameter and have nuclei of ≈450 µm. Such very large dimensions allow for a manual oocyte dissection into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions with exceptionally little cross-contamination (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Robertis et al., 1978</xref>). These oocyte nuclei are also special with their volume being 100,000 times larger than that of average-sized cells with a G2 DNA contents. The chromatin should therefore make no more than a negligible contribution to nuclear retention of proteins. Instead, the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of a given protein or protein complex in these cells should be solely determined by its passive diffusion properties and by their potential to access active nuclear import and/or export pathways. In addition, oocytes are very long-lived cells that grow over months to their final size, which implies that even slow partitioning processes are likely to have reached a steady state.</p><p>As a standard experiment, we dissected 60 oocytes, cleared the cytoplasmic fractions off yolk, normalised the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions to their respective volumes, and identified proteins in three biological replicates by mass spectrometry. Proteins of two replicates were separated by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>) and in-gel digested with trypsin. As a complementary approach, proteins of the third replicate were digested in solution. Resulting peptides were separated by reverse phase chromatography at pH 10 and obtained fractions analysed by LC-MS/MS. The raw data were searched against a comprehensive <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wühr et al., 2014</xref>). In this way, a total of 9573 proteoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) were identified, 7015 in isolated nuclei and 7036 in the cytoplasmic fractions. The intersection set comprised 4478 proteoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11466.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial proteomics of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for mass spectrometric analysis of cytosolic and nuclear proteins.

We therefore treated allelic isoforms not as separate proteins, but mapped all recognizable allelic forms down to unique protein species. This ‘mapping’ was guided also by comparisons to the human and the (diploid) <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> proteomes (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We aimed at a high-quality dataset for those proteins that can actually pass through NPCs and partition between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We therefore tried to minimize the number of ‘contaminants’ in the list, which represent, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum (which co-purifies with nuclei in the form of the NE) or the mitochondrial cloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heasman et al., 1984</xref>) that is tightly associated with the outside of these nuclei. We subsequently tested which proteins disappeared from the nuclear fraction when the NE was manually removed. Such proteins were discarded from the list if their sequence features qualified them also as integral membrane, ER-luminal or mitochondrial proteins. This left us with a total of 5006 unique proteins. Of these, 1126 were identified only in the nuclear fraction, 1059 only in cytosolic fraction and 2821 in both compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>In order to quantify each of these proteins in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, we employed the iBAQ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>) combined with an internal universal protein standard (UPS2; see Materials and methods). We estimate that our quantitation was reliable over a range of 5 orders of magnitude in abundance and accurate within a factor of 2.3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To validate the quality of the obtained nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, we first evaluated the partitioning of the previously described marker proteins nucleophosmin (also called B23 or NO38) and gelsolin, which are localised exclusively to nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmidt-Zachmann et al., 1987</xref>) or cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yin and Stossel, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Samwer et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. We chose highly abundant proteins, because these yield a larger number of unique, quantifiable peptides and thus allow for a more precise quantification. For nucleophosmin (a histone chaperone), we measured a nuclear concentration of ≈ 2.3 µM, a cytoplasmic concentration of 8 nM, and hence a nucleocytoplasmic (N:C) partition coefficient of 300:1. For gelsolin (a factor that stabilizes cytoplasmic actin in its G-form) we measured a nuclear concentration of ≈ 0.01 µM, a cytoplasmic of ≈ 4 µM, and thus an N:C ratio of 1:400. This suggests that the obtained nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions show only very limited cross-contamination and also suggested what range of partition coefficients should be expected also for other proteins.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> contains complete and simplified data sets for the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of 5006 individual proteins and 9573 proteoforms.

As these patterns are in many cases tightly linked to the activity of CRM1, we will discuss these after describing our approach of mapping the CRM1-dependent nuclear exportome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Implications for energy supply of the oocyte nucleus</title><p>An apparently CRM1-independent aspect relates to the energy supply of the giant oocyte cell nucleus. Efficient duty cycles of numerous enzymes, such as Ran, require a high NTP:NDP ratio, which seems hard to maintain inside these nuclei if ATP were produced only outside (i.e. by mitochondria or cytosolic glycolysis). The problem arises from the short half-life of ATP in living cells (≈ 1 min), which is less time than an ATP molecule would typically need to diffuse into and across such large nucleus. We now found evidence in the oocyte for two parallel solutions to this problem.</p><p>The first is a ‘creatine-creatine phosphate energy shuttle’, which uses diffusion of creatine phosphate (CP) instead of ATP for a long-range transport of energy equivalents (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bessman and Carpenter, 1985</xref>). It exploits the ≈160 times higher phosphorylation potential of CP as compared to ATP, and operates by creatine kinase (CK) synthesising CP from ATP near ATP sources and the reverse reaction at sites of ATP consumption. Oocytes enable such CP shuttle by maintaining high CK concentrations in both, cytoplasm and nucleus (3 µM and 1.5 µM, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The second solution concerns the glycolysis pathway. The oocyte nucleus contains all glycolytic enzymes, except for hexokinase and phosphofructokinase that catalyse the ATP-consuming preparatory steps. The hexokinase level is generally very low in oocytes (because they produce glucose 6-phosphate by other means; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nutt et al., 2005</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), while 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK) is confined to the cytoplasm (N:C ≈ 1:2000; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This enzyme distribution predicts a directed flux of fructose 1,6 bisphosphate into the nucleus. It further suggests that oocyte nuclei produce the high-energy compounds phosphoenolpyruvate and 1,3 bisphoglycerate locally and use them for synthesizing ATP and other NTPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A large-scale data set for potential CRM1 cargoes from three species</title><p>The exportin CRM1 is known to be essential for viability and to account for nuclear export of numerous targets (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Thakar et al., 2013</xref> for a comprehensive summary of so far identified substrates). However, it has been unclear how broad the cargo spectrum really is and which set of cellular processes are directly or indirectly controlled by CRM1-dependent nuclear export.</p><p>In order to close this gap, we set out to identify cargoes in an unbiased manner from three different species and types of cells, namely: the already-mentioned <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, human HeLa cells and the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We first prepared cellular extracts, used immobilised CRM1 as an affinity matrix and asked which proteins and protein complexes would bind in a RanGTP-dependent manner. As detailed below, CRM1 has many interaction partners of widely different abundance and affinity, which implies that the majority of them bind to the immobilized exportin in a highly sub-stoichiometric manner. The challenge thus is to cleanly distinguish such highly sub-stoichiometric bands from non-specific interactors. To this end, we optimised several parameters, such as the way of immobilisation, the exportin:extract ratios (to minimise competition between cargoes), buffer conditions, incubation time, etc., in order to maximise the signal-to-noise ratio of the affinity chromatography (for details see Materials and methods).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the starting extracts and CRM1-bound fractions of such affinity chromatographies, and it documents indeed a very large number of protein species that bound to CRM1 in a RanGTP-dependent manner. Using the mass-spectrometric approaches mentioned above, we identified in the starting extracts ≈2800 (<italic>Xenopus</italic>), ≈3900 (human) and ≈2600 (yeast) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’ samples, ≈2300, 3000 and ≈2000 proteins were identified. About 14% of these had not been detected in the total extracts and these probably represent low-abundance proteins that had been highly enriched during CRM1 affinity chromatography.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11466.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of potential CRM1 cargoes from 3 species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mouse (mm) or yeast (sc) CRM1 were immobilised through a biotinylated Avi-tag to streptavidin agarose, and incubated with indicated extracts (1 ml), without or with the addition of 5 μM RanQ69L<sup>5-180</sup>GTP.

We also considered to which extent it became enriched from the input extract (‘input enrichment’), to which extent its CRM1-binding had been stimulated by RanGTP (‘RanGTP-stimulation’), as well as its absolute abundance in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fraction (‘Molar fractions in CRM1+RanGTP’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which affects the accuracy of quantification and thus the reliability of the first two numbers.

These thresholds had been adjusted to best match the behaviour of proteins, whose specific CRM1-interaction is already established beyond doubt, as well as of proteins that are known not to interact with the exportin (see Materials and methods). CRM1-binders of the category A1 not only had to pass the most stringent thresholds in terms of RanGTP-stimulation of CRM1-binding (≥500-fold in the case of <italic>Xenopus</italic>) and enrichment from the input extract (≥3-fold), but also belong to the most abundant proteins in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fraction (Note that the threshold of a 500 times stronger signal than in the negative (minus RanGTP) control is far more stringent than the standard of ‘2-fold’, which is used in most proteomics studies). A2 had an even stricter threshold for ‘input enrichment’ (≥100), but a relaxed one for the apparent RanGTP-stimulation. It includes cargoes like snurportin, which bind CRM1 so strongly that the affinity is still high even in the absence of RanGTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paraskeva et al., 1999</xref>). In category B, one of the three criteria was relaxed, while the category ‘low abundant’ includes proteins that were only detected in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fraction, but were not sufficiently abundant to qualify for category A.</p><p>We assume that most identified proteins from the categories A, B and ‘low abundant’ are direct CRM1 interactors that either carry a functional NES or occur in stable complexes with NES-containing proteins. Thus, we identified ≈1000 probable cargoes each in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human as well as ≈700 in yeast. This is far more than identified for any other NTR (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>), and represents ≈20% of all detectable nuclear or cytosolic proteins, only a small fraction of which (≈ 10%) had been proposed to be associated with CRM1 before (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This suggests that CRM1 serves a far larger number of cargoes than previously assumed. To estimate our positive discovery rate of direct CRM1 cargos, we tested a subset of these candidates below.</p><p>Of course, nucleoporins, and FG Nups in particular, were also identified as CRM1 ligands. We consider them, however, as part of the transport machinery and not as cargoes. Some of them bind CRM1 very strongly, for example, the human or <italic>Xenopus</italic> Nup214•88•62 complex or Nup358 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, and e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fornerod et al., 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelsma et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>On the other end of the distribution, we identified ≈700 proteins in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, ≈900 in human and ≈600 in yeast, which were strongly selected against in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These represent proteins, whose nucleocytoplasmic partitioning is probably not directly affected by CRM1. Metabolic enzymes (of e.g. glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway etc.), protein folding factors, and exclusively nuclear proteins are over-represented in this ‘non-binder’ category.</p><p>In between, we found a broad zone of ‘ambiguous’ proteins, which actually represent a continuum. Some of them bound still very specifically to the export-form of CRM1 (according to the ‘minus RanGTP’-control); yet, the binding was weak. We assume that these proteins become only transiently CRM1 cargoes (e.g. in response to the addition or removal of a post-translational modification) or that they only transiently associate with <italic>bona fide</italic> CRM1-cargoes. On the other end of the ‘ambiguous’ category, there are proteins, which appear to be ‘CRM1 non-binders’.

Nevertheless, they are also subject to exportin-mediated nuclear export. Human EF1A was previously identified as the most prominent export cargo of Xpo5, while the elongation factor for proline-rich regions, eIF5A, is exported by Xpo4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lipowsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohnsack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calado et al., 2002</xref>).

Furthermore, CRM1-dependent nuclear depletion also applies to several translation-associated factors, such as the signal recognition particle SRP, where SRP54 appears to be the NES-carrying component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), or the human start-methionine aminopeptidase MetAP2, which binds translating ribosomes and cleaves the start methionine from nascent polypeptides. The normally strictly cytoplasmic MetAP2 accumulates upon leptomycin B treatment in nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), not only validating it as a true CRM1 cargo, but also suggesting that it can bind to assembling ribosomal subunits prematurely and possibly interfere with the maturation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CRM1 and ribosome biogenesis</title><p>CRM1 is known to be essential for ribosome biogenesis. It exports pre-60S ribosomal subunits (rSUs) through the export adapter Nmd3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ho et al., 2000</xref>), while Ltv1 and Rio2 behave like export adapters for yeast 40S rSUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Seiser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Yeast Arx1 and the Mex67•Mtr2 dimer also bind pre-60S rSU subunits and promote export through direct interactions with FG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bradatsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, Ecm1, Bud20, Alb1, Tif6, Rlp24, Nog1, and Mtr4 are known to escort 60S rSUs, while Nob1 and Enp1 have been shown to accompany 40S rSUs to the cytoplasm, without remaining a constituent of mature ribosomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thomson et al., 2013</xref>). We now found that yeast Enp1 (essential nuclear protein 1) behaves like an autonomous CRM1 substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that it might actually act as yet another adapter for CRM1-mediated export of 40S rSUs. The use of multiple export adapters, as in here, might not just be an issue of robustness and redundancies, but a more fundamental requirement for making such large cargoes sufficiently ‘soluble’ in the gel-like permeability barrier of NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ribbeck and Görlich, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, our analysis revealed that additional predominantly nuclear, ribosomal biogenesis factors behave like CRM1 cargoes, namely: Brx1, Pno1, Tsr1, Rpf1, Rlp7, Ytm1, Tsr3, Rix7, Erb1, Nsa1, Ssf1, Dim1, Nol10, Loc1, and Rpf2 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref> sheet ‘Ribosome biogenesis’). Thus, they might also escort rSUs to the cytoplasm, and possibly facilitate the export process by providing additional binding sites for CRM1.</p><p>Newly exported 40S and 60S rSUs acquire translation competence only after a series of maturation steps in the cytoplasm. In the case of yeast 60S rSUs, this involves the activities of Drg1/ Afg2, Rei1, Reh1, Jjj1, Yvh1, Lsg1, Efl1/ Ria1 as well as of Sdo1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Panse and Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thomson et al., 2013</xref>). While some of these might get loaded already inside the nucleus, it appears that Drg1, Rei1, Reh1, Lsg1, and Ria1 act exclusively in the cytoplasm. All these factors showed a strong and strictly RanGTP-dependent interaction with CRM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref> sheet ‘Ribosome biogenesis’). This suggests that CRM1 keeps them cytoplasmic, possibly to avoid the occurrence of translation-active ribosomes inside the nucleus (at least Lsg1 and Rei1 behave like true CRM1 cargoes, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A cytoplasmic confinement of these factors appears crucial for yet another reason: They displace the export mediators Arx1, Nmd3, Mex67, and Mtr2 from newly exported 60S species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loibl et al., 2014</xref>). A premature intra-nuclear displacement by mis-localized cytoplasmic maturation factors could thus abort ribosomal export.</p><p>Cytoplasmic maturation also involves the incorporation of additional ribosomal proteins, a prominent example being rpS3. rpS3 is highly abundant in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fraction, and thus perhaps hindered (directly or indirectly) by CRM1 to bind 40S rSUs prematurely already inside nuclei. The same might apply to rpL24a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Aminoacyl tRNA ligases</title><p>These enzymes are essential for translation, and a cytoplasmic confinement of tRNA-charging would also contribute to the exclusion of intranuclear translation. Nevertheless, nuclear aminoacylation has been proposed as a proof-reading step for correct pre-tRNA processing and maturation prior to export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lund and Dahlberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sarkar et al., 1999</xref>). This proposal was based on the observations that blocking aminoacylation in yeast results in nuclear accumulation of tRNA and that a similar treatment in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes prevents tRNAs, which had been injected into the nucleus, from reaching an exclusively cytoplasmic steady state distribution. There are, however, also arguments against this scenario, foremost that a loss of cytoplasmic retention of tRNA by translation elongation factor eEF1A (which binds only aminoacylated tRNA) would explain the phenotypes as well. Furthermore, a structural and functional analysis of tRNA•Xpo-t•Ran export complexes revealed that this exportin proof-reads a correct 3'-CCA end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arts et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lipowsky et al., 1999</xref>), but cannot sense aminoacylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cook et al., 2009</xref>). The latter applies also to the alternative tRNA exporter Xpo5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohnsack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calado et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To clarify this issue at least for <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, we analysed the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the aminoacyl tRNA ligases and found a strong cytoplasmic bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, sheet ‘Aminoacyl tRNA ligases’). The cytoplasmic concentration exceeded the nuclear one by more than a factor of 100 in most cases, and even the least excluded ones had ≈10 times higher levels in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. This makes is rather unlikely that nuclear aminoacylation is a general proof-reading criterion prior to tRNA export. At least the Ser, Thre, and Asn tRNA-ligases showed a strong RanGTP-dependent interaction with CRM1. We tested the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Asn tRNA ligase by transfection assays and observed a perfect CRM1-dependent nuclear exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Human Ser tRNA ligase and the α-subunit of the yeast Phe tRNA ligase behave the same way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), suggesting that cells make a true effort to keep tRNA aminoacylation cytoplasmic.</p><p>We also tested the human Cys tRNA ligase that failed to interact with CRM1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Nevertheless, the transfected GFP-fusion protein showed a perfect nuclear exclusion, which was also not impaired by leptomycin B-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). How this cytoplasmic confinement is maintained is still unclear, but the formation of larger complexes or alternative export pathways are plausible possibilities. In contrast to a CRM1-dependent confinement, the cytoplasmic localisation can, however, not be maintained against a fused SV40-type NLS. These transfection experiments also exemplify the validation of a ‘CRM1-non-binder’ (for more such validations, see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>CRM1 and mRNA degradation</title><p>We identified several high-scoring CRM1 cargoes amongst cytoplasmic mRNA degradation factors, components of P-bodies and stress granules.

Thus, CRM1 probably enables cells to control nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA turnover independently from each other. This CRM1 function appears very well conserved from yeast to human.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>CRM1, vesicular transport and autophagy</title><p>So far, no connection has been made between CRM-mediated nuclear export and vesicle formation along the secretory pathway (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirchhausen, 2000</xref>). Yet, we observed that COPI and COPII coat proteins as well as, e.g., the AP-1 and AP2 adapter complexes or the AP180 clathrin coat assembly protein behave like CRM1 cargoes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">3</xref>, sheets ‘Vesicle coat proteins’; as well as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

The absence in other cell types can now be explained by an active depletion of the vesicular budding machineries from the nuclear interior.</p><p>The data also suggest an unanticipated connection of CRM1 to autophagy (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reggiori and Klionsky, 2013</xref>). Atg1, Atg13, Atg17, and Vps30 are all required for autophagy in yeast and all of them are high-scoring CRM1 cargoes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>, sheet ‘Autophagy’). It thus appears as if CRM1 counteracted an initiation of autophagy from the nuclear interior. The situation is very similar in human cells, though the spectrum of CRM1-interacting autophagy components is slightly different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> sheet ‘Autophagy’). For example, here the ATG8-conjugating enzyme ATG3 is a major CRM1-cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>CRM1 and post-translational transport to peroxisomes</title><p>Our data set also revealed high-scoring CRM1 cargoes that make an unexpected link between nuclear export and protein import into peroxisomes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2011</xref>): The peroxisomal targeting (PTS1) receptor Pex5 was not only identified as a high-scoring CRM1-binder, but also showed a strictly CRM1-dependent nuclear exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This connection might point to a general challenge for post-translational transport from the cytosol, namely that diffusive transport will not necessarily lead to the destination organelle, but also to and possibly into nuclei. In the case of peroxisomal proteins, this poses a particular danger as many of them produce reactive oxygen species that might damage the genome. A first line of defence against such incidents is a trapping of peroxisomal proteins by dedicated targeting receptors. The resulting receptor•substrate complexes, however, still need to reach peroxisomes by diffusive transport. If this fails and the complex ends up inside nuclei, then CRM1-mediated export can rectify the problem and give the targeting complex another chance to reach its correct destination.</p><p>PEX19 from yeast or human is another example, which behaves like a perfect CRM1 cargo and shows a CRM1-dependent nuclear exclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). PEX19 targets membrane proteins to peroxisomes and allows pre-peroxisomes to bud from the ER (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). A mis-targeting of PEX19 to nuclei by a fused NLS causes interesting consequences, namely nuclear accumulation of newly synthesised peroxisomal membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>).

Septins interconnect actin and microtubule networks, function in cytokinesis, formation of cilia and defence against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mostowy and Cossart, 2012</xref>), and it appears that their nuclear accumulation needs to be actively suppressed.</p><p>The data also suggests some contribution of CRM1 to nuclear exclusion of α- and β-tubulin in metazoan cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">3</xref>).

These strong CRM1 interactors include the HAUS augmin complex, γ-tubulin and γ-tubulin complex components as well as a number of additional centriolar proteins (e.g. CEP41, CEP55, and CEP170). This could point not only to an active suppression of microtubule nucleation in metazoan interphase nuclei, but also to additional mitotic function of CRM1 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnaoutov et al., 2005</xref>)—namely at centrosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-13"><title>CRM1 and regulatory proteins</title><p>Almost every aspect of cellular physiology is under the control of protein kinases, phosphatases or the ubiquitin/ proteasome system. Our data now suggest that CRM1 is more heavily involved in such regulatory circuits than previously thought. Alone in HeLa cells, we found ≈ 70 kinases as high-scoring CRM1 cargoes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), only a fraction of which had been described as such before. The new cargoes include heavily studied kinases such as protein kinase A, the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, the pro-apoptotic serine/ threonine kinase 3, the tank-binding kinase 1, Raf-1, and several isoforms of casein kinase I and II. In addition, we identified numerous kinase regulators as new CRM1 cargoes, examples being the already mentioned regulatory subunit of PKA (PRKAr2a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) or the TSC1•TSC2 complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which is a key component of the mTOR signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Laplante and Sabatini, 2009</xref>).

The most common one is a PKI-type NES. Several other spacings are also allowed, which can be explained either by such NESs binding in a different conformation to CRM1 (snurportin-type or Rev-type NES) or by skipping one Φ-residue in a 5Φ NES. A functional NES also needs to be solvent-exposed and not buried in a globular fold.</p><p>We applied these criteria to identify NESs in a set of validated, new CRM1 cargoes. We were successful in six cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but failed with some others (e.g. Pex5, rpS3, Haus1, Cop beta’, MetAP2, CDC37L, Enp1, Phe tRNA ligase α). These negative cases illustrate how difficult a reliable NES prediction still is. These difficulties originate from at least two problems. First, many published NESs turned out to be incorrect (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu et al., 2012b</xref> and discussion therein). NES prediction will therefore remain unreliable and produce frequent false-positive hits as long as it is based on an unreliable list of positive cases. Second, we probably miss true NESs, because we do not yet know all NES patterns.</p><p>Our study should now provide solutions to these limitations. First, we provide large test sets for benchmarking current and future NES predictions, first of all a total of ≈1300 ‘category A cargoes’, which should contain an NES (in the case of oligomers at least one per complex). The subset of such true CRM1 cargoes, which lack a so far recognizable export signal, provides an ideal starting point for identifying NESs that conform to new patterns. We also found ≈2200 clear non-CRM1-binders that can serve as a negative control group for NES prediction.</p><p>The just mentioned non-binders include several cases (11) that have been listed as CRM1-cargoes in the NESdb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu et al., 2012b</xref>). This could now point to the false-positives in the NESdb or to contaminating false-negatives in our dataset. To address this issue, we analysed seven of these conflicting cases and tested the behaviour of the corresponding GFP fusions in the HeLa cell transfection assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). All of them showed a considerable nuclear signal already in untreated cells and this nuclear signal did not further increase upon blocking CRM1 by leptomycin B. These seven re-tested candidates thus behaved as predicted from their classification as CRM1 non-binders, at least for the tested protein isoforms (cloned from HeLa cell cDNA), for the tested cell type (human HeLa cells) and under standard cell culture conditions.</p><p>An interesting twist to CRM1-mediated export is that it can be regulated by post-translational modifications. Cyclin B, for example, is kept cytoplasmic by CRM1 until prophase, when the NES gets inactivated by phosphorylation of adjacent serine residues and the protein suddenly accumulates inside nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). PHAX, the export adapter for U snRNAs, on the other hand, requires phosphorylation for an efficient interaction with CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kitao et al., 2008</xref>). Given these examples, it will now be very interesting to obtain a global view on how phosphorylation impacts individual cargo-CRM1 interactions, for example, by testing in how far CRM1 selects for or against the corresponding phosphoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>What necessitates an active sorting of obligatory cytoplasmic proteins?</title><p>Surprising outcomes of our study not only were the sheer number of CRM1 cargoes (≈ 1/4 of all detectable cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins), but also that the majority of cargoes are actually exclusively cytoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">4</xref>).

First, the NPC permeability barrier is <italic>per se</italic> probably imperfect and allows leakage: It is based on the sieving effect of reversibly crosslinked FG repeat domains and probably represents compromise in the sense that a tighter barrier would also restrict facilitated transport (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref> and discussions therein).</p><p>In addition, there are situations, where even the most perfect NPC barrier gets bypassed. The open mitosis in metazoans, for example, leads to a complete mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents and requires an unmixing following reformation of the nuclear envelope. Nuclear proteins require re-import, while obligatory cytoplasmic proteins, such as translation factors, components of the vesicular transport machinery and many others, are obviously subject to active nuclear export. Another source of leakage might be NPC assembly, where inner and outer nuclear membrane might already fuse to a pore, before all FG Nups are in place to maintain a permeability barrier.</p><p>Finally, cells should survive a temporary damage of their nuclear envelope, which is known to occur rather frequently in certain cultured cancers cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hatch et al., 2013</xref>), but might also happen in normal cells, in particular when exposed to mechanical stress. Such incidents not only require a repair of the NE, but also a rapid unmixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents by active import as well as by active export. Thus, the barriers of the NE alone cannot maintain the compartment identities. Instead, a robust separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents requires active corrective mechanisms, whereby the exportin CRM1 appears to play a very central role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Microdissection of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes</title><p>Manual microdissection of the oocytes was performed in ‘5:1/HEPES buffer’ (10 mM HEPES/ KOH pH 7.5, 83 mM KCl, 17 mM NaCl, supplemented with Roche complete protease inhibitor (EDTA-free) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu and Liu, 2006</xref>). Isolated nuclei were gently washed several times, and proteins were recovered by ethanol precipitation.</p><p>The respective cytoplasmic fractions were diluted with ‘5:1/HEPES buffer’ and homogenized with a pestle. Pigments, yolk and membranes were removed from the extract by two rounds of centrifugation (17,000 g, 15 min, 4°C). Note that thereby also insoluble protein complexes, such as intermediate filaments were removed, and that our analysis explicitly aimed at the nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of soluble complexes and proteins. We therefore also excluded proteins that co-purified with nuclei through their association with the nuclear envelope (NE). Such proteins were identified and ‘flagged’ by a manual dissection of nuclei into nuclear interiors and crude NEs (kindly performed by Volker Cordes) and by asking which ‘nuclear’ proteins did not fractionate with the nuclear interiors.</p><p>A total of 775 unique proteins (see below) were flagged as possibly not being cytosolic or intranuclear, 748 of them were removed from the list of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, while 27 were kept in the final list because they were manually qualified as cytosolic or intranuclear proteins according to previous literature, or according to their subcellular localization at Human Proteome Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Quantitative mass spectrometric analysis of the obtained nuclear and cytosolic fractions involved three biological replicates with two technical replicates each.

Proteins were then in-gel digested as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, proteins were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 30 min at 55°C, and then alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (BC) for 20 min at 26°C in the dark. Protein digestion was performed overnight at 37°C at a 1:50 (w/w) trypsin (Promega #V5111) to protein ratio. Following digestion, peptides were extracted from the gel pieces, and concentrated by vacuum evaporation of the solvent in a SpeedVac to near dryness. Dried peptides were dissolved in 20 µl of 1% (v/v) formic acid, and 6 µl were analysed LC-MS/MS for each technical replicate.</p><p>In the second workflow, ethanol-precipitated proteins were dissolved in 1% (v/v) RapiGest SF surfactant (Waters # 186002122) at 70°C for 10 min.

Proteins were first digested with Lys-C (Roche, 1:100 enzyme to protein ratio) for 4 hr at 37°C, then overnight with trypsin at a final RapiGest concentration to 0.1%. Following digestion, the samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration of 1%, v/v, 37°C, 1 h) to break down the RapiGest surfactant, the resulting by-products were pelleted by centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 15 min, RT), and the supernatant containing the digested peptides was transferred to a new tube. Peptides were desalted on reversed phase-C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges (SPE; SepPak, Waters) and concentrated in a SpeedVac to near dryness. Then, peptides were resuspended in 10 mM ammonium hydroxide (pH 10) and loaded onto a reverse phase HPLC column (XBridge C18, Waters, 3.5 µm, 1.0 mm x 150 mm) and eluted in a 5-35% (v/v) acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 60 µl/min. 45 initial fractions were collected, which were combined into 17 peptide pools.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor), Karsten Weis (Reviewing Editor), and two peer reviewers. One of the two reviewers, Naoko Imamoto, has agreed to share her identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Kirli et al. describe a thorough and comprehensive identification of CRM1 cargoes in yeast, <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and human cells. Both reviewers felt that this report provides important novel insight on the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of proteins in eukaryotic cells and represents a valuable resource not only to the nuclear transport field, but also to the broad field of cell biology. Furthermore, this study reports several unexpected findings. For example, that a subset of protein kinases is excluded from the nucleus by CRM1 is most likely to ensure compartment-specific phosphorylation. Interestingly, in addition to protein kinases, a broad range of cytoplasmic proteins contain NESs and are bona fide CRM1 cargoes, indicating that eukaryotic cells have evolved a mechanism to maintain these proteins in the cytoplasmic compartment and that the accumulation of these factors in the nuclear compartment can be detrimental.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A concern amongst the reviewers was the fact that the purifications were apparently only performed once and no biological replicates are presented in the study. Clearly, there could be significant variation between experiments. This could be particularly problematic for proteins that were not identified, and which do not necessarily need to correspond to low-abundance proteins.

Clearly, there could be significant variation between experiments. This could be particularly problematic for proteins that were not identified, and which do not necessarily need to correspond to low-abundance proteins. For example, the iBAQ intensities vary significantly between experiments (i.e. in one experiment, iBAC intensity is 0, while in the other experiment, iBAQ intensity is high). Repeat experiments (for at least one model system) could clarify this point and potentially strengthen the paper significantly. If this was not possible in a reasonable time frame some of the conclusions need to be toned down and no conclusions should be drawn from the lack of identification/negative results.</italic></p><p>The analysis of nucleocytoplasmic partitioning did include three biological replicates. These were performed using different biological samples (note that there is also genetic variability between frogs) by different workflows (SDS-PAGE⇒ tryptic digests ⇒ LC/MS versus in-solution-digest ⇒ two dimensional HPLC⇒ MS) and different mass spectrometric setups. Yet, the agreement in terms of identification is remarkably good: Out of the 1000 top abundant proteins identified in the first replicate, 996 were re-identified in the second, and all 1000 in the third (see table below). For low abundance proteins, the re-discovery was, of course, lower.</p><p><table-wrap id="tblu2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td colspan="2"><p>Re-identification of proteins from Biol.

A biological replicate of all binding experiments at the already presented depth would require 4 weeks of instrumentation time and this cannot be accommodated within the time frame of the revision, also out of respect for other projects that rely on the instruments as well.</p><p>Our text did not include any specific conclusions from negative results – other than the suggestion that the extremes (category A cargoes and clear non-binders) could provide a statistical basis for optimising NES-predictions. We still believe this to be a valid point.</p><p>Yet, we are also fully aware of the fact that any large-scale proteomics study is likely to produce false-positive, as well as false-negative, hits. We therefore decided to look deeper into this issue.</p><p>First, we implemented a more conservative classification of cargoes as well as of ‘CRM1 non-binders’. Essentially, candidates are listed within these categories only if their abundance exceeds a certain threshold in either the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fraction or in the starting material. For cargoes, the threshold became stricter (the so far least reliable ‘category D’ became a subgroup of ambiguous). For non-binders, a threshold for ‘input abundance’ was newly implemented. This reduced the numbers of non-binders to the most reliable ones, while the category ‘ambiguous’ became larger.</p><p>Second, we used an earlier analysis of CRM1-bound fractions from HeLa cell extracts as a ‘biological replicate 2’ in order to validate the main dataset (biological replicate 1). While still optimising the cargo identification, we used the SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) approach to quantitatively compare ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fractions with a minus RanGTP control (at that time we had not yet fully realized that a comparison of just those two sample does not allow a reliable identification of cargoes). We now re-analysed the SILAC data, derived iBAQ intensities and calculated molar fractions for 2756 identified proteins in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’ sample.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref> shows how the measured molar fractions correlate between the two datasets. Considering that different instrumentations were used, the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.79 is actually quite good and in full agreement with our estimation that protein quantitation with our setup is, on average, accurate within a factor of 2.3.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11466.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Scatter plot shows correlation of molar fractions of given protein species within the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fractions of the two biological replicates.</title><p>Note that many of the data points overlap at the diagonal. The local density of data points in the plot was therefore color-coded like a heat map, with red indicating the highest density and blue the lowest density. The red-orange region represents already 50% of the data points.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11466.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11466.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11466-resp-fig1-v4"/></fig></p><p>Third, the correlation plot does not include proteins that remained undetected in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fractions and thus excludes many of the ‘CRM1 non-binders’. We therefore compared the two datasets in yet another way: We re-calculated the cargo classification after replacing the iBAQ intensities in the ‘CRM1+RanGTP’-bound fraction by the (re-scaled) iBAQ intensities of biological replicate 2. […] The agreement between the replicates is remarkably good. Most assignments (97%) are identical. There are no swaps between cargo and non-binders, just a few changes between ambiguous/cargo and ambiguous/non-binder.</p><p>Fourth, we added new the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, where we validated predicted negatives from our screen for CRM1 cargoes by expressing them as GFP or GFP-NLS fusions in HeLa cells. Specifically, we tested seven (out of the eleven) cases of clearly conflicting data, namely human proteins that are listed as CRM1 cargoes in the NESdb, but appeared negative according to our proteomics data (the seven were the ones, where cloning from HeLa cDNA worked at the first trial). Four of them showed an exclusively nuclear signal already as plain GFP fusions. The other three were equally distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm, and their nuclear signal did not increase upon blocking CRM1 by leptomycin B. These seven re-tested candidates thus behaved as predicted from their classification as CRM1 non-binders, at least for the tested protein isoforms (cloned from HeLa cell cDNA), for the tested cell type (human HeLa cells) and under standard cell culture conditions.</p><p><italic>Also, it was unclear how the thresholding was performed.

More explanation is required and it is not clear how these lines were drawn and the thresholds were set.</italic></p><p>We agree, the ‘explanatory tables’ for the thresholds were confusing. In fact, they were a legacy from an earlier version. This has been corrected now and the layout has been simplified.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
