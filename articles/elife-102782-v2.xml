responding to threat cues is essential to survival. Freezing is a predominant threat behavior in rats. We have recently shown that a threat cue can organize diverse behaviors beyond freezing, including locomotion (Chu et al., 2024). However, that experimental design was complex, required many sessions, and had rats receive many foot shock presentations. Moreover, the findings were descriptive. Here, we gave female and male Long Evans rats cue light illumination paired or unpaired with foot shock (eight total) in a conditioned suppression setting using a range of shock intensities (0.15, 0.25, 0.35, or 0.50 mA). We found that conditioned suppression was only observed at higher foot shock intensities (0.35 mA and 0.50 mA). We constructed comprehensive temporal ethograms by scoring 22,272 frames across 12 behavior categories in 200-ms intervals around cue light illumination. The 0.50 mA and 0.35 mA shock-paired visual cues suppressed reward seeking, rearing, and scaling, as well as light-directed rearing and light-directed scaling. These shock-paired visual cues further elicited locomotion and freezing. Linear discriminant analyses showed that ethogram data could accurately classify rats into paired and unpaired groups. Using complete ethogram data produced superior classification compared to behavior subsets, including an immobility subset featuring freezing. The results demonstrate diverse threat behaviors – in a short and simple procedure – containing sufficient information to distinguish the visual fear conditioning status of individual rats.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>ethogram</kwd><kwd>associative</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>flight</kwd><kwd>freezing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH117791</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDannald</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A more complete, bidirectional relationship between fear conditioning and behavior is established when many behaviors are examined, as opposed to single behavior such as freezing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In a typical Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure, a neutral cue is paired with foot shock. As a result, the shock-paired cue acquires many properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDannald, 2023</xref>). The most well-known property is that a shock-paired cue (or context) can elicit freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>). Pavlovian conditioning procedures measuring freezing have been used to great effect to reveal neural bases of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LeDoux et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Oca et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goosens and Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Massi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>A shock-paired cue can also suppress reward seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Estes and Skinner, 1941</xref>), a phenomenon referred to as conditioned suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Killcross et al., 1997</xref>). Using conditioned suppression procedures, we recently demonstrated that a shock-paired auditory cue elicits locomotion, rearing, and jumping, in addition to freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2024</xref>). Though consistent with some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Totty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borkar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chanthongdee et al., 2024</xref>), observing such a diversity of fear-conditioned behaviors is uncommon. In rats, and across a variety of settings, freezing is a predominant fear-conditioned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trott et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Williams-Spooner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ng and Sangha, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yau et al., 2024</xref>). It is possible the diversity we observed was due to the complexity of our experimental design (2–3 cues, including an uncertainty cue), the specific stimuli used (complex auditory cues), or the numerous shock presentations (50+). Further, our results were descriptive. If there is a robust relationship between a rat’s fear conditioning status (paired vs. unpaired cue and shock presentations) and these diverse behaviors, then we should be able to predict an individual’s status from ethograms spanning all behaviors.</p><p>The goal of the present experiments was to comprehensively quantify behaviors evoked by a shock-paired cue in a simple, visual fear conditioning setting. We then sought to determine if ethograms can predict rats’ fear conditioning status (paired vs. unpaired). Mildly food-deprived, Long Evans rats (half female) were trained to nose poke for food, then received Pavlovian fear conditioning over a baseline of rewarded poking. All rats received a 10-s visual cue paired or unpaired with foot shock. First, we identified the lowest shock intensity that would support conditioned suppression (in the manner of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holland, 1979</xref>). In Experiment 1, rats received 0.15 or 0.25 mA foot shock. In Experiment 2, rats received 0.35 or 0.50 mA foot shock. All rats received eight total shock presentations, thereby making these experiments simpler and shorter than our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2024</xref>). Extinction testing (four total cue light illuminations) was designed to reveal behaviors acquired by the visual cue during conditioning, rather than the reduction of those behaviors over trials and sessions.</p><p>TTL-triggered cameras were programmed to capture frames at 200-ms intervals before, during, and following cue light illumination. For Experiment 2, 22,272 frames were hand scored for 12 behaviors under categories of Immobility (freezing and stretching), Horizontal movement (locomotion and backpedaling), Vertical movement (rearing, scaling, and jumping), and Reward-related behavior (nose port and food cup). Light-directed variants of each vertical movement type were differentiated. Ethograms spanning all 12 behaviors were constructed from the scored frames. Multivariate and univariate ANOVA performed on the ethogram data revealed behaviors that differed between groups. Linear discriminant analyses determined if group membership (paired vs. unpaired) can be classified from ethogram data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our first objective was to determine the lowest foot shock intensity capable of supporting conditioned suppression to a visual cue. Rats were shaped to nose poke in a central port to receive a food reward, delivered via a cup directly below. The cue light was positioned above the central port. Cue light illumination resulted in bright, focal illumination of the light itself as well as diffuse illumination of the entire context, which was otherwise dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In Experiment 1, rats received cue light illumination paired or unpaired with a 0.25 or 0.15 mA foot shock.

These behaviors were divided into four different categories: Immobile (freezing and stretching), Reward (cup and port), Vertical (rearing, scaling, and jumping), and Horizontal (locomotion and backpedaling). Within the Vertical category, we separated rearing and scaling that were specifically directed toward the light. This was done because light-directed behavior reflects stimulus orienting, while non-light-directed behavior reflects context exploration.</p><p>We focused our scoring efforts on Experiment 2: conditioning session 2 and the extinction session. During these sessions, paired, but not unpaired rats, receiving the 0.50 mA and 0.35 mA foot shock intensities demonstrated robust nose poke suppression. Six observers blind to group, sex, and intensity scored 22,272 total frames (see ‘Materials and methods’ for blinding details): 11,136 from the second conditioning session and 11,136 from the extinction session. Additionally, these six observers scored 696 frames spanning eight separate comparison trials. We determined inter-rater reliability by calculating the % identical observations for each observer-observer pair across the 696 frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The mean inter-rater reliability was 72.41%. Although inter-rater reliability was higher when fewer behaviors were present within a trial (e.g., 77.7% when three were present), the inter-rater reliability remained high, at 71.9%, even when eight behaviors were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hand scoring inter-rater reliability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) % identical observations for the comparison frames were calculated for each observer–observer pair.

For example, a disagreement in which one observer assigns jump to a frame, while another observer assigns rear, is a seldom occurrence. Instead, disagreement occurred when one observer assigned background to a frame while the other observer assigned a specific behavior to that frame. To quantify disagreements, we constructed a confusion matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) composed of every single-frame judgment for every observer–observer pair. Identical observations for every frame (zero confusion) appear as a diagonal line across the matrix (top left to bottom right). Confusing a specific behavior and background appears as a horizontal line on the top edge or a vertical line on the left edge. Confusing a specific behavior for another specific behavior appears as values occurring between the diagonal and edges. The confusion matrix shows the vast majority of values fall on the diagonal, with most of the remaining values on the left edge. The confusion matrix results reveal high scoring specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ethograms reveal diverse fear-conditioned behaviors, including locomotion</title><p>We constructed 200-ms resolution ethograms for paired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and unpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) rats from Experiment 2.

This number of shocks is comparable to overtraining procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maren, 1998</xref>), in which compensatory brain and behavioral responses can be observed following brain manipulations such as neurotoxic lesions of the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zimmerman et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it is possible that extended training produces fear behaviors that are not observed with limited training. Finally, rats were presented with more complex auditory cues than commonly employed pure tones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>) or white noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maren et al., 2001</xref>). Design complexity, extended training, and stimulus complexity may have acted independently or combined to produce behavioral diversity and fear-conditioned locomotion. However, these factors do not account for our present findings. Behavioral diversity and robust fear-conditioned locomotion can be observed in rats receiving limited visual cue/shock pairings.</p><p>Our current and prior studies corroborate findings from other laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>) observing locomotion to a shock-paired cue, but are notable for their simplicity and associative basis. Using a serial compound conditioning procedure (tone → white noise → shock), Le and colleagues found robust flight to white noise presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 2024</xref>). Robust flight was only observed when the serial compound was paired with shock. Totty and colleagues also observed that white noise elicited flight whether it was the first or second compound stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Totty et al., 2021</xref>). Conditioned flight to white noise in a serial compound may be a stimulus-specific instance of flight. Gruene and colleagues first demonstrated darting to a shock-paired auditory cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gruene et al., 2015</xref>). Darting has since been demonstrated in additional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitchell et al., 2024</xref>). Although darting in their rats is comparable to locomotion in our paired rats, the associative nature of darting has yet to be demonstrated via the use of an unpaired control. Observing robust fear-conditioned locomotion in a simple, associative setting provides a strong behavioral basis to uncover neural circuits for this essential but overlooked fear behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borkar et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iglesias et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luxem et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodwin et al., 2024</xref>) and Pavlovian fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chanthongdee et al., 2024</xref>) are moving toward machine scoring of behavior. Unsupervised machine scoring may reveal behaviors not previously observed in response to a fear-conditioned cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chanthongdee et al., 2024</xref>) as it does not rely on assumptions made about which behaviors should be present or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>). Supervised machine scoring, such as convolutional neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), trains a model based on hand-scored human data. A supervised scoring approach is useful when known behaviors – such as freezing and locomotion – are firmly established in a behavioral setting. Scored frames from the current experiments, as well as our prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2024</xref>), are free to download via repository explicitly for these purposes. Machine scoring holds promise to make comprehensive ethograms – like in our studies – more prevalent in the field.</p><p>Comprehensive ethograms are necessary to reveal the neural basis of <italic>Pavlovian fear conditioning</italic>, as opposed to the neural basis of conditioned freezing. This is because Pavlovian fear conditioning is a collection of behaviors and processes rather than a single behavior or process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McDannald, 2023</xref>). If freezing was the totality of Pavlovian fear conditioning, as expressed through overt behavior, we should observe two results. First, freezing should be specific to a shock-paired cue. We observe this. Second, paired versus unpaired fear conditioning status should be predicted equally well by freezing alone vs. freezing + all other behaviors. We do not observe this for freezing or <italic>any</italic> behavior. This means that focusing on any individual behavior will miss information about fear conditioning status. A stronger, bidirectional relationship between fear conditioning status and behavior is observed when all behaviors present are considered.</p><p>Here we show that a shock-paired visual cue elicits diverse behaviors, including locomotion and freezing. Our results solidify and extend a directional relationship from Pavlovian fear conditioning → behavior. We further demonstrate that the strongest, reverse directional relationship (behavior → Pavlovian fear conditioning) is obtained when all behaviors present are considered. Observing diverse behaviors within a single conditioning procedure has stronger parallels to the diverse symptoms that define anxiety disorders. Comprehensive behavioral approaches, as performed here, will be essential in revealing more complete neural bases for Pavlovian fear conditioning, with greater relevance to disordered anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Experiments 1 and 2 each used 32 adult Long Evans rats (16 females), for a total of 64 rats (32 females). Rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories on postnatal day 55. Rats were single-housed on a 12 hr light cycle (lights off at 6:00 pm) and maintained at their initial body weight with standard laboratory chow (18% Protein Rodent Diet #2018, Harlan Teklad Global Diets, Madison, WI). Water was available ad libitum in the home cage. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the NIH guidelines regarding the care and use of rats for experimental procedures. All procedures were approved by the Boston College Animal Care and Use Committee. The Boston College experimental protocol supporting these procedures is 2024-001.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavior apparatus</title><p>The behavior apparatus consisted of eight individual chambers with aluminum front and back walls, clear acrylic sides and top, and a grid floor. LED strips emitting 940 nm light were affixed to the acrylic top to constantly illuminate the behavioral chamber for frame capture. 940 nm illumination was chosen because rats do not detect light wavelengths exceeding 930 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikbakht and Diamond, 2021</xref>). An array of three infrared lights were mounted to the chamber door to track the trial period (baseline, light, and post-light). Each grid floor bar was electrically connected to an aversive shock generator (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). An external food cup, a central port equipped with infrared photocells, and a key light were present on one wall.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Pellet exposure and nose poke shaping</title><p>Identical pellet exposure and nose poke shaping were performed for Experiments 1 and 2. Rats were food-restricted and specifically fed to maintain their body weight throughout behavioral testing. Each rat was given four grams of experimental pellets in their home cage in order to overcome neophobia. Next, the central port was removed from the experimental chamber, and rats received a 30-min session in which one pellet was delivered every minute. The central port was returned to the experimental chamber for the remainder of behavioral testing. Each rat was then shaped to nose poke in the central port for experimental pellet delivery using a fixed ratio schedule in which one nose poke into the port yielded one pellet. Shaping sessions lasted 30 min or until approximately 50 nose pokes were completed. Each rat then received five sessions during which nose pokes into the port were reinforced on a variable interval schedule. Session 1 used a variable interval 30 s schedule (poking into the port was reinforced every 30 s on average). All remaining sessions used a variable interval 60 s schedule. For the remainder of behavioral testing, nose pokes were reinforced on a variable interval 60 s schedule independent of light illumination and shock presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Light pre-exposure</title><p>Identical light pre-exposure was performed for Experiments 1 and 2. Each rat was pre-exposed to the 10-s light, four times during two, 43 min sessions (Monday and Tuesday). The two pre-exposure sessions meant that each rat received eight total, light pre-exposures. Although light intensity was greatest at the source, light illumination generally illuminated the experimental chamber, which was completely dark to the rat at all other times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Light illumination and shock presentation</title><p>Following pre-exposure, the 32 rats in each experiment were evenly divided into two groups: paired (16 rats, 8 females) and unpaired (16 rats, 8 females). Each paired and unpaired rat received four light and four shock presentations during two, 43 min sessions (Wednesday and Thursday). The two sessions meant that each rat received eight total light and shock presentations. For rats in the paired group, the light was presented for 10 s. Light offset precisely coincided with foot shock presentation (0.5 s). For rats in the unpaired group, light (10 s) and shock (0.5 s) were presented at distant times. The inter-event interval (in which both light and shock are considered events) was greater than 5 min. The order of unpaired light and shock presentation was randomly determined and differed for each rat, each session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Foot shock intensity</title><p>For both experiments, two levels of foot shock intensity were used. For Experiment 1, half of the rats received a 0.25 mA foot shock and half a 0.15 mA foot shock. The total experimental design yielded four groups: paired 0.25 (eight rats, four females), paired 0.15 (eight rats, four females), unpaired 0.25 (eight rats, four females), and unpaired 0.15 (eight rats, four females). For Experiment 2, half of the rats received a 0.50 mA foot shock and half a 0.35 mA foot shock. The total experimental design yielded four groups: paired 0.50 (eight rats, four females), paired 0.35 (eight rats, four females), unpaired 0.50 (eight rats, four females), and unpaired 0.35 (eight rats, four females).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Extinction test</title><p>Identical extinction tests were performed for Experiments 1 and 2. The single extinction session (Friday) was similar to the pre-exposure session. Each rat received four, 10-s light illuminations in a 43 min session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calculating suppression ratio</title><p>Time stamps for cue light illumination, shock presentation, and nose pokes (photobeam break) were automatically recorded using the Med Associates program. The baseline nose poke rate was calculated for each trial by counting the number of pokes during the 20-s pre-light period and multiplying by 3. The light nose poke rate was calculated for each trial by counting the number of pokes during the 10-s light period and multiplying by 6. Nose poke suppression was calculated as a ratio: (baseline poke rate – light poke rate)/(baseline poke rate + light poke rate). A suppression ratio of ‘1’ indicated complete suppression of nose poking during cue light illumination relative to baseline. A suppression ratio of ‘0’ indicates equivalent nose poke rates during baseline and light presentation. Gradations in suppression ratio between 1 and 0 indicated intermediate levels of nose poke suppression during cue light illumination relative to baseline. Negative suppression ratios indicated increased nose poke rates during cue light illumination relative to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Frame capture system</title><p>Behavior frames were captured using Imaging Source monochrome cameras (DMK 37BUX28; USB 3.1, 1/2.9″ Sony Pregius IMX287, global shutter, resolution 720 × 540, trigger in, digital out, C/CS-mount). Frame capture was triggered using the Med Associates behavior program. The 28 V Med Associates pulse was converted to a 5 V TTL pulse via Adapter (SG-231, Med Associates). The TTL adapter was wired to the camera’s trigger input. Captured frames were saved to a PC (OptiPlex 7470 All-in-One) running IC Capture software (Imaging Source). Frame capture began precisely 5 s before light onset, continued throughout 10-s cue light illumination, and ended 2.5 s following light offset. For paired rats, this meant that the frames were captured during the 0.5 s shock and the 2 s following. For unpaired rats, the empty 2.5 s period was captured. Frames were captured at a rate of 5 per second, with a target of capturing 87 frames per trial, and 348 frames per session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Anonymizing trial information</title><p>A total of 256 trials were scored from the 32 rats in Experiment 2. Trials came from the second session of light/shock presentations (Thursday) and the extinction test (Friday). We anonymized trial information in order to score behavior without bias. The numerical information from each trial (rat #, session #, and trial #) was encrypted as a unique number sequence. A unique word was prepended to the sequence. The result was that each trial was converted into a unique word + number sequence. For example, trial dw01_01_03 (rat #1, session #1, and trial #3) would be encrypted as abundant28515581. The trials were randomly assigned to six observers. The result of trial anonymization was that observers were completely blind to the subject, group, and session. Further, random assignment meant that different observers scored the four trials composing a single session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Post-acquisition frame processing</title><p>A MATLAB script sorted the 348 frames from the four session trials into four folders, one for each trial, each containing 87 frames.

Frames were first watched in real time in Microsoft PowerPoint by setting the slide duration and transition to 0.19 s, then playing as a slideshow. Behaviors clearly observed were noted. Next, the observer went through all the frames, scoring one behavior at a time. A standard scoring sequence was used: groom, port, cup, light rear, rear, light scale, scale, jump, freeze, locomote, backpedal, stretch. When the specific behavior was observed in a frame, that frame was labeled. Once all behaviors had been scored, the video was rewatched for freezing. In our procedure, cup is defined based on the rat’s location and freezing is defined based on the rat’s behavior. If the two co-occurred, the cup superseded freezing because it was prevalent during the baseline behavior. However, the co-occurrence of cup and freezing was low. The unlabeled frames were then labeled ‘background’. Finally, all the background frames were checked to ensure they did not contain a defined behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>MANOVA and univariate ANOVA were performed for suppression ratios and specific behaviors. Sex was used as a factor for all analyses. Group, session, intensity, and time were used as factors when relevant.

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a linear classification method that projects the ethogram features into a space that maximizes the separation between groups. Each LDA model used the entire dataset without any initial data splitting. To evaluate the performance of the LDA model, tenfold cross-validation was applied using MATLAB’s crossval function. Cross-validation divides the dataset into 10 equal parts (folds). For each iteration, the model was trained on nine folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process was repeated 10 times so that each fold served as a test set once. The accuracy of the model (defined as 1 minus the loss) was assessed by computing the classification error for each fold, and the overall performance was averaged across all folds. The crossval function was used in conjunction with kfoldLoss, which returns the average classification error across the folds. The performance of the LDA model was quantified using the average classification accuracy across the 10 folds. This approach provided a robust estimate of the model’s generalization capability to unseen data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting. 100 LDA models were made for each analysis. Prediction accuracies from each model were saved and used to calculate mean ± SEM prediction accuracies across the 100 models for each analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal care was in accordance with NIH and Boston College guidelines.

Re the method – The authors created four categories of 12 &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; behaviours. The categories included immobility and reward. The implication is that rats cannot have been immobile while in the food cup where the reward was delivered. However, it is not clear at all why this should be true (i.e., rats can and will freeze with their head inside a food cup). Please clarify how these behaviours were recorded in relation to each other.</p><p>3. Re inter-rater reliability, was there a particular behaviour or category of behaviours that had a lower/higher inter-rater reliability than the others?</p><p>4. Re sex differences: given that the rats were hungry, was body weight included as a covariate that might account for the apparent sex differences?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Two experiments are reported but only one is described in detail. The design of each experiment was simple but powerful: one group of rats received pairings of a visual stimulus and foot shock while the other group received unpaired presentation of the stimulus and shock. The other factor was shock intensity (two values in each experiment; very low in experiment 1 and moderate in experiment 2). The aim of the work was to compile a list of the behaviors elicited by the visual stimulus across its paired or unpaired presentations with shock. The compilation of these behaviors required an impressive amount of work and their analyses were equally impressive. The conclusion appeared to be that incorporating all of the behaviors discriminated better than freezing (a common index of threat conditioning) between the paired and unpaired groups. That said, the work yielded little else of theoretical significance.</p><p>The work could be improved by providing a description of the behaviors elicited by the weak shocks in experiment 1. That experiment failed to produce conditioned suppression or freezing but did the weak shocks elicit any of the other behaviors observed in experiment 2? I would have also liked to see a description of the behaviors in the first conditioning session of experiment 2 to see how these related to those observed in the well-documented 2nd session. In view of the effort required to provide such a complete assay of threat related behaviors and the fact that they provide marginally more information than freezing, it is unlikely that such an assay will replace freezing in the search for the brain mechanisms underlying threat conditioning, I appreciate that the assay was restricted to the protocols commonly used to produce threat conditioning as assessed by freezing. However, changing the environmental space to allow the rats to move into another chamber when the visual stimulus appeared in the conditioning chamber could be informative with respect to the general idea that defensive behaviors are organized in part by the environmental affordances. Finally, extinction consisted of a single session, not sufficient to produce a significant loss of freezing, etc. Additional sessions would have been useful to provide an indication of the extent to which the conditioned responses converge with those exhibited by the control groups.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript, the authors compile detailed ethograms for male and female rats undergoing conditioned suppression of reward seeking. They use 4 different shock levels, and they analyze 12 different behaviors. Only the 2 highest shock levels induced conditioned suppression and these shock levels suppress many appetitive behaviors during the CS. They then use linear discriminant analyses to classify rats as paired or unpaired.</p><p>This study is interesting in that it delves into the richness of behavior evident in a simple conditioning task. The results also help explain why conditioned suppression is present in the absence of conditioned freezing behavior. I have a few suggestions that I hope will help strengthen the conclusions and increase the impact of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors examine behavioral responses to a visual cue linked to foot shocks within a conditioned suppression paradigm. They demonstrate that conditioned suppression to the visual cue occurs at shock intensities of 0.35 and 0.5, but not at lower levels. An ethogram analysis further shows specific behavioral patterns in response to the visual cue paired with the foot shocks.</p><p>Strength of the manuscript:</p><p>The authors conducted a comprehensive ethological analysis of behavioral responses to fear-associated cues. Although human annotations may be prone to biases, the authors accounted for this by assessing inter-rater reliability and minimizing rater confusion.</p><p>Weaknesses of the manuscript:</p><p>This study lacks novelty, as previous research has already shown that a cue paired with footshocks induces freezing and defensive behaviors. It is also unclear what advantage a light cue would offer over a sound cue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102782.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers identified a number of points that, when addressed, will increase the overall significance of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewers time and effort.

The work could be improved by providing a description of the behaviors elicited by the weak shocks in experiment 1. That experiment failed to produce conditioned suppression or freezing but did the weak shocks elicit any of the other behaviors observed in experiment 2?</p></disp-quote><p>We initially set out to do exactly this. Holland 1979 showed that freezing linearly scaled with the foot shock intensity and that at low intensities other behaviors emerged because freezing was minimal. Here we did not detect the linear relationship that Holland did. Instead, there was a very clear division between the low foot shock intensities (0.15 mA and 0.25 mA) and high foot shock intensities (0.35 mA and 0.50 mA). This is very likely a product of using a conditioned suppression procedure. The subjects have a reason to be doing something other than expressing defensive behaviors. Namely, working for food. While we think of conditioned suppression as competition in which shock-paired cues influence (and suppress) reward responding, it is likely that the reverse can occur. Indeed, it seems that at low foot shock intensities, the motivation to work for food can eliminate the ability of the shock-paired cue to influence reward seeking.</p><p>Your concern also gets at a strength/weakness of conditioned suppression. Conditioned suppression is very good at revealing the summed behavioral properties of shock-paired cues to suppress reward seeking. This is because conditioned suppression is agnostic to which behavior is producing suppression. This makes conditioned suppression an excellent barometer of total behavior when conditioned suppression is observed. But then careful ethograms are needed to reveal exactly how suppression is being achieved. On the flip side, a null conditioned suppression result is very meaningful. If a shock-paired cue is unable to suppress reward behavior, it is very difficult for that cue to also elicit specific defensive behaviors. This is because, by definition of not observing conditioned suppression, any amount of defensive behavior would have to be offset by increased reward behaviors.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have performed more granular analyses of the conditioned suppression data from Experiments 1 and 2 [Lines 90-127]. These analyses conclusively demonstrate that low shock intensity, paired and unpaired rats do not differ at any point in behavioral testing. Instead, both the 0.25 mA and 0.15 mA rats show a steady decrease in conditioned suppression over the 5 session (20 trials). High shock intensity, paired and unpaired rats show clear and robust divergence during conditioning and in extinction. Because we set out to determine the behaviors elicited by a shock-paired cue that was associative in nature, we chose to construct comprehensive ethograms for only Experiment 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I would have also liked to see a description of the behaviors in the first conditioning session of experiment 2 to see how these related to those observed in the well-documented 2nd session.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we do not have behavior frames for those sessions. We agree those data would have been nice to see. However, we do not think that having those data would change the main conclusions of our study. We wanted to identify behaviors that were specific to Paired rats and were the result of conditioning. Doing this means focusing on the trials during which differential responding is observed (via suppression ratio). With the exception of conditioning trial 4 for the rats receiving the 0.50 mA foot shock, the second conditioning session and the extinction session capture all of the relevant trials. In the revised manuscript, we show trial by trial responding for suppression ratio [Figure 1D] to more clearly show why we focused scoring on the last fear conditioning session and extinction session.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Extinction consisted in a single session, not sufficient to produce a significant loss of freezing, etc. Additional sessions would have been useful to provide an indication of the extent to which the conditioned responses converge with those exhibited by the control groups.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another good point. Extinction testing is traditionally performed for one of two reasons: 1) To reveal what was learned (or what behaviors were acquired) through prior pairings of cues and outcomes or 2) To assess the loss of that responding. For the first approach, very few extinction trials are given. In fact, the very first extinction trial is the most critical for this approach. This is because the first trial is not influenced by shock omission. Whereas every trial after the first is going to reflect both what was learned in the prior sessions and shock omission in extinction. For the second approach, many trials and even sessions are needed. This is necessary to completely reduce cue-elicited responding to pre-learning levels.</p><p>In our experiments, we used the first approach. But to do this well, we should have not only shown trial-by-trial responding, but should have specifically shown the behaviors elicited by the cue light on trial 1. The revised manuscript corrects this oversight by analyzing and visualizing behavior for each trial. Critically, we now perform extensive analyses on only the first trial [Lines 231-249]. These analyses do not merely reinforce but extend our findings. Trial by trial analyses show that post-shock locomotion is prominent on trial 1 and is sensitive to shock intensity. So although both 0.50 mA and 0.35 mA paired rats increase locomotion, this increase is significantly greater in 0.50 mA rats [Figure 4I]. Transient locomotion periods accounted for &gt;60% of all behavior. These results – and additional trial by trial supplemental figures – have been added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1.

When mean cue suppression ratio is plotted, females and males in the 0.15 mA Paired conditioned are clustering separately. And in fact, an independent samples t-test confirms that Paired female and male suppression ratios differ for the 0.15 mA condition (t = 13.02, p = 1.26 x 10<sup>-5</sup>).

However, a more complete comparison of the sex x group pattern suggests the opposite.</p></list-item></list><p>Female Paired rats (m = 0.37) showed higher mean suppression ratios than female Unpaired rats (m = 0.038). A power analysis found that n=16 rats per group would be required to detect a significant difference. Male Paired rats (m = 0.019) showed <italic>lower</italic> mean suppression ratios than male Unpaired rats (m = 0.361). A power analysis found that n=9 rats per group would be required to detect a significant difference. The problem is twofold. The male Paired vs. Unpaired difference is in the wrong direction. Male Unpaired suppression ratios are comparable to female Paired suppression ratios, and male Paired suppression ratios are comparable to female Unpaired suppression ratios. There is no theoretical or practical basis to think that low foot shock probabilities invert Pavlovian fear conditioning in a sex-specific manner. A more parsimonious explanation is that we happened to sample some high Paired females and low Paired males. Additional samples are unlikely to replicate this pattern. Indeed, a power analysis for Paired vs. Unpaired rats (with sexes collapsed) found that 13,404 rats would be necessary to detect a significant Paired vs. Unpaired sex difference. These analyses strongly suggest that the observed sex difference in the 0.15 mA Paired condition is spurious.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Finally, the low variability observed in the mean suppression ratio data is not supported when trial by trial suppression ratios are plotted [Figure 1C/D]. We have to admit this was a weakness of the initial submission. Given the small number of trials each rat received, it is most appropriate to plot the trial-by-trial data. We have now done that in the revised manuscript. These plots make it clear that at no point during training or test did Paired rats in either the 0.15 or 0.25 mA condition meaningfully diverge from the Unpaired rats [Figure 1C]. In contrast, the Paired vs. Unpaired divergence is clear in both the 0.35 mA and 0.50 mA conditions [Figure 1D].</p></list-item></list><p>For these three reasons, we are confident that adding fewer than 13,404 subjects to the 0.15 and 0.25 mA conditions would not alter any of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It could be more informative to show early versus late bins for extinction learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now made figures showing trial by trial ethograms [Figure 4 – Supplemental Figure 1]. We are using extinction to reveal behaviors acquired during the prior conditioning sessions. In this case, the first extinction trial is most critical as it is not influenced by shock omission, which could alter responding on subsequent trials. We now show freezing and locomote data for Trial 1 [Figure 4G-J]. These results show that fear conditioned locomotion is even greater during trial 1, particularly for rats receiving 0.50 mA foot shock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 3A, it appears that either Port or Cup behavior is increased at the time of shock. Is this correct? If so, why?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3A, port (dark purple) is very, very low prior to, during, and following foot shock. Cup (light purple) is also very low around shock although somewhat higher than port. Both port and cup show higher levels during baseline than any period around shock presentation.</p><p>We think you might mean Figure 4A? There, port levels towards the end of cue illumination appear closer to baseline levels. In case this is what you meant; we did a deeper statistical dive on port. We performed ANOVA with trial, group, sex, and intensity as factors. We observed a significant trial x time x group interaction (F<sub>258,6192</sub> = 1.41, <italic>p</italic> = 2.95 x 10<sup>-5</sup>). We show the SPSS graphical outputs (sorry for the color and formatting). But what you can see is that port behavior remained low through cue illumination for trials 1 and 2, but increased towards cue illumination offset on trials 3 and 4. This pattern did not manifest in Unpaired rats. This pattern is consistent with a change in behavior via extinction, showing that reward behavior first returns near cue offset.</p><p>While we think this effect is interesting, we do not include it in the manuscript because it is statistically problematic to follow up on all behaviors measured with univariate ANOVA looking for significant interactions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102782-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Some of the claims in the Introduction (e.g., that a visual CS is known to produce little conditioned freezing) are supported by older references and ignore many recent findings. Please update the references for this section of the Introduction and revise any statements accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is fair. While auditory cues are more common, visual cues are used in fear conditioning. However, it is still quite rare for visual cues to be used in a conditioned suppression setting. This matters, as freezing is readily obtained to visual and auditory cues in non-conditioned suppression settings. We cite numerous recent findings and clarify the distinction in the introduction [Lines 49-50].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Re the method – The authors created four categories of 12 &quot;mutually exclusive&quot; behaviours. The categories included immobility and reward. The implication is that rats cannot have been immobile while in the food cup where the reward was delivered. However, it is not clear at all why this should be true (i.e., rats can and will freeze with their head inside a food cup). Please clarify how these behaviours were recorded in relation to each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that describing the behaviors as mutually exclusive was inaccurate. Our definitions are mutually exclusive because we made them that way. “Cup” is more about the rat’s location and freezing is more about what it is doing. In our scoring procedure cup supersedes freezing because cup behavior is so prevalent during baseline periods. In this data set, freezing with the nose directly above the food cup was uncommon, as freezing in general was present but minimal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Re inter-rater reliability, was there a particular behaviour or category of behaviours that had a lower/higher inter-rater reliability than the others?</p></disp-quote><p>This is difficult to determine because there is a wide range in the prevalence of each behavior. For example, in our comparison data set freezing was only observed 5 times, while locomote was detected 69 times and port 100. If you look in Figure 2C, freezing and background are confused more often than freezing and freezing are identically observed. (the freeze x background square is darker than the freeze x freeze square). But all this really means is that there was 4 freeze x backgrounds and 1 freeze x freezes. This speaks to the rarity of freezing more than the reliability of the category. Stretch shows a similar pattern to freezing.</p><p>We would say that generally, behaviors based strictly on location (port, cup, jump, rear) show the least confusion. Behaviors that can take place anywhere and play out over frames (stretch, freeze, and locomote) show greater confusion. Much of the confusion is around the start and the stop of the behaviors. This is true for both people and CNNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Re sex differences: given that the rats were hungry, was body weight included as a covariate that might account for the apparent sex differences?</p></disp-quote><p>For Experiment 2, the significant group x sex x session interaction persisted when performing ANCOVA with mean body weight over the 5-day week of behavioral testing was used as a covariate (F<sub>4,92</sub> = 3.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012).
