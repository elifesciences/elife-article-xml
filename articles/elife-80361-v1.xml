of vision in amblyopic subjects whose occlusion is removed in adulthood. Dark exposure initiates homeostatic mechanisms that together with light-induced changes in cellular signaling pathways result in the re-engagement of juvenile-like plasticity in the adult such that previously deprived inputs can gain cortical territory. It is possible that dark exposure itself degrades visual responses, and this could place constraints on the optimal duration of dark exposure treatment. To determine whether eight days of dark exposure has a lasting negative impact on responses to classic grating stimuli, neural activity was recorded before and after dark exposure in awake head-fixed mice using two-photon calcium imaging. Neural discriminability, assessed using classifiers, was transiently reduced following dark exposure; a decrease in response reliability across a broad range of spatial frequencies likely contributed to the disruption. Both discriminability and reliability recovered. Fixed classifiers were used to demonstrate that stimulus representation rebounded to the original, pre-deprivation state, thus dark exposure did not appear to have a lasting negative impact on visual processing. Unexpectedly, we found that dark exposure significantly stabilized orientation preference and signal correlation. Our results reveal that natural vision exerts a disrupting influence on the stability of stimulus preference for classic grating stimuli and, at the same time, improves neural discriminability for both low and high-spatial frequency stimuli.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dark exposure</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>decoding</kwd><kwd>sensory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health NEI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY024678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhlman</surname><given-names>Sandra J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Curci Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhlman</surname><given-names>Sandra J</given-names></name><name><surname>Chase</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stimulus representation in primary visual cortex rebounds to its original state following therapeutic sensory deprivation in adults.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory cortex is highly malleable early in life. During postnatal development, cortical territory rapidly expands and contracts to represent active and inactive inputs, respectively. These large-scale changes are mediated by age-restricted experience-dependent synaptic refinement at the level of individual postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998</xref>). Primary visual cortex (V1) is particularly sensitive to visual deprivation during this period. Classic experiments demonstrate that in order for sensory pathways to drive cortical responses in the adult, continuous binocular input is required during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hensch and Quinlan, 2018</xref>). Experimentally induced monocular deprivation in young animals results in a rapid decrease in the strength of deprived inputs, and with a delay, the response of intact inputs is potentiated. Depression of deprived inputs occurs at a synaptic level and outlasts the perturbation. On the other hand, the same peripheral perturbation in adults does not induce a rapid decrease in response strength, although potentiation of the intact input does proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jenks et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in the young, the impact of deprivation on excitatory neuron activity levels is compensated for by a decrease in evoked inhibitory neuron activity. This form of compensation is a direct consequence of deprivation and does not occur in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feese et al., 2018</xref>). Delineating the molecular basis and cellular signaling pathways responsible for restricting plasticity in the adult is an active area of investigation. For example, consistent with the above observations, extracellular matrix perineuronal nets (PNNs), which preferentially surround parvalbumin inhibitory neurons and create a barrier for synaptic remodeling, are resistant to degradation in the adult. Interventions that target the break-down of PNNs in adult V1 are effective in restoring juvenile-like plasticity and allow previously unused inputs to regain the ability to drive cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murase et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pizzorusso et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pizzorusso et al., 2002</xref>). Taken together, there is a general consensus that in the adult, the inputs that are established during postnatal development retain a limited amount of plasticity throughout life. However, in contrast to the young, established inputs are not lost following disuse, and in the absence of additional training or treatment, new input patterns from previously occluded sources are not readily integrated into the existing networks of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hensch and Quinlan, 2018</xref>). As such, restoring vision to subjects that have matured without binocular input during early postnatal development is a recognized challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hensch and Quinlan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falcone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodríguez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To successfully restore vision, the newly opened inputs must compete with non-deprived eye inputs to drive cortical responses. An emerging treatment for animals with experimentally induced amblyopia, across a diverse range of species, is to transiently expose subjects to darkness, followed by light reintroduction (LRx; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eaton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Montey and Quinlan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erchova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stodieck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>). Accumulating evidence indicates that dark exposure (DE) followed by LRx re-activates juvenile plasticity and is sufficient to restore deprived-eye input responses to grating stimuli. Notably, LRx effectively degrades PNNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murase et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, this critical form of juvenile plasticity is reactivated and likely contributes to the effectiveness of DE in restoring responsiveness of the deprived pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murase et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Ideally, treatments such as DE followed by LRx would not have a negative impact on on-going visual processing carried out by the intact pathway. In other words, effective treatments would facilitate the integration of new information without perturbing existing functionality. Based on the studies cited above, it is not expected that in the adult basic responsiveness to visual stimuli following transient DE would be lost. However, previous work demonstrated that closing one eye is sufficient to transiently disrupt stimulus representation in the adult. Although individual neurons remain responsive, the pattern of activity evoked in V1 is disturbed, including orientation preference and pairwise signal correlation among simultaneously recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, although mean firing rates are largely similar across daily light-dark transitions, pairwise correlations are significantly stronger during vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torrado Pacheco et al., 2019</xref>). This raises the possibility that deprivation such as DE could increase the rate of representational drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deitch et al., 2021</xref>), placing a burden on downstream areas to update the manner in which information is readout. Indeed, in the olfactory cortex, continuous experience is required for drift to remain low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, higher-order relationships among neurons, beyond the basic responsiveness of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rupasinghe et al., 2021</xref>), could be altered by the interruption of continuous visual input.</p><p>To determine whether transient DE disrupts or otherwise influences stimulus representation beyond basic responsiveness, neural responses to grating stimuli that covered a broad range of spatial frequencies were recorded using two-photon calcium imaging in awake head-fixed mice before and after transient DE. Calcium imaging has the advantage that individual neurons can be readily longitudinally tracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Margolis et al., 2012</xref>). Tuning stability and response reliability were assessed before and after DE. In addition, neural discriminability and the rate of representational drift were quantified using classifiers. We found that in contrast to monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2016</xref>), DE did not degrade pairwise signal correlation when immediately assessed after DE and in fact stabilized orientation preference in neurons that remained tuned. Similarly, LRx did not degrade pairwise signal correlation of tuned neurons. These data indicate that changes in signal correlation induced by monocular deprivation in adulthood are likely a result of imbalanced input rather than reduced drive from the periphery.</p><p>However, similar to olfactory cortex, an increase in the rate of representation drift was detected when visual input was interrupted by DE. A decrease in the trial-to-trial reliability of stimulus responsiveness accounted for the transient change. Reliability was restored within 8 days of LRx, and the representation rebounded to its original form. Thus when used for the treatment of amblyopia, neither DE nor LRx is expected to have a persistent negative impact on existing visual processing, although the effectiveness of perceptual training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGuire et al., 2022</xref>) immediately following DE may be influenced by a transient increase in representational drift. Furthermore, our results establish that although natural vision, which includes complex scene statistics, has a disrupting influence on tuning stability to simple grating stimuli, natural vision as experienced in the home-cage environment improves neural discriminability in the adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To assess the impact of 8 days of DE on tuning stability and neural discriminability, the activity of individual layer 2/3 excitatory V1 neurons in the binocular zone was imaged in response to randomized presentations of static grating stimuli using two-photon microscopy in head-fixed transgenic mice positioned atop a floating spherical treadmill, expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f driven by the EMX1 promoter. Our goal was to assess the stability of stimulus representation before and after DE. Therefore prior to DE, two baseline imaging sessions acquired 8±1 days apart, referred to here as Baseline 1 (B1) and Baseline 2 (B2) were recorded. The acquisition of two baseline sessions allowed the stability of tuning to grating stimuli of varying orientation and spatial frequency (s.f.) to be assessed before DE was initiated. A third imaging session was recorded immediately after DE and is referred to as the post-DE (pDE) session. A final forth imaging session was acquired after 8±1 days of LRx, referred to as the recovery (Rec) session. These four sessions were used to define three experimental conditions: control, DE, and LRx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To facilitate interpretation of stability, the elapsed time in-between imaging sessions was held constant. A total of six mice was included in the study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for sex and age information). The fraction of visually responsive neurons, defined as those neurons whose activity was significantly modulated by stimulus feature (ANOVA, <italic>α</italic>=0.05; see Methods), is reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> for the six mice in each of the imaging sessions. As expected, 30–50% of the segmented neurons were responsive to full-field static gratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montijn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>).

Orientation preference was significantly less stable in the baseline condition (Wilcoxon rank-sum test [<italic>z: 2.0748</italic>], p=0.038; n=266 and n=205 neurons for baseline and DE conditions, respectively).

The mean and SD of the R square values are plotted; the values are largely overlapping. p Values are calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (<italic>z: 1.54, –5.83</italic>) and are not corrected for multiple comparisons.

This method takes into account trial-to-trial variability and ensures that the stimulus identities that elicit activity are more consistent across trials than expected by chance. The stimulus set consisted of 12 orientations and 15 spatial frequencies spanning a range of 0.02–0.30 cycles/°, resulting in a total of 180 stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Four parameters were computed from the two-dimensional fits: orientation preference and bandwidth, as well as s.f. preference and bandwidth. Stability of each of the four parameters was calculated by comparing the absolute change (Δ) during the control and DE experimental conditions. We took a conservative approach and only considered neurons that were tracked and tuned (i.e. well-fit by the two-dimensional Gaussian function, see Methods for details) on both of the imaging sessions used to calculate the change. DE induced a significant shift in the stability of orientation preference (Wilcoxon rank-sum p=0.032, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Analysis at the level of individual animals revealed that five out of the six mice reflected the pooled population of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The age at the time of the first imaging session ranged from p45 to p86. Notably, the atypical animal was the youngest, p45. Prior work establishes that some rejuvenating influences of DE do not occur until on or after p55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2010</xref>), therefore age might be a contributing factor as to why this animal was distinct.</p><p>The detected difference in orientation stability did not appear to be a result of a systematic difference in the quality of the two-dimensional Gaussian fits across the conditions, for the following reasons. First, goodness of fit values, calculated on a trial-by-trial basis for each neuron included in the analysis (see Methods), was not different within or across the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; see also the associated file of all tuning curves for neurons scored as being significantly tuned). Second, further analysis in which the top 10% of the worst-fit neurons was removed also revealed an increase in orientation tuning stability in the DE condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We did however note that there was an association between orientation stability and the goodness of fit values. This relationship could have a biological basis. For example, higher trial-to-trial variability could be predictive of a neuron being more likely to shift its orientation preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The other three parameters trended in the same direction as orientation preference, but the difference between conditions did not reach statistical significance. Given the trend across the four parameters, it is possible that if all four parameters were considered simultaneously, a clear difference would emerge. To address this possibility, we examined pairwise signal correlation among the neurons that were responsive and tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The similarity of signal correlation in the control condition and in the DE condition was computed for each of the six animals. We found that the similarity was significantly higher in the DE condition (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0.009; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). As above, additional analysis was performed to assess whether the results were robust to issues related to the quality of the tuning fits. Signal correlation and the similarity of signal correlation matrices were computed using all responsive neurons, regardless of whether tuned or untuned. Similarity was also significantly higher in the DE condition when tuning was not part of the inclusion criteria (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p=0. 015; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, in contrast to monocular deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2016</xref>), a lack of vision through both eyes did not perturb tuning and in fact resulted in a net stabilization.</p><p>In contrast to orientation tuning, deprivation-induced changes in s.f. were not readily detected. These results are consistent with prior work indicating that the stability of s.f. preference and orientation preference are independently regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeon et al., 2018</xref>). It would be of interest in future work to examine whether at the level of receptive field sub-structure, the axis of receptive field orientation is preferentially destabilized relative to the size of on-off sub-regions. Alternatively, larger sample sizes could reveal subtle changes in s.f.; this would be an indication that instability of s.f. contributes to the observed change in signal correlation.</p><p>The above analysis considered the two pools of neurons separately, those tracked and tuned on the B1 and B2 sessions, and those tracked and tuned on the B2 and pDE sessions. Therefore, it is possible that individual neurons themselves were not stabilized by DE, rather, initially unstable neurons became either unresponsive or untuned on the pDE session. To directly determine whether individual neurons became stabilized, we examined that the pool of neurons that were tracked and tuned across all three sessions, B1, B2, and pDE. The average shift in orientation preference across animals was significantly lower in DE compared to the control condition (paired t-test, p=0.029; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The majority of neurons (58%) was more unstable in the control condition, and the fraction of neurons displaying large shifts (e.g. &gt;50°) was larger in the control condition compared to the DE condition. Consistent with this qualitative description, when pooled across animals, the magnitude of the shift in orientation preference was significantly larger in the control condition compared to the DE condition (paired t-test, p=0.006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether LRx, which is known to potently induce gene expression even in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mardinly et al., 2016</xref>), disturbed tuning stability of the four tuning parameters or pairwise signal correlation. The distribution of the change in orientation preference and bandwidth for the DE condition was indistinguishable from that of the LRx condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This was also the case for the other two tuning parameters (median Δ s.f. preference, DE: 5.3E-3 and LRx: 4.9E-3, Wilcoxon rank-sum corrected for four multiple comparisons, p=0.999; median Δ s.f. bandwidth, DE: 5.5E-3 and LRx: 5.2E-3, Wilcoxon rank-sum corrected for four multiple comparisons, p=0.999). Consistent with these results, no difference in the similarity of signal correlation was detected between the DE and LRx conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that 8 days of DE stabilized tuning response curves to grating stimuli and LRx did not induce a shift in tuning stability when considering those neurons that remained tuned after DE.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Light reintroduction (LRx) did not disrupt tuning in V1 neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neither the change in orientation preference or bandwidth was different between dark exposure (DE) and LRx conditions (Wilcoxon rank-sum test corrected for two multiple comparisons [z:–0.3098 and 0.2599, power<sub>e</sub>: 0.110 and 0.100], p=0.795 and p=0.999, respectively; n=230 and n=216, respectively).

Either scenario would be consistent with the observations reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. To determine whether these factors contributed to the decrease in decoding accuracy, first the trial-to-trial response reliability of tuned neurons was compared between the B2 and pDE sessions. Within the tracked pool, a decrease in response reliability for the preferred stimulus was observed. The median reliability of tuned and tracked neurons for individual mice was significantly lower in the pDE session compared to the B2 session (paired-t test, p=6.0E-3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Analysis of within-neuron comparisons corroborated this interpretation and in addition demonstrated that in control conditions, reliability on the initial imaging sessions was predictive of reliability on the subsequent session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Furthermore, low reliability was associated with loss of tuning on the subsequent session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, when the reliability of all tuned neurons, regardless of whether tracked, was pooled across mice, the reliability was significantly lower in the pDE session (Wilcoxon rank-sum p=3E-6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). It was previously reported that basal firing rates transiently increase when animals are transitioned from prolonged DE to light; such an increase could impact our calculation of reliability. Consistent with the observation that the increase in basal firing rate was prominent within the first 10 min of the dark-to-light transition and returned to baseline within 30–60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torrado Pacheco et al., 2019</xref>), we did not detect a difference in basal activity between the B2 and pDE imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Second, the tracked pool neurons depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D and F</xref> were scored as being tuned or not tuned across the three sessions. On average across the six mice, there was an 11 ± 4% ( ± SEM) decrease in the fraction of tuned neurons from B2 to pDE. Of the 11% that were lost, approximately 6% were re-gained. We noted that approximately 5% of previously untuned neurons became tuned de novo during the LRx condition, as such the total number of tuned neurons was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that both a decrease in reliability and loss of tuning contributed to lower decoding accuracy in the pDE session.</p><p>A potential concern in interpreting these data would be if the pupil was more constricted in the pDE session relative the other sessions. If the pupil diameter was smaller in the pDE session, less light may reach the retina and lead to lower input drive. To determine if this was a factor, we examined pupil radius in relation to the imaging sessions. Rather than a decrease, we detected an increase in pupil radius in the pDE session (median radius in millimeters, B1, B2, pDE, and Rec sessions, respectively [ ± SEM]: 0.29±0.01, 0.28±0.02, 0.41±0.03, and 0.29±0.03). However, pupil diameter did not correlate with decoding accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), therefore we can rule out the possibility that a lower amount of light reaching the retina accounts for the transient increase in representational drift. We noted that on average the mice ran a little more throughout the pDE session (fraction of session spent in locomotion, B1, B2, pDE, and Rec sessions, respectively [ ± SEM]: 0.18±0.05, 0.10±0.05, 0.27±0.06, and 0.07±0.03). Given that pupil diameter is positively correlated with locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), it is likely that locomotion drove the increase in pupil diameter.</p><p>In our final analysis, to assess the rate of representational drift, fixed classifiers were employed, in which a single session was used to train the classifier. That same session (X<sub>1</sub>), as well as a second session (X<sub>2</sub>), was used for testing the accuracy of stimulus identify classification. The rate of drift was defined as the difference in accuracy between X<sub>2</sub> and X<sub>1</sub>. The rate of drift was significantly higher during DE (sessions pDE and B2) compared to the control condition (sessions B2 and B1; paired t-test, p=9E-3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results are an indication that similar to the olfactory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>), continuous sensory experience reduces representational drift.</p><p>Notably, there was not a difference in the change in decoding accuracy across the control condition and between the Rec and the B2 sessions, even though the time span covered was 16 days (DE +LRx) rather than 8 days. These results demonstrate that the stimulus representation not only recovered after transient DE but that the representation rebounded to its original state. To confirm this interpretation, fixed classifiers were trained using the neural activity from the Rec session, and the difference in accuracy between the pDE (the ‘second’ test session in this case) and Rec sessions was computed. As expected, the rate of drift was higher than in the control condition (paired t-test, p=0.012; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found that in the adult, stimulus encoding is robust to transient deprivation and is capable of recovering not only in terms of the estimated amount of stimulus information contained in V1 but also that the stimulus representation rebounds to its original form. LRx, despite initiating a cascade of changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Torrado Pacheco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mardinly et al., 2016</xref>), did not persistently disturb stimulus encoding. Thus, using DE as a treatment for amblyopia is not expected to have a negative impact on previously established visual function. Furthermore, our results establish that exposure to naturalistic statistics in the home-cage environment improves neural discriminability well into adulthood. It will be of interest in future studies to determine whether stimulus discrimination reaches a plateau and requires continuous experience to maintain the plateau or continues to improve past the classic critical period for ocular dominance plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Our DE experiments revealed that vision has a destabilizing influence on the persistence of orientation preference for approximately 30% of the population of imaged neurons. Similarly, the persistence of pairwise signal correlation among V1 neurons was lower in control conditions compared to the DE condition. Thus, it is possible that under normal natural viewing conditions in the adult, orientation preference is subjected to on-going Hebbian plasticity which has an observable net destabilizing effect on the preference of individual neurons in V1; these changes potentially occupy the null coding space such that they do not impact downstream readout in the visual hierarchy but are sufficient and necessary to maintain retinotopic and matched organization of receptive field structure. In this scenario, DE-induced stabilization would not be a direct consequence of mechanisms associated with deprivation-induced homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>) rather the removal of a disrupting influence.</p><p>The observations reported here are consistent with the theoretical proposal that there is a plastic substrate of neurons with preferentially higher recurrent connectivity that coexist with a stable ‘backbone’ formed by neurons that are resistant to sensory perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sweeney and Clopath, 2020</xref>). Such a functional architecture has the advantage that new information can be integrated into existing networks without perturbing on-going function and could contribute to stable perception while allowing for adaptive flexibility. In other words, the backbone is resistant to effects of homeostatic plasticity induced by DE. Also, consistent with the proposed functional architecture, we found that that the decoding accuracy of fixed classifiers rebounded to their original, pre-dark exposed state during LRx. The extent to which a stable backbone could be updated to integrate previously deprived input in the case of pathologies such as amblyopia is unclear. Prior work demonstrates that visual perceptual training is effective at improving spatial acuity specifically if the training immediately follows DE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eaton et al., 2016</xref>) such that the rejuvenating effects of DE are still present. It would be of interest in future experiments to determine whether DE transiently allows for a stable backbone to be updated to reflect newly integrated input.</p><p>Notably, the development of natural scene processing is protracted relative to grating stimulus encoding in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kowalewski et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, a proportion of V1 neurons develops a strong preference for complex scenes relative to simple grating stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kowalewski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walker et al., 2020</xref>). It will be of future interest to determine whether the development of complex scene processing is facilitated by the presence of neurons that are functionally distinguishable from a stable ‘backbone’ and the extent to which complex-scene preferring neurons emerge from a potentially more plastic population within V1. Such an architecture may be reinforced by a spatial segregation of neuomodulatory input arising from subcortical brain regions associated with reward signals, such as the nucleus basalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pafundo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2015</xref>).

To express the calcium indicator GCaMP6f selectively in excitatory neurons, homozygous Emx1cre mice (Jackson Laboratories, stock number 005628) were crossed with homozygous Ai93/heterozygous Camk2a-tTA mice (Jackson Laboratories, stock number 024108). Experimental mice were heterozygous for all three alleles. Mice were housed in groups of 2–3 per cage, in a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle; all imaging sessions started at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 14.5±1, where ZT0 is lights on, and ZT12 is lights off. The same enrichment materials were provided in all cages including a Plexiglas hut and nesting material. Mice were housed in the barrier section of the animal facility until the time of surgery, luminance in this room was 240 lux. After surgery mice were maintained in a different location that also had a luminance of 240 lux. During animal set up and tracking prior to recording luminance was 60 lux. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for information on animal sex and genotype. Males and females were randomly selected. None of the mice used in this study exhibited aberrant, interictal events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kowalewski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steinmetz et al., 2017</xref>) in V1 or adjacent regions.</p><p>Mice (29–31 days old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (3% induction, 1–2% maintenance). A 3 mm diameter craniotomy was made over the primary visual cortex in the left hemisphere, identified by coordinates and landmarks as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feese et al., 2018</xref>. A stainless-steel bar, used to immobilize the head for recordings, was glued to the right side of the skull and secured with dental cement. The craniotomy was then covered with a double glass assembly in which the diameter of the inner glass was fitted to the craniotomy and sealed with dental cement. To ensure correct targeting of recordings to the binocular zone of V1, in a pilot experiment, visual stimuli were presented to the ipsilateral pathway. The screen was placed directly in front of the animal, perpendicular to the midline. The contralateral eye was occluded by attaching an opaque shield to the microscope objective. Mice typically adapt to this irritant within 1–2 min. We confirmed that our imaging field of view could be placed such that the field of view did not extend past the boarders of binocular V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the pilot experiment, the calcium indicator GCaMP6f was expressed via a virus (Addgene #100837: pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40; titer ≥1 × 10¹³ vg/mL). Two injections were targeted to the binocular zone of V1 in the left hemisphere (0.3 mm anterior to lambda; 3 and 3.25 mm lateral to the midline, respectively) using a glass micropipette and a PicoSprizer III Microinjector (20 psi, 10–80 ms pulses, 2 s pulse interval). Injections started at an initial depth of 400 μm. The pipette was then raised in 25 μm steps, and equal amounts of virus were injected up to a final depth of 100 μm below the dura for a total injected volume of ~300–500 nl across layer 2/3.</p><p>Prior to the first baseline recording session in the experimental mice, the location of binocular neurons in V1 was identified using the following search strategy: neural activity in response to ipsilateral pathway stimulation was visualized at low magnification using a field of view sized approximately 900×900 microns and moved until the location of the highest-intensity ipsilateral-driven activity was identified. This location was centered in the imaging field of view and the same location used in subsequent imaging sessions. The search area was restricted to an area 2.7 mm posterior of Bregma, thus ensuring extra striate regions anterior to V1 were avoided. Note, although the lateral medial area adjacent to the binocular zone contains binocular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wagor et al., 1980</xref>), the responses are weaker compared to V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003</xref>). After the initial screening described above, four imaging sessions were acquired, each session was separated by 8±1 days (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for the precise age of each animal on each imaging session). Animals were dark-exposed for 8 days. On the pDE imaging session, animals were removed from the dark and exposed to low-light conditions (60 lux) for 30–40 min during the animal mounting and neuron tracking procedure, prior to data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Data acquisition, neuron segmentation, and neuron tracking</title><p>Two-photon calcium imaging was performed in awake head-fixed mice mounted atop a floating spherical treadmill using a resonant scanning microscope (Neurolabware) outfitted with a 16× Nikon objective (0.80 NA) and 8 kHz resonant scanning mirror.

Then, the mean intensity images of the two sessions were registered using an affine transform with one-plus-one evolutionary optimizer. Once the sessions were registered, the percentage of pixel overlap between the neurons from two sessions was computed. Neurons were accepted to be the same neuron across sessions if the percentage of overlapping pixels across the two sessions was larger than 75%.

The stimulus was presented on a screen positioned 25 cm away from the right eye angled at 50° with respect to the midline of the animal. The size of the screen was 64×40 cm, thereby subtending 142×96° of visual angle. The s.f. range of the stimulus set was 0.02 cycles/° to 0.3 cycles/° at 0.02 cycles/° interval. The orientations ranged from 0 to 180° at 15° spacing interval, yielding a total of 180 different sinusoidal gratings with 12 different orientations and 15 different spatial frequencies. Each grating was presented for 250 ms consecutively in a random order without interleaved gray screen; this was repeated four times, and data were saved to disk. This sequence was repeated a minimum of nine times, resulting in a total of at least 36 trials for a given stimulus.

In our case, the KNN classifier estimated the stimulus identity for a given response vector by identifying the most frequent stimulus identity of its k closest response vectors. To identify the nearest neighbors for a given response vector, we computed the Euclidean distance to the other response vectors. For each session, data were divided so that a single set of response vectors consisted of one trial of each stimulus. This resulted in the number of sets being equal to the number of trials that each stimulus was shown. When the number of trials available was larger than the minimum number of trials, trials were randomly subsampled from the available trials. During decoding, the possible neighbors for a test response vector consisted of all response vectors not belonging to the test set. This ensures an unbiased representation of possible nearest neighbors across stimuli. This process was repeated across each response vector and each set. We reported the performance of this decoding process as accuracy across all response vector tested. Previously, we found that a value of k=4 resulted in the best average rank across mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeon et al., 2021</xref>), therefore we fixed the value of k to 4.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Arbora Resulaj (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Included here is a brief summary and list of essential revisions the reviewers and review editor deem necessary for you to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will be able to read below, reviewers appreciated the study and manuscript, which provides a unique and unexpected set of results for the field of adult visual plasticity, at the levels of both population and single cell responses in rodent V1. The writing was clear, the figures appropriate and importantly, the study design and analyses were deemed rigorous and generally appropriate. However, reviewers raised concerns with regard to some of the claims and data interpretation. Rather than additional experiments, they suggested additional information and analyses of the data already collected. The key points that need to be addressed can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1. Several experimental parameters are missing or difficult to locate, and should be provided clearly and completely in the Methods/Results:</p><p>a. A clear experimental timeline.</p><p>b. Mouse age and its impact/lack of impact on results.</p><p>c. Cage environment parameters.</p><p>d. Stimulus and screen parameters for behavioral assays.</p><p>e. Imaging/recording locations within V1 (monocular versus binocular zone?).</p><p>2. Reviewers raised several questions about the proportion (and properties) of untuned neurons in Figure 1 and loss of tuning in Figure 3, as well as change in tuning stability for spatial frequency (as opposed to orientation).</p><p>3. Proper statistical reporting, sample size justification and alternative statistical tests are needed to address strength of findings with regard to increased stability of orientation preferences and generalizability of results to the level of single animals.</p><p>4. Expanded discussion of results in view of: (1) the work of Schoonove et al., 2021 in olfactory cortex (esp. the impact of repeated stimulus presentations), (2) the role of decreased signal to noise ratio (and/or firing rates) in the observed changes in neuronal tuning after DE, and (3) how the notion that in the intact visual system, neural circuits that are easily perturbed by sensory fluctuations co-exist with more stable neurons that are resistant to them applies to abnormally-formed visual systems – such as those in amblyopes.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a number of issues I would like to see addressed in this otherwise well-framed and clearly written manuscript:</p><p>Methodological:</p><p>– State the length of DE in the Methods and at the first mention of DE in Results. Currently, it is stated in the abstract, then on line 173 of the Results and Figure 1 legend.</p><p>– Please provide information about cage environment luminance, as well as visual stimulus screen parameters such as luminance and luminance contrast of the stimuli utilized. Was the screen luminance calibrated for instance? Were all gratings high-contrast? I assume they were – but what contrast?</p><p>– 6 mice appears to be a low sample size – as such, there is a question as to whether sufficient power is present for some of the analyses performed. Please address. Related to this, please provide full statistical expression (degrees of freedom, t or F values as appropriate) every time stats are detailed in the text and figure legends.</p><p>– Please indicate where in V1, imaging/recordings were done. Was it in the monocular section? The binocular section? Some whole brain reconstructions of the location of imaging sites would be useful in this context. Would you expect to see different effects in monocular versus binocular cells?</p><p>– Please provide some evidence (anatomical or otherwise) that you were analyzing neurons in V1 and not extrastriate cortex.</p><p>Interpretational:</p><p>– While the single parameter (ori preference, ori bandwidth, SF preference, SF bandwidth) analysis reveals a change in tuning stability for orientation after DE, there is none for SF – please discuss why and what the functional implications might be.</p><p>– Please discuss the question of why you were able to elicit relevant visual responses from only a small fraction of V1 neurons imaged for the comparisons made between B1-B2, B2-pDE, etc. What exactly caused this (loss of visual responsiveness, or ability to be fit with the 2D Gaussian model)? How does that impact interpretation of the effects of DE?</p><p>– The last sentence of the Introduction (lines 104-105) comes out of no-where, stating that &quot;exposure to natural image statistics in the home-cage improves neural discriminability in the adult&quot;. It is not clear how the authors arrive at this conclusion, especially here in the Introduction (before methods and results are detailed) and in view of the fact that there is next to no information about the visual environment of their experimental animals in their cages. Were natural image statistics measured? Manipulated? Have the authors established a causal relationship between statistics of natural cage environment and neural tuning or discriminability in their animals or is this speculation? Please clarify. What may additionally help the reader in this context, is for authors to introduce the notion of the natural visual environment earlier, as they describe their experimental manipulations. Light re-introduction is in fact not just re-introduction of light, but re-introduction to a high luminance state + the natural [cage] visual environment.</p><p>– Please discuss the temporal requirements for the phenomena observed – or at the very least justify why 8 days were selected for both the DE and the light re-exposure. Would 1 day have sufficed? Would 3? This ties in with my next point ….</p><p>– It would be good to see the discussion of results include some mechanistic hypotheses about the phenomena described. Do the authors think the representational stabilization observed is the result of homeostatic plasticity induced by deprivation or a Hebbian mechanism? What about the effect of visual re-exposure?</p><p>– Finally, the authors nicely present their work in the context of the theory proposed by Clopath and colleagues, about the co-existence of neural populations that are more easily perturbed by sensory stimuli and those which are more resistant – the more &quot;stable backbone&quot;. While the present work may have confirmed such a scenario in the intact mouse visual cortex, it would be useful to see a discussion of the likelihood that this may also be true in pathological visual systems such as those of amblyopic subjects.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite the significance of the work and the findings, there are a number of points that should be clarified in the manuscript:</p><p>1. According to supplemental data file 1, 6 mice were recorded in these experiments, 3 aged postnatal day 45-59 and 3 aged postnatal day 83-86. It would be interesting to see if the response to dark exposure was different across the 2 age groups, as predicted by previous work. An experimental timeline would be useful, the above age at imaging initiation is only available in supplemental data.</p><p>2. The representational drift demonstrated in Deitch et al., in visual cortex is not stabilized by the visual stimulation protocol, however Schoonove et al., 2021 show demonstrate that daily exposure to the same odorant stabilizes stimulus selectivity in the olfactory cortex. I'd like to see the authors expand their discussion of these interesting observation.</p><p>(It would also be more precise for the authors to refer to Schoonove et al., as working in olfactory cortex not association cortex).</p><p>3. In Figure 1B, &quot;tracked and tuned&quot; neurons were shown in red and &quot;segmented&quot; neurons were shown in yellow. How about &quot;tracked but not tuned&quot; neurons? Were they included in &quot;segmented&quot; group? Since not all visually responsive neurons are tuned, this group should be separated by &quot;segmented&quot;.</p><p>4. In Figure 3F and G, the nature of decrease in tuning should be further discussed. Pacheco et al., 2019 demonstrated, prolonged exposure to darkness increases the firing rates upon LRx. Is the decrease in reliability due to the decrease in SNR? Any difference in firing rate changes between &quot;neurons remained tuned&quot; vs &quot;neurons lost tuning&quot;?</p><p>5. Unless those 30% of neurons that lost tuning after pDE are the ones regain tuning, visual representation after 8 d LRx is different from pre-DE condition (B1 and B2). It is not clear if the identity of 30% of neurons were tracked after 8 d LRx to prove this.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper uses a combination of analysis methods that are both thoughtful and complementary. My main recommendations are for additional analyses to strengthen the findings.</p><p>(1) Please mention whether the monocular zone of V1 or the binocular zone of V1 was imaged. This is relevant for comparison with monocular deprivation studies.</p><p>(2) The finding that a fraction of neurons show more stable orientation preferences following dark exposure depends on the quality of the fits for the tuning curves. While the authors present a control where they remove 10% of neurons with the worst R2 from their analysis, and show that the conclusions still hold, other complementary analysis can be used. Does R2 depend on change in orientation preference? If neurons were to be ranked according to their change in orientation preference and split into three equal groups, is there a difference in R2 between the three groups?</p><p>(3) The paper pools visual responses across six mice to show a smaller change in orientation preference following dark exposure compared to baseline. Is there an effect if you do Wilcoxon rank sum test on visual responses from each individual mouse (ie. Figure 1D statistical test performed on visual responses from individual mice)?</p><p>(4) Additional analysis is needed to support the following sentence in the Abstract or this sentence should be softened: &quot;a decrease in response reliability across a broad range of spatial frequencies accounted for the disruption&quot;. The paper shows that there is both decreased reliability and degraded classifier performance. However, to address whether decreased reliability indeed degrades classifier performance, the authors could remove the least reliable neurons and compare classifier performance (the comparison may have to be with a matched number of neurons).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80361.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are a number of issues I would like to see addressed in this otherwise well-framed and clearly written manuscript:</p><p>Methodological:</p><p>– State the length of DE in the Methods and at the first mention of DE in Results.

These results are consistent with prior work indicating that the stability of spatial frequency preference and orientation preference are independently regulated (Jeon et al., 2018). It would be of interest in future work to examine whether at the level of receptive field sub-structure, the axis of receptive field orientation is preferentially destabilized relative to the size of on-off sub-regions. Alternatively, larger sample sizes could reveal subtle changes in spatial frequency; this would be an indication that instability of spatial frequency contributes to the observed change in signal correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please discuss the question of why you were able to elicit relevant visual responses from only a small fraction of V1 neurons imaged for the comparisons made between B1-B2, B2-pDE, etc. What exactly caused this (loss of visual responsiveness, or ability to be fit with the 2D Gaussian model)? How does that impact interpretation of the effects of DE?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in the public view, a consist finding across laboratories is that 30-50% of the neural population in V1 is visually responsive to grating stimuli<sup>1–5</sup>. Regarding the comment on B1-B2 and B2-pDE, we now provide analysis using the pool of neurons that were tracked across all three sessions to alleviant the reviewer’s concern that neurons responsive on only a sub-set of these three sessions drove the main effect (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1E,F). Additional analysis related to Figure 3 is now included that clarifies ~11% of neurons that were initially tuned to grating stimuli on the Baseline 2 imaging session were no longer tuned after dark exposure. Of that 11%, half regained tuning (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1E,F).

This ties in with my next point ….</p></disp-quote><p>8 days of light re-exposure was selected because by design it was necessary to match the duration to the time spend in DE so that we could compute the rate of representational drift (the temporal duration must the same in this case). Text was updated to make this clearer. Given the results, indeed it, would be of interest in future studies to determine how quickly accuracy rebounds upon light re-exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be good to see the discussion of results include some mechanistic hypotheses about the phenomena described. Do the authors think the representational stabilization observed is the result of homeostatic plasticity induced by deprivation or a Hebbian mechanism? What about the effect of visual re-exposure?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up some interesting questions. We can only speculate. Our working model is that: (1) Under normal natural viewing conditions in the adult, orientation preference is subjected to on-going Hebbian plasticity which has an observable net destabilizing effect on the preference of individual neurons in V1; these changes potentially occupy the null coding space such that they do not impact downstream readout in the visual hierarchy, but are sufficient and necessary to maintain retinotopic and matched organization of receptive field structure. In this scenario, stabilization is not a direct consequence of deprivation-induced homeostasis, rather the removal of a disrupting influence. (2) An underlying ‘backbone’ exists that is resistant to the effects of homeostatic plasticity induced by deprivation, allowing the representation to re-bound back to its original form, despite prominent deprivation-induced homeostatic changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, the authors nicely present their work in the context of the theory proposed by Clopath and colleagues, about the co-existence of neural populations that are more easily perturbed by sensory stimuli and those which are more resistant – the more &quot;stable backbone&quot;. While the present work may have confirmed such a scenario in the intact mouse visual cortex, it would be useful to see a discussion of the likelihood that this may also be true in pathological visual systems such as those of amblyopic subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, the reviewer brings up some interesting questions. The following is speculative; we welcome the opportunity to include in the manuscript if useful:</p><p>The extent to which a stable backbone could be updated to integrate previously deprived input in the case of pathologies such as amblyopia is unclear. Prior work demonstrates that visual perceptual training is effective at improving spatial acuity specifically if the training immediately follows dark exposure (Eaton et al., 2016), such that the rejuvenating effects of dark exposure are still present. It would be of interest in future experiments to determine whether dark exposure transiently allows for a stable backbone to be updated to reflect newly integrated input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Despite the significance of the work and the findings, there are a number of points that should be clarified in the manuscript:</p><p>1. According to supplemental data file 1, 6 mice were recorded in these experiments, 3 aged postnatal day 45-59 and 3 aged postnatal day 83-86. It would be interesting to see if the response to dark exposure was different across the 2 age groups, as predicted by previous work. An experimental timeline would be useful, the above age at imaging initiation is only available in supplemental data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue. Indeed, the youngest animal (p45) does appear atypical. This information is added in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A. In addition we rearranged the Table to appear as Table 1, rather than a supplementary file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The representational drift demonstrated in Deitch et al., in visual cortex is not stabilized by the visual stimulation protocol, however Schoonove et al., 2021 show demonstrate that daily exposure to the same odorant stabilizes stimulus selectivity in the olfactory cortex. I'd like to see the authors expand their discussion of these interesting observation.</p><p>(It would also be more precise for the authors to refer to Schoonove et al., as working in olfactory cortex not association cortex).</p></disp-quote><p>Updated to olfactory cortex. We agree that it is possible that representational drift in visual cortex is less sensitive to repeated stimulation presentation compared to olfactory cortex, and it would be of interest to explore. However, the experimental design used in the Deitch et al., study was not designed specifically to test that hypothesis. The stimulus schedule, including which stimuli were presented on a given session and the interval (e.g. days between sessions) at which they were presented differed across mice, and as we understand the Allen Brain data set, it is possible some mice experienced other visual stimuli at different rates. Because of this complication, we prefer to not directly compare Deitch and Schoonove. Note, we did expand the discussion to include some mechanistic hypotheses about the phenomena observed, as suggested by reviewer #1, and on line 272 relate our results to Schoonove et al., 2021.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 1B, “tracked and tuned” neurons were shown in red and “segmented” neurons were shown in yellow. How about “tracked but not tuned” neurons? Were they included in “segmented” group? Since not all visually responsive neurons are tuned, this group should be separated by “segmented”.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested Information was added to Figure 1B.

In Figure 3F and G, the nature of decrease in tuning should be further discussed. Pacheco et al., 2019 demonstrated, prolonged exposure to darkness increases the firing rates upon LRx. Is the decrease in reliability due to the decrease in SNR? Any difference in firing rate changes between “neurons remained tune&quot; vs &quot;neurons lost tunin”?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this thoughtful comment, indeed given prominent changes in immediate early gene expression changes in basal firing rate could be significant. We added additional analysis of basal activity to address this issue and did not detect an increase in basal activity in the post-DE imaging session (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D). Note, the observed increase in firing by Pacheco et al., 2019 was transient, peaking at 10 minutes and returning to baseline within 30-60 minutes. In our case, recording was initiated 30-40 minutes after the transition from dark to low-light during animal positioning and neuron tracking, thus is consistent with Pacheco et al., 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Unless those 30% of neurons that lost tuning after pDE are the ones regain tuning, visual representation after 8 d LRx is different from pre-DE condition (B1 and B2). It is not clear if the identity of 30% of neurons were tracked after 8 d LRx to prove this.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the confusion. In Figure 3, all analysis was performed on the same tracked pool of neurons; neurons were segmented in all 4 sessions: Baseline 1 (B1), Baseline 2 (B2), Post-DE (pDE), and Recovery (Rec). We are not entirely sure what the reviewer means by ‘those 30% of neurons that lost tuning after pDE’. To make this section clearer, we quantified the fraction of neurons that were tuned and found that on average across the 6 mice there was an 11±4% decrease in tuned neurons from Baseline 2 to Post-DE. Of the 11% that were lost, 6 % were re-gained (new Figure supplement 2E,F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper uses a combination of analysis methods that are both thoughtful and complementary.

While the authors present a control where they remove 10% of neurons with the worst R2 from their analysis, and show that the conclusions still hold, other complementary analysis can be used. Does R2 depend on change in orientation preference? If neurons were to be ranked according to their change in orientation preference and split into three equal groups, is there a difference in R2 between the three groups?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in order for our conclusion to be valid, there cannot be a systematic difference in the quality of fits across imaging sessions, and that complementary analysis is useful. We include three different (complementary) analyses that address this issue. First, our analysis of three groups, B1, B2, and pDE, demonstrates that there is no difference in the goodness of fit values across imaging sessions (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B); this is direct evidence that there is not a systematic difference in quality of fits underlies the observed difference reported in Figure 1D. Second, removing the worst 10% did not impact the results (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1C). Third, stability of signal correlation was analyzed for all responsive neurons, regardless of tuning (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1D). The reviewer suggests a forth analysis, however a priori, one might expect that there is a correlation between the stability of orientation preference and R2 value. This could have a biological basis. For example, higher trial-to-trial variability could be predictive that a neuron will be more likely to shift its orientation preference. Such a correlation does not invalidate the conclusion, but does mean that the first analysis described above is essential. Note, the criteria for including specific neurons was independent of the R square value, we used a permutation test to determine whether a neuron was tuned or not.</p><p>In case helpful, we include a version of the requested analysis in this rebuttal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

The mean and standard deviation of the R square values are plotted; the values are largely overlapping. P values are calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and are not corrected for multiple comparisons. As expected, there is a correlation between orientation stability and the R square value.
