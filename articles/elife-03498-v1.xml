This is accomplished by a dynamic and complex structure known as the phragmoplast, comprising the cytoskeletal polymers, microtubules and actin filaments. The phragmoplast assembles from the anaphase spindle and directs the traffic of vesicles carrying cell wall components to and from the nascent wall, called the cell plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Seguí-Simarro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Austin et al., 2005</xref>). The phragmoplast forms at the center of the cell and expands outward to reach the parental cell wall, tens or even hundreds of microns distant. When the phragmoplast reaches the parental cell wall, the cell plate and parental membranes fuse, completing cytokinesis.</p><p>Active guidance is required during phragmoplast expansion. However, the molecular basis for this steering has been elusive. It is clear that microtubules are essential for cell division, since in their absence the cell plate does not form. And while it has been known for decades that the phragmoplast also contains actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clayton and Lloyd, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kakimoto and Shibaoka, 1987</xref>), it remains unclear how actin contributes to phragmoplast function. For one, plant cells still divide in the absence of actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baluska et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nishimura et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally division still occurs in the presence of mutations in genes encoding actin or various actin-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jürgens, 2005</xref>). However, based on drug treatments and localization studies, actin has been proposed to stabilize the phragmoplast and link the phragmoplast to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lloyd and Traas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Molchan et al., 2002</xref>). But beyond implicating actin in a steering mechanism somehow, these studies have provided little if any mechanistic details.</p><p>Specifically dissecting the role of phragmoplast actin is further complicated because actin is also present at the preprophase band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pickett-Heaps and Northcote, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kakimoto and Shibaoka, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Palevitz, 1987</xref>), a microtubule-based structure that is present on the cell cortex just prior to nuclear envelope breakdown. As mitosis proceeds, the microtubules in the band disassemble while actin filaments become depleted from the band itself but enriched on either side of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cleary, 1995</xref>). Although the cytoskeletal polymers are lost from the band, a number of proteins remain at the site of the band throughout mitosis and cytokinesis, thereby marking the site where the new cell plate will fuse to the parental cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Walker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Interfering with preprophase band development invariably interferes with cell plate positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rasmussen et al., 2011b</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Because actin is present in both the band and the phragmoplast, discovering actin's function specifically in the latter has been challenging.</p><p>However, not all dividing plant cells have a preprophase band. Moss spores germinate into a branched network of filaments, known as protonemata. All dividing cells, both apical and branching, divide without benefit of a preprophase band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Doonan et al., 1985</xref>). While depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton halts cell expansion in protonemata, it has little if any effect on cell division. The fact that moss protonemata do not make a preprophase band, but have actin in the phragmoplast provides a unique opportunity to study the role of actin in phragmoplast guidance. Here, we use a combination of genetics and live-cell imaging to probe the role for guiding the phragmoplast of actin and a family of actin-based molecular motors, the class VIII myosins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell plate guidance defects in myosin VIII null plants</title><p><italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> has five identified class VIII myosin genes, named myo8A through E. Taking advantage of facile homologous recombination in this species, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wu et al. (2011)</xref> constructed a line in which all five genes were disrupted (Δmyo8ABCDE). Protonemata from this line have multiple, unevenly distributed branches. Upon further inspection, we found that cell plate placement at branch sites is often affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell plates are aberrantly positioned with respect to the filament axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrows). Since branch patterning and cell division plane specification are linked, we reasoned that non-branching cells in the myosin VIII null plants might also have cell division defects. In young wild-type plants, apical cells position their new cell plates perpendicular to the long axis of the cell: more than 84% of apical cell plates are within 15° of the perpendicular plane. In contrast in myosin VIII null plants, less than 35% of the apical cell plates are within 15° of the perpendicular axis and nearly 40% have cell plates with angles greater than 25°, some as high as 45° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03498.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell plate defects in Δmyo8ABCDE can be restored by expression of Myo8A-GFP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 10-day-old wild type and myosin VIII null plants stained with calcofluor.

Since myosin VIII's are partially redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wu et al., 2011</xref>), we reasoned that expression of Myo8A should be sufficient to partially rescue the myosin VIII null phenotype. To test this, we measured cell plate positioning in young plants and found that expression of Myo8A-GFP results in plants with 63% of the apical cell plates within 15° of the perpendicular axis. Importantly, cell plates with angles greater than 35° are never observed in the Myo8A-GFP expressing plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that Myo8A-GFP partially restores cell plate positioning in the myosin VIII null plants. Additionally, Myo8A-GFP expression partially rescues a number of other defects in myosin VIII null plants, including protonemal branching defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), apical cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and timing of gametophore formation (data not shown).

To stage division, we introduced into the Myo8A-GFP line mCherry-PpTUA1 (hereafter referred to as mCherry-tubulin). In branch forming cells, Myo8A-GFP accumulates prominently at the cell cortex at the neck region of the emerging bulge, and this accumulation happens prior to prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The tubulin images confirm that these cells lack a preprophase band. During branch cell mitosis, Myo8A-GFP appears on the spindle and phragmoplast, and as the phragmoplast matures, Myo8A-GFP accumulates at the phragmoplast periphery. In the later stages of cytokinesis, there are two populations of Myo8A-GFP: an inner ring on the phragmoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, arrow heads; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and an outer ring at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As the phragmoplast expands, the inner Myo8A-GFP ring eventually reaches the outer one.

When Myo8A-GFP appears on the spindle, there is little to no accumulation of lifeact-mCherry. During the transition from spindle to phragmoplast, Myo8A-GFP concentrates at the midzone and lifeact-mCherry fluorescence rises above background levels in the vicinity of the phragmoplast. However, when Myo8A-GFP fluorescence tightens into a thin band on the phragmoplast leading edge, the lifeact-mCherry fluorescence accumulates significantly around the phragmoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>, top). The timing of the appearance of actin suggests that early localization of Myo8A-GFP to the mitotic spindle is independent of actin. To test this, we imaged cells entering mitosis in the presence of 25 µM Latrunculin B, which depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, Myo8A-GFP still accumulates on the mitotic spindle.

However, we also observed that Myo8A-GFP localizes to the ends of peripheral phragmoplast microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>) that initiate from the edge of the phragmoplast and are initially unattached to the phragmoplast midzone. We investigated the behavior of these peripheral microtubules in control and latrunculin B treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>). Before the phragmoplast reaches the cell cortex, we found that there were three times fewer peripheral microtubules in control cells as compared to cells treated with latrunculin B. We suspected that this difference likely results from the fact that peripheral microtubules more rapidly focus at the phragmoplast midzone in control cells. To test this, we identified peripheral microtubules in control and latrunculin B treated cells and followed them for 20 s. We found in control cells that only 20% of the peripheral microtubules were still present after 20 s (n = 4 cells). In contrast, 89% of peripheral microtubules were still present after 20 s in latrunculin B treated cells (n = 4 cells). In some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, yellow arrow) peripheral microtubules were observed to remain unattached for more than a minute. Taken together these data indicate that in the presence of actin peripheral microtubules are swiftly integrated into the expanding phragmoplast, suggesting that actin filaments exist between the edge of the expanding phragmoplast, peripheral microtubules, and the cell cortex.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03498.027</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Myo8A-GFP associates with the ends of phragmoplast microtubules.</title><p>Images of a protonemal apical cell expressing Myo8A-GFP (green) and mCherry-tubulin (red) were acquired with a spinning disc confocal microscope.

A population of myosin VIII localizes to microtubules and this population incorporates into the mitotic spindle upon spindle formation. In early mitosis, as microtubules are dynamically searching to make chromosomal attachments, Myo8A-GFP decorates the entire spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At metaphase, Myo8A-GFP concentrates in the spindle midzone and at anaphase an additional population of Myo8A-GFP dynamically concentrates at the cell cortex where the cell plate ultimately fuses with the parental cell wall. Once the phragmoplast assembles, Myo8A-GFP forms a tight ring at the edge of the expanding phragmoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). At this point, the class II formin, For2A, localizes to the phragmoplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">van Gisbergen et al., 2012</xref>) and polymerizes actin filaments between the leading edge of the phragmoplast and the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Since For2A remains associated with the phragmoplast, it suggests that the barbed ends of the actin filaments are anchored at the phragmoplast midzone and the pointed ends are in the cytoplasm. Myosin VIII at the cortex can hold onto these actin filaments and walk towards the barbed end thereby aligning the actin filaments to the cortical division site. We propose that myosin VIII at the ends of peripheral phragmoplast microtubules moves along these actin filaments from the cortical division site towards the expanding phragmoplast, thereby translocating microtubules and ensuring that phragmoplast expansion occurs along a plane defined by the cortical division site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03498.033</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model for myosin VIII function in phragmoplast guidance.</title><p>In prometaphase, myosin VIII localizes to plus ends throughout the mitotic spindle.

As the phragmoplast forms, the midzone myosin VIII accumulation tightens into a thin band on the phragmoplast edge. For2A is at the phragmoplast midzone. Actin filaments are generated between the phragmoplast and cortical myosin VIII.

In the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the class V myosin, Myo2p, binds Kar9p, which localizes to cytoplasmic microtubule plus ends by binding the yeast EB1 homolog, Bim1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2000</xref>). These cytoplasmic microtubules emanate from the spindle pole body embedded in the nuclear envelope and Myo2p mediates their motility along actin cables directed into the bud, moving the nucleus toward the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beach et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yin et al., 2000</xref>). We imagine a similar mechanism could be at work in plant cells, whereby myosin VIII associates with microtubule ends, and subsequently translocates microtubules on actin filaments to guide phragmoplast expansion.</p><p>While the localization of myosin VIII is striking, myosin VIII in protonemata is mostly dispensable for phragmoplast guidance in apical cells. These cells are narrow, with diameters not much greater than the sizes of the nucleus and spindle, leaving little room for those two structures to be misplaced. Due to these geometric constraints, the mitotic spindle always forms along the long axis of the cell. Thus, any cell plate positioning defects that occur are mild because the spindle midzone is always roughly perpendicular to the long axis of the cell.</p><p>In contrast, myosin VIII is needed for branch formation, insofar as cell plates are often aberrantly positioned in the branching cells of the myosin VIII nulls. Arguably, in comparison to apical cell division, side-branch formation needs to specify the cell division plane more accurately. Branching involves an asymmetric cell division in an L-shaped cell. The nucleus migrates toward the junction of the parental cell and the branch and the spindle is oriented along the longitudinal axis of the new emerging cell. The phragmoplast builds the new cell plate at the junction of the two cells. We found that in branching cells, a relatively static population of Myo8A-GFP accumulates at the cell cortex at the future site of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Myo8A-GFP accumulates at this site early, prior to mitosis, and remains throughout cytokinesis. As in apical cells, Myo8A-GFP also accumulates on the mitotic spindle, ultimately forming a tight band on the leading edge of the phragmoplast. The new cell plate fuses with the parental cell membranes at the cortical site defined by the presence of Myo8A-GFP. Since there are many ways to orient the spindle in a branching cell, in the absence of myosin VIII defects in cell plate positioning are frequent, suggesting that myosin VIII functions to guide phragmoplast expansion.</p><p>Notably, our data suggests that a myosin VIII-mediated phragmoplast-guidance mechanism also exists in seed plants, since we found that moss Myo8A-GFP localizes to the preprophase band, cortical division site, and the phragmoplast midzone in BY-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our result is consistent with a previous report in which a GFP fusion of one of the Arabidopsis class VIII myosins, ATM1-GFP, was shown to localize to the phragmoplast in BY-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Van Damme et al., 2004</xref>). The discovery that Myo8A-GFP localizes to the cortical division site gives us a portal to connect our observations in moss to the current model of cell division in seed plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Van Damme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rasmussen et al., 2011b</xref>). In that model, cells with preprophase bands use a microtubule-dependent mechanism to position the nucleus such that it is bisected by the future plane of division and to form the spindle perpendicularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mineyuki and Furuya, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Venverloo and Libbenga, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Katsuta et al., 1990</xref>). Once the spindle is aligned, defects in phragmoplast guidance would little alter cell plate positioning and subsequent tissue morphogenesis, obscuring the role of myosin VIII. Nevertheless, when BY-2 cells are treated with actin inhibitors, phragmoplasts are disorganized, generating wrinkled cell plates that are often skewed with respect to the cortical division site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hoshino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yoneda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Higaki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kojo et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we predict that for fine tuning myosin VIII and actin guide phragmoplast expansion in cells with preprophase bands.</p><p>Our data provide evidence that myosin VIII and actin steer phragmoplast expansion during cytokinesis in both moss and tobacco, suggesting that myosin VIII function is conserved throughout plant evolution. In fact, myosin VIII provides a physical link between phragmoplast microtubules and the cortical division site via actin filaments. We propose that myosin VIII's motor activity along actin provides a molecular mechanism for steering phragmoplast expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>All expression constructs were constructed using Multisite Gateway recombination technology from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

At least 30 µg of plasmid DNA was linearized, ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in sterile TE buffer. pTKUbi constructs were linearized with Pme I and pTZUbi constructs were linearized with Swa I. Protoplasts were transformed with linearized DNA via PEG-mediated transformation (<italic>15</italic>). Protoplasts were plated in top agar, regenerated on PRM (PpNH<sub>4</sub> medium supplemented with 8.5% mannitol and 10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.) for 4 days and transferred to PpNH<sub>4</sub> medium containing the appropriate antibiotics (G418, 20 µg/ml; zeocin, 50 µg/ml; hygromycin, 15 µg/ml). To select for stable transformants, transformations were cycled on and off antibiotic selection for three 1-week intervals. Stable transgenic lines were visually screened on a confocal microscope for expression of the transgene.</p><p>pTKUbi-mEGFP-Tub was transformed into WT and Δmyo8ABCDE (<italic>14</italic>) generating the mEGFP-Tub lines. pTKUbi-Myo8A-3mEGFP was transformed into Δmyo8ABCDE generating the Myo8A-GFP line. Myo8A-GFP was subsequently transformed with pTZUbi-mCherry-tubulin and pTZUbi-Lifeact-mCherry to generate Myo8A-GFP/mCherry-tub and Myo8A-GFP/Lifeact-mCherry.</p><p>Lifeact-mEGFP line (<italic>30</italic>) was transformed with the Asc I linearized mCherry-αtub215-51-1AR construct, to generate Lifeact-mEGFP/mCherry–tubulin line. Stably transformed lines were identified by visually screening for mCherry expression and then verified by genotyping using primers P15 and P16.</p><p>Tobacco BY-2 tissue culture and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were performed as previously described (<italic>35</italic>). Tobacco BY-2 cells were transformed with pMDC32-Myo8A-3XmEGFP. The GV3101 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain was used for infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phenotypic analysis, cell wall staining, and imaging</title><p>For measurement of cell plate angle and apical cell length, plants regenerated from protoplasts were stained with 0.1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> calcofluor solution and visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (Leica MZ16FA, Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) using a UV filter (excitation 360/40 nm, emission 420 long pass) or a Violet filter (excitation 425/40 nm, emission 400 long pass).

For cell plate staining, 15 µM FM4-64 was added in the Hoagland's solution in the agar pad. For latrunculin B treatment, plants were transferred to PpNH4 medium containing 25 µM latrunculin B for 2 hr, then transferred to slides containing 25 µM latrunculin B in both the agar pad and the Hoagland's solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Variable angle epifluorescence microscopy (VAEM)</title><p>Samples were mounted on an inverted microscope (model Ti-E; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a mirror-based T-FL-TIRF illuminator (Nikon) and imaged with a 1.49 NA 100× oil immersion TIRF objective (Nikon). The 1.5× optivar was used for all images to increase magnification. 488 and 561 nm laser illumination was used for GFP and mCherry excitation, respectively. The laser illumination angle was adjusted individually for each sample to achieve the maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Signals for each channel were captured simultaneously with a 1024 × 1024 electron-multiplying CCD camera (iXON3; Andor Technology USA, South Windsor, CT) equipped with a dual-view adaptor (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ).

The only result that directly supports this claim is the increase in frequency of oblique cell walls in the quintuple mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The localization of Myo8A-GFP at the cortical division site only indirectly supports the guidance model. The authors' interpretation that these cortical Myo8A motors can exert a pulling force on the actin filaments emanating from the phragmoplast is plausible, but not supported by any data. It is also important to emphasize that this mechanism is very different from that found in budding yeast where the myosin uses actin filaments of opposite orientation to pull the nucleus toward the bud neck.</p><p>The text should be modified to explain these differences better. It may also be helpful to point out that the authors postulate two different localizations of Myo8A: one at MT plus ends and one on the cortical division site. Where it is stated that “...these data suggest that mysosin VIII steers the phragmoplast to the pre-determined cortical division site.”; at this point in the paper, it may be better to leave the window for mechanistic possibilities a little open since it might also be possible that myosin VIII could help to position other division factors, which would be a somewhat different role than being part of the steering mechanism itself.</p><p>1a) A major emphasis in the proposed mechanism for phragmoplast guidance involves the role of peripheral MTs. Several reviewers were not convinced by the data regarding the rate of incorporation of peripheral microtubules into the phragmoplast body; data currently consist of several movies, but these lack measurements, numbers of samples and statistics. Given that these data speak to the proposed mechanism, and the images already seem to have been acquired, quantitative comparisons of mutant and wild type (at comparable stages of cytokinesis) should be made.</p><p>1b) Towards the end of the Results section, is it known at this stage that myosin motility per se is the responsible activity? Other motors can act, for example, by localizing other proteins to particular positions such as the ends of cytoskeletal polymers.</p><p>2) Improve quantitation and statistical analysis of data: specifically</p><p>2a) While the histograms of cell wall angles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show different distributions among the three genotypes, it would add rigor to perform a statistical test for distribution shifts. For example, a Mann-Whitney U test.</p><p>2b) Please provide numbers for how often the population of cortical Myo8A-GFp spots are observed in the apical cells? They are evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, but not in 5D at the same time point.</p><p>2c) The FM-464 results are presented as single images. Numbers should be provided to indicate repeatability.</p><p>2d) It is stated that in the absence of actin, the peripheral microtubules with Myo8A on their ends are not rapidly incorporated into the expanding phragmoplast. The supporting movie does seem to show more stable association of microtubule ends with the cortex, and it is stated that they stay so associated for more than a minute; however, measurements really have to be provided to support this conclusion.</p><p>2e) The observations about actin becoming more abundant at the remaining unattached area of the phragmoplast need to be quantified – at least in terms of how often this was observed out of how many asymmetric cortical contact events.</p><p>2f) The experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> should either be repeated on the line expressing LA-mCherry to demonstrate the extent of actin depolymerization by LatB, or other information presented to indicate the confidence that this treatment was effective as LatB can quickly lose activity during storage.</p><p>3) Improve display of data, including using kymographs, specifically:</p><p>3a) Taken altogether, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B-D</xref> and the accompanying movies are a little limited as data demonstrating Myo8A moving along actin tracks, at least as presented. There is that one nice example in Figure C, but some other examples should also be provided. A kymograph approach might work, where analysis lines are drawn along actin bundles and then applied to the Myo8A channel. This could work for Movie 1/image sequences of LF and Myo8A as it is possible then to show many motility events and to measure velocities. Performing a frame average across the time series in both the control and the LatB treatment in Movie 2 could make images much more distinctly different than as depicted in 2D.</p><p>3b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, is it possible to show projections along the plane of, or at an angle to, the phragmoplast equator? Or provide 3D rotations as movies? In both cases, one of the key features being pointed out is the population of tagged Myo8A at the periphery of the phragmoplast. While this location is clear in images such as 5C and E at 16 minutes and later, when the phragmoplast is tilted relative to the axis of view, it is less easy to discern at earlier stages (how much is peripheral and how much is internal to the periphery). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> 12 minutes, it is not in fact clear if the most intense portion of Myo8A ring is at the phragmoplast periphery, or somewhat external to this location.</p><p>3c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, show the two channels. It is important when assessing a colocalization pattern that both the merged and the single channel data are shown.</p><p>3d) The Myo8A-GFP localization to the presumptive plus ends of phragmoplast microtubules is interesting and the movies show the dynamic colocalization of these labels. To present such evidence in print, a kymograph analysis of joint displacement would be more effective.</p><p>3e) Movie 8 is a very important movie. Both individual channels should be shown together with the merged channels so dynamic co-localization can be better assessed.</p><p>3f) Peripheral microtubules are observed to be incorporated into the expanding phragmoplast within 10 seconds of what event?</p><p>4) Justify use of tobacco to examine the role of myo8s in plants with PPBs.</p><p>Testing models in a different plant is an important addition, but since P.p. myo8 was used instead of endogenous tobacco myo8, these results should be treated with caution. Showing that a myosin VIII from moss can show similar localization patterns when expressed in tobacco is not equivalent to showing the localization of a bonafide tobacco protein, let alone testing for the function. Two modifications should be made: First, an alignment of the P.p Myo8 sequence compared with tobacco (or other solanaceous species) should be included as a supplemental figure and second, changing the phrasing of the last sentence of the paragraph describing the tobacco results to be less emphatic. Perhaps “...myosin 8A is capable of...”</p><p>5) Explore phenotypes of mutants (or justify why mutants were not used) of Myo8 and formin in phragmoplast guidance.</p><p>Myo8-GFP only partially rescues the mutant. Why doesn't it rescue? One hypothesis is that it is just one of several myo8s and so we wouldn't expect it to completely rescue. The other is that the GFP tag interferes with its activity. Some evidence that it is not the latter, for example, by rescuing other myo8 lines (triple mutants?) with milder defects, would be useful. At the same time, since the Myo8-GFP doesn't fully rescue, this is an opportunity to see localization in a “mutant”. Is there any difference in behavior in the phragmoplasts that are not correctly aligned than in those that are? Formin is invoked as an important component of the division process; could mutants have been analyzed to strengthen the connection?</p><p>6) Clarify final model.</p><p>In the current model drawing, Formin is missing, which seems an important component, and the diagram implies delivery of Myo8A to the cortex by peripheral phragmoplast microtubules. Is there any evidence for this? It was reported that Myo8A-gFP shows up at the cortex before prophase, when there are no such microtubules.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03498.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) While the models presented in this manuscript are thought provoking, they are still quite speculative, and the text and title should be modified to reflect the fact that there is limited evidence for the guidance of the phragmoplast to the cortical division site</italic>.</p><p>We have modified the title and text accordingly.</p><p><italic>The only result that directly supports this claim is the increase in frequency of oblique cell walls in the quintuple mutant in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>.

In the revised model, we include the localization of formin to the phragmoplast midzone. Formins are known to generate actin filaments and stay associated with the barbed ends of the actin filaments. Thus, in our proposed model myosin VIII guides the peripheral phragmoplast microtubules along actin filaments towards the phragmoplast edge, the location of the actin filament barbed ends. With these revisions, we hope to clarify that our model is in agreement with the budding yeast mechanism whereby the plus end of the cytoplasmic microtubule is guided by myosin V, which walks to the barbed end of actin filaments located at the bud tip.</p><p><italic>Where it is stated that “...these data suggest that mysosin VIII steers the phragmoplast to the pre-determined cortical division site.”; at this point in the paper, it may be better to leave the window for mechanistic possibilities a little open since it might also be possible that myosin VIII could help to position other division factors, which would be a somewhat different role than being part of the steering mechanism itself</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to characterize the biochemical properties of Myo8A. Without this, any mutations that we might make are potentially difficult to interpret, since we will not know how these mutations affect the properties of the myosin. While myosins are highly conserved, not all mutations have the same effect on all myosins. We would need substantial biochemical data to help support any mutational data.</p><p>We actually don’t expect full rescue of the Δmyo8ABCDE mutant with just Myo8A. From our previous work (Wu et al., Molecular Plant, 2011), we have shown that there are two groups of myosin VIIIs in moss. Myo8A is the myosin that is predominately expressed from its group, but Myo8B and 8C are in the other group. We expect that full rescue will likely be achieved when either Myo8B or Myo8C is also expressed.</p><p>Rescue of the triple mutant is an excellent idea. Unfortunately we have not generated a triple mutant that is lacking myo8A (only have Δmyo8BCD). We also do not currently have fluorescent tubulin in the other myosin mutants. With respect to formin, we primarily used formin localization as a proxy for where actin polymerization was being initiated on the phragmoplast. While formins may be integral to the process, it is difficult to assess this, since there are nine formins in moss, two of which are absolutely essential for polarized growth.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these great experiments and we hope to do them in the future, but feel that they are beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>6) Clarify final model</italic>.</p><p><italic>In the current model drawing, Formin is missing, which seems an important component, and the diagram implies delivery of Myo8A to the cortex by peripheral phragmoplast microtubules. Is there any evidence for this? It was reported that Myo8A-gFP shows up at the cortex before prophase, when there are no such microtubules</italic>.</p><p>We have re-drawn, clarified the model, and included formins. We did not mean to imply that delivery of Myo8A-GFP to the cell cortex occurs via peripheral microtubules. The new model has removed that component. We have also re- written the Discussion section to discuss the model with respect to division only in apical cells, where accumulation of cortical Myo8A-GFP happens at anaphase.</p></body></sub-article></article>
