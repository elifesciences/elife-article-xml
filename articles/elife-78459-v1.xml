Mosaic mutations are commonly recognized in cancers or localized overgrowth disorders, such as Proteus, CLOVES, and hemimegalencephaly syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lindhurst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goncalves et al., 2018</xref>). Increasingly recognized in more complex diseases such as autism spectrum disorder or structural abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jamuar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rodin et al., 2021</xref>,) mosaic mutations are typically restricted to the individual in which they arise unless they appear prior to the embryonic separation of somatic and germline lineages or within germ cell progenitors. In these cases, gonadal mosaic mutations (comprising gonad specific and gonosomal) have the potential to transmit to offspring. These will appear as a considerable portion of de novo mutations and may result in miscarriage or a congenital or complex disease—often without phenotypes in the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breuss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We and others previously demonstrated that 5–20% of identified pathogenic de novo mutations in a child are detectable in parental tissues, with ejaculated sperm demonstrating the highest rate of occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Myers et al., 2018</xref>). Every male harbors up to dozens of such mutations in sperm, which—in contrast to other paternal mutation types that increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jónsson et al., 2017</xref>)—contribute a life-long threat of transmission largely independent of paternal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). As such, they are thought to explain, in part, the individually rare but collectively common risk of congenital disorders from de novo mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deciphering Developmental Disorders, 2017</xref>). Yet, experimental evidence of transmission to a conceptus of in situ identified gonadal mosaic mutations—in contrast to the detection of gonadal mosaicism of already transmitted variants—is lacking. This is a critical point upon which clinical implementation hinges because procedures like preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) could be used to select embryos absent for potentially damaging mutations detected in sperm. Here, we demonstrate that gonadal mosaic mutations detected in sperm from individual males can transmit to their preimplantation blastocysts. We decided to assess this early time point, as it avoids any potential bias introduced by a possible selection of mosaic mutations or their lineages during implantation or survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Donor population, recruitment, and sample preparation</title><p>For gonadal mosaicism assessment, we recruited three infertile couples (F01, F02, and F03) who had supernumerary blastocysts (minimum of 8) that wanted to donate them to research. The males (‘sperm donors’) all provided a fresh ejaculate and a somatic sample (blood for F01, saliva for F02 and F03). The age of the three sperm donors was 36, 38, and 50 years for F01, F02, and F03, respectively. In accordance with reported population origin, the three fathers’ ancestries were most closely matched to Middle Eastern (F01) or European (F02 and F03) ancestry, employing nearest neighbor analysis of principle components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Taliun et al., 2017</xref>). One of the three females (‘egg donors’) was a nonidentified egg donor (F01) and provided blood, another woman was the partner (F02) and provided saliva. The third chose not to provide a somatic sample (F03). DNA was extracted from each parental sample using documented procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuss et al., 2020</xref>), and extracted and amplified from vitrified blastocysts by thawing in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin and processing with REPLI-g whole-genome amplification methods (Qiagen, Cat. #150343). Informed consent was obtained from all participants (custodians of the blastocysts) as well as from each participant in a study protocol approved by the University of California, San Diego IRB (140028).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Whole-genome sequencing and massive parallel sequencing</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing (WGS; NovaSeq 6000, Illumina) of the sperm donor samples was performed to approximately 300× (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), then analyzed using the 300× MSMF (MuTect2, Strelka2, MosaicForecast) computational pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>).

All putative mosaic mutations (single-nucleotide variants and small insertion–deletion mutations only) as well as 120 common and rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each detected as heterozygous in only one of the sperm donors, were then subjected to validation using massive parallel amplicon sequencing (MPAS, AmpliSeq Illumina Custom DNA Panel), to orthogonally assess each mutation in sperm donors, egg donors, and blastocysts. We also included two unrelated controls to control for false-positive calls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breuss et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MPAS data analysis</title><p>Mosaic mutations from tissues or blastocysts were confirmed or rejected based on the distribution of reference homozygous mutations and the signal in control samples at the same position as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breuss et al., 2022</xref>). The overall number and distribution of mosaic mutations were largely consistent with other unbiased analyses performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). SNPs in nonblastocyst samples were assigned genotypes as reference homozygous, heterozygous, or alternate homozygous, based on the appearance of known genotypes previously determined in WGS data. Blastocysts were determined as genotype negative or positive for the SNPs.</p><p>To determine the expected number of transmissions to each blastocyst, the list of gonadal mosaic mutations and their measured AF in sperm for each sperm donor was used to determine the expected probability of transmission. Then, each blastocyst was combined with all other blastocysts from a single sperm donor or across all sperm donors as indicated. A Gaussian 1D model was fitted using astropy’s LevMarLSQFitter and Gaussian1D to obtain the mean as well as the standard deviation and 95% confidence interval.

Blastocysts with less than 10% detectable genomic positions according to the panel were excluded from the downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Determination of false-negative and -positive rate of transmission to blastocysts</title><p>To calibrate our genotyping approach on whole-genome-amplified blastocyst material, we determined the transmission of heterozygous variants from sperm and egg donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that transmission followed expected genetic patterns; furthermore, homozygous variants from a parent—which should be present across all blastocysts—were transmitted in approximately 94% of those analyzed, suggesting a false-negative rate of ~0.06. Importantly, this false-negative rate also includes potential allelic dropout, which can be problematic for single-cell studies or amplification from biopsies. Conversely, when assessing the presence of gonadal mosaic mutations identified in one sperm donor in the blastocysts of the other two, we only found one such event out of 985 possible, suggesting an MPAS false-positive rate of ~0.001. Thus, this approach provides sensitivity to detect clinically relevant gonadal mosaicism (i.e., mutations with a measurable and potentially actionably abundance) and specificity to assess transmissions of perm mosaic mutations to blastocysts, and it suggests that whole-genome-amplified blastocysts exhibit modest allelic dropout, even though allelic imbalance was frequently observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Determination of <bold>m</bold>osaicism in MPAS data</title><p>For each mosaic mutation or SNP, we determined the estimated AF and its 95% confidence interval based on MPAS. As a baseline for observed noise, we determined the distribution of reference homozygous SNPs and their lower 95% confidence interval (population threshold). Mutations considered as a mosaic in a sperm donor’s tissue fulfilled three criteria: (1) read depth for the position was at least 100×; (2) the observed 95% confidence interval of the mutation did not overlap with the population threshold or the upper 95% confidence interval of the control samples; (3) either control’s lower 95% confidence interval limit had to be below the population threshold. For a blastocyst, to be considered positive for the mutation, similar criteria were applied, but the lower 95% confidence interval could not overlap with 0.05 AF and the read depth at this position had to be equal or above 20×. For SNPs in blood, saliva, and sperm, a mutation was considered heterozygous if above or equal to 0.2 and below 0.8 AF; it was considered homozygous if above or equal to 0.8 AF. Blastocysts were considered positive (either heterozygous or homozygous, not distinguished) if above 0.05 AF.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Determination of <bold>e</bold>venness of ransmitted <bold>m</bold>utations across <bold>b</bold>lastocysts</title><p>For each of F01, F02, and F03, the observed number of transmitted mutations was randomly assigned to the different blastocysts in 10,000 permutations.

The obtained distribution across the 10,000 permutations was then compared to the observed value.

Although additional mutations may arise within earlier sperm lineages marked by prior mutations (e.g., blastocyst #2 in F03), somewhat unexpectedly, we observed cosegregation of mutations of almost equal AF (e.g., blastocyst #1 in F02 or blastocyst #6 in F03); this was reflected as a nonrandom distribution of transmitted mutations across blastocysts in F03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that some early male germ cell lineages or individual mitotic divisions are more susceptible to mutation than others, allowing stratification of sperm lineages into those with higher and those with lower mosaic load, and mutations from one sperm progenitor may uncouple during meiosis. Indeed, we observed different combinations of gonadal mosaic mutations across blastocysts (e.g., blastocysts #5, #6, and #9 in F03). This analysis demonstrates that a priori identified gonadal mosaic mutations have the potential to transmit to preimplantation blastocysts.</p><p>Based upon their individually measured AFs, we next calculated the expected number of transmission events across all blastocysts. Whereas for both F01 and F02 the observed transmission rate was within the 95% confidence interval of the expectation, for F03 and across all individuals when considered in total, the transmission was slightly below what was expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This likely reflects a limitation of the model which assumes that gonadal mosaic mutations arise and transmit independently—a simplification, as mutations arising on the same lineage have the potential to cotransmit. This may be especially relevant if sperm lineages do not stochastically accumulate mutations during early development. Nevertheless, our observations closely reflect expectations, suggesting that gonadal mosaicism assessment can serve as a predictor of mutation transmission.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Expected and observed transmission of gonadal mosaic mutations to preimplantation blastocysts.</title><p>The expected number of transmissions—based on the allelic fraction (AF) of all detected mutations in sperm and the number of analyzed blastocysts—is indicated with the mean and a 95% confidence interval for each sperm donor and across all sperm donors.

The observed transmission rate was again slightly below the expected 95% confidence interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). This replication in live-born offspring supports the undertransmission observed in blastocysts and highlights the potential predictive power of gonadal mosaicism assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we directly measured the abundance of gonadal mosaic variants and demonstrate transmission to preimplantation blastocysts for three couples undergoing IVF. These results provide a proof-of-concept that a priori detected gonadal mosaic mutations can transmit to blastocysts and therefore likely to offspring. There are two important limitations of our study: (1) we were only able to ascertain this phenomenon in three sperm donors and their associated blastocysts; (2) none of the variants interrogated for this study were predicted to be disease causing. Thus, if this approach is to be advanced in the clinic to prevent genetic disease, further research is necessary that expands the size of the cohort and directly assesses a priori identified pathogenic variants for transmission to blastocysts. In addition, further technological development will be required to enable the direct assessment of mutations from biopsies rather than whole blastocysts as implemented in this study.</p><p>Previous studies focused on the detection of mosaicism in parents following the identification of de novo mutations in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rahbari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jónsson et al., 2018</xref>). Currently, following the birth of a child with a disease due to a de novo mutation, parents are provided with an empirical recurrence risk of 1–2% for future pregnancies. However, this population risk reflects an average of a near-zero risk in the majority and measurably higher risk (up to 25%) in a minority of instances due to gonadal mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>). While recent studies have improved the risk accuracy by incorporating population models and sampling parental blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jónsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2014</xref>), direct assessment of gonadal mosaicism can provide a more precise personalized risk, as well as the potential to prevent recurrence through genetic testing. Yet, this framework is only applicable to families where a de novo mutations has previously been identified, and it can merely prevent recurrence within a family. While we previously demonstrated our ability to detect gonadal mosaicism in males independent of prior transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breuss et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), this study provides the important complement that these detected variants are, indeed, transmitted to the next generation.</p><p>What is the potential health impact of the detection of gonadal mosaic variants and their prevention before any child is born with disease? We previously estimated that 1 in 15 males carry a potentially pathogenic mutation, detectable in approximately 5% of sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Together, this led to a prediction that a gonadal mosaic variant may result in adverse pregnancy or pediatric health outcomes for 1 in 300 concepti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). While this likely only represents ~15% of the monogenic sporadic component of diseases such as autism or congenital heart disease, this is the sole fraction that could be prevented with further advances. Thus, if these mosaic mutations were detected prior to pregnancy, and if mutation-carrying blastocysts were identified by PGT, there could be positive consequences for families through the prevention of pregnancy termination or pediatric diseases.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>inventor on a patent (PCT/US2018/024878, WO2018183525A1) filed by UC, San Diego that is titled 'Methods for assessing risk of or diagnosing genetic defects by identifying de novo mutations or somatic mosaic mutations in sperm or somatic tissues</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Project administration, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent was obtained from all participants (custodians of the blastocysts) as well as from each participant in a study protocol approved by the University of California, San Diego IRB (140028 ).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Processed data and sequencing depth information tables.</title><p>Provided as a separate file; legend contained within.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78459-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-78459-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw whole-genome sequencing data of the bulk sperm, saliva, and blood are available on SRA under accession numbers PRJNA753973 and PRJNA588332.

analyzing mosaicism in sperm and transmission of new mutations to relevant offspring. The current work extends previous analysis of mosaicism in sperm to human blastocysts from in vitro fertilization for three subjects (a total of 55 blastocysts), demonstrating transmission of mosaic mutations at close to expected frequencies. The experiments and analysis are carefully done and of high quality, with potential translational relevance to the diagnosis and prevention of genetic disease by pre-implantation genetic testing for a limited subset of mutations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78459.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ginsburg</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan–Ann Arbor</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Ginsburg</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan–Ann Arbor</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.28.486034">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.28.486034v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We did, however, observe a range from 10 to more than 50, and all three individuals would fall within this range (even though F01 and F02 would show numbers at the lower end of the spectrum). We do not believe that this is due to sequencing depth, as F03 is sequenced at a depth between F01 and F02; likewise, we do not believe it to be an age effect: while F03 is older than F01 and F02 (50 years, compared to 36 and 38), the difference is much less than between our young and aged cohorts in our previous publication (~20 years vs. 48+ years). Therefore, we believe these differences to be within the expected biological variation range and not due to a systematic issue. Prompted by this comment we have made two changes to the manuscript:</p><p>1) We have now added the ages of the three sperm donors to the Methods section for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments/suggestions for authors:</p><p>1) The manuscript is well-written and the figures are generally clear.
