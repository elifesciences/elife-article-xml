However, our understanding of their actions in mammalian neurons remains limited. Using affinity purification, yeast-two-hybrid and proximity ligation assays, we identified interactions of multiple RBPs with neural retina leucine (NRL) zipper, a Maf-family transcription factor critical for retinal rod photoreceptor development and function. In addition to splicing, many NRL-interacting RBPs are associated with R-loops, which form during transcription and increase during photoreceptor maturation. Focusing on DHX9 RNA helicase, we demonstrate that its expression is modulated by NRL and that the NRL–DHX9 interaction is positively influenced by R-loops. ssDRIP-Seq analysis reveals both stranded and unstranded R-loops at distinct genomic elements, characterized by active and inactive epigenetic signatures and enriched at neuronal genes. NRL binds to both types of R-loops, suggesting an epigenetically independent function. Our findings suggest additional functions of NRL during transcription and highlight complex interactions among transcription factors, RBPs, and R-loops in regulating photoreceptor gene expression in the mammalian retina.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>retinal development</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01EY000450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swaroop</surname><given-names>Anand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01EY000546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swaroop</surname><given-names>Anand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY030918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corso Diaz</surname><given-names>Ximena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tissue-specific transcription factors, such as basic motif leucine zipper protein NRL, interact with a plethora of RNA-binding proteins to perform pleiotropic functions during distinct steps of transcription process to generate quantitatively precise patterns of gene expression in neuronal cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell type-specific and quantitatively precise decoding of genetic information produces a plethora of divergent cellular morphologies and functions during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El-Danaf et al., 2023</xref>).

The Maf-family basic motif leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor neural retina leucine (NRL) determines rod photoreceptor cell fate as its loss leads to retina with only cone photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mears et al., 2001</xref>), whereas ectopic expression of NRL in developing cones results in generation of rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oh et al., 2007</xref>). Continued expression of NRL is essential for maintaining rod function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), and mutations affecting NRL activity are associated with retinopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bessant et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Asrag et al., 2022</xref>).

Given its fundamental role as a primary activator of rod expressed genes and continuous high-level expression during the life of rod photoreceptors, we hypothesized the involvement of NRL in modulating additional steps during the transcription process. This prediction was strengthened by transcriptional activation synergy observed in rhodopsin regulation between NRL and NonO/p54<sup>nrb</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yadav et al., 2014</xref>). NonO, a ubiquitous nuclear paraspeckle protein, binds to DNA, RNA as well as proteins, and regulates distinct cellular events including the coupling of the circadian clock to cell cycle and transcription to splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fox and Lamond, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kowalska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focused on identifying additional roles of NRL in guiding rod gene expression by characterizing NRL-interacting proteins from the mammalian retina using multiple complementary approaches. We discovered an over-representation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) among NRL interactors, with almost half of the high-confidence interacting proteins associated with R-loops, which are DNA structures comprised of RNA–DNA hybrids and displaced single-stranded DNA. We then investigated the interaction of NRL with two key RNA helicases, DHX9 and DDX5, which mediate resolution of R-loops and further evaluated R-loop dynamics and epigenetic signatures in the retina. Our study underscores the importance of RBPs and R-loop formation as key NRL-interacting regulators of gene expression in retinal rod photoreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RBPs constitute a large cohort among NRL interactors</title><p>To identify new NRL protein partners that mediate its function in rod photoreceptors, we first conducted an unbiased protein interaction screening.

We confirmed six of the proteins exhibiting the strongest signals by immunoblot analysis of GST-pull-down proteins using specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, interaction of NRL with DHX9, HNRNPU, or HNRNPUl1 remained robust even after incubation of the nuclear lysate with Benzonase, a promiscuous nuclease that digests all nucleic acid species, whereas HNRNPA1, HNRNPM, and HNRPA2B1 were not or barely pulled down after treatment, indicating a requirement of nucleic acids for the latter set of interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We also confirmed the interaction between NRL and several of the identified proteins by transfection of tagged constructs in HEK293 cells overexpressing human NRL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Notably, two of the RBPs (PRPF8 and SNRNP200) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escher et al., 2018</xref> have been implicated in photoreceptor degeneration and harbor substantial interactions in this subnetwork (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, black rectangle). We also noted that some RBPs in the network (DHX9, DDX5, DDX17, and DDX3X) are RNA helicases with prominent roles in the regulation of R-loops, which are non-B DNA structures comprising of RNA-DNA hybrids and displaced single-stranded DNA with multiple regulatory roles in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Wang, 2021</xref>). We then identified 67 high-confidence R-loop binding proteins from four independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cristini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mosler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) by determining shared proteins in their respective R-loop proteomes. Strikingly, 50% of NRL-interacting RBPs were also identified in this high-confidence R-loop protein group indicating a high enrichment of R-loop-associated RBPs among NRL interactors (Fisher’s exact test p = 2E−13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NRL interacts with the R-loop helicases DHX9 and DDX5 in rod photoreceptor nuclei</title><p>We further focused on the interaction of NRL with R-loop resolvases DHX9 (identified in all affinity purifications) and DDX5 (identified in endogenous NRL-pull downs from bovine and mouse retinas). DHX9 and DDX5 are shown to be present in the same protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Padmanabhan et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, immunofluorescence of mouse retina reveals the localization of DHX9 and DDX5 in the rod nuclear periphery, which corresponds to the euchromatin compartment of murine rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore studied DHX9 and DDX5 interaction with NRL in situ using a proximity ligation assay (PLA). In mouse retina, DHX9 is observed in all nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). PLAs using anti-NRL and DHX9 antibodies show robust positive interaction signal in the outer nuclear layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) where NRL is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, no signal above background is detectable when PLA is performed in <italic>Nrl</italic> KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting the specificity of PLA signals, even though DHX9 is still expressed throughout the KO retina nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). DDX5 also shows widespread expression throughout the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) but displays a lower yet specific interaction signal with NRL in the outer nuclear layer by PLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This signal is absent in <italic>Nrl</italic> KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar to mouse retina, DHX9 and DDX5 are detected in all nuclear layers of the human retina whereas NRL is present only in the outer nuclear layer of photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, G</xref>). Consistent with the results in mouse, NRL–DHX9 PLA signal is clearly detected in the outer nuclear layer of the human retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating a robust and reproducible interaction between NRL and DHX9. However, NRL-DDX5 PLA signals do not seem to be above negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>). To further ensure that the signal is specific for DHX9, negative controls using human retinas were performed with DHX9 antibodies in combination with Goat IgG. Some background is observed outside the nucleus and in the extracellular space, but no signal enrichment is detected in the photoreceptor nuclear layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, in HEK293 cells overexpressing human NRL, PLA signals are robust for both DHX9 and DDX5 throughout the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). DHX9 and HNRNPU serve as a positive control for PLA and are enriched mostly in the nuclear periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest a strong interaction between NRL and DHX9 throughout the nuclear compartment in the retina and that a transient and/or more regulated interaction of NRL with DDX5 may require additional protein partners.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DHX9 and DDX5 are expressed in retinal photoreceptors and interact with neural retina leucine (NRL) within the nuclear compartment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DHX9 (blue) and NRL (red) expression in adult mouse wild-type (WT) and <italic>Nrl</italic> Knockout (KO) retina.

We therefore performed co-IP experiments with antibodies against NRL, DHX9, and DDX5 with or without RNase A, RNase H, and DNase. IP using a DDX5 antibody failed to consistently pull down NRL from HEK293 and bovine retina extracts, suggesting that only a small pool of NRL is involved in this interaction, or their interaction is weak and transient. In HEK293 cells overexpressing NRL, the interaction of DHX9 and NRL is enhanced upon treatment of lysates with RNase A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C</xref>), indicating a negative regulation by RNA. We observed a similar phenomenon in reciprocal pull downs with DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D</xref>). On the other hand, treatment with RNase H, which digests RNA only in the DNA:RNA hybrid context, reduced NRL’s interaction with both DHX9 and DDX5 suggesting a positive impact of DNA:RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C</xref>). The reciprocal pull downs with DHX9 did not reveal this change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D</xref>) probably since NRL accounts for only a small part of DHX9 interactome. Pull down of DHX9 and DDX5 from bovine retina extract with endogenous NRL was not altered by RNase A treatment but was decreased upon removal of DNA:RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, G</xref>), suggesting a role of R-loops in regulating NRL interactions.

After incubations with mouse retinal nuclear lysates, NRL is enriched in R-loops along with DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A pool of NRL also binds to the RNase H-treated sample, possibly reflecting its ability to interact with genomic DNA sequences that may still be present in the pull down.

Remarkably, all four samples and all four RNAse H-treated samples clustered separately by their PC1 value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Principal component analysis (PCA)), which contributes to 58.12% of the variance whereas PC2 contributes to 16.26%, demonstrating the specificity of the assay. We identified 4677 R-loops in our ssDRIP-Seq data that were absent in RNase H-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>).

Our analysis uncovered 3352 loops without any strand specificity (hereafter referred as unstranded) and 1328 strand-specific R-loops (hereafter referred as stranded). Notably, the DRIP-Seq coverage was similar for both unstranded and stranded R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The identified R-loops intersected with different intergenic and genic regions and are overrepresented in intergenic and promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, stranded R-loops are also enriched at pseudogenes, whereas unstranded R-loops are only enriched at intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In agreement, stranded R-loops are preferentially observed around the transcription start site (TSS), but unstranded R-loops are further downstream of the transcription termination site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>We then studied whether certain genes/pathways display more R-loops in the retina.

We observed that stranded and unstranded R-loops displayed differences in their epigenetic signatures. Stranded R-loops harbor histone marks associated with active transcription including H3K36me3, H3K4me2, and H3k4me3. However, unstranded R-loops were only enriched with H3K9me3, associated with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Next, we investigated whether NRL binds to R-loops and found that NRL is enriched at both stranded an unstranded R-loops, suggesting a strong association of NRL to R-loops regardless of the epigenetic context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Notably, other chromatin-binding factors such as BRD4, CTCF, and Pol II were primarily associated with stranded R-loops. In addition, NRL binding was associated with a higher proportion of R-loops at low and high expression genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then looked specifically at the NRL-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Overall, NRL target genes have an enrichment of stranded R-loops at the promoter/TSS and unstranded R-loops on the gene body compared to all genes annotated in Ensembl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Select examples of genes displaying NRL occupancy and harboring stranded or unstranded R-loops are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>. R-loops can also overlap with proximal promoter or intergenic regions that do not show NRL binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Conversely, R-loops are undetectable in few highly expressed NRL-regulated genes such as <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, we studied whether R-loop formation is linked to the gene length. Curiously, the genes without any R-loop are shorter than those overlapping with R-loops, independently of their expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In genes showing low to mid-level expression, a concomitant formation of stranded and unstranded R-loops is associated with longer genes compared to the genes with stranded only or unstranded only R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate distinct associations between R-loop types, genomic features, and chromatin-binding factors including NRL, which could play a role in the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Neural retina leucine (NRL) is associated with different types of R-loops.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Metaplot of BRD4 (SRR4252658), CTCF (SRR4252685), NRL (Cut&amp;Run), and RNA pol II (SRR4252922) signals centered on stranded and unstranded R-loop peaks.

Several RBPs interact with chromatin and function as integrators of transcription and co-transcriptional RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). We currently have poor understanding of how ubiquitously expressed RBPs are recruited to specific genomic loci at defined locations and in distinct cell types. Here, we demonstrate the interaction of retinal rod photoreceptor-specific bZIP transcription factor NRL with multitude of RBPs that are associated with RNA splicing as well as resolution of R-loops, which form during the transcription process. Focusing specifically on two helicases – DHX9 and DDX5, we show that their interaction with NRL is dependent on specific nucleic acids, and in the case of DHX9 on R-loops. Notably, R-loops are not uniformly present in genes that are highly expressed in the retina but are detected in heterochromatin regions and in lowly expressed genes. Additionally, R-loops are enriched in genes encoding neuronal synaptic proteins. Our results suggest specific resolution and regulation of R-loops and provide insights into potential mechanisms by which RBPs and R-loops control transcriptional states in the retina.</p><p>Most R-loops are formed during transcription and play key roles in transcriptional initiation, elongation, and termination. R-loops are reportedly sufficient to initiate transcription of antisense lncRNA from enhancers and other genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan-Wong et al., 2019</xref>). R-loops also contribute to Pol II pausing at promoters and in gene bodies, thereby influencing transcriptional outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tous and Aguilera, 2007</xref>). Accumulation of R-loops at polyadenylation-dependent termination regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>) and R-loop-prone sequences downstream from poly A cleavage sites can cause transcriptional termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, R-loops may indirectly control gene expression by influencing chromatin structure and the epigenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we detect enrichment of R-loops at promoter and intergenic regions indicating their potential role in the modulation of distal and internal regulatory elements. We also demonstrate the presence of R-loops in genes irrespective of their expression levels but also linked to their length, suggesting that R-loops are contributors to the complex regulation of long genes.</p><p>We are intrigued by the enrichment of R-loops in neuronal genes associated with synaptic structure and function, including those involved in cell–cell communication. As R-loops are generated during transcription, their relatively stable detection at genes encoding several neuronal and retina-disease associated proteins indicates distinct transcriptional control mechanisms for different gene families. One plausible explanation is slower turn-over of RNA and requirement for smaller protein amounts. The greater likelihood of neuronal genes to harbor R-loops may also be because of their larger gene size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>). R-loops may also contribute to regulation of long neural genes as is the case for DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2016</xref>). Further investigations into R-loop formation and resolution at distinct genomic regions can offer mechanistic insights into gene regulation as well as non-coding variations relevant to disease.</p><p>Our results indicate that unstranded R-loops (containing RNA:DNA hybrids on both strands) are enriched in intergenic regions and occur downstream of genes, overlapping the repressive mark H3K9me3. This observation suggests that bidirectional transcription is associated with the formation of repressive genomic regions. Indeed, R-loops are also reported to be involved in maintenance of heterochromatin and telomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). The potential role of R-loops in maintaining a repressed chromatin state in the retina warrants further investigation. We note that R-loops near transcriptional termination sites have also been associated with the formation of repressive epigenetic marks and termination of transcription. For example, R-loops can induce antisense transcription at gene termination sequences, leading to the generation of double-stranded RNA and recruitment of G9a histone methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014</xref>). Bidirectional transcription termination by Pol II also offers a potential mechanism of termination at convergent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). R-loops localizing near H3K9me3 sites are shown to be associated with regulation of long genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manzo et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, NRL genomic occupancy overlaps with unstranded R-loops at the gene body, suggesting a functional link that may be unrelated to transcriptional initiation. Additional experiments are needed to understand the relationship between R-loops and repressive marks in postmitotic retinal neurons.</p><p>NRL regulates the transcriptional state of many rod-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The absolute requirement of NRL for rod photoreceptor cell fate determination and its continued high expression for functional maintenance of rods strongly indicate a multitude of roles of NRL beyond transcription initiation. Interactions of NRL with RBPs and R-loops are likely significant contributors to gene regulation. In particular, we note that NRL-interacting RNA helicases, DHX9 and DDX5, have a direct role in controlling R-loop resolution and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>), DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saha et al., 2022</xref>) and splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2018</xref>). The interaction of NRL with DHX9 is very robust in GST pull downs, in HEK293 cells, and in bovine retina, suggesting that NRL–DHX9 complexes might play key roles in rod photoreceptors. Curiously, the interaction of NRL with DDX5 is weaker, suggesting that it may be more regulated or context dependent. In agreement, DHX9 but not DDX5 is enriched in retinal R-loops. Removal of RNA in bovine retina did not weaken the interaction between NRL and both DHX9 and DDX5, indicating that RNA is not required for many NRL–RBP interactions. Thus, interaction of NRL with R-loop resolvases and with R-loops shown here in vitro through R-loop pull downs, and in vivo through DRIP-Seq, suggest that NRL contributes to R-loop regulation in retinal photoreceptors. Indeed, NRL-regulated genes are enriched for stranded R-loops at promoter regions and unstranded R-loops at gene bodies implying distinct modes of R-loop-mediated gene regulation. Notably, dynamics of R-loops is proposed to regulate somatic cell reprogramming that involves interaction of SOX2 with DDX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows a proposed model of NRL-mediated regulation of R-loops during gene expression in rod photoreceptors. Our studies thus provide an avenue to investigate the role of R-loops in retinal development and functional maintenance.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A putative model of R-loop regulation in retinal rod photoreceptors.</title><p>We hypothesize that neural retina leucine (NRL) guides R-loop resolvases such as DHX9 at photoreceptor genes to critically regulate gene expression.

Dysregulation of R-loops has been implicated in a variety of diseases including neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richard and Manley, 2017</xref>). Even during normal aging, aberrant transcription contributes to mis-splicing and increased R-loop formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jauregui-Lozano et al., 2022</xref>). As R-loops are low or absent at many key retina genes, failure of the mechanism that maintains these genes free of R-loops could contribute to retinal disease. Interestingly, monoallelic rare <italic>DHX9</italic> variants increase R-loop levels and are shown to be associated with neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calame et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, further investigation into NRL–DHX9 interaction with R-loops in the retinal photoreceptors could uncover mechanisms that maintain transcriptional homeostasis and genomic stability.</p><p>Transcription factors are reported to be involved in controlling alternate splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Based on our discovery of NRL’s interaction with splicing factors and R-loop binding proteins, we hypothesize a potential role of NRL in determining patterns and rates of splicing, which is prevalent in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zelinger and Swaroop, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellough et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keuthan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciampi et al., 2024</xref>). NRL–RBP interactions may also influence the rate of transcription elongation and/or termination and consequently transcript isoform diversity in rod photoreceptors. Notably, mutations in splicing factors as well as aberrant splicing of many genes have been associated with retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zelinger and Swaroop, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Zack, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buskin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results indicate that other RNA-dependent chromatin processes may be influenced by NRL–RBP complexes. Many of the identified RBPs participate in maintaining chromatin architecture and modifications and in DNA damage repair, and their functions require further exploration. Some of the candidate NRL–RBP interactors are not expressed in mature rods and may bind NRL only in in vitro assays, possibly due to harboring similar domains to NRL interactors. However, this dataset is valuable because several of these proteins could be expressed during development or upregulated in disease conditions. For instance, Elavl 1 is highly expressed in mature photoreceptor cells (counts per million [CPM] = 38), providing a likely explanation for the interaction of NRL with other Elavl proteins in vitro. Notably, Elavl 2, 3, and 4 are expressed during rod development at postnatal day 6 (P6) with CPM values of 4.5, 19, and 5, respectively, and their potential role in rod photoreceptors requires further investigation. Overall, we propose that RBPs play key roles in rod photoreceptors through their interactions with NRL. Future studies will aim at unraveling the physiological significance of NRL-interacting RBPs on R-loops and chromatin regulatory mechanisms in photoreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and husbandry</title><p>All procedures involving mice were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Eye Institute (NEI-ASP#650).

Mapped reads were split by strand using samtools. To confirm the quality of the experiment, a PCA was run on the 500 bp coverage scaled in R for all samples treated or not with RNAse-H, using R ggfortify package. R-loops calling was performed using MACS2. First, all R-loops (without regard of any strand specificity) were called on all reads, using the merged RNase H-treated samples as control dataset using MACS2 with the default parameters (narrow peaks) and the broad peaks option. R-loops found in at least three samples with a <italic>q</italic>-value ≤0.001 in the narrow call or in the broad call were merged. From this list of R-loops, strand specificity was assessed for each R-loop. To do so, peaks presenting signal enrichment from one strand over the other were called on reads split by strand, using the reads mapping the opposite strand as control dataset, similarly to the R-loops call. By intersecting the peaks presenting signal enrichment from one strand over the other and the total R-loops, we extracted the strand-specific R-loops and the unstranded R-loops. The annotation of R-loops, gene ontology analysis, and chromatin marks enrichment were computed using HOMER and plotted using R package ggplot2. Overlap between gene expression levels, R-loops and NRL peaks were computed using Bedtools.

This is a very relevant study highlighting the possible mechanism of gene expression regulation via interactions between TFs, RNA binding proteins, and R-loops. In that regard, it would be very interesting to uncover the biological relevance of such gene regulation.

Additionally, the Authors use multiple orthogonal techniques and tissue samples to reproduce and validate that NRL interacts with DHX9 and DDX5. Experiments also utilize specific assays to understand the influence of RNA and R-loops on protein-protein interactions. The Authors also use state-of-the-art techniques to profile R-loop localization within the retina and integrate multiple previously established datasets to correlate R-loop presence with transcription factor binding and chromatin marks an attempt to understand the significance of R-loops in the retina.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In general, the Authors provide interpretations of the data that fit a narrative about NRL and the perceived significance of interactions with RNA binding proteins. Large-scale screens for NRL protein interactions were conducted but all of the data is not reported. For example, NRL IP-Mass Spec was performed, but the authors only provide interaction/detection data for identified interactions with known RNA binding proteins. We cannot assess the enrichment of interactions or specificity of interactions with RNA binding proteins based on the reported results. Additionally, the lack of experiments testing the functional significance of Nrl interactions with R-loops within the developing retina fails to provide novel biological insights into the regulation of gene regulatory networks. While this provides additional avenues for research in the future, it is unclear that NRL interaction with R-loops have physiological relevance for photoreceptor health or function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103259.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Corso Diaz</surname><given-names>Ximena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xulong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Preston</surname><given-names>Kiam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tegshee</surname><given-names>Bilguun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>English</surname><given-names>Milton A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nellissery</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yadav</surname><given-names>Sharda Prasad</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marchal</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Swaroop</surname><given-names>Anand</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Eye Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bethesda</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Corso-Diaz et al, focus on the NRL transcription factor (TF), which is critical for retinal rod photoreceptor development and function.

This study also presents the first data on R-loop mapping in mammalian retinas and shows the enrichment of R-loops over intergenic regions as well as genes encoding neuronal function factors. While the research topic is very important, there is some concern regarding the data presented: there are substantial data supporting the interaction between NRL and DHX9, including pull-down experiments and proximity labeling assay (PLA), however, the data showing an interaction between NRL and DDX5, another R-loop-associated helicase, are inadequate. Importantly, the data supporting the claim that NRL interacts with R-loops are absolutely insufficient and at best, correlative. The next concerns are regarding the R-loop mapping data analysis and visualization.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There is compelling evidence that the NRL transcription factor interacts with several RNA binding proteins, and specifically, sufficient data supporting the interaction of NRL with DHX9 helicase.</p><p>A major strength is the use of the single-stranded R-loop mapping method in the mouse retina.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Figure S1A: There is a strong band in GST-IP (control IP) for either HNRNPUI1 or HNRNPU, although the authors state in their results that there is a strong interaction of these two RBPs with NRL.</p></disp-quote><p>Under our experimental conditions, most RNA-binding proteins displayed higher binding to glutathione beads (Fig. S1A). However, GST-NRL purifications showed much stronger signals for respective RBPs. In the case of HNRNPU and HNRNPUl1, white bands that are indicative of substrate depletion due to higher protein levels are observed in GST-NRL lanes. Additionally, in Figures 1B and 1C, there is a clear enrichment of HNRNPU and HNRNPUl1 above the background signal. We added this to the text. See page 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Both DHX9 and DDX5 samples have a faint band in the GST-IP.</p></disp-quote><p>RNA-binding proteins may display some background as observed in other studies (e.g. PMID: 32704541). We think that showing the raw data without decreasing the exposure time is useful and that there is a clear enrichment compared to controls. In addition, we tested the interaction in multiple systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is an extremely faint band for HNRNPA2B1 in the GST-NRL IP lane. Given this is a pull-down with added benzonase treatment to remove all nucleic acids, these data suggest, that previously observed NRL interactions with these particular RBPs are mediated via nucleic acids. Similarly, there is a loss of band signal for HNRNM in this assay, although it was identified as an NRL-interacting protein in three assays, which again suggests that nucleic acids mediate the interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. We mention in the manuscript that the interaction between HNRNPM and A1 depends on nucleic acids, as noted by the reviewer, since there is no obvious band after the pull-down. We have now added that the interaction of NRL with HNRNPA1B1 is likely dependent on nucleic acids as well, given its weak signal.

In Figure 2D, the PLA signal for DDX5-NRL is very weak in the adult mouse retina and is absent in the human retina, as shown in Figure 2H.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We think that the signal for DDX5 is weak, and we addressed this in the text. We noted on page 7: “Taken together, these findings suggest a strong interaction between NRL and DHX9 throughout the nuclear compartment in the retina and that a transient and/or more regulated interaction of NRL with DDX5 may require additional protein partners.” We have modified this sentence to add that the data also suggest transient interaction or the requirement of additional protein partners for stable interaction. See page 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that there is no NRL-KO available for the human PLA assay, the control experiments using single-protein antibodies should be included in the assay. Similarly, the single-protein antibody control PLA experiments should be included in the experimental data presented in Figure 2J.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We performed PLAs using both DHX9 and IgG in the human retina and observed no specific amplification signal. Some background is observed outside the nucleus and in the extracellular space. We added these results to the text and to the supplementary information. See page 7 and Fig.S2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The EMSA experiment using a probe containing NRL binding motif within the DHX9 promoter should include incubation with retina nuclear extracts depleted for NRL as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>In EMSA experiments, we used bovine retina to obtain enough protein quantities. As suggested by the reviewer, using NRL depleted extract would increase the specificity of observed gel shift and complement our pre-immune serum as a negative control. However, removal of all the NRL protein using the antibodies available was not feasible. In the future, we will use enough mice to obtain large quantities of protein for this experiment and will collect retinas from Nrl knockout as negative control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There is a reduced amount of DHX9 pulled down in NRL-IP in HEK293 cells, but there is no statistically significant difference in the reciprocal IP (DHX9-IP and blotting for NRL) (Figure 4C).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer is referring to the data in Figure 4C showing that RNase H treatment led to significantly reduced pulldown of DHX9 as compared to control, but the reciprocal IP in Figure 4D showed no statistical significance between control and RNase H treatment. In Figure 4D, we hypothesize that NRL may account for only a small proportion of DHX9’s interactome, so the change in NRL levels could not be detected due to the sensitivity of our assay. DHX9 likely constitutes a large proportion of NRL’s interactome in HEK293 cells, hence the change in DHX9 level was more obvious when pulling down with NRL. We added this information to the results. See page 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The only data supporting the claim that NRL interacts with R-loops are presented in Figure 5A.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional evidence that NRL interacts with R-loops comes from DRIP-Seq experiments where signals from R-loops overlap with NRL ChIP-Seq signals (Figure 7A). This shows that R-loops and NRL co-occur on multiple genomic regions. In addition, indirect evidence of NRL and R-loops’ interaction is shown in pull down experiments and PLA assays where R-loops influence DHX9 and NRL binding. We clarified this in the discussion. See page 14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a co-IP of R-loops and then blotting for NRL, DHX9, and DDX5. Here, there is no signal for DDX5, quantification of DHX9 signal shows no statistically significant difference between RNase H treated and untreated samples, while NRL shows a signal in RNase H treated sample. These data are not sufficient to make the statement regarding the interaction of NRL with R-loops.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We respectfully disagree as we observe statistically significant enrichment for both NRL and DHX9 in these experiments (See Fig5A). Some NRL continues to bind to DNA that is pulled down nonspecifically, which may be expected since NRL is a transcription factor. See for example R-loop binding by the transcription factor Sox2 (PMID: 32704541). However, binding to R-loops is evidenced by an enrichment compared to RNase H-treated sample. We clarified this in Results section (See page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Regarding R-loop mapping, the data analysis is quite confusing. The authors perform two different types of analyses: either overall narrow and broad peak analysis or strand-specific analysis. Given that the authors used ssDRIP-seq, which is a method designed to map R-loops strand specifically, it is confusing to perform different types of analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. This has enhanced the clarity of the methods and enriched the discussion. We aimed to identify R-loops as accurately as possible. We conducted two types of analyses to capture different aspects of R-loops: one that looks at overall patterns (narrow and broad peaks) and another that focuses on specific strands of DNA.</p><p>Using ssDRIP-seq, which is designed to map R-loops on specific strands, allowed us to examine R-loops formed in only one strand and those formed on both strands. To identify strand-specific R-loops, we filtered our RNase-H enriched peaks for those enriched on one strand compared to the opposite strand. We clarified the analysis in the results section, and Figure 6B. See page 10 and methods section page 25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, the peak analysis is usually performed based on the RNase H treated R-loop mapping; what does it mean then to have a pool of &quot;Not R-loops&quot;, see Figure 6B?</p></disp-quote><p>The “Not R-loop” group refers to peaks called using the opposite strand that are not observed when calling peaks using RNase H as control. We modified this figure for clarity (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In that regard, what does the term &quot;unstranded&quot; R-loops mean? Based on the authors' definition, these are R-loops that do not fall within the group of strand-specific R-loops. The authors should explain the reasons behind these types of analyses and explain, what the biological relevance of these different types of R-loops is.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helping us clarify this point. Unstranded R-loops are DNA regions containing DNA:RNA hybrids on both plus and minus strands and possibly representing bidirectional transcription by Pol II. We observed that unstranded R-loops are enriched only in intergenic regions, H3K9me3 regions, and downstream of the transcriptional termination site (TTS). We added to the discussion the possible implications of these enrichments, including regulation of Pol II termination and transcription of long genes. See Page 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It would be more useful to show the percent distribution of R-loops over the different genomic regions, instead of showing p-value enrichment, see Figure 6C.</p></disp-quote><p>Since most of the genome is non-coding, plotting the distribution as a proportion was not informative since the vast proportion of the data falls in intergenic regions. However, we created a new figure showing observed vs. expected ratio that seems to be more informative and moved the current p-value figure to the supplement in revised version. See Figure 6C and S6D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Based on the model presented, NRL regulates R-loop biology via interaction with RBPs, such as DHX9, a known R-loop resolution helicase. Given that the gene targets of NRL TF are known, it would be useful to then analyze the R-loop mapping data across this gene set.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We performed an analysis of R-loops on NRL-regulated genes. Interestingly, NRL target genes have an enrichment of stranded R-loops at the promoter/TSS and unstranded R-loops on the gene body compared to all Ensembl genes (Figure S7B). We added a table containing all NRL-regulated genes we used for this analysis (table S5) and a figure showing this result (Fig. S7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors utilize biochemical approaches to determine and validate NRL protein-protein interactions to further understand the mechanisms by which the NRL transcription factor controls rod photoreceptor gene regulatory networks. Observations that NRL displays numerous protein-protein interactions with RNA-binding proteins, many of which are involved in R-loop biology, led the authors to investigate the role of RNA and R-loops in mediating protein-protein interactions and profile the co-localization of R-loops with NRL genomic occupancy.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written, providing succinct explanations of the observed results and potential implications. Additionally, the authors use multiple orthogonal techniques and tissue samples to reproduce and validate that NRL interacts with DHX9 and DDX5. Experiments also utilize specific assays to understand the influence of RNA and R-loops on protein-protein interactions. The authors also use state-of-the-art techniques to profile R-loop localization within the retina and integrate multiple previously established datasets to correlate R-loop presence with transcription factor binding and chromatin marks in an attempt to understand the significance of R-loops in the retina.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In general, the authors provide superficial interpretations of the data that fit a narrative but fail to provide alternative explanations or address caveats of the results. Specifically, many bands are present in interaction studies either in control lanes (GST controls) of Westerns or large amounts of background in PLA experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional information to the text regarding the presence of background signals in pull downs. We wish to note that experimental samples always exceeded background signals. We believe that reporting these raw findings (rather than showing shorter exposures) is valuable for the scientific community. We did not observe any background in the proximity ligation assay (PLA) that exceeded what is typically expected, and the signals were clearly discernible. Cases where signals are weaker, such as with DDX5, have been highlighted. In addition, we added a DHX9-IgG negative control for the human PLA experiment. See page 5 and Fig. S2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the lack of experiments testing the functional significance of Nrl interactions or R-loops within the developing retina fails to provide novel biological insights into the regulation of gene regulatory networks other than, 'This could be a potentially important new mechanism'.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that functional experiments are necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms behind R-loop regulation in the retina; however, we believe it goes beyond the scope of this initial characterization (as this is the first report on R-loops in the retina). We are currently pursuing these studies.</p><p>We performed new analysis on NRL-regulated genes as suggested by reviewer 1. We show that NRL target genes have an enrichment of stranded R-loops at the promoter/TSS and unstranded R-loops on the gene body compared to all Ensembl genes (Figure S7B), providing further evidence of the functional interaction between NRL and R-loops. See table S5 and Fig. S7B, and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors test the necessity of RNA for NRL/DHX9 interactions but don't show RNA binding of NRL or DHX9 or the sufficiency of RNA to interfere/mediate protein-protein interactions. Recent work has highlighted the prevalence of RNA binding by transcription factors through Arginine Rich Motifs that are located near the DNA binding domains of transcription factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the role of RNA in these complexes is very exciting, and we are currently pursuing these studies.

RNA-binding proteins can have more background as observed in other studies (e.g. PMID: 32704541) but there is always a higher signal in experimental samples compared to controls. While we agree that we can enhance the conditions for immunoprecipitation (IP) by optimizing washing buffers, exposure and other parameters, we believe the current methods tell the story. We have added additional text explaining this. See page 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Use of the term 'Strongest' interaction - IPs don't directly address the strength of interaction, but depend on levels of expression AND affinity. The strength of interaction should be tested using techniques like an OCTET or SPR assay. One can also quantify the effect that RNA would have in such an assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We replaced the term 'stronger' with “higher signal” and “robust” at most places. The source of protein lysates is the same for experiments and controls, thus the amount of protein is consistent in both conditions, and not dependent on level of gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In supplemental tables, please use the proper gene names, not the UniProt peptide name. For example, there are no genes named ELAV1-ELAV4. These should be ELAVL1-ELAVL4. A short glance identifies &gt;10 gene name errors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We updated current gene names in all tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please provide the rationale for the choice of DNA sequence for the DHX9 nucleotide sequence used for EMSA assays. In the human DHX9 locus, the NRL ChIP-seq peak looks to be contained in Intron1 whereas the NRL ChIP-seq peak in mouse DHX9 looks to be in the proximal upstream promoter. Did the authors choose an evolutionarily conserved sequence in the promoter region that contained the NRL motif or does the probe sequence arise from the sequence that has known NRL binding as assayed by NRL ChIP-seq? A zoomed-in image of the NRL ChIP-seq pile-ups in the DHX9 locus in each species would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. The probe was chosen by scanning for NRL binding motifs on the Chip-Seq peak at the human DHX9 promoter. We added a Zoom-in image of the ChIP-Seq or CUT&amp;RUN reads for NRL on both human and mouse retinas. Figure 3D shows NRL binding in both species in regions containing the homologous motif. The sequence is partially conserved and shown in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Normalization in RNaseH/RNaseA Co-IP experiments. Why does RNAseH treatment result in increased NRL IP (increased NRL expression?) or does RNaseA treatment cause reduced IP of DHX9? These differences seem to cause a 'denominator' effect, leading the Authors to conclude decreased co-IP of DHX9 with NRL when R-loops are inhibited or increased co-IP of NRL with DHX9 when RNA is degraded. An alternate interpretation would be that inhibiting the R-loop binding of NRL unmasks the epitope for antibody recognition. The authors should test NRL binding to RNA and determine if RNA binding affects the co-IP of NRL with DHX9.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that removing total RNA by RNase A or R-loops by RNase H may alter the accessibility of our antibodies to the epitopes, resulting in the differences in the level of total protein pulled down. However, we quantified the relative level of the associating protein to the total protein and confirmed, in reciprocal assays, that RNase A treatment led to increased interaction between NRL and DHX9. However, the quantification was not consistent between the reciprocal IPs upon RNase H treatment. We reason that in Figure 4D, as NRL may account for only a small proportion of DHX9’s interactome, the change in NRL level could not be detected due to the sensitivity of our assay. However reciprocally, DHX9 can constitute a larger proportion of NRL’s interactome in HEK293 cells, hence the change in DHX9 level was more obvious. We added this information to the text. See page 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 7 - Malat1 - there doesn't seem to be an overlap of NRL with Stranded R-loop peaks in this image. Nrl seems to flank the region of R-loops.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed Malat1 for Mplkip that shows a direct overlap of Nrl binding and R-loops. See Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Results end with 'A Model'. Seems like some concluding remarks and references to Figure 8 were mistakenly left out.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this typo. We removed the misplaced text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Model and Discussion - authors should show raw data for RHO with respect to NRL binding and R-loops. No evidence was provided regarding R-loops (or lack thereof) in the Rhodopsin locus. Additionally, conclusions stating that &quot;R-loops... are specifically depleted from genes, such as Rhodopsin, with high expression levels&quot; go against Figures 7B and 7C. Malat1 is one of the highest expressed genes in the retina and contains R-loops.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for helping us clarify our hypothesis. We added a genome browser view of Rhodopsin showing the absence of R-loops (Fig. S8). We hypothesize that R-loops could interfere with achieving higher rates of transcription, however we did not mean to say that all high expressed genes lack R-loops. We have rephrased the discussion to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Neuronal genes, particularly those involved in synaptic transmission are known to be, on average, longer than most genes (Gabel, 2015; PMID: 25762136). Is it possible that R-loops are detected at genes involved in synaptic function/structure solely because of transcript length, as it takes longer for transcription termination to resolve in genes that are longer? A plot showing R-loop enrichment and transcript length would address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a plot showing gene length in relation to R-loops and expression levels. We observed that R-loops are more common over long genes regardless of their expression levels. We also observed that the concomitant presence of stranded and unstranded R-loops is restricted to the longest genes in most cases. We added this to Figure 7D.</p></body></sub-article></article>
