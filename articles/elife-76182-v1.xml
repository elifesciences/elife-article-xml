However, the genetic basis of these associations is often unclear. The proteobacterium <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> is a widely distributed gut symbiont of honey bees. It colonizes a specific niche in the hindgut and causes a characteristic melanization response. Genetic determinants required for the establishment of this association, or its relevance for the host, are unknown. Here, we independently isolated three point mutations in genes encoding the DNA-binding protein integration host factor (IHF) in <italic>F. perrara</italic>. These mutants abolished the production of an aryl polyene metabolite causing the yellow colony morphotype of <italic>F. perrara</italic>. Inoculation of microbiota-free bees with one of the mutants drastically decreased gut colonization of <italic>F. perrara</italic>. Using RNAseq, we found that IHF affects the expression of potential colonization factors, including genes for adhesion (type 4 pili), interbacterial competition (type 6 secretion systems), and secondary metabolite production (colibactin and aryl polyene biosynthesis). Gene deletions of these components revealed different colonization defects depending on the presence of other bee gut bacteria. Interestingly, one of the T6SS mutants did not induce the scab phenotype anymore despite colonizing at high levels, suggesting an unexpected role in bacteria-host interaction. IHF is conserved across many bacteria and may also regulate host colonization in other animal symbionts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>A. mellifera</italic></kwd><kwd>gut symbiont</kwd><kwd>gut colonization</kwd><kwd>aryl polyene</kwd><kwd>type 6 secretion</kwd><kwd>integration host factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Théodora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_179487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name><name><surname>El Chazli</surname><given-names>Yassine</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Konstantin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_160345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name><name><surname>Emery</surname><given-names>Olivier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>742739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leopold-Messer</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Piel</surname><given-names>Joern</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51NF40_180575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Philipp</given-names></name><name><surname>Santos-Matos</surname><given-names>Gonçalo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genes for adhesion, interbacterial competition, and secondary metabolite production are important colonization factors of the honey bee gut symbiont <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> and are regulated by the conserved histone-like DNA-binding protein integration host factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The digestive tract of many animals is colonized by specialized gut symbionts that occupy distinct physical niches and utilize diverse nutrients. Owing to the availability of genetic tools, gnotobiotic animal models, and multi-omics approaches, we can now study the genetic features that allow gut symbionts to colonize various animal hosts, including mammals, fishes, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Townsend et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Townsend et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakajima et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohbayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kikuchi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The Western honey bee, <italic>Apis mellifera,</italic> is a particularly interesting model to characterize colonization factors of bacterial gut symbionts due to its agricultural importance and the tractability of its gut microbiota. Honey bees harbor relatively simple yet highly specialized gut microbiota composed of 8–10 bacterial genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwong and Moran, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonilla-Rosso and Engel, 2018</xref>). The wide distribution of these communities across social bees suggests long evolutionary associations with the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwong et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, different members of the bee microbiota colonize distinct physical niches along the gut. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria predominate in the posterior hindgut (rectum), while Gammaproteobacteria (<italic>Frischella perrara</italic> and <italic>Gilliamella</italic> species) and a Betaproteobacterium (<italic>Snodgrassella alvi</italic>) preferentially colonize the anterior hindgut (ileum and adjacent pylorus, i.e., the transition zone between midgut and ileum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwong and Moran, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powell et al., 2014</xref>). The partitioning of these bacteria into distinct gut compartments suggests the existence of specific bacterial and/or host mechanisms that facilitate colonization.</p><p>Most bacteria of the bee gut microbiota can be cultured and experiments with gnotobiotic bees have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emery et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raymann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brochet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kešnerová et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, genomic analyses have provided important insights about the functional potential of bee gut symbionts and their adaptation to the gut environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brochet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellegaard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellegaard and Engel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ludvigsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, little is known about which genes are directly involved in establishing colonization in the bee gut and how these genes are regulated. The only symbiont that has been extensively studied in this respect is <italic>S. alvi</italic>. Using transposon sequencing and transcriptome analysis, Powell et al. determined genome-wide host colonization factors in <italic>S. alvi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2016a</xref>). Most genes with strong fitness effects were found to belong to three major categories: extracellular interactions, metabolism, and stress response. In particular, genes for attachment and biofilm formation were highly beneficial for colonization, which is in agreement with the observation that this gut symbiont adheres to the host epithelium of the ileum and forms a multispecies biofilm with <italic>Gilliamella</italic>.</p><p>The honey bee gut symbiont <italic>F. perrara</italic> belongs to the recently described family Orbaceae within the Gammaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Volkmann et al., 2010</xref>). It is taxonomically close to the bee gut symbiont <italic>Gilliamella</italic> and has a similar metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 2013</xref>). However, compared to the other members of the bee gut microbiota<italic>, F. perrara</italic> shows a rather distinctive colonization phenotype. While <italic>S. alvi</italic> and <italic>Gilliamella</italic> have been reported to colonize the host epithelium of the entire ileum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leonard et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>F. perrara</italic> preferentially colonizes the transition zone between the midgut and the ileum, that is, the pylorus. Moreover, colonization with <italic>F. perrara</italic> leads to the appearance of a brown to black material on the luminal side of the epithelial surface between the cuticle layer of the host tissue and the adherent <italic>F. perrara</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2015a</xref>). This so-called scab phenotype forms after 5–7 d post-colonization and has so far not been reported to be triggered by any other gut symbiont than <italic>F. perrara</italic>. Transcriptome analysis of the host showed that <italic>F. perrara</italic> elicits a specific immune response that includes the upregulation of the host melanization pathway likely responsible for the formation of the scab phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emery et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>F. perrara</italic> is highly prevalent across worker bees and colonies of <italic>A. mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kešnerová et al., 2020</xref>), and related bacteria have also been found in <italic>Apis cerana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolter et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, between 25 and 80% of all worker bees of a colony harbor a visible scab phenotype in the pylorus region of the gut, which has been shown to strongly correlate with a high abundance of <italic>F. perrara</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2015a</xref>). However, the impact of these phenotype on the host has remained elusive.</p><p>Genome sequencing of the type strain of <italic>F. perrara</italic> and comparison with other genomes of the Orbaceae family revealed the presence of several genomic islands that may be involved in the specific interaction of <italic>F. perrara</italic> with the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engel et al., 2015b</xref>). These include a biosynthetic gene cluster for the production of the genotoxic metabolite colibactin (Clb), two distinct type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) and associated effector proteins, type I secretion systems, and fimbrial low-molecular-weight protein (Flp) pili genes. However, currently no genetic tools are available for <italic>F. perrara</italic> precluding studies about the role of these genetic factors in gut colonization or the induction of the scab phenotype.</p><p>Here, we report the isolation of a spontaneous mutant of <italic>F. perrara</italic> that possesses a strong colonization defect in vivo. Resequencing of the mutant revealed a single nonsynonymous point mutation in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the DNA-binding protein integration host factor (IHF). Using a combination of gnotobiotic bee experiments, transcriptomics, and metabolite analyses, we characterized the genes regulated by IHF. We then established a gene-deletion strategy for <italic>F. perrara,</italic> which allowed us to knock out some of the IHF-regulated genes and show that they impact gut colonization and scab development to different extent in the presence and absence of a complex community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolation of spontaneous IHF mutants affecting growth and colony morphology of <italic>F. perrara</italic></title><p>Culturing <italic>F. perrara</italic> type strain PEB0191 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 2013</xref>) on modified tryptone yeast glucose (mTYG) agar resulted in the formation of yellow colonies. However, we occasionally observed the appearance of larger white colonies among the yellow ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Restreaking white colonies on fresh mTYG agar usually resulted in yellow colonies again. However, three white colonies that we identified in independent experiments did not change their appearance anymore, suggesting that we had isolated stable ‘white’ variants of <italic>F. perrara</italic> PEB0191 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Genome sequencing of the white variants revealed the presence of three different non-synonymous point mutations in the genes encoding the IHF. IHF is a widely distributed DNA-binding protein consisting of the IhfA/B heterocomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freundlich et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goosen and van de Putte, 1995</xref>). Strikingly, two point mutations were identical to each other, but occurred in the different subunits of IHF (<italic>ihfA</italic> and <italic>ihfB</italic>), resulting in a proline to lysine change at amino acid positions 82 and 83, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The third point mutation resulted in a lysine to serine change at position 38 of IhfA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Homology modeling showed that these amino acids are located in the region interacting with DNA, suggesting that the three mutations impact the DNA-binding properties of IHF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rice et al., 1996</xref>). As two of the isolated mutants occurred when generating gene deletions of <italic>F. perrara,</italic> they harbored additional genetic modifications (see ‘Materials and methods’). Therefore, we focused further characterization of IHF on the mutation Pro83Lys (hereafter <italic>ihfA*</italic>) that occurred in the wild type (wt) background of <italic>F. perrara</italic> PEB0191. While the <italic>ihfA*</italic> strain consistently formed larger colonies than the wt strain on mTYG agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), there was no significant difference in growth in liquid culture (permutation test, p=0.097; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, light microscopy showed that cells of the mutant strain were on average slightly longer than cells of the wt (Kolgomorov–Smirnov test p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isolation of a spontaneous <italic>ihfA</italic>* mutant of <italic>F.</italic> <italic>perrara</italic> displaying an altered colony morphotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Colonies of <italic>F. perrara</italic> PEB0191 (wt) after 48 hr of growth on modified tryptone yeast glucose (mTYG) agar.

There was a considerable overlap of the differentially regulated genes between the two time points (115 and 80 shared up- and downregulated genes, respectively). At both time points, the COG category ‘Carbohydrate transport and metabolism’ (COG G) was significantly enriched among the genes upregulated in vivo relative to the entire genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). In addition, at time point day 10, also the COG category (P) ‘Inorganic ion transport and metabolism’ was enriched (P adj&lt;0.01, Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Genes belonging to these two categories encoded transporters for different sugars (Phosphotransferase systems), iron, and transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). In addition, a catalase gene and several genes for the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan were upregulated at both time points. However, only 14 and 19 genes of those upregulated in vitro in the wt relative to the <italic>ihfA*</italic> mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) were also upregulated in vivo at day 5 and day 10 post-colonization, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). This was expected because the in vitro RNAseq analysis had shown that these genes are already expressed in the wt when grown on mTYG agar, which we used as a reference condition for the in vivo analysis. Indeed, when comparing count-normalized gene expression (as measured by transcripts per million [TPM]) across the different conditions, we found that most of the T6SS machinery, APE biosynthesis, pilus, and iron uptake genes were expressed at both time points in vivo, and to similar levels as in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This allowed us to create six different non-polar in-frame gene-deletion mutants of potential colonization factors regulated by IHF (Key Resources Table). We deleted an essential gene of the colibactin biosynthesis pathway (Δ<italic>clbB</italic>), both <italic>hcp</italic> genes of the two T6SSs, either separately or as double mutant (Δ<italic>hcp1,</italic> Δ<italic>hcp2,</italic> and Δ<italic>hcp1</italic>/Δ<italic>hcp2</italic>), the gene encoding the major Flp pili subunit (Δ<italic>pilE</italic>)<italic>,</italic> and the entire APE biosynthesis gene cluster (Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic>). Deletion mutants were confirmed by genome resequencing. The Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic> mutant was the only strain not forming yellow colonies anymore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that the aryl polyene pathway is responsible for the yellow color. We measured the growth of the gene-deletion mutants in vitro, which was similar to the wt and <italic>ihfA*</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, no significant differences were observed in cell length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, we corresponded OD<sub>600</sub> to CFU counts and found that both the Δ<italic>hcp1</italic>/Δ<italic>hcp2</italic> and Δ<italic>pilE</italic> strains had lower counts than the wt strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). To compare the six gene-deletion strains to <italic>F. perrara</italic> wt and the <italic>ihfA*</italic> mutant in terms of gut colonization and induction of the scab phenotype, each strain was inoculated into microbiota-free bees and CFUs assessed in the pylorus/ileum region 10 d post inoculation. As expected, the wt successfully colonized the pylorus/ileum region of all analyzed gnotobiotic bees (median = 9.56 * 10<sup>6</sup> ± 5.06 * 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs per gut; n = 18 bees, two independent experiments) and induced the scab phenotype in 16 of 18 bees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>ihfA*</italic> colonized poorly compared to the wt (median = 1.46 * 10<sup>4</sup> ± 3.19 * 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs per gut, n = 20 bees, Wilcoxon rank-sum test p&lt;0.001), and not a single bee developed the scab phenotype. Of the six tested gene-deletion mutants, only the mutant of T6SS-1 (Δ<italic>hcp1</italic>) reached wt colonization levels and also induced the scab phenotype in most of the bees (15 out of 20). The other five mutants all exhibited lower colonization levels than the wt strain. However, the severity of the colonization defect varied between the mutants, and while some of the mutants still caused the scab phenotype, others did not. For example, the Clb biosynthesis gene cluster mutant Δ<italic>clbB</italic> induced the scab phenotype in all but one bee, despite the fact that the colonization levels were about twofold lower than for the wt (median = 4.24 * 10<sup>6</sup> ± 2.87 * 10<sup>6</sup> CFUs per gut). The gene-deletion mutant of the T6SS-2 (Δ<italic>hcp2</italic>) and the double mutant of both T6SSs (Δ<italic>hcp1</italic>/Δ<italic>hcp2</italic>) reached similar colonization levels as the Δ<italic>clbB</italic> mutant. Yet, none of the bees colonized with these two mutants developed the scab phenotype not even those that had very high bacterial counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The deletion mutant of the APE biosynthesis pathway (Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic>) showed again a different colonization phenotype: for some bees no colonization was detected, while others showed similar colonization levels as the wt of <italic>F. perrara</italic>. However, in contrast to the Δ<italic>hcp2</italic> and the Δ<italic>hcp1</italic>/Δ<italic>hcp2</italic> mutants, the Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic> mutant still induced the scab phenotype, but only in the bees that had high bacterial loads. Finally, the Δ<italic>pilE</italic> mutant had the strongest impact on colonization. Only 5 out of 20 bees had detectable levels of <italic>F. perrara</italic> in the gut (limit of detection: 75 CFUs per gut) and none of the bees developed the scab phenotype.

Our results advance the understanding of the genetic factors that facilitate symbionts to colonize niches in the animal gut. Specifically, we find that the DNA-binding protein IhfA plays an important role in gut colonization. IhfA is a histone-like, nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) that forms a heterodimer together with IhfB. IHF binds to and bends DNA in a sequence-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freundlich et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goosen and van de Putte, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rice et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zulianello et al., 1995</xref>), thereby facilitating the recombination of mobile DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freundlich et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goosen and van de Putte, 1995</xref>) and influencing gene expression. We identified three different mutations in IHF, all located in the region of the protein interacting with the DNA. All three IHF mutants formed larger colonies than the wt strain on mTYG agar. Together, this suggests that the identified mutations change the DNA-binding properties of IHF, resulting in broad transcriptional changes in <italic>F. perrara</italic> that provide a growth advantage in vitro relative to the wt strain.</p><p><italic>F. perrara</italic> colonizes the epithelial surface of the pylorus, where it adheres to the cuticular lining and forms a thick biofilm-like layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2015a</xref>). IHF has been shown to bind to extracellular DNA, which in the case of the human pathogen <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> increases biofilm stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jurcisek et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that IHF has a direct impact on gut colonization of <italic>F. perrara</italic> by stabilizing the biofilm formed on the host epithelium. However, based on our gene expression data and the results of the gene-deletion experiments, it seems more likely that IHF influences gut colonization by regulating downstream genes involved in host interaction. Several of the genes regulated by IHF are known to play important roles in the adhesion to surfaces or the formation of biofilms. For example, pili are key factors for adhesion across many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Utada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tomich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shime-Hattori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craig et al., 2004</xref>) and have already been shown in the case of the bee gut symbiont <italic>S. alvi</italic> to be beneficial for gut colonization and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell et al., 2016a</xref>). In agreement with these previous results, several of the deletion mutants of IHF-regulated genes showed colonization defects in our gnotobiotic bee experiments corroborating that IHF impacts gut colonization through its effect on gene expression rather than through a direct role in biofilm formation.</p><p>The pili mutant (Δ<italic>pilE</italic>) had the strongest colonization defect of the tested gene-deletion strains, likely because pili mediate the adhesion to the host epithelium, and therefore allow <italic>F. perrara</italic> to persist and replicate in the pylorus/ileum region of the honey bee gut. The deletion mutant of the APE biosynthesis pathway (Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic>) also showed a clear colonization defect. However, while some of the bees inoculated with this mutant had no detectable levels of <italic>F. perrara</italic> in the gut, others reached similar levels as bees colonized with the wt strain and also developed the scab phenotype. Aryl polyenes can protect bacteria from reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schöner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnston et al., 2021</xref>), which are produced by insects as part of the host immune response in the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuraishi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ha et al., 2005</xref>). Our time-course experiment revealed that in the first few days of colonization the bacterial numbers of <italic>F. perrara</italic> in the gut are much lower than in the initial inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the bacteria experience a significant population bottleneck at the beginning of the colonization process. It is possible that the Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic> mutant is impaired in its ability to resist reactive oxygen species (or other physicochemical stressors) when passing through the anterior sections of the honey bee gut and therefore reaches its niche in the pylorus in only a fraction of the inoculated bees. These stressors may be even more active in the presence of a complex community, which could explain the even lower colonization success of Δ<italic>apeA-R</italic> in the presence of the BeeComm_002. However, APEs have also been implicated in other functions such as biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Johnston et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, future studies will be needed to elucidate how the APE biosynthetic pathway of <italic>F. perrara</italic> impacts honey bee gut colonization. Given the widespread occurrence of these biosynthetic genes throughout different bacteria, this might help to understand their role in host colonization in a much wider context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cimermancic et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A somewhat unexpected result of our mutant analysis was that the deletion of one of the genes encoding an essential NRPS/PKS enzyme (ClbB) of the Clb biosynthetic gene cluster did not affect scab development and had only a weak impact on gut colonization (twofold lower levels than wt). Studies on <italic>E. coli</italic> have shown that the Clb biosynthesis pathway induces DNA damage in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nougayrède et al., 2006</xref>) and contributes to tumorigenesis in the mammalian gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuevas-Ramos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously shown that <italic>F. perrara</italic> also induces DNA damage in eukaryotic cells and that this is dependent on a functional Clb biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engel et al., 2015b</xref>). Therefore, we had speculated that the genotoxic activity of colibactin may trigger the local melanization response and the development of the scab phenotype upon colonization with <italic>F. perrara</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emery et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engel et al., 2015a</xref>). However, the results presented here show that colibactin is not causing the scab phenotype. Therefore, other characteristics of <italic>F. perrara</italic> must explain why this bacterium causes the scab phenotype.</p><p>Usually, bees that have &lt;10<sup>6</sup> bacteria in the gut do not develop visible scab at day 10 post colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), which suggests that a certain number of bacteria is needed to elicit this characteristic host response. On the contrary, not all bees with high levels of colonization developed a scab phenotype, indicating that high loads are necessary but not sufficient to trigger the development of a visible scab phenotype. Specifically, the <italic>Δhcp2</italic> mutant of T6SS-2 and the <italic>Δhcp1</italic>/<italic>Δhcp2</italic> double mutant of T6SS-1 and T6SS-2 both reached relatively high colonization levels, yet not a single bee developed the scab phenotype. T6SS are usually involved in interbacterial warfare by injecting toxins into neighboring bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mougous et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coyne and Comstock, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coulthurst, 2019</xref>). However, there is an increasing number of studies showing that certain T6SS effectors can also target eukaryotic cells and modify diverse eukaryotic processes, including adhesion modification, stimulating internalization, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and evasion of host innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monjarás Feria and Valvano, 2020</xref>). While <italic>F. perrara</italic> is not the only bee gut symbiont harboring T6SS, the effector protein repertoires differ tremendously between different species and even strains of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steele and Moran, 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that some of the effector proteins of <italic>F. perrara</italic> may target the host rather than other bacteria eliciting the melanization response and scab phenotype in the bee gut. Additionally, both the <italic>Δhcp2</italic> and the <italic>Δhcp</italic> double mutant had increased colonization defects in the presence of the BeeComm_002. This raises the hypothesis that the T6SS-2 may be important for <italic>F. perrara</italic> to interact with other gut symbionts, namely bacteria of the genera <italic>Snodgrassella</italic> and <italic>Gilliamella</italic> that also colonize the pylorus. It is important to mention that our experimental design favored <italic>F. perrara</italic> over the individual members of the BeeComm_002 as, in the inoculum fed to the bees, <italic>F. perrara</italic> was 13 times more abundant than any member of the defined community. It is likely that a stronger colonization defect would be observed if the proportions of <italic>F. perrara</italic> to other community members were more even. In any case, the presence of the BeeComm_002 led to a reduction in the number of bees colonized by most <italic>F. perrara</italic> strains, but not for the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is particularly interesting in the case of the <italic>Δhcp1</italic> and <italic>ΔclbB</italic> mutants, suggesting a possible role for these genes in the presence of other symbionts.</p><p>We did not carry out a genome-wide screen for host colonization factors and only generated deletion mutants of a few of the IHF-regulated genes. Thus, there are probably many other factors that also contribute to gut colonization. For example, our in vivo RNAseq experiment indicated that metabolic genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, sugar transport, and iron uptake are upregulated during gut colonization. This is in line with the TnSeq screen performed in <italic>S. alvi,</italic> which revealed that genes of essential amino acid biosynthesis pathways and iron uptake are important colonization factors of the honey bee gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Powell et al., 2016b</xref>). It is, however, remarkable that <italic>F. perrara</italic> only upregulates the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway, which suggest a specific demand for the production of this specific amino acid during gut colonization.</p><p>While our study revealed that IHF is important for regulating host colonization factors in the honey bee gut, it remains to be elucidated whether IHF is a direct regulator of the identified genes. In <italic>Vibrio fluvialis</italic>, IHF binding sites were identified upstream of several T6SS gene clusters, indicating that direct transcriptional regulation of similar genes by IHF exists in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, IHF may act upstream of another regulator that controls the expression of the identified genes. In the plant pathogen <italic>Dickeya zeae,</italic> IHF was suggested to positively regulate different virulence factors through binding to the promoter region of a diguanylate cyclase gene, increasing the production of the secondary messenger c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>F. perrara,</italic> we found that the transcriptional regulators BasR and DksA were substantially downregulated in the wt versus the <italic>ihfA*</italic> mutant. Hence, it is possible that at least some of the differentially regulated genes may not be under the direct control of IHF but regulated via BasR or DskA.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified important gut colonization factors of the bee gut symbiont <italic>F. perrara</italic> and show that they are regulated by IHF. The wide occurrence of these genes in host-associated bacteria suggests similar roles in other environments and calls for a more detailed functional characterization. Our approach to create clean gene-deletion mutants expands the available genetic toolbox for bee symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leonard et al., 2018</xref>) and will help to dissect the molecular mechanisms of the identified gut colonization factors in this animal model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Frischella perrara</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Frischella perrara</italic> wt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 2013</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.doi.org/10.1099/ijs.0.049569-0">10.1099/ijs.0.049569-0</ext-link>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PEB0191 or ESL0157</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Type strain of <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> isolated from <italic>Apis mellifera</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>F. perrara</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Frischella perrara ihfA*</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> ESL0158</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Spontaneous P83L mutation (CCA→CTA) in <italic>ihfA</italic> in the wt background;

Samples were homogenized by bead beating with a FastPrep instrument with CoolPrep adapter (FastPrep-24 5G, cooled with dry ice) for two cycles of 45 s at speed of 6 m/s, including a 30 s break between each cycle. Samples were kept at RT for 5 min, subsequently extracted using chloroform, and RNA was precipitated using isopropanol overnight at –20°C. Precipitated RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water (Gibco) and incubated with DNase (NEB) to degrade remaining DNA.

These samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until RNA extraction, which was carried out in the same way as described in the previous section. For the in vivo RNA samples, bees were colonized with <italic>F. perrara</italic> as described above and sampled at day 5 and day 10 post inoculation. Guts were removed from anesthetized bees, the pylorus and first part of the ileum was dissected, and the presence of the scab was recorded. For each sample, 10 pylorus and ileum sections from bees coming from the same cage were pooled in a 2 ml screw cap tube containing 750 μl of TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck), glass beads (0.75–1 mm diameter, Roth), and silica beads (0.1 mm diameter, Roth). Immediately after collection the samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80°C until RNA extraction. RNA was extracted as described in the previous section. At each time point, four biological replicate samples were used for RNA sequencing, that is, bees for one sample came from independent cages of gnotobiotic bees. The GTF at the University of Lausanne generated the libraries for the sequencing of the in vivo RNA samples. Poly-A depletion was performed to enrich for bacterial mRNA, and Ribo-zero rRNA depletion was performed to remove prokaryotic and eukaryotic rRNAs. Then TruSeq stranded mRNA libraries (Illumina) were generated. The eight libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 to obtain single-end 125 bp reads. Libraries of the in vitro RNA samples were generated as described before. The four libraries corresponding to the <italic>F. perrara</italic> inocula used for colonizing the bees of the four replicates were sequenced on an Illumina MiniSeq at the Department of Fundamental Microbiology (125 bp single-end reads).

FASTQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) was used to control the quality of the data, followed by Trimmomatic (Trimmomatic-0.35) to trim adapters. Filtered and trimmed reads were mapped onto the <italic>F. perrara</italic> genome using Bowtie (bowtie2-2.3.2). Mapped reads were quantified using HTseq (version 0.7.2). Differential gene expression analysis was done with the Bioconductor package EdgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikolayeva and Robinson, 2014</xref>) using R scripts. For the in vitro RNAseq analysis, negative binomial models were fitted to the data and quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood (qCML) common and tagwise dispersion were estimated. The conditional distribution for the sum of counts in a group was used to calculate the significantly differentially expressed genes using an exact test with an FDR &lt; 5%. Only genes detected in all samples with at least one count per million were used for the analysis. For the in vivo RNAseq analysis, we followed the recommendations specified in the EdgeR user guide for generalized linear models. In short, read counts were normalized by trimmed mean of M-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>) producing scaling factors used by EdgeR to determine effective library sizes. Then, negative binomial generalized linear models were fitted for each condition and quasi-likelihood F-tests for each defined contrast (i.e., pairwise comparison between conditions) was used to assess the significance of differentially expressed genes. As for the in vitro RNAseq analysis, only genes with mapped reads with at least one count per million in all replicates and conditions were used for the analysis. Genes were considered as differentially expressed upon fulfilling the following criteria: (i) log2 fold change ≥ 2; (ii) a p-value of &lt;0.05; and (iii) an FDR &lt; 5%.

In a first step, suicide plasmids were constructed harboring two adjacent 700–800-bp-long homology regions matching the up- and downstream region of the gene or gene cluster to be deleted. To this end, the two homology regions were amplified using 2 Phanta Max Master Mix (Vazyme) and cloned into pKS2 using Golden Gate assembly. pKS2 is a derivative of pSEVA312 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martínez-García et al., 2020</xref>) that contains an sfGFP expression cassette flanked by two BsaI restriction sites in the multiple cloning site. All clonings were done in <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5a/λpir. To validate successful cloning of the two homology regions, PCR and Sanger sequencing was performed. The plasmids derived from pKS2 containing the homology regions were shuttled into the diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-auxotroph <italic>E. coli</italic> JKE201 and delivered to <italic>F. perrara</italic> wt via conjugation using bi-parental mating. To this end, <italic>E. coli</italic> JKE201 carrying the plasmid of interest was cultivated for 16–20 hr at 37°C in LB with 500 µM DAP (Sigma, LB-DAP) and 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol. Subcultures were made by diluting the culture at a ratio of 1:20 into fresh medium and incubated until exponential growth was reached. A fresh culture of <italic>F. perrara</italic> was prepared by growing it for 36 hr on mTYG agar. <italic>F. perrara</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were harvested in PBS and the OD<sub>600</sub> adjusted to 10. Equal quantities of both bacteria were mixed and spotted onto a cellulose acetate membrane filter (0.2 µm, 25 mm, Huberlab, Sartorius) placed on BHI agar with 500 µM DAP, followed by incubation at 35°C for 6 hr under microaerophilic condition. Filters with bacterial mixtures were removed from the plates with a forceps and placed into a tube with PBS. Bacteria were removed from the filter by pipetting, vortexing, and agitation for 10 min at 1500 rpm (ThermoMixer C, Eppendorf). The bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 8000 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, the supernatant discarded to remove dead bacteria, and the bacterial pellet was washed once with 1000 µl PBS before resuspending in a reduced volume, that is, 100 µl PBS. The bacterial mixture was plated onto CBA and mTYG with selection antibiotic and incubated at 35°C for 5 d under anaerobic condition. Colonies were picked after 4–5 d of incubation and expanded to fresh plates. DNA was isolated and five different PCRs performed to check for successful integration of the plasmid into the chromosomal region of <italic>F. perrara</italic> targeted for deletion. Positive clones (loop-in strains) were stocked in liquid mTYG containing 20% (v/v) glycerol at –80°C until further usage. To select for bacteria that have lost the integrated plasmid, <italic>F. perrara</italic> loop-in strains were grown on mTYG agar and subsequently transformed with plasmid pYE1. pYE1 is a derivative of pBZ485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harms et al., 2017</xref>) containing the restriction enzyme <italic>I-SceI</italic> under the control of the IPTG-inducible <italic>lac</italic> promoter. The activity of the restriction enzyme <italic>I-SceI</italic> will negatively select bacteria containing pKS2-derivatives as two <italic>I-SceI</italic> sites are flanking the multiple cloning sites on pKS2. To generate electrocompetent <italic>F. perrara</italic> cells, the bacteria were cultivated from glycerol stocks on mTYG agar and incubated at 35°C for 2 d under anaerobic condition. Bacteria from plate were inoculated in BHI broth with a starting OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 and grown anaerobically at 40°C for 12–16 hr. Subsequently, growth was stopped by placing cultures onto ice for 15 min. Cells were made electrocompetent by washing twice with ice-cold MOPS solution supplemented with 20% glycerol, with decreasing volumes per wash. Electrocompetent cells were mixed with &gt;500 ng plasmid DNA and incubated for 15 min on ice before transferring into an electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was performed applying a voltage of 2.5 kV with resistance of 200 Ω and capacitance of 25 µF. Bacteria were immediately resuspended in BHI and incubated anaerobically for 6 hr at 35°C to allow phenotypic expression. Bacteria were plated on CBA, mTYG, and/or BHIA plates with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and 100 µM IPTG to select for pYE1 and induce the restriction enzyme <italic>I-SceI</italic>. Plates were incubated in anaerobic atmosphere at 35°C. After 3–5 d of incubation, bacterial colonies were replica plated onto fresh plates containing 15 µg/ml chloramphenicol (selection marker of pKS2-derivatives) or 25 µg/ml kanamycin (selection marker of pYE1) to identify clones that cannot grow on chloramphenicol anymore as a consequence of the loss of the integrated pKS2-derivative. DNA was extracted and a PCR screen performed with primers amplifying the gene targeted for deletion as well as the overspanning region of the deletion. All clones possessing the gene deletion were subsequently expanded on mTYG agar and stocked in glycerol as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Correspondence between OD and CFU</title><p>For the wt, <italic>ihfA</italic>* and the six gene-deletion mutants, bacteria were grown in BHIA plates for 3 d at 35°C in anaerobic conditions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Karina B Xavier as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: François Leulier (Reviewer #3); Laura Florez Platino (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general, all three reviewers thought the work is solid and that the conclusions are well supported by the data. However, there was also a general consensus that the manuscript would benefit from additional experiments and context to clarify and increase the biological relevance of the mechanisms identified in this study towards a better understanding of the importance of the genetic factors identified here in symbiont gut colonization.</p><p>Below is a list of suggestions for essential revisions proposed by the reviewers after the consultation session, that we hope you can use to improve the manuscript. Additionally, you can also find in the end of this letter the sperate &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; written by each of the reviewers which should help to improve the manuscript and to understand the rationale of each of the reviewers. You do not need to reply to each of the individual comments from &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot;, for submission of a revised version you only need to reply to the essential revision’s points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We think that the manuscript requires additional experiments aiming to address the biological relevance of the genetic factors identified here. Namely, the paper requires a more detailed characterization of the mechanisms underlying the colonization phenotypes of the mutants identified here on both the host and bacterial sides to better understand the relevance of these processes on host biology and/or bacterial physiology. The points below are suggestions for experiments to achieve this aim, it is possible that there are other phenotypes/experiments beyond the ones suggested here that can also be used, or that could be even better. to achieve this goal.</p><p>1) The mutants were studied in mono-colonized bees, we suggest that colonization phenotypes of some the mutants (from Figure 6) are also tested in bees colonized with a complex community, as the results might be different and should help to further understand the role of the mechanisms affected in these mutants in the bee gut. For example, we think it would be interesting to test the mutants related to colibactin and T6SS.</p><p>2) The manuscript would also improve with an additional characterization of the mutants in terms of growth rate and cell shape, or other characterizations of the physiology of these bacterial mutants, to help understand why some of the mutants are compromised in their ability to colonize the bee gut.</p><p>3) Given the importance of understanding the mechanisms that are required for the occupancy of distinct physical niches. We suggest that the authors test if there is any difference in the spatial gut colonization of the mutates studied here. The data in Figure 6 refers to colonization in the pylorus and ileum. We suggest that these results are compared with results with the CFUs recovered from the whole gut to see if any of these mutants has a different spatial colonization niche.</p><p>4) The importance of the scab phenotype is highlighted in the manuscript (although additional context is need (see point 6)), one of the mutants studied colonizes at high loads but is impaired in inducing the scab phenotype. Additional characterization of the impact of this mutant for the host could reveal additional insight related to the impact of the scab phenotype on host performance or health.</p><p>5) Technical issues: i) The number of bees tested in Figure 3 should be the same in the two time points. ii) clarify if some of the results might have been affected by differences in OD and cell numbers when comparing the WT and the different mutants given that some mutants are affected in cell size/shape. Calibrations between might OD and cell concentrations might be required to ensure that there was no bias in any of the experiments in which same OD was assumed as equivalent titers of the mutant and the wt.</p><p>6) There are some points that can be improved with additional clarification/re-writing: i) The authors should include in the manuscript the motivation for the choice of F. perrara. What is known about the relevance of this bacterium for the host, how common/prevalent is this symbiont in natural conditions? ii) the manuscript requires additional information about the relevance of the scab phenotype in symbiosis and/or pathogenesis, what is known about the relevance of these phenotype for the host. The importance of the scab phenotype should be clear already in the abstract (iii) the abstract ends with the conclusion that the different mutants identified had different colonization defects, this is a very vague conclusion, it would be better to try to be more specific and explained for example what was learnt with the Type VI SS mutants, or include additional conclusion from the experiments suggested above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As the authors emphasize, one important question in this field is the understanding of the mechanisms that are required for the occupancy of distinct physical niches. Therefore, I think it would be interesting to determine the spatial gut colonization of the mutates studied here. The data in Figure 6 refers to colonization in the pylorus and ileum. I think it would be interesting to compare these results with the CFUs recovered from the whole gut to see if there is any of these mutants that has a different spatial colonization niche.</p><p>2. Mutants involved in the colibactin production were only mildly affected in gut colonization, can it be that colibactin is not important in mono-colonization conditions, but it is required for colonization in the presence of the other gut symbionts? This hypothesis should be considered/discussed.</p><p>3. Throughout the paper it is often written that the results show that IHF plays an important role in gut colonization. I think it is clear that the effect of IHF in gut colonization is related to its effect of the expression of several colonization such as the pili genes. Therefore, I think it would be better to emphasize that the results presented here show that IHF acts as major regulator of the expression of factors involved in gut colonization. It is indeed still possible that IHF also has a direct role in colonization, so I think it still makes sense to raise that possibility in the discussion (as it is written in lines 328), but the major conclusion should be that the results indicate that IHF is acting as a regulator of the expression of factors which are important in colonization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the study is thorough and the main conclusions supported by the results however this reviewer feels that the study deserve further insights to reach the level of advances expected by this referee for an <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript, however I let the editor decide on this parameter. The study identifies new genetic factors that support symbiont colonization in the bee gut but so far falls short at dissecting the mechanisms underlying the phenotypes on both the host and bacterial sides, which I believe would be necessary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. As it is, my feeling is that the manuscript in its current form would be a better fit for generalistic microbiology journal such as mBio.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Title: the abbreviation IHF is unlikely to relate to a broad audience. I suggest modifying.</p><p>– Lines 49-50: this can be interpreted as if only bacterial factors are involved in determining spatial distribution in the honeybee gut. I suggest mentioning that host factors are potentially involved as well, unless there is opposing evidence.</p><p>– Lines 68-72: I suggest to also include some words on the occurrence of the scab phenotype as has been described previously (Engel et al. 2015 mBio), to give the reader a better sense of the potential relevance of this phenotype. Also, here or elsewhere it is worth clarifying that this is not associated to disease or other negative impact on the host, if that is the case.</p><p>– Lines 101-105: please revise the text or figure, as the amino acids or positions referred to do not match (See specific comment on Figure 1).</p><p>– Lines 148-150: How did the authors make sure that the colonies that were plated are indeed F. perrara? Is having contamination in the feed for the bees or while plating the guts unlikely? Please clarify here or in the corresponding methods section.</p><p>– Lines 168-170: given that a difference in cell shape and size is reported for the wt and the mutant, it would have been relevant to make a calibration of OD vs cell concentration. It is likely that this underlies the difference in CFUs noted here.</p><p>Therefore, I find it relevant to expand on this point, providing a quantitative estimate of this difference and making sure that this does not generate a bias in any of the experiments in which same OD was assumed as equivalent titers of the mutant and the wt.</p><p>– Line 248-250: please revise the grammar of this sentence. Also, it is not fully clear why this was not unexpected. I suggest rephrasing/clarifying.</p><p>– Line 368: please provide a reference for the claim that no other honeybee symbiont causes the scab phenotype.</p><p>– Lines 100-101: as far as I am aware, it is only present in Gram-negative bacteria. I suggest to state more precisely.</p><p>– Line 434: I suggest indicating directly here at least if this was via antibiotic treatment (and which).</p><p>– Lines 439-440: See specific comment for lines 168-169.</p><p>– Line 657: please revise sentence.</p><p>– Figure 1: Note that in C and in the legend there seems to be a mislabeling or misplacement of the mutations in the sequence. Lysine &gt; Serine is written but on the sequence the green rectangle indicates Leucine (L) &gt; Methionine (M). Also for the Proline mutations, the highlighted region of the sequence alignment does not match what is indicated in the text, both in terms of amino acids and location.</p><p>– I believe that the manuscript would benefit from including the following points in the discussion (or elsewhere), even if there are no conclusive answers to some of the points:</p><p>– How might the presence of other bacteria affect F. perrara colonization (in relation to the genes in focus) and the scab phenotype? Are the titers of F. perrara in the experiments with gnotobiotic bees comparable to titers of F. perrara under natural conditions?</p><p>– Are different strains of F. perrara known in honey bees, how consistently do specific strains colonize within or across different colonies? How representative is the strain used in this study?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76182.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We think that the manuscript requires additional experiments aiming to address the biological relevance of the genetic factors identified here.

We have conducted a more detailed characterization of the mutants in the revised manuscript. In some cases, we have carried out the experiments as suggested by the reviewers. In other cases, we have come up with a different approach that we believe addresses the main point of the critique, but from a more interesting perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The mutants were studied in mono-colonized bees, we suggest that colonization phenotypes of some the mutants (from Figure 6) are also tested in bees colonized with a complex community, as the results might be different and should help to further understand the role of the mechanisms affected in these mutants in the bee gut. For example, we think it would be interesting to test the mutants related to colibactin and T6SS.</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision, we tested the colonization of the <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> mutants in the presence and absence of a complex community containing 13 strains representing the core members of the bee gut microbiota (BeeComm_002). In short, we colonized bees with a 1:1 mix of <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> and the BeeComm_002 (i.e., <italic>F. perrara</italic> was present 13x more concentrated than any of the individual strains) and analysed the colonization levels of <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> using qPCR at 10 days post-colonization (Figure 7 and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). We tested all eight <italic>Frischella perrara</italic> genotypes (i.e. wt, <italic>ihfA</italic>*, and the six inframe deletion mutants: three T6SS mutants, colibactin mutant, aryl polyene mutant, and T4 pili mutant) in the presence and in the absence of the BeeComm_002. We carried out two independent replicates of this experiment. A total of 20 bees were analysed for each treatment. Interestingly, while the colonization of the wt strain of <italic>F. perrara</italic> was not affected, three of the six tested in-frame deletion mutants showed an increased colonization defect in the presence the BeeComm_002 (Figure 7). This included two of the T6SS mutants and the mutant of the aryl polyene. Moreover, the presence of the BeeComm_002 led to a reduction of the number of bees colonized and number of scabs formed (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). This trend was seen for most strains tested but not for the wt.</p><p>We have included these results into the revised manuscript, by expanding the Results section with a new chapter on the role of the colonization factors in the presence of a community reflecting the conventional microbiota of bees.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript would also improve with an additional characterization of the mutants in terms of growth rate and cell shape, or other characterizations of the physiology of these bacterial mutants, to help understand why some of the mutants are compromised in their ability to colonize the bee gut.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out the following additional analyses to better understand why some mutants do not colonize the gut anymore or do not induce the scab phenotype:</p><p>i) We carried out electron microscopy on some of the genotypes which showed that cells of the wt but not the <italic>ΔpilE</italic> mutant have pili-like cell protrusions. This confirms that the <italic>ΔpilE</italic> mutant has an effect of pili formation which may be key for host attachment in the pylorus. Corresponding images have been added to the Supplementary material as Figure 6 —figure supplement 3.</p><p>ii) We carried out FISH microscopy on guts colonized with all eight strains to assess if those mutants which still colonize the host are also able to localize to the epithelial surface of the pylorus where the wt induces the scab phenotype. As expected from the CFU counts and the absence of pili structures, no bacteria were found to be attached to the host epithelium in the cross-sections of bees colonized with the <italic>ihfA*</italic> and <italic>ΔpilE</italic> mutant. In contrast, the two T6SS mutants which still colonized at high levels (<italic>Δhcp2</italic> and <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic>), but which did not cause the scab phenotype anymore, both still colonized the epithelial surface of the pylorus in a very similar way as the wt. This is intriguing as it suggests that the absence of the scab phenotype in these two mutants is not due to the inability of the bacteria to attach to the epithelium (where the scab forms). It confirms our previous speculation that one of the T6SS may trigger scab formation by e.g. delivering a host-targeting effector. These results have been added to the manuscript in the second to last results chapter and the FISH images added to Figure 6B (also, Figure 6 —figure supplements 6 and 7).</p><p>iii) We also characterized the in vitro growth and viability of the mutant strains in more detail. We prepared bacterial solutions at the same optical density – OD 0.1 – and plated serial dilutions on semi-solid agar to calculate the number of colony forming units (CFUs) (Figure 6 —figure supplement 4). We observed that two mutants – <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic> and <italic>ΔpilE</italic> – had less CFU counts than the wt. However, we do not think these differences affected the capacity to colonize. In the mono-association experiment, the <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic> mutant colonized to the same loads as <italic>Δhcp2</italic> and <italic>ΔclbB</italic>, whose loads did not differ from the wt in the OD to CFU experiment. Moreover, while <italic>ΔpilE</italic> had a severe colonization defect in mono-association, it had higher loads than the <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic> in the OD to CFU experiment. Therefore, having reduced CFU counts in the OD to CFU experiment does not correlate with the capacity to colonize. Moreover, we characterized the growth of the six gene-frame deletion mutants, <italic>ihfA*</italic> and wt strains in liquid BHI medium, under anaerobic conditions, and saw that all strains grow similarly to the wt (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2). This shows that these phenotypical characteristics observed in vitro may tell us little about the ability of strains to colonize the gut. Nevertheless, we have added the growth curves into the Supplementary material.</p><p>iv) We obtained light microscopy images for the six gene-frame deletion mutants, <italic>ihfA*</italic> and wt strains and measured cell length. No differences were found in this experiment (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3), in opposition to the experiment shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2. This new experiment was done in BHI, which is the liquid medium we generally use to grow Frischella. In contrast, the initial experiment was done in TYG medium, because this was the condition in which the spontaneous ihfA/B mutants were isolated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the importance of understanding the mechanisms that are required for the occupancy of distinct physical niches. We suggest that the authors test if there is any difference in the spatial gut colonization of the mutates studied here. The data in Figure 6 refers to colonization in the pylorus and ileum. We suggest that these results are compared with results with the CFUs recovered from the whole gut to see if any of these mutants has a different spatial colonization niche.</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully considered this suggestion, and decided to focus on comparing the spatial distribution of the different gene-deletion mutants within the pylorus instead of across gut compartments. We did so for two reasons: (i) The pylorus is the preferential niche of this bacterium in conventional bees, and only there it forms a biofilm attached to the host. Studying the spatial distributions of the different mutants within the pylorus could help to identify mechanisms that regulate biofilm formation in this gut compartment. Moreover, comparing the spatial distribution of these genotypes may lead to a better understanding of the scab formation, namely by studying those mutants that colonize but do not induce the scab. (ii) The disadvantage of mono-association experiments in the laboratory is that there is no competition with other bacteria, and hence niches in other gut compartments are available for invasion even though they would never be colonized by the bacterium of interest in conventional bees. So, instead of looking at the CFU levels in other parts of the gut, we decided to specifically look at the characteristic colonization pattern of the different genedeletion mutants in the pylorus (Figure 6B and Figure 6 —figure supplement 6 and 7). See also reply to point 1. This allowed us to assess which mutants are still able to adhere to the epithelial surface and whether mutants that show a defect in scab formation, but not colonization, may have a defect in adhesion and biofilm formation in the regions where scab material usually accumulates. Strikingly, this was not the case. All mutants for which we observed high levels of colonization still colonized the crypts of the epithelial surface of the pylorus region, even the T6SSs mutants (<italic>Δhcp2</italic> and <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic>) which did not induce the scab phenotype anymore. This is interesting, as it suggests that these mutants are still able to interact with the host, yet are not capable of triggering the scab anymore. It is possible that the mutated T6SS targets the host or delivers effector proteins that lead to the built up of the scab material. This adds exciting new data to the current manuscript and opens the door to further experimental approaches to describe the function of these T6SSs in more detail in the future. The FISH images have been added to Figure 6B (but also Figure 6 —figure supplement 6 and 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The importance of the scab phenotype is highlighted in the manuscript (although additional context is need (see point 6)), one of the mutants studied colonizes at high loads but is impaired in inducing the scab phenotype. Additional characterization of the impact of this mutant for the host could reveal additional insight related to the impact of the scab phenotype on host performance or health.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to point 3. The FISH microscopy shows that the spatial colonization of this mutant, <italic>Δhcp2</italic>, is similar to the <italic>ΔclbB</italic> mutant that has similar loads and induces scab formation. We now believe there are specific effector proteins that are necessary to trigger the scab and started a project in the lab to identify them. This said, we don’t know yet if the scab phenotype has an impact on the host. However, we know that it is widely distributed in bees of the species <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (you can find it in 25-80% of all adult bees in every colony) and that it is specifically associated with the presence of <italic>F. perrara.</italic> Other bee species, although they harbour similar bacteria in the gut have not been reported to exhibit this phenotype. This makes this phenotype really interesting to study to understand fundamental aspects of the specificity of microbiota-host interactions, even though we do not know yet if this phenotype has any relevance for the fitness of the host.</p><p>Nevertheless, we know that <italic>F. perrara</italic> triggers the host immune response and that this very likely leads to scab formation. This activation may protect the honey bee from opportunistic pathogens, creating a filtering mechanism in the gut. We will explore this hypothesis in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Technical issues: i) The number of bees tested in Figure 3 should be the same in the two time points.</p></disp-quote><p>Bees were sampled from the same cages at the two different timepoints. As sampling at Day 5 was an intermediate timepoint we removed a smaller number of bees to ensure to have enough bees left for the later timepoint. As day 10 was the final timepoint, we analysed all bees that were left. We believe it would be a pity to discard data to make the two groups equal. Also, we carried out a proper time course in a follow-up experiment (see Figure 3) to compare across timepoints. Therefore, we believe that these differences have no influence on the overall point we want to make with these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) clarify if some of the results might have been affected by differences in OD and cell numbers when comparing the WT and the different mutants given that some mutants are affected in cell size/shape. Calibrations between might OD and cell concentrations might be required to ensure that there was no bias in any of the experiments in which same OD was assumed as equivalent titers of the mutant and the wt.</p></disp-quote><p>Both OD and CFUs have caveats when measuring bacterial cell number in the inocula. As pointed out by the reviewers, OD is affected by cell size and shape. Less often considered, but as important is the fact that bacterial cells can clump together and form a single colony instead of several separate ones. This will influence CFU enumerations. Therefore, calibrating one with the other may not be ideal. However, we can exclude that small differences in the actual number of cells in the inocula influenced our colonization results. (i) In the time course experiment, the total number of viable cells (i.e. forming CFUs) in the inocula of the <italic>ihfA*</italic> mutant was much higher than in the wt (Figure 3D). Yet this strain poorly colonized the bees. (ii) To correspond OD to CFU, we diluted all genotypes to the same optical density (OD 0.1) and quantified the number of colony forming units in these bacterial solutions (Figure 6 —figure supplement 4). The <italic>ΔpilE</italic> and <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic> had less CFU counts than the wt. However, we do not think these affected the capacity to colonize. In the mono association experiment, the <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic> mutant colonized to the same loads as <italic>Δhcp2</italic> and <italic>ΔclbB</italic>, whose loads did not differ from the wt in the OD to CFU experiment. Moreover, <italic>ΔpilE</italic> had a severe colonization defect in mono-association, while it had higher loads than the <italic>Δhcp1/hcp2</italic> in the OD to CFU experiment. Finally, we have done an experiment in which we measured cell length (see also reply IV to point 2) and did not observe significant differences between strains. This was done in BHI, whereas the initial experiment was done in TYG medium. We did not see any association between cell length and colonization capacity in this new experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There are some points that can be improved with additional clarification/re-writing: i) The authors should include in the manuscript the motivation for the choice of F. perrara. What is known about the relevance of this bacterium for the host, how common/prevalent is this symbiont in natural conditions? ii) the manuscript requires additional information about the relevance of the scab phenotype in symbiosis and/or pathogenesis, what is known about the relevance of these phenotype for the host.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a corresponding section in the introduction, which reads as follows:</p><p>“F. perrara is highly prevalent across worker bees and colonies of <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, and related bacteria have also been found in Apis cerana. Moreover, between 25%-80% of all worker bees of a colony harbor a visible scab phenotype in the pylorus region of the gut, which has been shown to strongly correlate with a high abundance of F. perrara (34). However, the impact of these phenotype on the host has remained elusive.”</p><p>We have also changed the abstract. See Reply to (iii).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The importance of the scab phenotype should be clear already in the abstract (iii) the abstract ends with the conclusion that the different mutants identified had different colonization defects, this is a very vague conclusion, it would be better to try to be more specific and explained for example what was learnt with the Type VI SS mutants, or include additional conclusion from the experiments suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the abstract so to be more specific about our findings. We now highlight the potential role of the T6SS in causing the scab phenotype. The abstract reads as follows:</p><p>“Bacteria colonize specific niches in the animal gut. However, the genetic basis of these associations is often unclear. The proteobacterium Frischella perrara is a widely distributed gut symbiont of honey bees. It colonizes a specific niche in the hindgut and causes a characteristic melanization response. Genetic determinants required for the establishment of this association, or its relevance for the host, are unknown. Here, we independently isolated three point mutations in genes encoding the DNA-binding protein integration host factor (IHF) in F. perrara. These mutants abolished the production of an aryl polyene metabolite causing the yellow colony morphotype of F. perrara. Inoculation of microbiota-free bees with one of the mutants drastically decreased gut colonization of F. perrara. Using RNAseq we found that IHF affects the expression of potential colonization factors, including genes for adhesion (Type 4 pili), interbacterial competition (Type 6 secretion systems), and secondary metabolite production (colibactin and aryl polyene biosynthesis). Gene deletions of these components revealed different colonization defects depending on the presence of other bee gut bacteria. Interestingly, one of the T6SS mutants did not induce the scab phenotype anymore, despite colonizing at high levels, suggesting an unexpected role in bacteria-host interaction. IHF is conserved across many bacteria and may also regulate host colonization in other animal symbionts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. As the authors emphasize, one important question in this field is the understanding of the mechanisms that are required for the occupancy of distinct physical niches. Therefore, I think it would be interesting to determine the spatial gut colonization of the mutates studied here. The data in Figure 6 refers to colonization in the pylorus and ileum. I think it would be interesting to compare these results with the CFUs recovered from the whole gut to see if there is any of these mutants that has a different spatial colonization niche.</p></disp-quote><p>See our reply to point 3 of Essential Revisions. But briefly, we opted to look at the spatial occupation of the gene-deletion mutants within the pylorus, the natural niche of this bacterium, using FISH microscopy (Figure 6B and Figure 6 —figure supplement 6 and 7). The mutants that colonize but do not induce the scab occupy the same locations as those mutants that lead to scab formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Mutants involved in the colibactin production were only mildly affected in gut colonization, can it be that colibactin is not important in mono-colonization conditions, but it is required for colonization in the presence of the other gut symbionts? This hypothesis should be considered/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined in point 1 of Essential Revisions, we have tested the ability of all mutants to colonize the bee gut in the presence of a complex bacterial community (Figure 7 and Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). There was no statistically significant difference in colonization levels of the colibactin mutant between mono-association and the presence of the community. However, less bees were colonized by the colibactin mutant when the complex bacterial community was present (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Therefore, it is possible that colibactin plays a role in the presence of competitors although to a lesser extent than other genes tested (e.g: <italic>Δhcp2</italic>). Future experiments with more replicates and fewer <italic>F. perrara</italic> cells as compared to the complex bacterial community (here we used a 1:1 ratio) may help to identify a clearer phenotype of the colibactin mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Throughout the paper it is often written that the results show that IHF plays an important role in gut colonization. I think it is clear that the effect of IHF in gut colonization is related to its effect of the expression of several colonization such as the pili genes. Therefore, I think it would be better to emphasize that the results presented here show that IHF acts as major regulator of the expression of factors involved in gut colonization. It is indeed still possible that IHF also has a direct role in colonization, so I think it still makes sense to raise that possibility in the discussion (as it is written in lines 328), but the major conclusion should be that the results indicate that IHF is acting as a regulator of the expression of factors which are important in colonization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that IHF impacts colonization by regulating genes that help <italic>F. perrara</italic> to interact with its host environment. However, we argue that therefore IHF itself can be considered a colonization factor. We should keep in mind that we do not know yet how the genes regulated by IHF influence colonization. As in the case of IHF, the effect does not need to be direct, yet we consider them colonization factors, as we see a change in colonization when we delete them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the study is thorough and the main conclusions supported by the results however this reviewer feels that the study deserve further insights to reach the level of advances expected by this referee for an eLife manuscript, however I let the editor decide on this parameter. The study identifies new genetic factors that support symbiont colonization in the bee gut but so far falls short at dissecting the mechanisms underlying the phenotypes on both the host and bacterial sides, which I believe would be necessary for publication in eLife. As it is, my feeling is that the manuscript in its current form would be a better fit for generalistic microbiology journal such as mBio.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that with the additional results added to this manuscript, the study becomes even more interesting for a broad audience and bolsters some of the previous findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Title: the abbreviation IHF is unlikely to relate to a broad audience.

We have isolated different strains of <italic>F. perrara</italic>. This bacterium is present in almost every bee, but only in bees that have high levels of the bacterium the scab is induced, usually in about 25-80% of all bees of a colony.

Moreover, we have done experiments with another <italic>F. perrara</italic> strain, isolated from a different continent than that here studied, and it induced the scab.
