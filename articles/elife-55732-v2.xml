molecule in the immune system, driving autocatalytic complement cascade activation and acting as an opsonin. We have previously reported a non-immune role of complement C1q modulating the migration and fate of human neural stem cells (hNSC); however, the mechanism underlying these effects has not yet been identified. Here, we show for the first time that C1q acts as a functional hNSC ligand, inducing intracellular signaling to control cell behavior. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we identified five transmembrane C1q signaling/receptor candidates in hNSC (CD44, GPR62, BAI1, c-MET, and ADCY5). We further investigated the interaction between C1q and CD44 , demonstrating that CD44 mediates C1q induced hNSC signaling and chemotaxis in vitro, and hNSC migration and functional repair in vivo after spinal cord injury. These results reveal a receptor-mediated mechanism for C1q modulation of NSC behavior and show that modification of C1q receptor expression can expand the therapeutic window for hNSC transplantation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>complement C1q</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell transplants</kwd><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005191</institution-id><institution>Craig H.

While the immunomodulatory effect of donor stem cells on the host has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tena and Sachs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pluchino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) the converse effect of the host immune-microenvironment on donor stem cells has received little attention. We have previously shown that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), which infiltrate the spinal cord at acute timeÂ points post trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2010</xref>), alter the responses of donor cells after acute spinal cord injury (SCI) transplantation. Specifically, systemic immunodepletion of PMNs inhibits donor hNSC astrogliogenesis and rescues the capacity of donor cells to promote functional repair after acute transplantation into the SCI microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). These data demonstrate that functional integration of transplanted stem cells is dependent, at least in part, on interactions between donor cells and cellular/molecular cues in the host microenvironment. We also demonstrated that secreted factors derived from two distinct immune populations, PMN and macrophages/microglia (MÏ), drive hNSC migration and lineage selection (fate) and identified complement C1q and C3a as molecular mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>). These data highlight the importance of cues from the host inflammatory microenvironment in modulating NSC behavior, and identify a significant in vitro and in vivo role for complement C1q in modulating NSC cell behavior.</p><p>The complement system is an enzymatic cascade of proteins that plays a crucial role as theÂ first line of defense against pathogens as it contributes to both innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunkelberger and Song, 2010</xref>). C1q is the recognition molecule of the classical pathway of complement activation. The traditional role of C1q in the immune system is to recognize and bind to antigen-antibody immune complexes, pathogens, lipids, and proteins accumulated during apoptosis or present on cell debris, initiating autocatalytic activation of the complement cascade and/or driving debris clearance by phagocytic immune populations. Recently, C1q has been found to act in non-traditional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterson and Anderson, 2014</xref>). In the CNS, C1q mediates the elimination of low activity presynaptic terminals by microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Presumey et al., 2017</xref>) and modulates axon growth and guidance by masking myelin-associated glycoprotein-mediated growth inhibitory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peterson et al., 2015</xref>). In theÂ muscle, C1q in C1 complex activates canonical Wnt signaling via conformation-induced activation of C1s serine protease activity, promoting age-associated decline in regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naito et al., 2012</xref>). In both cases, these activities are independent of complement cascade activation but remain consistent with the recognition functions of C1q in the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Botto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mevorach et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nauta et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, however, C1q induces ERK signaling in fetal cytotrophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agostinis et al., 2010</xref>), and binds discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), directly activating mitogen-activated protein kinases and PI3K/Akt in hepatocellular tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). This result suggests that C1q could play additional non-traditional roles, functioning as a ligand that can initiate cell signaling and/or directly interact with a transmembrane receptor to mediate cell signaling. Supporting this notion in CNS cells, C1q in the absence of other complement components induces neuronal-gene expression critical for cell survival in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit and Tenner, 2011</xref>), and our recent data link C1q to direct effects on NSC function and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that there is receptor-mediated communication between the host immune system and endogenous and/or donor NSC in the injured, diseased, or aged CNS that is mediated by C1q. Consistent with such a role, C1q protein/mRNA increases and persists locally in the CNS after injury and in aging/disease as a result of disruption to the bloodâbrain barrier and local synthesis by invading and resident inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterson and Anderson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunkelberger and Song, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we test whether C1q directly modulates NSC behavior through cell surface protein interactions and receptor-mediated cell signaling transduction mechanisms. We show for the first time that C1q activates specific intracellular signaling pathways in NSC to modulate NSC behavior. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we identify five novel transmembrane C1q signaling/receptor candidates in NSC, and define specific functions for the first of these, CD44, establishing the biological relevance of C1q-receptor interactions. These findings reveal an important role of complement C1q in modulating NSC behavior and identify a novel element in the understanding of the neuro-immune interface and NSC biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>C1q induces specific activation of intracellular signaling pathways on hNSC</title><p>We investigated the effects of C1q on intracellular signaling in hNSC by testing three physiological C1q concentrations that are produced by PMN [28 ng/mL â 0.1 nM] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>), MÏ [400 ng/mL â 1.0 nM] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>), or present in plasma.

C1q at 200 nM also significantly and selectively activated PI3K signaling, identified by p-Akt and P70 S6 kinase, as well as P53.

For the first approach, after validating that biotinylated and non-biotinylated C1q shared similar binding patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>) and binding specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>), total protein extract was incubated with immobilized C1q followed by a stringent wash protocol to minimize detection of nonspecific interactions. Bound proteins were eluted and analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and by nanoLC-MS/MS, which identified over 400 protein families. However, consistent with the far-western blot data and known interactions between C1q and intracellular constituents, few of these were known cell surface proteins.</p><p>For the second approach, we designed a novel strategy to selectively identify cell surface protein interactions. A critical limitation of both far-western blots and conventional pull-down assays is that these experiments are performed with denatured proteins, resulting in 3D structure loss.

To accomplish this, cell surface interactions were initiated in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Membrane proteins cross-linked with C1q were then extracted, pulled-down with biotinylated specific anti-C1q antibody, and bound proteins eluted and analyzed using nanoLC-MS/MS. This approach identified a shortÂ list of five known transmembrane proteins representing novel candidate C1q receptor and signaling protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>): CD44, GPR62, BAI1, c-MET, and ADCY5. RT-PCR analysis confirmed positive expression of these five candidates in hNSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We evaluated the functional significance of specific intracellular signaling pathways in C1q-induced chemotaxis and C1q-modulation of proliferation on hNSC using intracellular signaling pathway inhibitors focusing on: 1) pERK/MAPK inhibition because C1q induces p-ERK signaling at all tested concentrations (PD98059); 2) G-protein coupled receptor inhibition because two candidates are GPCRs (pertussis toxin, PTX); and 3) p38 MAPK inhibition as a negative control because we did not detect p38 signaling induction (SB20358). We focused on migration and proliferation to minimize the potential for toxicity due to long-term inhibitor treatment, and because we have previously established the effects of C1q administration on these hNSC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

The lack of complete migration blockade in response to C1q [200 nM] could be related to concentration-dependent activation of ERK/MAPK pathway signaling via C1q interaction with other receptor candidates.</p><p>To validate that these results were not due to off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9, we employed a parallel genetic approach, generating mouse NSC (mNSC) from either CD44 WT or CD44 KO littermate mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4AâD</xref>). We confirmed that mNSC exhibit theÂ expression of CD44 and the other C1q signaling/receptor candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4E</xref>),Â as well as a comparable response to complement components and the inflammatory injury microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>), including induction of mNSC chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4F</xref>). These data demonstrate theÂ conservation of this mechanism across species. TheÂ loss of CD44 protein expression in KO vs. WT mNSC was confirmed using immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4D</xref>), and transwell assays were used to verify C1q induced migration as for hNSC. Baseline migration in control media was identical between CD44 WT and KO mNSC (Studentâs t-test, p=0.6150). However, while WT mNSC exhibited increased migration in response to C1q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4F,G</xref>) similar to WT hNSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), this response was completely blocked in CD44 KO mNSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4G</xref>). Indeed, CD44 KO mNSC exhibited a repulsive effect in response to C1q. Temperature inactivation of human C1q abolished all responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4G</xref>), confirming both specificity and a requirement for functional 3D conformation of the C1q protein. In summary, these in vitro findings demonstrate that CD44 is involved in C1q-mediated signaling pathway activation and chemotaxis in mammalian NSC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>C1q modulation of hNSC proliferation and differentiation is CD44 independent</title><p>We have previously shown that C1q alters hNSC proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>).

This result is likely to reflect an indirect effect of increased Olig2+ cell number observed under baseline differentiation conditions for CD44 KO vs. WT hNSC (30% vs. 21%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3G,H</xref>, noted above), creating a ceiling effect for C1q-driven increases in Olig2+ cell number. Byn contrast, when exposed to C1q [200 nM] both WT and CD44 KO hNSC exhibited a significant and equivalent decrease in Olig2+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>; in CD44 WT: C1q [200 nM] vs control 10% vs. 21%, Tukey p&lt;0.0001; KO C1q [200 nM] vs control 14% vs. 30%, Tukey p&lt;0.0001).

In all, these data are consistent with our previous report of a dose dependent effect of C1q on hNSC differentiationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>), and demonstrate that the effects of C1q on astroglial and neuronal fate are independent of CD44. These data suggest that C1q functions through one or more of the other receptor candidates identified and their associated signaling pathways (e.g., GPCR signaling) to regulate hNSC proliferation and differentiation/fate.</p><p>CD44 KO decreases hNSC localization at the SCI epicenter, modulating astroglial fate and rescuing the capacity of hNSC to promote locomotor recovery after transplantation into the acute SCI microenvironment.</p><p>We have previously shown that the time of hNSC transplantation into the parenchyma adjacent to the SCI epicenter is a key variable for the in vivo fate and migration profile of engrafted donor human cells. Delayed hNSC transplantation (9â30/60 d post-SCI) results in extensive donor human cell migration away from the SCI epicenter, toward the distal rostral and caudal spinal cord, and predominant oligodendroglial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yonemasu et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salazar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooshmand et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cummings et al., 2006</xref>). Conversely, acute hNSC transplantation (0 d post-SCI) results in increased donor human cell migration toward the SCI epicenter and a pronounced shift toward astroglial fate in the donor human cell population that engrafts adjacent to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, while delayed hNSC transplantation leads to locomotor recovery, acute transplantation does not. These effects can be rescued by specific systemic immunodepletion of the PMN cell population with anti-Ly6G antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), as well as by C1q+C3a blockade via epicenterÂ administration of neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these data and the identification of a novel role for CD44 expressed by hNSC in C1q-induced chemotaxis, we hypothesized that: 1) CD44 KO hNSC would exhibit reduced migration to the SCI epicenter after acute transplantation; 2) CD44 KO hNSC would exhibit reduced astroglial differentiation at the SCI epicenter after acute transplantation; and 3) CD44 KO hNSC would promote functional locomotor recovery after acute transplantation, while CD44 WT cells would not.</p><p>We first sought to demonstrate that there is a spatial and temporal C1q gradient, with highest levels in the injury epicenter and a peak in the acute period that could drive donor hNSC migration via C1q-CD44 interaction. We analyzed C1q protein in Rag one mice that received a T9 laminectomy alone (sham) or a T9 laminectomy plus a 50Â kD contusion SCI, collecting spinal cord tissue in rostral, epicenter and caudal 3 mm segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) at 3 hr, 24 hr or 9 d post-injury (pi). Using SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis, we verified that C1q protein is significantly increased at acute timeÂ points (3-24hpi) in the injury epicenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Plasma C1q circulates in theÂ C1 complex, which is composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s. Also, a multitude of cells in the CNS can synthesize C1q, including PMN and MÏ, which do so both in vitro and in vivo after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>). Detection of C1q by western blot could thus indicate the presence of either C1q as a single protein or C1 complex. Consistent with this suggestion, microarray gene expression data overlapping these regions and timeÂ points shows a parallel increase in local C1q mRNA at the injury epicenter that is not accompanied by C1s mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aimone et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that locally synthesized C1q would be bioavailable for interaction as a single molecule, separate from C1 complex. Together, these data demonstrate that C1q is present in the SCI microenvironment acutely at the lesion epicenter, and supports that C1q would be available to interact with CD44 and drive hNSC migration to the SCI epicenter after acute transplantation of donor hNSC.</p><p>To test if CD44 mediates hNSC recruitment toward the SCI epicenter after acute transplantation, 75,000 CD44 WT or KO hNSC were transplanted bilaterally into four sites (250Â nL/site) in the intact parenchyma, two sites 1 mm rostral and two sites 1 mm caudal to the SCI epicenter, immediately after a moderate (50Â kD) T9 contusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>). To enable adequate xenograft survival for analysis of survival and migration, we employed immunodeficient Rag-1 mice; while the adaptive T and B cell response is absent in these animals, innate immune responses, including PMN infiltration, macrophage/monocyte infiltration, and early complement molecules are retained. Donor CD44 WT and CD44 KO hNSC engraftment were observed in 100% of transplanted animals (NÂ =Â 10/group). A subset of six animals was randomly selected from each group for immunohistology and unbiased stereological analysis (MBF StereoInvestigator). Fibronectin+ lesion volume was quantified using the Cavalieri probe. Similarly, the number of human-specific cytoplasmic marker (STEM121) and human-specific astrocyte marker (STEM123) positive hNSC was quantified using the optical fractionator probe. Additionally, we have previously reported that, while hNSC in this acute transplantation paradigm do not invade the Fibronectin+ injury site per se, the robust magnitude of hNSC localized to the spared parenchyma adjacent to the SCI epicenter leads to undersampling in stereology; accordingly, we also analyzed human donor cell localization in this region using volumetric sampling with the Cavalieri probe (clustering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). All histological analyses were performed by observers blinded to the study groups 16 weeks post-transplant (WPT).</p><p>No differences in fibronectin+ lesion volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>), or in the number of surviving engrafted donor human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2C,D</xref>; hNSC STEM121+ cells in brown) were observed in mice receiving CD44 WT vs. KO hNSC. However, consistent with our hypotheses, mice transplanted with CD44 KO hNSC exhibited a significant reduction in total STEM121+ donor cells adjacent to the SCI epicenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâC</xref>). Similarly, mice transplanted with CD44 KO hNSC exhibited a significant reduction in hNSC derived STEM123+ astrocyte clustering (h-astrocytes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7DâH</xref>) adjacent to the SCI epicenter and STEM123+ h-astrocytes in the spared parenchyma within 1 mm rostral-caudal to the SCI epicenter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These data suggest that CD44 KO decreased theÂ migration of transplanted hNSC toward the SCI epicenter, which was associated with decreased astroglial fate, and that this effect did not result from alterations in lesion volume or total donor cell engraftment and survival. Further, analysis of locomotor recovery on the horizontal ladder beam task, a sensitive task for animals exhibiting frequent stepping, showed that mice receiving CD44 KO hNSC made significantly fewer errors vs. mice receiving vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>), while no improvements were observed after transplantation of WT hNSC. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CD44 modulates hNSC migration and distribution in the in vivo acute microenvironment after SCI, affecting both lineage selection and the potential to yield locomotor recovery. While identification of C1q as a novel CD44 ligand suggests a novel mechanism by which hNSC CD44 expression may regulate the behavior of these cells in vivo, this experiment cannot rule out the potential contribution of other CD44 ligands in the SCI microenvironment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CD44 KO decreases hNSC localization at the SCI epicenter, modulating astroglial fate and rescuing the capacity of hNSC to promote locomotor recovery after transplantation into the acute SCI microenvironment.</title><p>All histological data obtained 16 weeks post-transplant (WPT).

We employed a previously published approach and reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>), transplanting WT hNSC into the rostral and caudal spared parenchyma immediately after T9 moderate contusion SCI, as described earlier. Acute hNSC transplantation was followed immediately by a single epicenter injection of either vehicle (hNSC + vehicle) or C1q neutralizing antibody (hNSC + C1qNAb). We have previously shown that there are no differences between NAb treatment, IgG control, and vehicle treatment with regard to hNSC cell engraftment and lesion volume (one-way ANOVA, p=0.493) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooshmand et al., 2017</xref>). Histological quantification was performed by blinded unbiased stereological analysis as described earlier, and the effect of C1qNAb administration on lesion volume as well as hNSC engraftment and h-astrocyte localization analyzed at 12 WPT.

Importantly, these findings suggest the potential for the optimization of cell therapies by manipulating hNSC responses to the host inflammatory microenvironment for CNS injuries and/or diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>C1q first appeared in the phylogenetic scale aboutÂ 450 million years ago, and multiple studies suggest that this protein has evolved roles that are not restricted its functions in the innate immune response, particularly in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterson and Anderson, 2014</xref>). Here, we hypothesized that C1q signals to NSC as a functional ligand via receptor-mediated interactions to modulate stem cell behavior. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate the first evidence for a receptor-mediated signaling role for complement C1q in the CNS, modulating NSC migration, proliferation, and lineage commitment. Moreover, using an unbiased forward screen, we define and validate five cell surface signaling/receptor candidate proteins, all of which represent novel C1q binding partners. The novelty of this technique allowed us to identify cell surface binding partners for C1q while maintaining the 3D structure of the receptor and the ligand on the cell surface of live hNSC, and validated these biologically-relevant interactions with an optimized proximity ligation assay.</p><p>The cell surface C1q signaling/receptor proteins identified, CD44, GPR62, BAI1, c-MET, and ADCY5 are all of particular interest in the CNS. CD44 is a multi-ligand, multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. CD44 is a receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA), but also interacts with other extracellular matrix ligands including osteopontin, laminin, and matrix metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ponta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weber et al., 1996</xref>). This protein participates in a wide variety of cellular functions mediated by alternative splice variations between CD44 isoforms, which confer ligand specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weber et al., 1996</xref>). CD44 has been linked to intracellular MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herishanu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), but itÂ can also control cellular signaling through interactions with other cell surface receptors, e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), e.g., c-Met (also identified in our forward screen), G-protein coupled receptors like CXCR4, and Wnt-induced beta-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orian-Rousseau and Schmitt, 2015</xref>), which requires LRP6. High expression of CD44 has been linked to commitment as an astroglial progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaltouki et al., 2013</xref>), and CD44 is highly upregulated in adult reactive astrocytes, suggesting a role in reactive astrogliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>). Oligoprogenitors/immature oligodendrocytes also express CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naruse et al., 2013</xref>). Transgenic mice overexpressing CD44 exhibit decreased oligodendrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2004</xref>), and CD44 is required for oligoprogenitor migration after CNS transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piao et al., 2013</xref>). Critically, NSC also express CD44, as we show in fetal human brain under results, and CD44 mediates transendothelial migration of neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deboux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rampon et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, CD44-HA interaction has been recently implicated in hippocampal neurogenesis, as a negative regulator of adult neural progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with reported roles for CD44 on p-ERK signaling and cell migration in different cell types, in this study, we identified a novel ligand for CD44, C1q, and show that C1q-CD44 signaling specifically modulates ERKÂ signaling and chemotaxis in hNSC in vitro. However, multiple of the C1q receptor candidates identified may signal in part via the ERK/MAPK pathway, and receptor activation is likely to be concentration-dependent, resulting in dramatic attenuation but not complete blockade of ERKÂ signaling and migration for high C1q concentrations (C1q [200 nM]). Moreover, our data suggest that other signaling pathways (e.g., GPCR signaling for C1q modulation of hNSC proliferation) and candidate receptors may mediate different aspects of hNSC regulation by C1q. Concurrent activation of multiple signaling pathways, with specificity conferred by time, expression, and concentration, may also be biologically important.</p><p>In addition to CD44, we identified GPR62, BAI1, c-Met, and ADCY5 as hNSC cell surface interaction partners. GPR62 is an orphan, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that was identified based on a forward screen of novel GPCRs specific to the CNS and exhibits strong expression in essentially all areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). RNAseq data analysis on purified CNS cell types from adult brain indicate that GPR62 is highly expressed in mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), consistent with our results from fetal brain single-cell RNA seq data analysis. GPR62 has not previously been investigated in the context of neural stem cell biology or immune interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan and He, 2017</xref>). Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) is part of a small subfamily of adhesion GPCRs that includes its close homologs, BAI2 and BAI3, which are developmentally regulated and highly expressed in the CNS in both fetal and adult tissue. BAI1 and BAI3 were orphan GPCRs. However, phosphatidyl serine is now known to interact with BAI1 to mediate phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, BAI1 KO mice exhibit abnormal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>) and deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, although normal synaptic arborization is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, C1q-like molecules induce signal transduction through the TSR region of BAI3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolliger et al., 2011</xref>). These data combined with the conserved homology of the TSRs across the BAI GPCR sub-family amplify interest in our preliminary identification of C1q as a BAI1 ligand. Critically, our data suggest that some C1q effects on hNSC are dependent on GPCRÂ signaling, accordingly, future studies will investigate if GPR62 or BAI1 are involved in these observations. c-Met is an RTK, for which, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was the only known ligand. c-Met is expressed by cells of epithelial origin; however, in addition to the liver, c-Met expression is observed in cells of the cerebral cortex and choroid plexus (Allen brain atlas). Deregulation of c-Met expression in the adult is associated with malignancy, including cancers of the liver and brain, suggesting a role for c-Met in cell proliferation and expansion. HGF has been shown to drive NSC/progenitor cell migration via c-Met induced activation of PI3k/Akt in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang and Lee, 2014</xref>). Further, HGF has been shown to act as both a proliferative factor and chemoattractant for subventricular zone NSC/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nicoleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), an activity neutralized by both function blocking c-Met antibodies and expression of a dominant negative c-Met receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). HGF-Met signaling in these studies also played a role in the maintenance of NSC/progenitors in an undifferentiated state; reduction in this signaling axis enhanced the generation of neurons by 7-fold. In parallel, HGF-c-MET signaling has been shown to increase the generation of oligoprogenitors/oligodendrocytes from embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2009</xref>). ADCY5 belongs to the family of membrane-bound adenylate cyclases (AC), ADCY1-9. membrane-bound AC activity controls the cellular levels and subcellular localization of cAMP, and ADCY5/cAMP have been shown to regulate many physiological and pathophysiological processes through the modulation of downstream effectors, e.g., cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sassone-Corsi, 2012</xref>), PI3K/Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">del Puerto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okumura et al., 2007</xref>), and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yan et al., 2007</xref>). Further studies will be necessary to determine the biological functionalities of these other novel ligand-receptor interactions.</p><p>In sum, this study identifies both novel functions for C1q as a single molecule in the CNS and a mechanism by which this protein directly modulates NSC through the identification of a novel C1q receptor, CD44. Moreover, in vivo genetic deletion of CD44 in hNSC restored the capacity of hNSC to drive locomotor recovery after acute SCI transplantation, expanding the therapeutic window to the acute injury microenvironment. Finally, these data broaden the potential biological role for inflammatory proteins and cells in the immune microenvironment to include a multitude of conditions in which complement and in particular C1q is upregulated in the context of the developing, aged, diseased, or injured CNS. Thus, understanding the molecular interplay and communication between neuroinflammatory molecules and NSC may be critical for predicting the effects of local cues on endogenous or donor cell properties. In all, these data support the potential for clinical application of strategies to target receptor candidates on transplanted cells rather than agents from the inflammatory microenvironment to enhance the repair or restoration of function by donor cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Biological replicates are defined as experiments performed independently from different cell samples (e.g., different cell culture, passage). Technical replicates are defined as experiments performed in duplicates or triplicates with the same cell samples (e.g., same culture sample). We used N3-4 biological replicates consistent with accepted standard for in vitro studies. Statistics were performed using Prism, version 8.0 (Graphpad Software Inc, San Diego, CA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">http://www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). All data are presented as meanÂ Â±Â standard error of the mean (SEM). When indicated experimental values were normalized to untreated control conditions and standardize to 1 or 100%. Data were analyzed using one-sample t-test to compare with control and Studentâs t-test to compare between experimental conditions. When comparing across multiple groups, one-way ANOVA was conducted first, followed by Tukeyâs multiple t-test comparisons. In all statistical analyses, significance was defined as pâ¤0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Rebecca Nishi, MS, Javier Lepe, BS, Chris Nelson, BA, Hongli Liu, MD, for assistance with SCI surgeries and BMS behavioral open field test.

Here they want to discover the signaling pathway for such effects. They found that five different membrane receptors bind C1q, and specific downstream proteins are phosphorylated upon the addition of C1q. The experiments support that CD44 mediates migration and gliogenesis; nonetheless, the proliferation of NSCs is a CD44-independent process. They finally found that after spinal cord injury, CD44-KO improves spinal cord injury recovery. The authors uncovered a novel signaling mechanism by which C1q modulates NSCs activity. The previous effect seems to be independent of the immune system finding new roles for C1q.</p><p>1) If you compare the results of Figure 7I vs. Figure 8C and specifically controls, they look really different.

This was a well-written, indeed a gripping, read from start to finish. The findings are fascinating, the experiments are very well conducted, and the story is artfully told.</p><p>The core of this story is that the authors previously found a non-immune role for complement C1q in modulating human neural stem cell (hNSC) migration and fate. They now have investigated the mechanism of C1q's effects, and show that it has the surprising property of being a ligand that activates intracellular signaling pathways. They identified five transmembrane C1q signaling/receptor candidates in hNSCs (CD44, GPR62, BAI1, cMET, and ADCY5). A deeper investigation revealed that CD44 mediates C1q induced hNSC signaling and chemotaxis in vitro. They also show that this pathway mediates hNSC migration and functional repair in vivo after spinal cord injury and that manipulation of this pathway can enhance the therapeutic benefits of nHSC transplantation.</p><p>The idea that C1q has non-traditional roles has been shown in previous studies by this group and others, and it is clear that there are C1q effects that are separate from complement cascade activation. These additional properties suggest that C1q is a ligand for something, but it is not known how it works in this regard.</p><p>After demonstrating that C1q activates MAP/ERK and PI3K pathways at nM concentrations, they used an unbiased screen assay to cross-link C1q to surface proteins on hNSCs. This approach yielded five candidate receptors, which were validated using elegant Proximity Ligation Assays. They next showed that inhibition of pathway activation with pharmacological inhibitors blocked effects of C1q.</p><p>They focused on CD44 due to previous indications of the effects of CD44 on ERK signaling pathways (although the same would be true for c-MET). This was a good choice, as CD44 knockout cells did not show ERK activation or stimulation of migration in response to C1q. Similar results were obtained with NSCs derived from CD44 knockout mice.</p><p>They then conducted in vivo studies and showed that CD44 knockout hNSCs show differences in their localization in traumatic SCI, differences in astrocyte generation and enhancing the ability of hNSCs to promote locomotor recovery in acute SCI. These data indicate effects of C1q in vivo. They also found spatial and temporal C1q gradients in vivo following SCI, with a distribution consistent with results of their other studies. They also showed improved motor recovery, thus demonstrating a potential therapeutic utility of their findings. C1q depletion had similar effects as CD44 knockout. This was done by injecting a C1q neutralizing antibody into the lesion center.</p><p>It is also exciting that this is likely to be the beginning of a story that will continue to become still more interesting.</p><p>As expected for this team, the data are all rock solid.</p><p>In short, this is wonderfully exciting paper. Congratulations to the authors on such a lovely piece of research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55732.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers are very enthusiastic about the findings in this study.

This has been addressed, and the data in Figure 7I and Figure 8C have been re-graphed to be in identical format (stereological estimate of SC123 cell number). We have modified both the text and the figure legends to include these changes in the paper.</p><p>We also note several additional points for the reviewerâs consideration. First, while the contusion injury induced was theoretically the same, these experiments were separated by a large gap in time. Second, while both experiments were conducted in constitutively immunodeficient mouse strains, these were different due to availability (Rag1 â Figure 7 and NODScid mice Figure 8). Finally, the timepoints of analysis were not identical (16 WPT Figure 7I and 12WPT Figure 8C). Accordingly, one would not expect an exact overlay between datasets â however, despite these differences, the fact that transplanted hNSC behaved similarly, including in total cell baseline engraftment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) does indicate that the hNSC transplants and cell behavior between these experiments was generally quite consistent.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55732-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
