The pressures that guide the development of coordination are not well understood. To understand how and why coordination might emerge, we measured the kinematics of spontaneous vertical locomotion across early development in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) . We found that zebrafish used their pectoral fins and bodies synergistically during upwards swims. As larvae developed, they changed the way they coordinated fin and body movements, allowing them to climb with increasingly stable postures. This fin-body synergy was absent in vestibular mutants, suggesting sensed imbalance promotes coordinated movements. Similarly, synergies were systematically altered following cerebellar lesions, identifying a neural substrate regulating fin-body coordination. Together these findings link the vestibular sense to the maturation of coordinated locomotion. Developing zebrafish improve postural stability by changing fin-body coordination. We therefore propose that the development of coordinated locomotion is regulated by vestibular sensation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>balance</kwd><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC012775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoppik</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehrlich</surname><given-names>David E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schoppik</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zebrafish use their sense of gravity and their cerebellum to coordinate the fin and body movements that, as they develop, allow them to better maintain balance as they climb.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To locomote, the nervous system coordinates multiple effectors, such as the trunk and limbs or fins, that collectively generate propulsive forces and maintain body posture. For example, humans walk by using the legs to move the body forward, swinging the arms to reduce angular momentum, and using axial musculature to support the trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collins et al., 2009</xref>). As animals mature they change the way they coordinate these effectors, a process driven both by experience and by changing motor goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sporns and Edelman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thelen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolph, 1997</xref>). However, which sensations and goals guide the development of coordination is poorly understood. During development, both physical body shape and neural coordination change simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickinson et al., 2000</xref>). Understanding the constraints that guide neural control of coordination therefore requires a model in which the maturation of locomotion can be dissociated from changes in physical form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thelen and Ulrich, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Development of coordination is simplified under water, where individual effectors function dissociably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">von Holst, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sfakiotakis et al., 1999</xref>). Whereas forces generated while walking ultimately act through the feet, fish bodies and fins serve as independent control surfaces that need not be used in concert. For example, fish can climb in the water column using pectoral fins or body/caudal fin undulation, meaning a given climb can be executed with varying mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleyev, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Webb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilga and Lauder, 2002</xref>). These mechanics can be defined with respect to common mechanics of flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Bodies that move in the direction they point – like a rocket – must direct thrust upwards by pitching upwards in order to climb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munk, 1924</xref>). Similarly, fish pitch upwards to direct thrust from the body/caudal fin, particularly fish with dorsoventrally symmetric bodies that generate minimal lift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Magnuson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ullén et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, bodies that generate lift – like a helicopter with its rotor – can remain horizontal while climbing. Fishes can produce lift using their pectoral fins (see technical note in Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleyev, 1977</xref>). When a fish generates lift with its pectoral fins, it moves upwards relative to its body posture, creating a non-zero attack angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45839.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Larvae climb using bodies and pectoral fins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of hydrostatic climbing mechanics.

Fish can achieve a given swimming trajectory using various combinations of fin and body movements. For a steering maneuver of a given magnitude, as the fins contribute more the body must contribute less, requiring smaller posture changes. Division of labor among the body and fins therefore impacts how posture varies, specifically in the pitch (nose-up/nose-down) axis. Many fish actively maintain horizontal posture, even during the first days of swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bagnall and McLean, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017a</xref>), which the fins may facilitate. Pectoral fin and body movements occur synchronously in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2011</xref>), but the fins appear dispensable for routine swimming in the roll and yaw axes at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hale, 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that fish regulate fin-body coordination in the pitch axis as they develop, learning to increasingly utilize their fins to better maintain balance as they climb.</p><p>To examine how and why fish regulate fin-body coordination across development, we studied larval zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as they spontaneously climbed in the water column. We compared groups of siblings, or clutches, throughout the larval stage (3–30 days post-fertilization, dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parichy et al., 2009</xref>). Larvae locomote in discrete bouts approximately once per second, simplifying kinematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marques et al., 2018</xref>). We found that larvae climbed with steeper trajectories than would be predicted from posture alone – evidence they were actively generating lift. After fin amputation, larvae no longer generated lift. We found that larvae at all ages exhibited correlated fin-driven lift and body rotations, strong evidence for active fin-body coordination. Consistently, we found that fin-body coordination was abolished in vestibular mutants with an impaired sense of balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2017</xref>) and perturbed by cerebellar lesions.</p><p>Developing larvae regulated fin-body coordination to rely increasingly on their fins during climbs. Consequentially, older larvae were observed to climb with balanced postures closer to horizontal. To understand why larvae at different ages coordinated their fins and bodies in different ways, we built a model to explore the trade-offs incurred by a drive to balance. Simulations showed that more mature coordination, dominated by pectoral fins, improved balance but cost greater effort (Appendix). We conclude that developmental changes to coordination help stabilize posture when climbing. Together, these data suggest that the vestibular sense guides the development of coordinated locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Larvae use pectoral fins to balance while climbing</title><p>First, we examined climbing kinematics of zebrafish late in the larval stage, from 2912 swim bouts captured from 45 larvae across 6 clutches at 3 weeks post-fertilization (wpf). Larvae tended to pitch upwards in order to swim upwards, yielding a positive correlation of trajectory and pitch-axis posture that reflected thrust-based climbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Spearman’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.81</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). In addition, larvae often swam with positive attack angles (defined here as the difference between trajectory and posture), swimming more upwards than they oriented, reflecting the production of lift. Larvae exhibited positive attack angles preferentially when climbing, in 92.5% of bouts with upwards trajectories (1866/2016). By comparison, larvae exhibited positive attack angles in only 13.8% of bouts when diving (124/896). Larvae therefore generate lift specifically when pitched upwards to climb.</p><p>We hypothesized that larvae generated lift using their pectoral fins, because they tend to abduct the fins while swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thorsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green and Hale, 2012</xref>) and did so when propelling upwards (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). When we amputated the pectoral fins and recorded 1890 bouts after 4–5 hr recovery, we found that positive attack angles were largely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Control larvae exhibited attack angles of 15.6° on average, compared to −8.0° for finless siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; n = 6 groups of 6–8 finless larvae, pairwise t-test: t<sub>5</sub> = 4.55, p = 0.0061). A finless larva simply propelled in the direction it pointed, exhibiting a trajectory that closely approximated its posture, albeit with a minor downward bias. Accordingly, finless larvae never made the near vertical climbs of control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Small negative attack angles exhibited by finless larvae are consistent with a slight negative buoyancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stewart and McHenry, 2010</xref>) and an observed tendency to sink between propulsive bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Pectoral fin amputation did not influence body rotations in the pitch axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) or swimming more generally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, amputation had no significant effect on bout maximum speed (paired t-test, p &gt; 0.05, t<sub>10</sub> = −1.14), displacement (t<sub>10</sub> = −1.66), rate (t<sub>10</sub> = 0.23), or absolute pitch-axis rotation (t<sub>10</sub> = 1.25). We conclude that larvae do not require their pectoral fins to pitch upwards and climb, presumably instead rotating using the body and caudal fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ullén et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall and Schoppik, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that larval pectoral fins are well suited for generating lift without torque because they attach near the body center of mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drucker and Lauder, 2002</xref>). Pectoral fins would therefore act over a small moment arm to generate torques in the pitch axis, making those torques small. We measured the rostrocaudal positions of pectoral fin attachment from 15 larvae and compared those to morphometrically estimated positions of the center of mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017a</xref>). Indeed, the pectoral fins attached consistently near the center of mass, on average 0.056 ± 0.007 body lengths rostrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The position of the pectoral fins in larval zebrafish may therefore facilitate dissociation of lift- and thrust-based climbing, enabling larvae to specifically use pectoral fins to produce lift without causing pitch-axis body rotation.</p><p>Following pectoral fin amputation, larvae compensated for loss of lift by changing their posture. Specifically, larvae rotated further from horizontal in order to climb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to produce climbs steeper than 20°, finless larvae pitched significantly further upwards than control siblings; they adopted postures of 23.5° compared to 16.5° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; pairwise t-test, t<sub>5</sub> = 5.02, p = 0.0040).

Because larvae actively control their posture during swim bouts, we reasoned that they may acutely change posture in pitch to direct thrust up or down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017b</xref>). To assess whether larvae changed posture before generating thrust, we compared the timing of angular and linear accelerations during spontaneous swim bouts. We found that larvae at all ages produced large, pitch-axis angular acceleration preceding and during thrust generation, when they accelerated forwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Angular acceleration lasted approximately 100 ms and peaked 62.5 ms before larvae ceased generating thrust and began linear deceleration. We defined the steering-related posture change of a bout from 25 to 75 ms before linear deceleration, and observed that all larvae exhibited comparable posture changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; Two-way ANOVA, main effect of age: F<sub>2,6</sub> = 2.21, p = 0.19; main effect of clutch: F<sub>3,6</sub> = 1.89, p = 0.23).</p><p>Larvae used their fins and bodies synergistically, particularly during steep climbs. Larvae at all ages exhibited positively correlated attack angles and posture changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with Spearman’s correlation coefficients of 0.27 ± 0.08 at 1 wpf (mean ± S.D. across clutches), 0.38 ± 0.13 at 2 wpf, and 0.37± 0.14 at 3 wpf (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In particular, larvae paired large, upwards posture changes (&gt;5°) with positive attack angles; of 210 bouts with such posture changes across all ages, 193 (92%) had positive attack angles (binomial test: p = 1.5E-21, given 63.4% of all bouts had positive attack angles).</p><p>To confirm that young larvae, like older larvae, generated positive attack angles using pectoral fins, we examined the effects of fin amputation at 1 wpf. Large attack angles (greater than 15°) were rare but observable in control larvae at 1 wpf (3.8%, 81/2652 bouts). In contrast, large attack angles were nearly abolished in siblings following pectoral fin amputation (0.6%, 16/2630 bouts; n = 6 groups of 7–8 finless larvae, pairwise t-test: t<sub>5</sub> = 4.40, p = 0.0070). We conclude larvae at all ages coordinated their fins and bodies in order to climb.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Developing larvae regulate fin-body coordination</title><p>Correlations between body and fin actions changed with age. Specifically, younger larvae paired a given posture change with smaller attack angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As a first pass, we quantified the ratio of attack angles to posture changes during shallow climbs (with posture changes from 0° to 3°) using a robust slope estimate; with age, the ratio of attack angles to posture changes nearly tripled, from 0.71:1 at 1 wpf to 1.61:1 at 2 wpf and 2.00:1 at 3 wpf. We conclude that older larvae produced small climbs with greater contribution from the pectoral fins.</p><p>Larvae at all ages made the steepest climbs similarly, pairing the largest posture changes (5°−10°) with comparable attack angles (10°−20°, on average). Attack angles reached an asymptote as a function of posture change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which we interpret as a physical constraint on attack angle; after maximizing attack angle, larvae could only climb more steeply by rotating further upwards. Because larvae at all ages exhibit comparable swimming speeds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, Two-way ANOVA with main effects of age and clutch, F<sub>2,6</sub> = 0.94, p = 0.44), similar maximal attack angles reflect similar dorsal acceleration from the pectoral fins. The same fin-mediated acceleration would require greater force generation, given increasing body mass. Consistently, pectoral fins grew with age but maintained similar proportional lengths to the body at 1 wpf (0.098 ± 0.010 body lengths), 2 wpf (0.110 ± 0.008), and 3 wpf (0.114 ± 0.008, n = 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; One-way ANOVA, F<sub>2,42</sub> = 13.19, p = 3.60E−5). These data suggest that larvae do not become physically more capable of climbing with the fins as they develop.</p><p>Instead, developing larvae changed how they distributed labor among the body and fins. Older larvae used the largest attack angles to climb on a greater proportion of bouts than younger larvae. Larvae at 3 wpf paired 2–3° posture changes with large 15.2° attack angles; although larvae at 1 and 2 wpf were capable of generating large attack angles, they paired 2–3° posture changes with attack angles of 5.8° and 8.8°, respectively. Furthermore, older larvae exhibited near-maximal fin use (&gt;10° attack angle) on a far greater proportion of bouts (5.4% at 1 wpf, 19.9% at 2 wpf, and 38.7% at 3 wpf). On average, larvae exhibited gradually increasing attack angles with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>marginals</italic>; main effect of age by two-way ANOVA, F<sub>2,6</sub> = 9.46, p = 0.014), with significantly smaller angles at 1 wpf (1.02°) than 3 wpf (8.11°, p = 0.004; Tukey’s posthoc test). Together, these data suggest that changes in fin-body coordination, rather than physical ability, account for the nearly 8-fold increase in average attack angles from 1 to 3 wpf.</p><p>To model how attack angle varied as a function of posture change, we fit data with sigmoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We used logistic functions comprising four parameters: one to capture sigmoid amplitude, another for sigmoid steepness, and two for location (see Materials and methods). Three parameters (for sigmoid amplitude and location) did not significantly differ across ages, further support for the hypothesis that fin capability is constrained across early development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the dimensionless steepness parameter significantly varied with age.</p><p>Sigmoid steepness captured fin-body coordination throughout development, reflecting increasing engagement of the fins relative to the body. We termed the maximal slope of the sigmoid the ‘fin-body ratio.’ This ratio increased more than four-fold with age (from 2.9 at 1 wpf to 7.0 at 2 wpf and 12.0 at 3 wpf) after fixing the remaining three parameters at their means across ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We conclude that larvae at all ages were capable of the same range of attack angles, but older larvae favored the fins when climbing, pairing large attack angles with smaller posture changes.</p><p>The fin-body ratio was sufficient to describe variations in climbing behavior across clutches. We measured fin-body ratio for individual clutches at each age, combining data over two successive recording days for good sigmoid fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The fin-body ratio exhibited a significant positive correlation with mean attack angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, Pearson’s <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.94, p = 5.6E-6) but not mean trajectory (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.29, p = 0.28) or the frequency of steep climbs (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.40, p = 0.13). Furthermore, the fin-body ratio reflected clutch differences in development of fin use; only clutches with increased fin-body ratios from 2 to 3 wpf displayed increased attack angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data suggest larvae swam with more lift while making the same climbs simply by biasing the composition of fin-body coordination toward the fins.</p><p>Beyond simply describing the relationship between fin and body actions, the fin-body ratio was related to balance performance. Larvae without fins exhibited worse balance in the pitch axis by adopting postures further from the horizontal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). In intact fish, pitch-axis posture was correlated with the fin-body ratio. Specifically, this ratio exhibited a significant negative correlation with the absolute deviation from horizontal posture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> = −0.74, p = 6.3E-3). During climbs steeper than 20°, larvae at 1 wpf adopted postures pitched significantly more upwards (28.0°; two-way ANOVA, main effect of age: F<sub>2,6</sub> = 25.29, p = 0.0012) than larvae at 2 wpf (19.7°; Tukey’s test, p = 0.0040) or 3 wpf (17.7°; Tukey’s test, p = 0.0013). The fin-body ratio also reflected clutch differences in development of balance; the lone clutch exhibiting a large decrease in fin-body ratio from 2 to 3 wpf (from 9.0 to 6.4) also exhibited worse balance, with larger deviation from horizontal at 3 wpf (11.0°) than at 2 wpf (8.6°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, clutch 3). Regardless of age, larvae that preferentially used their fins to climb remained nearer horizontal. We conclude that a single parameter, the fin-body ratio, captures variability of fin-body coordination across development and its consequences for balance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Fin-body coordination requires vestibular sensation</title><p>To confirm that correlated fin and body actions arose due to coordination rather than biomechanics, we tested whether fin-body correlations were influenced by sensory perturbation. Specifically, we hypothesized that vestibular sensation promoted fin-body coordination, because coordination was correlated with measures of balance performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2F</xref>) and vestibular stimuli can elicit pectoral fin movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timerick et al., 1990</xref>).

By comparison, control siblings exhibited positive attack angles on 112 of 141 bouts with large, upwards posture changes (p = 5.2E-8, given that 57.9% of bouts had positive attack angles).

Best-fit sigmoids captured the tendency to engage the fins during large positive and negative posture changes. For larvae with Purkinje cell lesions, the largest magnitude slope of the nose-down sigmoid significantly differed from 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; −4.09). Furthermore, that slope did not significantly differ in magnitude from the slope of the best-fit nose-up sigmoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; 6.50). In contrast, the double sigmoid was overparameterized for fitting control data, and the maximal slope of the nose-down sigmoid did not differ from 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; −0.22; see Materials and methods). Finally, the slope of the nose-up sigmoid was significantly larger for larvae with Purkinje cell lesions compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; 6.50 vs. 1.69). We conclude that the cerebellum actively suppresses fin-mediated lift generation during pitch-axis steering. Our data suggest a dual role for cerebellar regulation of fin-body coordination: to bias division of labor towards the body, and to prevent the production of conflicting fin-body actions (generating lift during body-mediated diving).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used a new model to study coordinated movements and discovered a fundamental role for the vestibular sense in the development of locomotor coordination. First, we demonstrated that to climb, zebrafish larvae used upward-orienting body rotations and lift-producing pectoral fin actions. Larvae actively coordinated two independent effectors, the trunk and the pectoral fins, to locomote upward. As they developed, larvae came to match larger fin actions with smaller body rotations. Younger larvae were capable of the same independent fin and body actions as older larvae, suggesting fin-body coordination matures due to neural rather than physical changes. Because manipulation and natural variation of coordination impacted posture, we hypothesized that coordination was regulated by sensations about posture transduced by the vestibular system. Mutants with deficient vestibular sensation did not coordinate the trunk and fins despite performing similar body and fin actions, linking the vestibular sense to coordination. Cerebellar lesions uncovered conflicting fin-body actions, revealing a neural substrate for regulation of fin-body coordination. Taken together, our data show how the vestibular sense comes to shape the development of coordinated locomotion.</p><p>Our data establish a locomotor function for pectoral fins in larval zebrafish. Previous work using larvae examined pectoral fin kinematics during yaw and roll turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hale, 2014</xref>). Few differences were observed in yaw and roll between wild-type fish and mutants lacking pectoral fins. Instead, pectoral fin movements <italic>between</italic> bouts led the authors to propose the intriguing hypothesis that pectoral fin movements played a role in respiration. Complementarily, we find that larvae use their pectoral fins during climbing bouts to generate lift. These data establish a novel locomotor function for fins in larval zebrafish, providing a more complete picture of their utility.</p><p>Climbing mechanics are well-established for adult fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleyev, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Webb, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drucker and Lauder, 2002</xref>). While we define a role for the pectoral fins in larval zebrafish climbing, the relevant kinematics remain unknown. Our work establishes several important constraints on the maturation of pectoral fin function. First, fin loss had no apparent impact on the ability of larvae to rotate their bodies in the pitch axis. Consistently, we observed that pectoral fins were located rostrocaudally near the estimated body center of mass, yielding a small moment arm in the pitch axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drucker and Lauder, 2002</xref>). Second, across development, larvae exhibited similar maximal attack angles, suggesting that lift (and thrust; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van Leeuwen et al., 2015</xref>) forces scale with body mass as larvae develop. Comparable function of the pectoral fins with age may reflect their musculoskeletal simplicity in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thorsen and Hale, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hale, 2014</xref>). In contrast to larvae, mature fish use their pectoral fins both to steer and as proprioceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aiello et al., 2017</xref>). Future work relating pectoral fin kinematics to vertical wake structure in developing zebrafish stands to illuminate how morphological maturation permits increasingly sophisticated movements with age.</p><p>We found that larval zebrafish coordinated their pectoral fins and bodies, controlling them independently but using them synergistically to facilitate climbing. Importantly, larvae missing their utricular otoliths, that is, gravity-blind mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2017</xref>), did not coordinate fin and body actions despite performing each independent action typically. Two important conclusions follow from the mutant experiments. First, coordination of fin and body actions reflects patterned control, distinct from movements that are correlated simply due to biomechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collins et al., 2001</xref>). Second, though gravity-blind mutants could swim with a normal dorsal-up orientation in the light, utricular information is necessary for properly coordinated climbing. In mutant fish, posture changes and attack angles (reflecting body- and fin-mediated climbing, respectively) were normal, but unrelated. Synergistic fin and body actions therefore reflect a neural transformation of vestibular information into correlated commands for climbing.</p><p>Our discovery that loss of the utricular otoliths abolishes synergistic fin and body actions reveals a sensory, and specifically vestibular, origin for the signals guiding coordinated climbing. On land, animals can infer their orientation relative to gravity from sensed pressure and muscle tension, allowing touch and proprioception to guide posture and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>). In zebrafish, recent work has identified a class of spinal proprioceptors that provide feedback during axial locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knafo and Wyart, 2018</xref>), and ascending feedback from the spinal cord in swimming tadpoles can drive compensatory ocular reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Combes et al., 2008</xref>). However, under water, the homogeneous physical environment necessitates vestibular strategies to guide coordinated locomotion with respect to gravity – such as the climbs we have studied here. Links between the vestibular system and postural orientation in the pitch axis are present in evolutionarily ancient vertebrates such as lamprey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orlovsky et al., 1992</xref>). Vestibular information can drive pectoral fin movements in chondrichthyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timerick et al., 1990</xref>), one of the earliest classes in which pectoral fins appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coates, 1994</xref>). Considerable morphological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shubin et al., 2006</xref>) and molecular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jung et al., 2018</xref>) work underscores the importance of the pectoral fins in the evolution of terrestrial appendages and gaits necessary for locomotion. Our findings extend this work by linking sensed gravity to the underwater climbing behaviors these ancient appendages serve.</p><p>Considering the development of coordination an optimization process, maturation may be driven by a gradual approach to a fixed, optimal coordination, or a change in the definition of optimal coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sporns and Edelman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adolph and Tamis-LeMonda, 2014</xref>). Specifically, fin bias may increase with age because optimal fin use gradually becomes possible or because large fin bias becomes optimal. Based on simulations of swimming using empirical coordination at different ages (Appendix), we propose that coordination may develop due to a change in the definition of optimal locomotion. Specifically, younger larvae generate fin-body coordination that primarily minimizes the effort required to steer, while older larvae generate fin-dominated steering that is optimized more for maintaining balance. Ultimately, defining the contribution of cost function dynamics to the development of motor control and specifically coordination will require acute manipulations of performance or feedback.</p><p>The cerebellum has long been recognized for its role both in enabling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morton and Bastian, 2004</xref>) and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thach, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bastian, 2006</xref>) coordinated movements, though the computations responsible remain contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manto et al., 2012</xref>). We found that ablation of cerebellar Purkinje cells perturbed fin-body coordination, leading to the production of conflicting actions in which larvae generated fin-mediated lift while making nose-down rotations. Furthermore, ablation changed fin-body coordination during nose-up rotations, causing larvae to pair stronger fin actions with the same body rotation. We conclude that the cerebellum acts to suppress lift generation by the fins during body rotations, and thereby prevents the production of conflicting actions. Purkinje cells in the lateral cerebellum of zebrafish, labeled in the driver line used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takeuchi et al., 2015</xref>), project to vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matsui et al., 2014</xref>) and respond to rotational visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knogler et al., 2019</xref>) and vestibular stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Favre-Bulle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Migault et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, cerebellar lesions in the dogfish result in profound impairment of pectoral fin reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paul and Roberts, 1979</xref>). Combining quantitative measurements of locomotion and molecularly-targeted perturbations has begun to yield new insights into cerebellar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, climbing in zebrafish will likely prove to be a uniquely tractable entry point into the study of the cerebellum’s role in the development of coordinated locomotion.</p><p>Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the bottleneck to developing coordination lies in perceptual rather than motor capacity. Young larvae were physically capable of producing large attack angles with the fins while rotating their bodies to climb. Further, the range of body rotations larvae produced did not change across development. We therefore propose that swimming development does not require unlocking or composing new actions, but instead involves selecting a particular combination of equally functional innate actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grillner and Wallén, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sporns and Edelman, 1993</xref>). As in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beraneck et al., 2014</xref>), the capacity of the vestibular system to stabilize gaze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bianco et al., 2012</xref>) and posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017a</xref>) improves markedly with age. In mature animals, vestibular information is thought to be weighted by reliability for perceptual computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Angelaki et al., 2009</xref>), consistent with learning rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Körding and Wolpert, 2004</xref>) that may underlie locomotor development. We propose that the fundamental limit on locomotor development reflects not motor capabilities, but peripheral or central limits to perceived posture.</p><p>Existing literature suggests a candidate neural substrate for the vestibular signals that underlie perceived posture and promote coordination. The utricles transduce body orientation and self-motion but are insensitive to vertical forces orthogonal to the utricular macula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flock, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2012</xref>), and should therefore be irrelevant for execution or perception of lift forces directly. A central origin for the signals that guide coordination is therefore more plausible, specifically in the utricle-recipient hindbrain vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schoppik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall and Schoppik, 2018</xref>). One of these, the tangential nucleus, contains ‘Ascending-Descending’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bianco et al., 2012</xref>). These neurons are distinguished by bifurcating axons that project rostrally, ascending to a midbrain nucleus, the nucleus of the medial longidutinal fasciculus, a region responsible for descending control of swim kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Severi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thiele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang and McLean, 2014</xref>). Ascending-Descending neurons are anatomically poised to also relay otolith-derived signals to the pectoral fins, as they make descending projections to the locus of the pectoral fin motoneurons: the caudal hindbrain/rostral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2010</xref>). Pectoral fin motoneurons have been studied in the context of axial swimming, and this work has established that rostral hindbrain-derived signals are important for proper pectoral fin control during fast swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green and Hale, 2012</xref>). In order to convey feedback to pectoral motoneurons about pitch-axis postural changes, Ascending-Descending neurons would need to encode angular velocity, consistent with the transient responses to pitch-axis posture changes of neurons in the fish tangential nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suwa et al., 1999</xref>) and with hindbrain vestibular responses more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laurens et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that the Ascending-Descending neurons in the tangential vestibular nucleus are therefore a candidate cellular substrate by which utricular information comes to regulate fin-body coordination.</p><p>Considerable effort has gone into defining the fundamental principles by which coordination emerges during locomotor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bernstein, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Newell and McDonald, 1994</xref>). Maturation of coordination is thought to permit optimization of locomotion based on experience, and to facilitate adaptations to changing motor goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sporns and Edelman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thelen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolph, 1997</xref>). Further, mature patterns of locomotion may be generally disfavored until balance can be maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thelen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Woollacott et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yogev-Seligmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolph, 2016</xref>). Broadly, the complexity of terrestrial biomechanics has made it difficult to understand why animals change the way they locomote, and how they accomplish these changes. We studied a simpler system – climbing underwater – to disentangle corporeal development from maturation of motor control. We discovered that the vestibular system shapes synergies between fin and body actions as larval fish learn to climb. Taken together, our work supports a fundamental role for the vestibular sense in the development of coordinated locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish husbandry and lines</title><p>Procedures involving larval zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of New York University.

Five clutches of 16 siblings each, eight lacking utricles (<italic>otogelin -/-</italic>) and eight phenotypic controls (<italic>otog+/-</italic> or <italic>otog+/+</italic>), were measured at 1 wpf before homozygous mutants develop utricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bagnall and Schoppik, 2018</xref>).

The thin tank (10 mm) restricted swimming near the focal plane. Water temperature was maintained at 26 °C in an enclosure with overhead LEDs on a 14/10 hr light/dark cycle. Video was captured using digital CMOS cameras (BFLY-PGE-23S6M, Point Grey Research, Richmond, BC, Canada) equipped with close-focusing, manual zoom lenses (18–108 mm Macro Zoom 7000 Lens, Navitar, Inc, Rochester, NY) with f-stop set to 16 to maximize depth of focus. The field-of-view, approximately 2 × 2 cm, was aligned concentrically with the tank face. A 5W 940 nm infrared LED backlight (eBay) was transmitted through an aspheric condenser lens with a diffuser (ACL5040-DG15-B, ThorLabs, NJ). An infrared filter (43–953, Edmund Optics, NJ) was placed in the light path before the imaging lens.</p><p>Video acquisition was performed as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017a</xref>).

In each frame, the position of the visual center of mass and posture (body orientation in the pitch, or nose-up/down, axis) were collected. Posture was defined as the orientation, relative to horizontal, of the line passing through the visual centroid that minimizes the visual moment of inertia, such that a larva with posture zero has its longitudinal axis horizontal.</p><p>Supplemental videos at high spatial resolution were alternatively filmed in a thinner glass tank (96/G/5 24 × 5 × 5 mm, Starna Cells, Inc) using a Sony IMX174 CMOS chip (ace acA1920-155um, Basler AG, Germany) equipped with a high-magnification fixed focus lens (Infinistix 0.5x, Infinity Optical Company, Boulder CO) and a high-pass infrared filter (Optcast 43948, Edmund Optics). Infrared illumination was provided by multiple high-power LEDs (5W 940 nm center wavelength, eBay); one, mounted behind the tank, provided transmitted light, passed through an aspheric condenser lens with diffuser (ACL5040-DG15-B) and a piece of Cinegel #3026 Filter paper (Rosco USA, Stamford CT). Three additional infrared LEDs were mounted between the lens and the tank to provide reflected illumination: one coupled to a fiber optic ring light (Optcast 54176, Edmund Optics) mounted on the lens barrel, and two additional bare LEDs mounted on either side of the tank at 45°angles. Full-frame (1900x1200, 8-bit) video capture was triggered at 60 Hz with a 7 ms exposure time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavior analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA).

The displacement across each pair of frames at speeds above 5 mm·s<sup>−1</sup> were summed to find net bout displacement. Attack angle was defined as the difference between trajectory and posture of a larva at the peak speed of a bout, such that a larvae pointed horizontally and moving vertically upwards had an attack angle of 90°. Posture change during a bout was defined as the difference in body orientation observed 25 and 75 ms before peak speed, when rotations correlate with changes to trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehrlich and Schoppik, 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Instantaneous bout rate was defined as the inverse of the interval between the first frame exceeding 5 mm·s<sup>−1</sup> in each of two successive bouts captured in a single epoch.

Inter-bout duration was computed as the difference between inverse bout rate (instantaneous bout period) and bout duration.

As our fish swim in stagnant water, this trajectory is assumed to oppose the direction of flow. Our definition describes the orientation of an element’s long axis relative to flow, consistent with the terminology in fluid dynamics. Our fish vary the direction of motion with respect to the body, and we are specifically interested in control of steering. Accordingly, we consider attack angles of the body because they are the consequence of forces orthogonal to the body long axis – by which the fish steer upwards and downwards. We refer to these upwards forces as ‘lift’ and attribute them to pectoral fins by inference, based on loss of positive attack angles following fin amputation. However, we have no data that speak to fin kinematics or the mechanics of force production; for example whether lift is generated by fin strokes or flow over fins due to body-mediated motion, or if the fins produce vertical thrust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aleyev, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Westneat et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data sharing</title><p>Raw data and analysis code are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.schoppiklab.com/">http://www.schoppiklab.com/</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Communication Disorders under award DC012775 to DS and an Emerging Research Grant from Hearing Health Foundation to DE.

larvae change how they divide labor between the fins and body? In other words, what cost function are larvae optimizing when they regulate fin-body coordination? To address this question, we built a simple computational model that allowed us to parameterize the division of labor between the fins and body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>, details in Materials and methods). In this control-theoretic model, a larva swam towards a target (up or down) by comparing the target’s direction to the direction it would swim without steering (its current posture). From this difference the larva generated a steering command. The larva steered its swim bouts by using its fins to generate lift and its body to direct thrust.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45839.018</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>A one-parameter control system captures fin-body coordination <italic>in silico</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Circuit diagram to transform pitch-axis steering commands into climbing swims using the body and pectoral fins. Steering commands are defined by the direction of a target in egocentric coordinates. The relative weight of commands to rotate the body (to direct thrust) and produce an attack angle with the fins (by generating lift) is dictated by fin bias (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf59"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>). To model physical transformations from commands into kinematic variables, commands to the body and fins are filtered to impose empirically-derived ceilings and floors on posture changes and attack angles (see Materials and methods).

To vary the ratio of fin and body actions (attack angles and posture changes, respectively), the command was differentially scaled for the fins and body.

Commands were transformed into kinematic variables according to physical transfer functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>) that increased approximately linearly near the origin, such that weak commands were faithfully transformed to movement; for large positive and negative commands, transfer functions reached asymptotes to model physical limitations. The asymptotes imposed empirically-derived constraints on the range of posture changes (−17.0 to +13.2°) and attack angles (−2.9 to +14.0°) of each bout. Additionally, Gaussian noise was added to swim trajectory to model errors in motor control and effects of external forces like convective water currents that move larvae (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf73"><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><p>The model permitted simulation of larvae across development, because sigmoid slope (and therefore fin bias) captured developmental changes to swimming.

Simulated attack angles and posture changes were sigmoidally related, with steeper sigmoid slopes for older larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). Simply by varying fin bias, simulated larvae exhibited mean attack angles comparable to empirical values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1D</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jennifer L Raymond ad the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kimberly McArthur (Reviewer #2); Hans Straka (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study employed behavioral analysis to explore the coordination of locomotion and posture in larval zebrafish. The results reveal a developmental change in the coordination between axial musculature and pectoral fins during swimming, with a greater usage of pectoral fins to generate lift in older animals, and increasingly more stable (horizontal) posture. A key finding is that vestibular signals from the utricular otoliths, which sense pitch, are critical to the coordinated engagement of pectoral fins to generate lift during upward swimming. In addition, the results indicate that the cerebellum functions to suppress pectoral fin recruitment, especially during &quot;nose&quot;-down swimming when pectoral recruitment would be antagonistic, but also during nose-up swimming. Computational modeling is used to explore explanations for the developmental plasticity in the coordination of body and fin movements.</p><p>This is a unique piece of work. The authors' description of the vertical motion of zebrafish in the water column is meticulous, providing a convincing platform for all further experiments. The results establish a tractable model for studying the neural substrates of the development of motor coordination, in which: 1) component behaviors are already functional, but their relative deployment changes with age; and 2) motor coordination impacts posture, but in a simpler way than typically occurs in terrestrial vertebrates.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear what the model adds. The proposal regarding a trade-off between effort and &quot;balance&quot; is intriguing, but the reviewers were not convinced that the modeling rigorously supports it, and wondered whether the paper might actually be stronger without the modeling. Though not immediately clear from the Results as written, the increased modeled effort during fin-biased swims seems to be driven by an increase in the number of maneuvers needed to reach a target. This seems to assume that the fish does not compensate for its motor strategy when executing an upward swim – that it will plan a given trajectory change in pitch, but always fall short of that change whenever fin bias is nonzero. Since the empirical behavioral data was recorded during spontaneous swims, there is no available data to support that assumption.</p><p>The authors should consider removing the model from the manuscript, and include the idea of a potential trade-off between effort and posture in the Discussion as compelling speculation, grounded in the rigorous behavioral data. At the very least, the description and the associated discussion of the model should be streamlined considerably.</p><p>2) The authors would like to conclude that &quot;balance&quot; plays a fundamental role in the development of fin-body coordination. The word &quot;balance&quot; is used throughout, and this word lacks some important precision (though it may enhance readability). If the authors intend &quot;balance&quot; to mean the sense of balance from the vestibular system, then the big conclusion (stated in the title) is consistent with the data: abolishing the otolith organs also abolishes normal fin-body coordination, consistent with a role for the vestibular system in development and/or execution of coordination. However, it seems that the authors intend &quot;balance&quot; to mean the drive to maintain a horizontal (upright) posture. This is a more provocative (and interesting) proposal, but it seems to be a step beyond what can be definitively concluded from the data. Indeed, the authors state it as a proposal in the Introduction (which is quite well-written), but employ it as a conclusion in the title and Discussion.</p><p>3) Currently the authors use a very technical language that makes it rather difficult to link the descriptions of e.g. slopes and sigmoid shapes with a particular behavioral parameter. Even though the &quot;attack angle&quot; was properly described in the beginning, it is still a very vague term that might be better explained throughout the manuscript by using additional icons in each figure. Also, the very detailed and often complicated descriptions impair grasping the major take-home message despite the summarizing sentences at the end of each part.</p><p>4) Though several possibilities are sprinkled throughout the text, the Discussion would benefit from a clear laying-out of the possible implications of the study (which are really interesting), regarding developmental changes in the animal's ability to generate optimal coordinated behaviors and/or changes in what the optimal coordinated behavior actually entails (more/less fin bias). If the definition of &quot;optimal&quot; doesn't change, then the animal's ability to execute it must be changing (possibly due to immature vestibular input, as suggested by the authors in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion; possibly due to immature coordination circuitry somewhere else; probably not due to changes in motor ability, from the study's results). If the ability to execute doesn't change, then the definition of &quot;optimal&quot; must be changing. The authors allude to the possibility that maintaining horizontal posture might be increasingly related to performance with age (Discussion, ninth paragraph), but don't discuss further. Articulating a clear theoretical framework in the Discussion would strengthen an already strong paper, by providing a blueprint for future experiments.</p><p>Title: As discussed above (see point #2) the conclusion stated in the title can be taken as more of a proposal by the authors, rather than a summary of what they've demonstrated. The title should be rewritten to for clarity, to disambiguate the dual use of the word &quot;balance.&quot;</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A primal role for the sense of balance in the development of coordinated locomotion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The implications noted here were originally framed with respect to the model, which is the only part of the study that directly speaks to questions of optimality. To address the first point in the Revisions, we have moved the model to a separate Appendix. Therefore we expound on these ideas in a new paragraph added to the Appendix (&quot;Conclusions about optimizing coordination&quot;). &quot;</p><p>A few lines about these ideas in the Discussion would be helpful. The model can stay in the Appendix, and be referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>A new paragraph (“Considering the development of coordination and optimization process…”) outlines these ideas in the main text Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
