protein (Kif15) implicated in spindle mechanics and chromosome movement. In this study, we reconstitute full-length hKif15 and its microtubule-targeting factor hTpx2 in vitro to gain insight into the motors mode of operation. We reveal that hKif15 is a plus-end-directed processive homotetramer that can step against loads of up to 3.5 pN. We further show that hKif15 is the first kinesin that effectively switches microtubule tracks at intersections, enabling it to navigate microtubule networks, such as the spindle. hKif15 tetramers are also capable of cross-linking microtubules, but unexpectedly, this does not depend on hTpx2. Instead, we find that hTpx2 inhibits hKif15 stepping when microtubule-bound. Our data reveal that hKif15 is a second tetrameric spindle motor in addition to the kinesin-5 Eg5 and provides insight into the mechanisms by which hKif15 and its inhibitor hTpx2 modulate spindle microtubule architecture.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01724.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01724.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01724.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Before a cell can divide, it produces an extra copy of all its chromosomes, and it must then ensure that each daughter cell ends up with one copy of each chromosome. During the division process, a structure called the spindle forms in the cell. This spindle is made of thread-like extensions called microtubules that grow from two poles at opposite ends of the cell. These microtubules are responsible for getting the chromosomes to line up in the middle of the cell, and then pulling half of the chromosomes to one end of the cell, and half to the other end. The cell then divides into two daughter cells.</p><p>Two motor proteins—so-called because they consume chemical energy to ‘walk’ along the microtubules—have important roles in this process: Kif11 motor proteins mainly drive the formation of the spindle and thus division of the chromosomes. A cell that does not contain Kif11 can only divide if it contains extra copies of a second motor protein called Kif15: this suggests that Kif15 can serve as some sort of back up for Kif11.</p><p>Normal cells only divide when new cells are needed for growth or to replace old cells that have died. Cancer cells, on the other hand, divide in a way that is not controlled. Drugs that interfere with Kif11 have been developed in the hope that they will stop cancer cells dividing, but these drugs have not been very effective in clinical tests, possibly due to the Kif15 back up. Scientists hope, therefore, that a better understanding of the role of Kif15 may lead to improved cancer treatments.</p><p>Drechsler et al. have isolated individual Kif15 motor proteins and used advanced microscopy techniques to study them in action. These experiments showed that Kif15 motor proteins can travel long distances along a single microtubule, and can also switch to a different microtubule at intersections. This movement of Kif15 is stopped when they bump into Tpx2 proteins, which are sitting on the microtubules. Together, these proteins can also form links between microtubules that can withstand high forces. These properties provide a starting point to understand how Kif15 can act as a back up for Kif11 in cells. In the future, it will be important to work out how Kif11 and Kif15 motor proteins work together in teams to build the spindle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01724.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01724.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>kinesin-12</kwd><kwd>mitotic spindle</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie Cancer Care</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drechsler</surname><given-names>Hauke</given-names></name><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Toni</given-names></name><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name><name><surname>McAinsh</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Warwick Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drechsler</surname><given-names>Hauke</given-names></name><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Toni</given-names></name><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name><name><surname>McAinsh</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first in vitro analysis of full-length human Kif15 provides insight into how hKif15 and its inhibitory binding partner hTpx2 modulate mitotic spindle architecture.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based protein machine with bipolar geometry that mediates chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dumont and Mitchison, 2009</xref>). Initial assembly of the spindle requires the separation of centrosomes by the homotetrameric plus-end-directed molecular motor Kif11 (Eg5)—a member of the kinesin-5 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tanenbaum and Medema, 2010</xref>). In vitro reconstitution experiments reveal that Kif11 can drive the outward sliding of anti-parallel microtubules thus providing a mechanistic basis for centrosome separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kapitein et al., 2005</xref>). Although essential for centrosome separation, Kif11 is not required to maintain subsequent spindle bipolarity due to the compensatory activity of the Kinesin-12 Kif15 (hKlp2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of hKif15 can overcome the absolute requirement for hKif11 in centrosome separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>). This functional redundancy has led to a model in which hKif15, like Kif11, can slide apart anti-parallel microtubules. Kinesin-12 proteins from <italic>Xenopus (xKlp2)</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wittmann et al., 1998</xref>), sea urchin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rogers et al., 2000</xref>), and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) are dimeric plus-end-directed motors that are targeted to the spindle by the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Tpx2 (targeting protein for xKlp2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wittmann et al., 1998</xref>). hKif15 is also recruited to the spindle microtubules by hTpx2 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>) with the interaction between dimeric hKif15 and hTpx2 hypothesised to enable the motor to cross-link and slide anti-parallel microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>). However, this model has been challenged by recent cell-biological studies showing that hKif15 localizes to kinetochore (k)-fibres (parallel microtubule bundles) and contributes to the generation of forces that counter those generated by hKif11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vladimirou et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how hKif11 and hKif15 cooperate during mitosis has important implications for cancer therapy because the clinical efficacy of hKif11 inhibitors, currently used as monotherapy, has proven largely disappointing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Rath and Kozielski, 2012</xref>). hKif15 is therefore emerging as a potentially important therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Groen, 2013</xref>). To understand how hKif15/hKif11 operate within the spindle, we will require a detailed mechanistic understanding of how each motor interacts with microtubules and generates force. Such information is already available for Kif11. In this study, we provide the first insight into the properties of the Kinesin-12 family motor hKif15.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>hKif15 is a processive tetrameric motor protein</title><p>Full-length human His<sub>6</sub>-Kif15 (hKif15), His<sub>6</sub>-Kif15-eGFP, and His<sub>6</sub>-Tpx2 (hTpx2) were expressed in insect SF9-cells and the recombinant proteins purified to near homogeneity by sequential affinity chromatography using a cation-exchange and a Co-NTA matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Analysis of His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 on native PAGE revealed that the protein migrates at ∼730 KDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Given the predicted molecular weight of His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 (164.8 kDa) our data suggest the presence of hKif15 tetramers, although hydrodynamic analysis of the frog (xKlp2) and Sea urchin (KRP<sub>180</sub>) Kif15 orthologues indicated that the motor is dimeric with a sedimentation coefficient of 8.1S and 8.3S respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wittmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rogers et al., 2000</xref>). To further characterise human Kif15, we subjected His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation on 5–40% glycerol gradients. At physiological ionic strengths (35 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 0-150 mM NaCl) both His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 and His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15-eGFP appear to be monodispersed and have apparent sedimentation coefficients of ∼12S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, increasing the salt concentration to 300 mM NaCl converts hKif15 into a species that runs at ∼8S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Taken together, our data show that hKif15 exists as a tetramer at physiological ionic strength that can be forced to dissociate into a dimer at high ionic strength. To further confirm that hKif15 can form tetramers we performed a size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), which allows determination of the absolute molecular weight. This analysis confirmed the presence of tetrameric hKif15 motors (molecular weight of 744.4 ± 14.1 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>1</italic><sup><italic>st</italic></sup> <italic>peak</italic>, <italic>blue line</italic>). We could also detect a dimeric population of motors (molecular weight of 360.1 ± 6.5 kDa) indicating that there is some degree of complex dissociation in solution under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>2</italic><sup><italic>nd</italic></sup> <italic>peak</italic>, <italic>orange line</italic>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01724.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Kif15 is a tetramer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel of purified His<sub>6</sub>-hTpx2, His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15, and His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15-GFP.

These experiments were done in buffer conditions (BRB20, 50 mM KCl) that would be expected to preserve hKif15 in a tetrameric state (from here on hKif15-eGFP refers to single tetrameric motors). The majority hKif15 motors move either by directional movement towards the plus-end of individual microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘<italic>P</italic>’) or by bidirectional 1D-diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘<italic>D</italic>’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) along the microtubule lattice. These types of movement are equally likely at all salt conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and single motors can switch between both modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Additionally, when motors reach the microtubule end, more than 90% remain attached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <italic>left</italic> note orange column).

This analysis showed that both processive and diffusive motors bleach in up to four steps, indicating the presence of four eGFP molecules per motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, processive tetramers are evident throughout the velocity distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data are in line with our biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and confirm that the observed hKif15-eGFP motors are indeed tetramers.</p><p>Within the mitotic spindle, motors will experience varying loads and thus it is essential to understand how a motor responds to force. We therefore investigated the mechanical properties of hKif15 motors using our single-bead laser trap set-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carter and Cross, 2005</xref>). Single hKif15 motors were adsorbed onto 550-nm diameter polystyrene beads and steered to the microtubule surface with the laser trap at which point the motor can bind to the lattice (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). With the trap turned off (zero-load) the mean velocity of beads moving on the microtubule was consistent with our measurements of hKif15-eGFP by TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Next, we held the bead in the trap and allowed the motor to walk along the microtubule, away from the centre of the trap. The motion of the bead reports the stepping actions of the motor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows two position traces in which hKif15 motors make a number of processive steps along the microtubule before detaching at relatively low loads between 1.5 and 3.5 pN. We also observed that beads move out the trap before moving back in the opposite direction without detaching (<italic>green arrowhead</italic>). These events may reflect the minus- and plus-end-directed diffusive motion observed in our TIRF experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Together with our TIRF microscopy, we conclude that hKif15 is a homotetramer that undergoes either diffusive movement along microtubules, processive plus-end-directed stepping over long-distances or short duration movements to the minus-end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>hKif15 effectively switches microtubule tracks</title><p>Our single molecule TIRF experiments also revealed a remarkable property of hKif15 motors as they approach microtubule intersections. The well-studied kinesin-1 will normally pass intersections and only in rare cases the motor will pause or switch microtubule tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ross et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, hKif15 motors show significantly elevated pause and switch events at intersections. Every fifth motor that approaches an intersection switches its microtubule track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1 video2">Videos 1 and 2</xref>). In general all events—pass, switch, pause, and dissociation at intersections—are equally likely. In this way, hKif15 is able to roam microtubule networks and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> demonstrates that one tetramer (see <italic>bleaching steps, lower panel</italic>) can indeed navigate along several different microtubules: the motor starts processive movement on microtubule #1 (trace A), eventually dissociates and rebinds to microtubule #2. On this, the motor diffuses a short distance (trace B) and dissociates again, just to rebind to microtubule #1. It processively follows microtubule #1 (trace C) and sequentially switches to microtubules #3 (trace D) and #4 (trace E), ending at the plus-end of microtubule #4 without detaching from the microtubule lattice(s) once again (see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Thus, Kif15 is a processive motor that is able to navigate microtubule networks by effectively switching microtubule tracks.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01724.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>hKif15 effectively switches microtubules at intersections.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kymographs showing the processive switch of an eGFP-labelled hKif15 motor at a microtubule–microtubule intersection.

To establish, whether tetrameric hKif15 indeed is able to cross-link microtubules on its own, we carried out experiments, in which biotinylated HiLyte-647-labelled GMP-CPP-microtubules were attached to a cover slip followed by addition of short XRhodamin-labelled GMP-CPP-stabilized- ‘transport’ microtubules and 1.4 nM tetrameric hKif15-eGFP. By drawing kymographs, we found that hKif15 could mediate the cross-linking of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) on its own, but that there was very little microtubule–microtubule sliding activity. Besides pivoting microtubules, we did observe episodes of bidirectional short duration sliding indicating a tug-of-war (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) and rarely the transport of short microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <italic>left</italic>): behaviours that were recently reported for the yeast Kinesin-8 Kip3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Su et al., 2013</xref>). However, we have no clear evidence to support the idea that hKif15 can drive continuous extensile sliding of anti-parallel microtubule bundles like hKif11. This is presumably because the motors frequently pause during processive excursions on the lattice and dwell at the ends for a long period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

However, cell-biological experiments showed that hTpx2 is essential for hKif15 to be recruited to the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). To resolve this contradiction, we first analysed possible complex formation of recombinant hKif15 and hTpx2 in solution by ultracentrifugation in glycerol gradients. With nanomolar concentrations of each protein, we could not observe any complex formation over a range of different salt conditions (50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 0/150/300/450 mM NaCl [data not shown] and 35 mM sodium phosphate buffer [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>]). However, a 30-fold excess of hTpx2 dimers (2.5 µM hTpx2 [dimer] + 80 nM hKif15 [tetramer]) allowed the formation of a hKif15-hTpx2 complex of ∼14.0S, which included approximately one third of the provided hKif15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>lower gels</italic>). The dissociation constant of the hKif15–hTpx2 complex is likely to be in the µM range arguing that its formation in vivo is less likely. In contrast, using a microtubule sedimentation assay, we observed that at low nM concentrations, hTpx2 (30 nM, dimer) does enhance the affinity of hKif15 (15 nM, tetramer) binding to GMP-CPP stabilised microtubules when in the presence of the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP (the fitted K<sub>d</sub> increasing ∼twofold from 993 nM to 490 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Addition of hTpx2 decreased the proportion of motile motors on microtubules by 70%. The remaining motors still showed both directional and diffusive movement, indicating that inhibition by hTpx2 is not selective for either type of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>kymographs and left graph below</italic>). Further, the velocity distribution of remaining processive motors (compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) now shows a bimodal distribution with a high proportion of slow motors (42.1 ± 1.7 nm•s<sup>−1</sup> median ± SEM) and fewer motors at the median speed of hKif15 motors in the absence of hTpx2 (114.9 ± 3.2 nm•s<sup>−1</sup> median ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <italic>right graph below</italic>). This may reflect the higher probability of a fast moving motor from engaging hTpx2 molecules that are bound on the microtubule lattice.</p><p>To further confirm the inhibition of hKif15 by hTpx2 and to estimate the functional impact of hTpx2 inhibition on hKif15 functions beside movement, we included hTpx2 in our optical trap experiment. To do this, we captured a hKif15-linked bead and confirmed that it underwent stepping on the microtubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref>, <italic>1. blue trace</italic>). We then exchanged the buffer to allow 18 nM dimeric hTpx2 access to the hKif15-microtubule complex and again recorded the bead position. The hKif15 motor could no-longer step processively, although it remained bound to the microtubule lattice (4/5 cases; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref>, <italic>2. blue trace</italic>). To rule out that the bead had not simply detached, we moved the microscope stage and observed an increase in force indicating an intact microtubule-motor connection (see silver asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). During this period, the bead can maintain microtubule attachment at forces that—in the absence of hTpx2—would have forced dissociation of the motor (compare also with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, hTpx2 increases the force-holding capability of microtubule-bound hKif15. We can rule out a generic ‘roadblock’ inhibition-mechanism: Firstly, kinesin-1 motility is unaffected by the presence of hTpx2 (n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <italic>green traces</italic>). Secondly, hTpx2 already inhibits hKif15 motility at low nanomolar concentrations when only single molecules are present on the lattice. Kinesin-1 motility in the presence of hTpx2 also shows that inhibition of bead motility in case of hKif15 is not simply mediated by hTpx2-bead-microtubule interactions. Thus, hTpx2 is a selective inhibitor of hKif15 motor stepping presumably by forming stable trimeric hKif15-hTpx2-microtubule complexes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we reveal that hKif15 is a second tetrameric spindle motor in addition to the tetrameric Kinesin-5 hKif11 (Eg5).

(<italic>box</italic>) Once hKif15 and hTpx2 have formed a complex on the microtubule lattice, this crosslink could become static, thereby forming a fixed structural link in the fibre, which can sustain higher loads than hKif15-only crosslinks. <italic>E</italic>–hKif15 powers transport of (small) microtubule fragments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01724.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01724.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01724-fig6-v1"/></fig></p><p>The uniqueness of hKif15 is also reflected in the motors ability to track-switch during processive movement—a property shared with Dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ross et al., 2008</xref>). It is easy to comprehend how dynein switches between microtubule tracks, as this motor is capable of making variable step sizes, significantly larger than 8 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</xref>). However, kinesins step with a step size of ∼8 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Svoboda et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Valentine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Yardimci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Huckaba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jannasch et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting that it is unlikely for a single hKif15 motor domain-pair to mediate switching without leaving the lattice. In this regard, we show that within our 500 ms time resolution single motors do not leave the lattice during switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, switching events often include a pause at the intersection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, traces ‘D’ and ‘E’). As hKif15 is a motile tetramer, we propose that a switch starts with attachment of the second, free head-pair to the lattice of the intersecting microtubule, while the first, engaged head-pair of the same molecule stays attached to the old track. This hKif15 bridge can now pause at the intersection or resolve by detachment of the second domain-pair into a pass or by detachment of the firstdomain-pair into a switch event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, ‘<italic>B</italic>’<italic>+box</italic>).</p><p>Microtubule switching is a feature that is very helpful to navigate through the complex microtubule arrangement within the k-fibre. Thereby each switch event is equivalent to a new independent run on a new microtubule, so that a single molecule can travel a distance of ‘<italic>median run-length</italic> × (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>switches</italic></sub><italic>+1)</italic>’ as we have shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>: traces C-E sum up to 7.4 µm run length in total, with single traces at 1.6, 3.7 and 2.1 µm. Thus, even with a moderate median run length of 2 microns, a single molecule would have a high probability of reaching the plus-end (kinetochores) of the k-fibre, regardless of any discontinuity within the fibre or roadblocks owing to structural microtubule-associated elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, ‘<italic>B</italic>’<italic>+box</italic>). In contrast, short running, non-switching hKif11, that additionally is constantly gathered at the spindle poles by a dynein-dependent minus-end-directed flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ma et al., 2010</xref>), cannot travel far enough into the k-fibre network to reach the kinetochore/plus-end. In vivo data backs up this hypothesis, as hKif11 localises mainly to the spindle pole and fades towards the spindle midzone, while hKif15 is localised uniformly along the k-fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>). Moreover, Kif15 motors also modulate the capacity of k-fibre microtubule bundles to generate an inward-directed force within the spindle (in opposition to hKif11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sturgill and Ohi, 2013</xref>). One possibility is that, due to their prolonged end dwell time, hKif15 motors may influence plus-end dynamics at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, ‘<italic>C</italic>’). Such is the proposed role of the Kinesin-8 Kif18a, which is reported to dampen microtubule dynamics in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Du et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stumpff et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Tetrameric hKif15 motors, like Kif11, can form cross-links between microtubules, we show that hKif15 crosslinks are dynamic as we observed limited tug-of-war movements of crosslinked cargo microtubules. Such cross-links may be reinforced by inhibitory hTpx2 (see below) turning dynamic hKif15 crosslinks into static structural hKif15/hTpx2 crosslinks that can resist higher forces than hKif15 only crosslinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, ‘<italic>D</italic>’+<italic>box</italic>). Our data does not, however, provide any evidence that hKif15 drives a Kif11-like continuous extensile sliding of anti-parallel microtubules in vitro, though we cannot rule out that in vivo other additional factors are involved in such an activity. This factor is unlikely to be hTpx2 since our data shows this protein to inhibit the stepping of hKif15. How this mechanism is regulated within the spindle will be an important future work, but the fact that hTpx2 and hKif11 are constantly transported to the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ma et al., 2010</xref>) might hint to a partition of the spindle into a hKif11 active zone around the poles and a hKif15 active zone towards the spindle equator.</p><p>Overall, our data provide the first insight into the biochemical and biophysical properties of the full-length human Kinesin-12 hKif15. We reveal that hKif15 is a distinct class of kinesin that assembles into stable tetramers, which are highly processive, can navigate microtubule networks by switching track and form high load-bearing microtubule–microtubule crosslinks when bound to the regulatory factor hTpx2. These data shed new light on the mechanism by which hKif15 motors control spindle and chromosome mechanics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hKif15 open reading frame cloning and expression plasmid construction</title><p>The hKIF15 ORF was amplified in five 800- to 1000-bp sized fragments from a cDNA library (derived from hTERT immortalised retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE1 cells)) and subsequently joined by overlap extension PCRs using Pfu Ultra AD polymerase (Agilent, Stockport, UK).

The trapped bead was focused close to the lower cover-glass surface during these solution changes, this offered some boundary layer protection during the solution flow and also greatly reduced the chances of a second bead entering the trap. Following recordings in the presence of hTpx2, a further 3–4 cell volumes of assay buffer were passed through the flow cell to make the final recordings following hTpx2 wash out.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your manuscript, which describes the first in vitro experiments of the human Kinesin-12 Kif15, is an excellent contribution to the field. In general, the data are of high quality and the conclusions well supported. We would therefore like to publish your manuscript, once you have addressed a few controls that we think would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) In the first paragraph of the results: what construct (His<sub>6</sub>-Kif15 or His<sub>6</sub>-Kif15-eGFP) was used to determine the molecular weight? What do the authors mean by 'native molecular weight' and 'theoretical monomeric weight' (Kif15 with/without tags)? The calculation only makes sense if one weight is given with tags and the other not... this is confusing and should be mentioned in the text. Furthermore, it is not clear how the authors calculated the molecular weight from the sedimentation coefficient and the stokes radius (a reference or an equation would be useful).</p><p>2) You observe that 14.6 % of the motors moved to the microtubule minus end. You should show a trace of a minus-end-directed run. Do they switch directions? Are the minus-end directed runs processive? What is the velocity? Could the minus-end-directed runs be diffusive rather than directed? In other words, what is the evidence that these runs are actually directed?</p><p>3) In the third paragraph of the results; 'processive particles ... bleached in up to three steps'. If the hKif15 is a tetramer why there are only three steps observable in all shown graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, Figure 1–figure supplement 1E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). It would be good to show the time on the x-axis. Furthermore, steps are hard to determine. Can the authors show a four-step bleaching trace or explain why they didn't observe one?</p><p>4) Single molecule optical tweezers experiment: You attach the hKif15 tetramer non-specifically to microspheres and used a motor-microsphere dilution where only one third showed motility. To show that one or two dimers of the tetramer walk on the microtubule poisson statistics are necessary.</p><p>5) In your experiments on the interaction between hKif15 and hTpx2 using glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. We are worried that affinities on the order of µM may be difficult to see in this experiment if the concentrations of the proteins loaded are not high enough. Were the proteins loaded at µM concentrations? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, if one compares the intensities in lanes 13 and 18, there are slight differences which may be significant for a low affinity interaction. It is not possible to determine this with the data provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01724.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) In the first paragraph of the results: what construct (His</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub><italic>-Kif15 or His</italic><sub><italic>6</italic></sub><italic>-Kif15-eGFP) was used to determine the molecular weight?

Furthermore, it is not clear how the authors calculated the molecular weight from the sedimentation coefficient and the stokes radius (a reference or an equation would be useful)</italic>.</p><p>To clarify the molecular weight of the human Kif15 motor we have carried out two new experiments. First, we have analyzed the His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 protein on native gel electrophoresis. This demonstrates that hKif15 migrates at a molecular weight of approximately 730 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, we analyzed the His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 protein by size-exclusion chromatography/multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). This is the gold standard experiment, which allows measurement of the absolute molecular mass of protein complexes. This experiment confirms that His<sub>6</sub>-hKif15 can exist as a tetramer with a mass of 740 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) You observe that 14.6 % of the motors moved to the microtubule minus end. You should show a trace of a minus-end-directed run. Do they switch directions? Are the minus-end directed runs processive? What is the velocity?

In other words, what is the evidence that these runs are actually directed</italic>?</p><p>We now include examples of minus-end directed movement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> – right panel. These movements were processive with a mean velocity of ∼170 nm·s<sup>-1</sup>. The median run length (0.8 µm verses 9.6 µm) and residency time (5.8 s versus 26.3 s) were considerably shorter than plus-end directed events and directional reversals were not observed. This new analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and discussed in the text (second paragraph of the Results).</p><p><italic>3) In the third paragraph of the results; 'processive particles ... bleached in up to three steps'. If the hKif15 is a tetramer why there are only three steps observable in all shown graphs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>, Figure 1–figure supplement 1E,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>). It would be good to show the time on the x-axis. Furthermore, steps are hard to determine. Can the authors show a four-step bleaching trace or explain why they didn't observe one</italic>?</p><p>We have carried out additional bleaching experiments at a higher temporal resolution (250 ms timelapse) to improve the resolution of bleaching events. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows example traces of hKif15-eGFP particles that bleach with three distinct steps. Note that the final GFP bleaching event to zero signal cannot be distinguished from the unbinding of the motor from the microtubule. We now make this point clear in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Single molecule optical tweezers experiment: You attach the hKif15 tetramer non-specifically to microspheres and used a motor-microsphere dilution where only one third showed motility. To show that one or two dimers of the tetramer walk on the microtubule poisson statistics are necessary</italic>.</p><p>We agree that Poisson statistics are important and now show these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref>) and fully describe them in the Methods section. Our experimental data fits a ≥ 1 poisson distribution (the probability that a bead binds by one or more motors), rather than the ≥ 2 distribution (the probability that a bead binds by two or more motors). These data confirm that we are observing single motor (i.e., tetramer) motility at the low concentrations we used in our trapping experiments (3.3 nM and 6.5 nM).</p><p>However, to our knowledge this type of analysis does not allow us to draw conclusions about whether one or two dimers of the tetramer attach to the microtubule. This is because of the different bead binding statistics between dimeric motors and tetrameric motors in which the two dimers are part of the same molecule and therefore inter-dependent (let us call them <italic>virtual dimers</italic> for the moment). The binding of the virtual dimers to the bead population is inter-dependent and therefore non-random (i.e., when a bead binds a motor it will always adsorb two virtual dimers at once). This is unlike the situation with classical dimeric motors where binding to beads would be random (i.e., dimers bind independently of each other to the beads). Given this, what is the consequence, if both virtual dimers of a tetramer were required to mediate binding of a bead to a microtubule? In this situation virtual dimers would produce a higher fraction of microtubule-bound beads when compared to the same concentration of independent dimers. In our opinion the binding behavior would not fit a ≥ 2 poisson distribution. As a result, we do not think it is possible to discriminate whether one or two dimers of the tetramer contribute to microtubule binding.</p><p>The fact that a ≥ 1 distribution is the best fit for our data does allow us to conclude that the beads have bound single tetramers (random distribution across the bead population), but we cannot exclude that both dimers of the tetramer can associate with the microtubule. In this context we would like to note that our data from the trap (like the data from TIRF) shows that the same beads can undergo different modes of motility (i.e., diffusion, processive stepping – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These transitions may be or may be not associated with different MT-association configurations of the tetramer (one or two dimer pairs attached). This uncertainty further precludes us from making strong conclusions as how the tetrameric hKif15 motors engage the microtubule. Future work will no doubt focus on investigating how hKif15 coordinates its four motor domains.</p><p><italic>5) In your experiments on the interaction between hKif15 and hTpx2 using glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. We are worried that affinities on the order of µM may be difficult to see in this experiment if the concentrations of the proteins loaded are not high enough. Were the proteins loaded at µM concentrations? For example, in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, if one compares the intensities in lanes 13 and 18, there are slight differences which may be significant for a low affinity interaction. It is not possible to determine this with the data provided</italic>.</p><p>This is an excellent point. We have repeated the glycerol gradient experiments using 2.5 µM dimeric hTpx2 and 80nM tetrameric hKif15. Under these conditions we can now detect the formation of the hKif15-hTpx2 complex in solution. This data is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. However, we note that the affinity of this interaction is low and our data are consistent with our original conclusion that the stable Kif15-hTpx2 complex formation involves binding to the microtubule track: in the presence of microtubules, low nM concentrations hTpx2 increase the microtubule-binding affinity of hKif15 and inhibit the motors motility (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5 B-D</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
