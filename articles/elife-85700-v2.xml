One of the main functions of ligaments is mechanical, as they passively maintain joint stability and assist in guiding those joints through their normal range of motion when a tensile loading is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frank, 2004</xref>). The knee is the largest and most complicated hinge joint associated with weight bearing in the human body. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is crucial for knee kinematics, especially in rotation, and functions as an anterior/posterior stabilizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fleming, 2003</xref>). ACL degeneration can gradually result in chronic knee pain, instability, and even poor life quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). It has been reported that aging-related degenerative changes in the ACL might also contribute to OA occurrence and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loeser, 2010</xref>), but mechanisms of ACL aging and degeneration remain unclear.</p><p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the physical basis for the biological functions of ligaments, and ACL degeneration is accompanied by alterations in the ECM. The ECM of ACL consists of collagen types I, II, III, and V, elastin, and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laurencin and Freeman, 2005</xref>), and collagen type I is a major determinant of tensile strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Corps et al., 2006</xref>). ACL degeneration is characterized by the disorganization of collagen fibers, cystic changes, mucoid degeneration, and chondroid metaplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>). Different types of pathological changes correspond to different ECM alterations. For example, mucoid degeneration reflects the degradation of collagen and deposition of new glycosaminoglycans, and cystic changes are devoid of ECM in the diseased area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>). It has been reported that some regions in the degenerated ACL have decreased type I collagen, whereas type II, III, and X collagen and aggrecan are significantly increased, and this abnormal ECM production can lead to a biomechanical fault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2003</xref>). In recent years, many scholars have paid attention to the degeneration mechanism of ligaments. TGFβ1, a member of the TGF superfamily, can be used to induce chondrogenic differentiation of ligament-derived stem cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 2019</xref>) and is considered to be an essential molecule contributing to chondroid metaplasia. It also has been reported that mechanical stretching force can promote TGF-β1 production by ligament cells, contributing to ligamental hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakatani et al., 2002</xref>). Some reports suggested that complement cascade could lead to ECM catabolism and contribute to ligament degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Busch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schulze-Tanzil, 2019</xref>). Akihiko Hasegawa et al. suggested that there is inflammation in the degenerative ligament, manifesting as leukocyte infiltration and neovascularization between collagen fibers within ACL substance, and once inflammation is initiated, its synergy with mechanical forces could facilitate ACL degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fleming et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There are various types of cells in the ligament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kharaz et al., 2018</xref>), and building a detailed ligamental cell landscape is essential to understanding ligamental characteristics and underlying pathogenesis of ACL degeneration. Currently, the reports on the ACL cellular changes during the process of degeneration mostly focus on chondroid metaplasia and progenitor cells or myofibroblasts recruitment and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mullaji et al., 2008</xref>). However, the cellular changes during ligamental degeneration are still unclear. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial RNA sequencing (spRNA-seq) to obtain an unbiased atlas of ACL cell clusters. Our findings provide a better understanding of the inherent heterogeneity, construct the classifications of fibroblasts, and profile the spatial information of identified cell clusters in the ACL. Notably, we also identified the cell interactions during the disease process and demonstrated the role of FGF and TGF-β signaling pathways in ligament degeneration. Thus, our study reveals the cellular landscape of the human ACL and provides insight that could help to identify therapeutic targets for human ligamental degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human ligament cell sample preparation</title><p>The ligament specimens were collected from four joint replacement patients with osteoarthritis (degenerated ACLs) and four amputation patients with severe trauma or malignant bone tumor (healthy ACLs; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>All specimens removed were placed immediately in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) free of antibiotics and FBS under 4℃. Ligament samples were rinsed in precooled PBS and then were cut into 1 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces. Containing Collagenase type I (2 mg/ml) and 0.25% (w/v) trypsin DMEM was used to digest the specimens for 1 hr at 37 °C using a Thermomixer at 1200 rpm (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). After that, Ham’s F-12 media containing 10% FBS was added to stop the process of digestion, and then the digested tissue passed through a 100 µm cell strainer. Finally, after centrifugation, cells were collected for subsequent batch analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis</title><p>The raw single cell sequencing data was mapped and quantified with the 10×Genomics Inc software package CellRanger (v5.0.1) and the GRCh38 reference genome. Using the table of unique molecular identifiers produced by Cell Ranger, we identified droplets that contained cells using the call of functional droplets generated by Cell Ranger. After cell-containing droplets were identified, gene expression matrices were first filtered to remove cells with &gt;5% mitochondrial genes, &lt;250 or &gt;8000 genes, and &lt;500 UMI. Downstream analysis of Cellranger matrices was carried out using R (4.1.3) and the Seurat package (v 4.1.0, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/">https://satijalab.org/seurat/</ext-link>). In total, 49,356 cells with an average of 2435 genes per cell were selected for ongoing analysis. Of these single cells, 24,721 were obtained from lesions ligament, including L2, L5, L6, and L8. The remainder were cells from healthy and included L1, L3, L4, and L10.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-cell trajectory analysis</title><p>We used the Monocle3 v. 2.8.0 R package to infer a hierarchical organization part of fibroblasts to organize these cells in pseudotime. We took these subpopulations from the Seurat data set from which we reperformed shared nearest neighbor clustering and differential expression analysis as described previously. We then selected the differentially expressed genes based on the fold-change expression for Monocle to order the cells using the DDRTree method and reverse graph embedding. We find gene co-expression modules according to the trend of gene expression and show the relationship between cells and modules in the form of heat maps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ligand-receptor interaction model</title><p>We used the ligand-receptor interaction database from the cellchat database to determine potential ligand-receptor interactions between fibroblast subpopulations and other cell types. The expression data were preprocessed for subsequent cell-cell communication analysis. The ligand or receptor that is overexpressed in a class of cells is first identified, and the gene expression data is then projected into a protein-protein interaction network. Whenever a ligand or receptor is overexpressed, the ligand-receptor interaction is recognized. CellphoneDB is based on the expression of a receptor in one cell type with a ligand in another cell type, resulting in rich receptor-ligand interactions between two cell populations. For the gene expressed by the cell population, the percentage of cells expressing the gene and the average gene expression were calculated. The gene was removed if it was expressed only in 10% or less of the cells in the population (the default value is 0.1).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Multiplex immunofluorescence (OPAL) staining</title><p>The tissue slices underwent deparaffinization and rehydration, and then heat-induced antigen retrieval was used. Following that, the paraffin slide containing the ligament tissue was subjected to continuous staining using the Opal Polaris Multiple-Color Manual IHC Kit (NEL861001KT), which involved incubating the tissue with different primary antibodies specific to various cell markers. We used different primary antibodies to simultaneously label pericyte (ACTA2), pericyte1 (MYH11), and pericyte2 (CD90) on the same tissue slide. APOE was used to label Fib.9 and TOP2A was used to label Fib.8. DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei. An automated staining system (BOND-RX, Leica Microsystems, Vista, CA) was used to perform the chromogen-based multiplex immunohistochemistry labeling. The Opal Polaris dyes were used to pair with these antibodies containing fluorophores for tyramide signal amplification (TSA) to enhance sensitivity. The following primary antibodies: FGF7 (160128, Abclonal), TGFβ1 (HA721143, HUABIO), APOE (YT0273, Immunoway), TOP2A (YM6914, Immunoway), ACTA2 (ab5694, Abcam), MYH11 (A4064, Abclonal), and CD90 (ab307736, Abcam) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Spatial-transcriptome analysis</title><p>We used L1, and L8 samples for spatial transcriptome analysis. We performed the Seurat standard analysis. Machine prediction and marker gene methods were used to determine the cell type, and SCTransform was used for standard analysis of the data. First, we determine it is specific enough to find a topic profile (similar to a feature vector) for each cell type and then deconvolve the information by cell type and superimpose it onto the slice in pie chart form.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Deconvolution analysis</title><p>SCDC (v 0.0.0.9000) tool combined with single cell data was used to deconvolve bulk RNAseq data for cell type and content proportion analysis bulk RNAseq data.

The characteristic pathological findings in the ACL of OA were identified by arthroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In the normal group, the ligaments are white stripes with a clear structure, and blood vessels can be seen on their surfaces. In the degenerated group, the ligaments were swollen, the structure was disorganized, and the color of the tissue was dark. From the images of knee MRI, we can also find that the signal of normal ACL on the T2 phase is uniform and the structure is clear, while the signal of the ACL in the degenerated group is mixed, and the clear structure cannot be distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). After rigorous quality control, we obtained the transcriptomes of 49,356 cells (normal: 24635 degenerated: 24721) and then employed differential gene expression analysis to discern cluster-specific markers. Firstly, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension, and then we adopted the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) method to conduct the next analysis. Unbiased clustering based on UMAP identified four cell classes and histrionic lineage-defining genes were detected, including endothelial cells: PECAM1, VWF, and PLVAP (3862, 7.83%), fibroblasts: DCN, LUM, and COL1A2 (32644, 66.14%), immune cells: PTPRC, SRGN, and CD163 (8021, 16.25%), and pericytes: ACTA2, MCAM, and RGS5 (4829, 9.78%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, we could further confirm that the selected cell markers could well identify various cell types. UMAP plots and stacked bar plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> described the distributions of cells in the healthy and degenerated samples. We can conclude that, in general, fibroblasts are the main cell type in both normal and degenerated ligaments and the degenerated group had a higher immune cell ratio and lower pericyte ratio than the normal group. We next analyzed the number of differentially expressed genes (Degs) between healthy and degenerated ligament clusters. The results demonstrated that the fibroblast had the largest difference, implying that fibroblasts undergo significant changes during the degenerative process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We also collected normal as well as degenerated ligament specimens for bulk sequencing and performed deconvolution analysis between bulk sequencing results and scRNA-seq results. The results illustrated that scRNA-seq samples were in good agreement with bulk sequencing samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). After that, through Degs analysis in the scRNA-seq results, we selected genes highly expressed in the degenerative group of the four-cell subsets (fibroblast, immune cell, endothelial cell, and pericyte). By examining the expression of these genes in bulk sequencing data, it can be found that these genes are also highly expressed in the diseased sample of bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–G</xref>). The results of the direct comparison of gene expression between the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data per se also illustrated that scRNA-seq samples present high consistency with bulk RNA-seq samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell RNA-seq reveals major cell classes in human ligament.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) A photograph of typical normal (left) and degenerated (right) anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) under arthroscopy.

We can conclude that the ratio of fibroblast subclusters varied greatly between these two groups. The ratio of Fib.1, Fib.2, Fib.8, and Fib.9 in the diseased group were higher than that in the healthy group, and the ratio of Fib.3, Fib.4, and Fib.7 in the healthy group were higher compared to the diseased group.

Combined with the analysis of the proportion of cell subclusters, we inferred that Fib.1 and Fib.2 are ECM remodeling-associated fibroblasts as they highly expressed the genes related to ECM components and ECM decomposition such as COL1A1, CTHRC1, COL3A1, FBLN1, MMP2, MMP14, and TPPP3. From the perspective of ECM synthesis, Fib.1 and Fib.2 are slightly different. Fib.1 highly expressed the collagen-related genes, but Fib.2 highly expressed the genes related to the synthesis of connexins. Fib.3 expressing metallothionein family genes such as MT1X, MT1E, and MT1M is a population of homeostasis-associated fibroblasts with defensive functions. Fib.4, expressing genes associated with the formation and organization of the ligamental ECM such as ANGPTL7, MYOC, CILP2, and THBS1 is a group of resident fibroblasts that function normally. Fib.5 is a cluster of structural fibroblasts within the ligament as they highly expressed multiple collagen-related genes such as COL3A1, COL6A1, COL5A1, COL1A1, and TGFVBI. Fib.6 is a cluster of chondrocytes as they highly expressed cartilage-related genes such as COL2A1, FMOD, CHAD, ACAN, and CILP2. We cannot define Fib.7 well because they expressed Degs without specific tags. Fib.8 is a group of cycling cells as they highly expressed cell cycle-related genes such as CENPF, TOP2A, and MLI67. Fib.9 is a group of inflammation-related fibroblasts as they highly expressed CXCL14, CXCL12, C3, and C7. Fib.10 may have the function of damage repair as they highly expressed anti-inflammation and anti-ECM decomposing associated genes such as PRG4, DEFB1, TIMP3, and HBEGF. To verify the accuracy of the classification of fibroblast subclusters, the top 50 Degs of each subpopulation were deconvolved on the bulk RNA-seq data by the GSVA method. The results illustrated that fibroblast 3,4 scored higher in the normal samples and fibroblast 1,2,9 scored higher in the diseased samples, which were consistent with the changes in proportion of scRNA-seq.</p><p>For further in-depth investigation of changes in ligamental fibroblasts during the degeneration process, we performed the Degs analysis in the whole fibroblast population between the normal and degenerated ligaments. We observed genes upregulated in the degenerated group such as CFD, SPP1, COL1A2, and COL3A1, which were related to scar healing and ECM remolding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were conducted for further functional interpretation of these Degs. The results illustrated that the upregulated genes in the diseased group were enriched for the terms ‘extracellular region’, ‘TGF-beta signaling pathway’ and ‘Complement and coagulation cascades’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) also demonstrated that ECM-associated signaling, ECM binding and ECM structural constituent, were activated in the degenerated group, which implied that the changes of ECM play an important role in the ligament degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). And then, by building gene interaction networks, we identified that genes upregulated in degenerated groups were concentrated in two parts, ECM-receptor interaction and leukocyte trans-endothelial migration, which once again proved the significant function of ECM remolding and immune inflammation in the disease process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dynamic transcriptional changes in ligamental degeneration</title><p>To gain insight into the cellular progression of fibroblast subclusters during the disease process, we performed cell trajectory analysis, revealing two significant routes in the process of degeneration. Five fibroblast subclusters, including Fib.2, Fib.4, Fib.5, Fib.9, and Fib.10, were involved in the reconstruction of the disease trajectories using Monocle 3, an algorithm for the reconstruction of lineage programs based on similarity at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). We set Fib.4 and Fib.5 as the starting point of the trajectories because they are structural fibroblasts with high expression of ECM component genes and represent normal ligamental functions well, and then computed pseudotime for cells along the inferred developmental axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). More specifically, Fib.4 and Fib.5 were predicted to transform into two distinct cell fates, including the cell fate1, which includes Fib.2 and Fib.9, and the cell fate2, which includes Fib.10. With this in mind, we tried to explore the genic dynamics that distinguished these two cell fates. The expression profile of cell fate1 showed increasingly high expression of genes (CXCL12, MMP2, MMP14, C7) related to ‘leukocyte trans-endothelial migration’, ‘cellular response to chemokine’, and ‘inflammatory response pathway’. Along with the cell fate2, we observed gradually high expression of ECM organization and skeletal muscle tissue development-related genes (FOS, EGR1, FGF10, FN1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–H</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evolution trajectory and transcriptional fluctuation during ligamental degeneration progression.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) UMAP visualization of fibroblast 2, 4, 5, 9, 10.

We can observe the aggregated expression of each module in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>. We identified that the expression of genes in module 3 was gradually elevated along the cell fate1 and gradually declined along the cell fate2, which were enriched for genes related to rheumatoid arthritis, antigen processing and presentation, and complement activation. In contrast, the expression of wound repair and ECM assembly-related genes were gradually elevated along the cell fate2 but declined along the cell fate1, such as ADAM12, HS3ST3A1, FN1, and SERPINE2 in module 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>). According to these pseudotime analysis results, we inferred that there are two opposite dynamic trajectories in the process of ligamental degeneration: one is the progressive damage process of complement inflammation leading to the continuous progression of the disease, and the other is the process of repairing the damage to delay or even reverse the disease process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Characterization of stromal cells in coordinating ligament microenvironment during degeneration progression</title><p>Besides fibroblasts, various endothelial cells (ECs) and immune cells also play significant roles in the occurrence and development of ligament degeneration. In our ligament samples, we identified seven clusters of blood-vessel-derived cells, including five clusters of ECs (EC1-5) and two clusters of pericytes (pericyte1 and pericyte2). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shown the distribution of EC1 expressing a high level of ACKR1 is a population of venous ECs; EC2 highly expressed COL4A1, COL4A2, H19 was related to anti-angiogenesis; EC3 highly expressed genes associated with ECM organization and we inferred this cluster related to damage repair. EC4 expressing a high level of CCL2, CCL8, STEAP4, and SYNPO2 is a cluster of ECs related to inflammatory chemotaxis. EC5 is a cluster of lymphatic ECs. As for pericytes, we identified two populations that expressed pericyte markers ACTA2, and MCAM. Pericyte1 highly expressed myocyte-related genes such as MYH11, MUSTN1, and LBH, which implied that this cluster may have myocyte-like properties. Pericyte2 highly expressed fibroblast markers such as COL1A1 and COL3A1, which implied that this cluster may have fibroblast-like properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We next compared the proportions of these 7 clusters between normal and diseased ligaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cand D</xref>). The results illustrated that most ECs subsets were elevated in the diseased group, implying increased angiogenesis during ligamental degeneration. The ratio of pericyte1 in the diseased group was higher than that in the healthy group, but the ratio of pericyte2 was lower. An increased ratio of pericyte1 may change the tissue’s biological properties, as ligament was dominant by fibroblast. To gain more biological insights underlying ECs, we performed the Degs analysis between normal and degenerated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Combined with the result of enrichment analysis and GSEA analysis, we identified that ligamental ECs upregulated inflammation and complement-related genes, such as C1QA, PLA2G2A, and ECM-related genes such as PRG4, VIM, and POSTN during degeneration procession (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). The terms ‘inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway’ and ‘TGF-beta signaling pathway’ activated in the diseased group also implied that inflammation and ECM remodeling have significant roles in the disease process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). By immunofluorescence staining, we demonstrated the presence of two pericyte subsets in normal and diseased samples. In the normal ligament, there were more pericyte2 than pericyte1 and compared with the normal group, pericyte1 was increased in the diseased group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Identification of blood vessel derived cell and immune cell subclusters in human ligament.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP visualization of the subclusters of endothelial cell and pericyte.

The heatmap illustrated the intensity of interactions among different cell clusters. From the results, we can find that in addition to interactions within fibroblast subclusters, cell-cell cross-talks were mainly between fibroblast subpopulations and ECs and between fibroblast subpopulations and macrophages. At the same time, we can find that fibroblast subsets dominated by the diseased group had stronger interaction associations with other cells, which implied that there are stronger and more complex interactions in degenerated ligaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cell–cell crosstalk during ligamental degeneration progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap depicting the significant interactions among the identified subclusters of fibroblast, immune cell, and endothelial cell of normal and degenerated ligaments.

Interestingly, Fib.9 was involved in FGF signaling, both autocrine and paracrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Fibroblasts were the leading receiver of FGF signals, as expected. Through the violin plot, we identified that Fib.9 acts on FGFR1 located in each fibroblast subpopulation by expressing FGF7 and FGF signaling pathways, which can promote pathological proliferation of cells and participate in scar repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We inferred that the FGF signaling network may disrupt the homeostasis of fibroblasts in the ligaments and promote the progression of ligamental degeneration. Moreover, the TGF-β pathway was involved in many cell-cell interactions among fibroblast subpopulations and macrophages via TGFB1-TGFBR1 or TGFB1-TGFBR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>). As shown above, fibroblasts of the degenerated group highly expressed PRG4, COL3A1, and SSP1, and these genes are all the important downstream targets of TGF-β, which participate in the process of ECM remolding. Hence, we suggested that TGFB1 is a key gene and Fib.8 and macrophages promote the development of the disease through this molecule. According to the Degs, we selected APOE as the marker gene of Fib.9 and TOP2A as the marker gene of Fib.8. The results of immunofluorescent staining illustrated that the number of Fib.8 and Fib.9 in the disease group were more than those in the normal group, and Fib.8 highly expressed TGFB1 and Fib.9 highly expressed FGF7 in the disease group, which validated the above findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>SpRNA-seq of ligament deciphering the spatial interactions of cell subclusters</title><p>For further insight, and multi-angle interpretation of the cell composition changes that occurred in ligamental degeneration, we performed spRNA-seq on normal and lesioned ligaments. Firstly, by using the feature marker transfer method, we mapped the individual subsets identified by single-cell sequencing into spatial transcriptome data. The heatmap illustrated that Fib.4, as a representative of fibroblasts in the normal ligament tissue, was widely distributed in L1 and the amount was significantly higher than that in L8. The number of Fib.9, as a representative of fibroblasts in the degenerated ligament, in L8 was higher than that in L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). We also examined the immune cells and ECs. As expected, there were more immune cells and ECs in L8 than in L1, implying immune infiltration and vascular hyperplasia were presented in the degenerative specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–J</xref>). In addition, we also examined the FGF and TGFB signaling pathways related genes expression in spRNA-seq. From the results, we can find that TGFB1, TGFBR1, FGF7, and FGFR1 were highly expressed in the diseased sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with those obtained by scRNA-seq. After that, we performed spotlight analysis in these two groups. All cell subsets are rendered in four colors, with red being the fibroblast subsets specific to the disease group. Finally, we hide the areas that are not red in both samples. We can find that the red region in L8 was widely distributed, and the area was significantly higher than that in L1. After careful observation, we found that almost all the red dots had yellow and black areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>). This indicates that some fibroblast subpopulations specific to the diseased group are adjacent to endothelial and immune cells in the degenerative state. The proximity of different cells in space makes it possible for them to interact with each other. Therefore, this further provided strong evidence for the results of our single-cell interaction analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Spatial transcriptome sequencing deciphers the microenvironment changes during ligamental degeneration progression.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Spatial heatmaps showing the representative normal and degenerated fibroblast subcluster distribution in L1 and L8 samples.

However, the mechanisms of this disease are not well characterized and treatments to prevent or treat ACL degeneration are scarce and not effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shane Anderson and Loeser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tozer and Duprez, 2005</xref>). Healthy and degenerated ACL tissues include multiple cell subpopulations with diverse genetic and phenotypic characteristics. How this heterogeneity emerges in development degeneration remains unclear. Herein, we built a single-cell atlas of normal and degenerated human ACL and explored the characteristics and key regulatory pathways of distinct fibroblast subtypes. These findings will help us understand the pathogenesis of ACL degeneration in-depth, and provide potential targets for clinical therapies for this disease.</p><p>Fibroblasts are increasingly considered dominating cell types in ligaments and central mediators of ligamental degeneration, and here, we identified 10 fibroblast subpopulations in normal and degenerated ACL samples by using scRNA-seq. Further cluster analysis profiled characteristics of each subcluster and combined with the cell proportion analysis, we found that pro-inflammation and ECM remodeling-related fibroblast subgroups were significantly increased in the degenerative ligamental tissues, which implied that inflammation and ECM remodeling are key events in the disease process. Through comparing the Degs of fibroblasts between degenerative and healthy conditions, we found that ECM-related genes upregulated in the diseased group, such as FN1, COL3A1, PRG4, and SPP1. The results of enrichment analysis and GSEA also illustrated that ECM-related pathways were activated in the degenerated group, which suggested that the modules of ECM play an important role in the process of ligamental degeneration. According to the gene interaction analysis, two gene modules were activated in the diseased group, leukocyte trans-endothelial migration and ECM-receptor interaction. These findings were consistent with previous studies which suggested that ligament inflammation and ECM changes contribute to ACL degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Busch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>). It is due to the changes and remodeling of the ECM in the degenerative ligament tissue that the biomechanical changes of the ligament are caused and eventually may result in the rupture of the ligament. From the pseudotime analysis, we identified two cell fates in the ligamental degeneration. Cell fate 1 represents a progressive process of the disease characterized by inflammatory damage and extracellular matrix degradation. Cell fate 2 implies a chronic repair process for the disease characterized by ECM remodeling, ligament development, and damage repair.</p><p>Immune cells are closely related to ligamental degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim-Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We analyzed the heterogeneity of immune cells in ACL using single-cell RNA sequencing. The results illustrated that macrophage-dominating immune cells in ACL and inflammation-related genes PLA2G2A and ECM-related genes PRG4, FN1, and HTRA1 were upregulated in the macrophages of the diseased group. Enrichment analysis also revealed that complement and ECM-related pathways were activated in the degenerated group. This implied that macrophages highly expressed ECM and inflammation-associated genes in the ligamental degeneration progression. So, we suggested that macrophages may contribute to ligamental degeneration. We also identified two types of pericytes in these tissues. As we all know, pericytes in the tissue have some stem cell characteristics and can differentiate into fibroblasts, and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>). Pericyte 1 highly expressed stem cell-related genes MCAM and MUSTN1 and have the characteristics of myofibroblasts, and pericyte 2 tends to have the characteristics of fibroblasts. Pericyte 1 was increased and pericyte 2 decreased in the degenerated group, which may change the properties of ligamental cells and contribute to ligamental degeneration.</p><p>Cells can communicate via ligand-receptor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>), so targeting cell-cell interactions is frequently utilized in clinical treatment. The results of CellphoneDB analysis demonstrated that the high content of fibroblasts and immune cells in the degenerative group had significantly higher interaction intensity, such as fibroblast 1, 2, and 8, which means that the interaction between cells in the ligament was enhanced in the degenerative state. To identify the key factors regulating the disease process, CellChat analysis was used to dissect the intercellular crosstalk based on the signaling network in the human ACL. We found that the FGF signaling pathway and TGF-β signaling pathway were involved in the crosstalk network. TGFβ1 contributes to osteophyte formation by inducing endochondral ossification, is thought to be closely related to the onset of OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murata et al., 2019</xref>), and can be used to induce chondrogenic differentiation of ligament-derived stem cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schwarz et al., 2019</xref>). It has been reported that in myocardial fibrosis, liver fibrosis, glaucoma, and other diseases, the TGF-β signaling pathway is also involved in angiogenesis, ECM remodeling, pathological scar healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ilieș et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee and Massagué, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferrão et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penn et al., 2012</xref>). FGFs can induce the fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation, promote tissue repair by regulating cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis and contribute to ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). ECM remodeling by overexpression, degradation, and cross-linking of ECM proteins in the lesioned tissue are direct factors leading to fibrosis tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we observed that fibroblast9, inflammation-related fibroblast, highly expressed FGF7 and can act on FGFR1 mainly distributed in the fibroblast subgroups. Immune cells especially macrophages highly expressed TGFB1 and can act on TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 mainly distributed in the fibroblast and endothelial subgroups. These findings suggested that FGF and TGF-β signaling pathways may induce ECM remolding in the process of ligamental degeneration and FGF7-FGFR1 and TGFB1-TGFBR2 may be potential targets for the treatment of this disease. SpRNA-seq was used to detect the spatial information underlying the normal and degenerated ligaments and validate the findings acquired from the scRNA-seq. Through the results, we observed that the disease group specific fibroblasts and immune cells recognized by single cells were more numerous and more widely distributed in the disease group specimens. We also got some spatial information, that fibroblasts in the disease group were spatially closer to immune and endothelial cells, which was more conducive to cell interaction.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our study described the cell atlas of the human ligament, providing a valuable resource for further investigation of ACL homeostasis and the pathogenesis of ligamental degeneration. The cellular heterogeneity and signaling network we uncovered help to increase the understanding of the human ACL at a single-cell level and provide crucial clues for establishing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this disease in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Software, Validation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was reviewed and approved by our University Ethics Committee (Ethics Committee on Biomedical Research, West China Hospital of Sichuan University No. 658 2020-(921)) and all procedures complied with the Helsinki Declaration.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The authors are suggested to run the proofreading carefully since many typos are found in the text. Below is a list of some, but not all.</p><p>P3 line 48: consider changing &quot; the musculoskeletal&quot; to &quot;the musculoskeletal system&quot;.</p><p>P3 line 59: Please consider revising &quot;ACL aging and degradation&quot; to &quot;ACL aging and degeneration&quot;. Also, &quot;degradation&quot; has been heavily used in the text. Consider replacing it with &quot;degeneration&quot; wherever it is appropriate.</p><p>P4 line 85: replace &quot;synergize&quot; with &quot;synergy&quot;; P10 line 204: please replace &quot;resolve&quot; with &quot;reveal&quot;?</p><p>2. The color codes for Figure 2B are confusing, please consider changing the color codes for L3 to L5 to increase visibility.</p><p>3. Markers used for pericyte immunostaining in Figure 4G were incorrect! ACTA2, MYH11, and CD90 (Thy1) are not specific markers for pericytes. ACTA2 (also called sSMA) and MYH11 (myosin11) are generally considered markers for myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle, not pericytes. Also, most of the mesenchymal progenitors express CD19. So pericyte classification in this ms is confusing and not supported by the immunostaining data.</p><p>4. The data in Figure 5F doesn't convincingly demonstrate there is an increase in the expression of FGF7 and TGFβ1 (where and which types of cells) in the specimens from the diseased groups. In addition, these data need to be quantified, and the &quot;n&quot; number should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85700.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The initial findings provided by the scRNA-seq technique need to be validated by in vitro and in vivo experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments and suggestions.

We kept 5 clusters (fibroblast2,4,5,9,10) for the pseodotime analysis. According to the Degs and the definition of different fibroblast subclusters, these five cell populations are the focus of our attention and are closely related to the disease progression. Besides, based on the current understanding of ligamental degeneration, we hypothesized that the process of ligamental degeneration could be reflected in these cell clusters by the pseodotime analysis. In addition, the reasons for excluding the other subpopulations are also described. Fibroblast8: a subpopulation that are in the cell cycle is not associated with disease progression. Fibroblast7: a subpopulation that has not yet been defined. Fibroblast6: a cluster of chondrocytes and not associated with ligamental degeneration. Fibroblast3: high expression of metalloenzyme related genes and low correlation with the disease. Fibroblast1: a subpopulation associated with ECM remodeling. It was initially included in the pseodotime analysis, but the results did not fit the biological process, so it was also excluded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The grammar throughout the manuscript needs significant improvement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your comments and suggestions.

According to your suggestions, we have changed the color codes in Figure 2B to make the figure clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Markers used for pericyte immunostaining in Figure 4G were incorrect! ACTA2, MYH11, and CD90 (Thy1) are not specific markers for pericytes. ACTA2 (also called sSMA) and MYH11 (myosin11) are generally considered markers for myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle, not pericytes. Also, most of the mesenchymal progenitors express CD19. So pericyte classification in this ms is confusing and not supported by the immunostaining data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Our definition of pericytes is well-founded and markers we selected used for pericyte immunostaining are also reasonable. Firstly, pericytes and smooth muscle cells originate from the same mesenchymal lineage, share many marker expressions like PDGFRB, ACTA2, CD13, CD146<sup>1</sup>. Pericytes also present strong muscle contractile gene expression signatures, including ACTA2, MYH/MYL genes, TAGLN<sup>2</sup>. There are several literature demonstrating pericytes expressing ACTA2 and MYH/MYL genes across multiple human organs such as meniscus<sup>2</sup>, intervertebral disc<sup>3</sup>, heart<sup>4</sup>, brain<sup>5</sup>. Secondly, it is known that pericytes attach to the surface of vascular endothelial cells and maintain vasculature stability via the endothelium–pericyte crosstalk<sup>6</sup>. Our immunofluorescence imaging found that this population of cells formed a tube shape and it seems to surround the blood vessels. Therefore, according to the spatial localization, this group of cells also conforms to the characteristics of pericytes. Thirdly, it has been reported that there are two subsets of pericytes. One subset expresses more stem cell markers such as CD90, RGS5, CD146. Another subset expressed more markers associated with muscle contraction, such as MYH11, MYH9<sup>1, 2</sup>. In our study, we also found similar two populations of pericytes and performed multiple immunofluorescent staining according to their markers (ACTA2: shared marker; MYH11: a marker of pericyte1; THY1/CD90: a marker of pericyte2). So, we believe that pericyte classification in our study is clear and can be supported by our immunostaining data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The data in Figure 5F doesn't convincingly demonstrate there is an increase in the expression of FGF7 and TGFβ1 (where and which types of cells) in the specimens from the diseased groups. In addition, these data need to be quantified, and the &quot;n&quot; number should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. Fibroblasts are the main cells in the ligament and are the focus of our study. In order to better reflect which types of cells express TGFB1 and FGF7, we conducted immunofluorescence co-staining of Fib.9 marker gene APOE and FGF7 and Fib.8 marker gene TOP2A and TGFB1 according to the results of cell interaction analysis. According to the results, we can see that fib.8 and fib.9 groups in the disease group were significantly more than those in the normal group, and fib8 highly expressed TGFB1 and Fib9 highly expressed FGF7 in the disease group, which was consistent with the results of scRNA-seq.</p><p>1.
