events remains unclear. The polarity regulators of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Scribble (Scrib) module are potent tumor suppressors and provide a model for mechanistic investigation. RNA profiling of Scrib mutant tumors reveals multiple signatures of neoplasia, including altered metabolism and dedifferentiation. Prominent among these is upregulation of cytokine-like Unpaired (Upd) ligands, which drive tumor overgrowth. We identified a polarity-responsive enhancer in <italic>upd3</italic>, which is activated in a coincident manner by both JNK-dependent Fos and aPKC-mediated Yki transcription. This enhancer, and Scrib mutant overgrowth in general, are also sensitive to activity of the Polycomb Group (PcG), suggesting that PcG attenuation upon polarity loss potentiates select targets for activation by JNK and Yki. Our results link epithelial organization to signaling and epigenetic regulators that control tissue repair programs, and provide insight into why epithelial polarity is tumor-suppressive.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03189.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03189.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03189.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cavities and organs within our body are lined with epithelial cells, which connect to each other to form continuous barriers. These cells have a highly polarized structure in which different components are found at the top and bottom of cells. In the fruit fly and most other animals, three genes known as the Scribble module control the polarity of epithelial cells. If these genes are faulty, the cells lose their polarity, break the epithelial barrier, and grow rapidly to form a tumor. Most malignant tumors that form from epithelial cells have lost normal cell polarity, so understanding how the organization and growth of epithelial cells are linked is a critical question.</p><p>It is not clear how the loss of cell polarity can drive tumor formation. Here, Bunker et al. used a technique called RNA sequencing to study the expression of genes in tumor cells that have mutations in the Scribble module. Hundreds of genes in the tumor cells had different levels of expression from the levels seen in normal fly cells. One of these is a gene called <italic>upd3</italic>, which was expressed much more highly in tumor cells than in normal cells. This gene activates a signaling pathway—called the JAK/STAT pathway—that promotes cell growth and division in many animals. Bunker et al. found that experimentally lowering the activity of the JAK/STAT pathway reduced the growth of the tumor cells that had lost normal polarity.</p><p>Further experiments show that disrupting the layer of epithelial cells activates two other signaling pathways that work together to switch on the <italic>upd3</italic> gene when cell polarity is lost. Proteins belonging to the Polycomb Group also control the expression of <italic>upd3</italic> and other genes involved in cell growth by altering how genetic material is packaged in cells.</p><p>The similarities between this response and the response to tissue damage suggest that the loss of polarity drives tumor formation through an unstoppable wound-healing reaction. Therefore, Bunker et al.'s findings link the formation of epithelial tumors to the signaling pathways that control the repair of damaged tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03189.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03189.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tumor</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund (BWF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilder</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Classen</surname><given-names>Anne K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM090150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bilder</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007707</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Research Coordinating Committee - Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bunker</surname><given-names>Brandon D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of polarity in epithelial cells leads to mitogenic cytokine upregulation, via coincident activation by JNK and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), and Polycomb derepression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The diagnosis of carcinomas–malignant tumors of epithelial origin—has long involved evaluating tissue architecture. Pronounced disorganization of biopsied epithelia is well-established to correlate with tumor malignancy and lethality. However, whether there exists a causative relationship between epithelial organization and tumor progression, as well as what the underlying mechanism might be, has been mysterious. Recent years have shed important light on the former question, identifying contexts where altered activity of proteins that regulate epithelial cell polarity can promote oncogenic phenotypes. For instance, the apical determinant atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is amplified and over-expressed in multiple cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang and Muthuswamy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parker et al., 2014</xref>), while basolateral regulators are altered in several tumor types and degraded by viral oncoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang and Muthuswamy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elsum et al., 2012</xref>); cancer stem cell activity may also be promoted by transition from an epithelial state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheel and Weinberg, 2012</xref>). Mouse models continue to support key roles for polarity regulators in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pearson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muthuswamy and Xue, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elsum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feigin et al., 2014</xref>), but the mechanisms linking epithelial organization to tissue homeostasis, as well as the cellular targets that promote oncogenic growth upon polarity loss, remain unclear.</p><p>Early evidence for causative links emerged from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where mutations in single polarity-regulating genes can induce dramatic tumorous growths. These polarity regulators–<italic>scribble</italic> (<italic>scrib</italic>), <italic>discs-large</italic> (<italic>dlg</italic>), and <italic>lethal giant larvae</italic> (<italic>lgl</italic>)<italic>-</italic> cooperatively distinguish the basolateral domain from the apical by antagonizing aPKC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">St Johnston and Ahringer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tepass, 2012</xref>). This conserved ‘Scrib module’ functions in both vertebrates and invertebrates, not only in epithelia but also other polarized cell types. Conservation of these and other core polarity regulators allows <italic>Drosophila</italic> to be used as a model to study the coupling between epithelial architecture and growth control.</p><p>When Scrib module function is lost from fly epithelia, mutant cells round up and become multilayered. In the imaginal discs, epithelial organs which normally have a precise intrinsic size-control mechanism, mutant tissue continuously proliferates to more than five times the WT cell number before it kills the animal. Small portions of the tumorous mass, when transplanted into adults, continue to grow uncontrollably and kill the host; such allografts can be repeated indefinitely. This disorganized, lethal and transplantable growth has been termed ‘neoplastic’, and includes several additional features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gateff and Schneiderman, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilder, 2004</xref>). Neoplastic fly tissue is prone to dissemination and degrades basement membrane; in cooperation with oncogenic Ras it can migrate away from its primary site and invade other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pagliarini and Xu, 2003</xref>). It is compromised in its differentiation potential, and cannot form adult structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gateff and Schneiderman, 1969</xref>). It can be recognized by the host innate immune system, whose cellular activities impede its growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cordero et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, it produces long-range signals that induce detrimental responses in fly hosts, including cachexia-like tissue wasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22a">Figueroa-Clarevega and Bilder, 2015</xref>). This suite of phenotypes, which echo those found in mammalian malignancies, suggest that elucidating mechanisms linking epithelial organization to tumor suppression in flies may provide novel insight into human cancer as well.</p><p>What are the genes that induce the multiple aspects of the neoplastic phenotype, and how does loss of a single polarity regulator at the plasma membrane lead to their nuclear misregulation? Here we define the global transcriptional changes associated with tumorigenic epithelial disorganization. By focusing on a single polarity-regulated enhancer of a gene involved in overgrowth, we then untangle signaling, transcription factor, and epigenetic activities that mediate activation upon polarity loss. Our results suggest that epithelia monitor their integrity via a coincidence detection mechanism, and respond to its loss by activating a damage-responsive gene expression program that cannot be turned off in mispolarized tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polarity disruption drives oncogenic transcriptional changes</title><p>The many malignant-like phenotypes observed upon loss of a single polarity regulator must be driven by altered gene expression. To identify such genes, we carried out RNA-Seq analysis of WT and mutant wing imaginal discs. We focused on changes common to neoplasm by sequencing cDNA libraries generated from both <italic>scrib</italic> and <italic>dlg</italic> tumors, which phenocopy each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>).

Differentially expressed genes include several previously identified neoplastic effectors, such as the pro-invasion factors <italic>Matrix metalloprotease 1</italic> (<italic>Mmp1</italic>) and <italic>cheerio</italic> (<italic>cher</italic>) as well as the pupation regulator <italic>insulin-like peptide 8</italic> (<italic>Ilp8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Külshammer and Uhlirova, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of these and other genes shows close agreement with RNA-Seq data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.8844).

Together, these data suggest that restoring expression of differentiation-promoting transcription factors can, in some contexts, block neoplastic transformation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>JAK-STAT ligand transcription promotes neoplastic overgrowth</title><p>The only cell signaling pathway among the top GO categories is the JAK/STAT cascade.

To determine if the Scrib module and PcGs co-regulate additional loci, we carried out a global transcriptional analysis of PcG mutant wing disc tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Comparison of Scrib module and PcG mutant RNA-Seq datasets revealed that nearly half of the genes upregulated upon polarity loss are also upregulated in PcG mutant tissues, a highly significant enrichment (p &lt; 6.98e-121, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

An alternate possibility is that PcG mutant tissue itself is polarity-defective; however, it often maintains polarized organization including areas that upregulate <italic>upd3.3lacZ</italic>, it does not show transcriptional changes of polarity regulators, and unlike neoplastic tissue it is not suppressed by aPKC inhibition ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Classen et al., 2009</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, data not shown).

Similar results were observed upon knockdown of a second PcG component, <italic>Su(Z)2</italic> (data not shown). If reduced PcG function contributes to overgrowth upon polarity loss, then preventing target derepression should suppress neoplastic growth. We inhibited Brahma (Brm), which suppresses PcG-mediated homeotic transformation and often opposes PcG activity at target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tamkun et al., 1992</xref>).

Here, we analyze both global RNA expression and a single polarity-responsive enhancer to delineate the signaling, transcriptional and epigenetic pathways linking epithelial organization to these diverse phenotypes. In polarity-deficient tissues, the simultaneous initiation of Fos-dependent transcription, aPKC-mediated Yki activation, and loss of PcG target repression leads to induction of a broad group of oncogenic factors, including the mitogenic JAK/STAT ligands. Our work provides insight into the logic, as well as the molecular mechanisms, by which polarity maintenance acts as a tumor-suppressive feature.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Linking polarity to growth control</title><p>Our data build on those of others showing that JNK, aPKC and Yki are key players in fly neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grzeschik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doggett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun and Irvine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). By focusing on a single enhancer element of a gene involved in tumorous growth, we clarify the role of implicated regulating kinases and define how proliferation can be triggered by each pathway. Inhibition of Fos can suppress <italic>upd3</italic> upregulation and neoplasia, indicating that this transcription factor itself is the major target of JNK in this context. Yet a polarity-sensitive enhancer is not fully activated by JNK alone, even when apoptosis is blocked. aPKC is an additional regulator of this enhancer, and as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doggett et al., 2011</xref>), can activate Yki independent of, rather than through, JNK. Inhibiting either the JNK or Hpo pathways, including depletion of the downstream transcription factors, prevents expression of the polarity-sensitive enhancer; our analysis predicts that mutating transcription factor binding sites would give the same effect. Knockdown of <italic>upd3</italic> alone in neoplastic tumors does not prevent overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); <italic>upd1</italic> and <italic>upd2</italic> are also regulated by JNK, Yki, and PcG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Classen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Staley and Irvine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) and may act through analogous enhancers to cooperatively drive tumor formation.</p><p>Loss of polarity thus induces two separate signaling pathways. An unknown mechanism triggers JNK to induce Fos-dependent transcription, while at the same time mispolarization of aPKC drives Yki-dependent transcription. Under mild signaling conditions, both pathways are required simultaneously to trigger enhancer expression or overgrowth, while inhibition of either is sufficient to suppress neoplasia. We suggest that polarity-responsive enhancers like <italic>upd3.3</italic> work as ‘coincidence detectors’ that during normal physiology require inputs from both JNK/Fos and aPKC/Yki. In this way, neither stress nor developmental growth signals alone run the risk of triggering malignant transformation. However, upon severe tissue damage that disrupts the epithelium, both stress and polarity signals are initiated to effect repair pathways (see below).</p><p>Our results also emphasize the unexpectedly central role of transcription in mediating cell polarity loss. Inhibition of Fos can revert not only growth defects but also polarity defects of neoplastic tumors. This surprising result suggests that polarity regulation by the Scribble module involves not only antagonistic interactions with the Par module at the cell cortex, but also an important transcriptional component that may be regulated similarly to the mitogenic <italic>upd3</italic> enhancer studied here. Nevertheless, activation of JNK, Yki, or both together is insufficient to elicit polarity defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), while aPKC activation alone is. Thus, aPKC must have additional effectors through which it regulates transformation; further analysis of the neoplastic transcriptome will shed light on this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Yki in neoplastic and hyperplastic growth</title><p>Yki is clearly a major regulator of neoplastic transformation, providing a link between the primary <italic>Drosophila</italic> TSG pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grzeschik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). However, our transcriptional data highlight a major puzzle. Many Hpo pathway targets, including direct growth regulators such as <italic>cycE</italic>, <italic>diap1</italic>, and <italic>Myc</italic>, are expressed at near-normal levels in Scrib module mutants, and comparison of Scrib module and Hpo mutant transcriptomes reveals limited overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). If Yki is activated in both types of tumorous tissue, why do they behave so differently? Our data help to rule out several models for altered Yki target selection. It is unlikely to be driven by simultaneous activation of JNK upon polarity loss, since co-activation of Yki and JNK does not recapitulate neoplastic growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). It is also unlikely to be explained by a model in which Yki activation through aPKC differs from Yki activation through canonical Hpo pathway regulators, since a transgenic 3.5 kb <italic>diap1</italic> fragment is strongly upregulated in neoplastic tissue, paralleling upregulation of a minimal Yki-responsive element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G–J</xref>). Interestingly, an enhancer trap inserted at the same 3.5 kb sequence in the endogenous <italic>diap1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) is only slightly upregulated by comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2K–L</xref>), hinting that the native chromatin environment at certain Yki targets might influence target response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Polarity and epigenetic regulation</title><p>Our data point to PcG as a new player in the transcriptional response to polarity loss. Three pieces of evidence support a close relationship between the Scrib module and PcGs: (1) their related mutant phenotypes, (2) the extensive and highly significant overlap of their mutant gene expression profiles, and (3) the sensitivity of Scrib module mutant overgrowth to changes in PcG activity. However, since canonical PcG targets including Hox genes are not upregulated in neoplastic tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Supplementary files 1–2</xref>), and overall Histone H3K27me3 levels are not altered (data not shown), the data rule out a global inactivation of PcG. Instead, they suggest that decreased PcG-mediated repression ‘primes’ select targets for activation by polarity-responsive effector pathways. Mild activation of either JNK or aPKC alone is insufficient to stimulate enhancers such as <italic>upd3.3</italic>. However, at these targets, reduced PcG activity upon Scrib module loss synergizes with JNK and aPKC signaling, perhaps by providing a permissive chromatin environment for Fos- and Yki-stimulated transcription. More generally, the link to epigenetic regulators that control many targets provides a mechanism by which loss of a single polarity regulator can induce the widespread transcriptional changes that drive the multifaceted neoplastic phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Tumor characteristics revealed by the neoplastic transcriptome</title><p>Our primary analysis focuses on overgrowth, but the transcriptome identifies further features of human cancer found in neoplastic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells.

Khan et al. recently reported that forcing differentiation can cause elimination of neoplastic clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2013</xref>); by contrast, our experiments show that restoring expression of the wing-fate regulator Vg suppresses tumorous overgrowth without inducing cell death. Thus, promoting tissue differentiation may be a tumor suppressive function of epithelial organization.</p><p>Why might loss of polarity drive this particular constellation of events that result in tumorous overgrowth? Our global analysis reveals that apicobasal polarity disruption elicits responses with striking parallels to those seen in epithelial wounds in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schäfer and Werner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Miura, 2014</xref>). These parallels, which are both thematic and extend to regulation of specific genes, include activation of stress signaling, reactive oxygen species production, upregulation of matrix remodeling enzymes, de-differentiation, recruitment of immune cells, and transcription of growth-promoting cytokines that stimulate cell proliferation. Intriguingly, several upregulated neoplastic effectors that contain conserved AP-1 and Sd binding sites are also upregulated during wound-healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). An attractive model is that linking transcriptional control of such targets to polarity regulators, via polarity-regulated aPKC, cell architecture-regulated Yki and stress-regulated JNK activity on both downstream transcription factors and PcG epigenetic regulators, allows the tissue to connect disturbances in its integrity to the activation of broad gene expression programs that promote repair. Following tissue damage, restoration of tissue architecture and integrity would abrogate wound-response signals. In contrast, in polarity-deficient tissues, architecture can never be restored, and these pro-growth, de-differentiation cues remain active, leading to the formation of malignant tumors that kill the organism. Our data linking apicobasal polarity to neoplastic gene expression thus suggest an evolutionarily ancient genesis for cancers as ‘wounds that never heal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dvorak, 1986</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p>The following alleles were used in this study: <italic>white [1118]</italic> (WT), <italic>dlg [40-2]</italic>, <italic>dlg [hf321]</italic> (<italic>dlg</italic><sup><italic>hypo</italic></sup>) <italic>scrib [1]</italic>, <italic>hep [r75]</italic> (JNKK), <italic>Psc/Su(Z)2 [XL26]</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>yki</italic><sup><italic>B5</italic></sup>.
