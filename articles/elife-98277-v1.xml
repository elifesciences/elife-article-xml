However, many non-mammalian vertebrates can fully regenerate their spinal cords after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee-Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alunni and Bally-Cuif, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rodemer et al., 2020</xref>). In the clawed toad <italic>Xenopus</italic>, tadpoles can fully regenerate the spinal cord; however, this capacity is lost during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beattie et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibbs et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Xenopus</italic> offers a rare opportunity to compare cellular and molecular responses to SCI in a regeneration-competent system with a regeneration-incompetent system in the same species. Thus, differences between the responses to SCI in the two stages likely have some functional implications for the difference in regenerative capacity rather than reflecting other phylogenetically accumulated differences in development, as may be the case when different species are compared.</p><p>A recent proteomic screen to identify proteins differentially regulated in regeneration-competent tadpoles versus regeneration-incompetent froglets after SCI identified a number of proteins that are highly upregulated at the tadpole stage but downregulated in froglets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kshirsagar, 2020</xref>). These proteins included Marcks and Marcksl1, which had previously been implicated in the regeneration of other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Amri et al., 2018</xref>) suggesting a potential role for these proteins also in spinal cord regeneration.</p><p>Marcks is an abundant and widely expressed protein with three highly conserved functional domains: an effector domain (ED), a Marcks Homology 2 (MH2) domain, and a myristoylation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brudvig and Weimer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Amri et al., 2018</xref>). Marcks-like protein 1 (Marcksl1) shares strong homology and functionality with Marcks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stumpo et al., 1998</xref>). In an unphosphorylated state, the positively charged ED of Marcks attaches to the plasma membrane, and the myristoylation site tethers the protein to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McLaughlin and Aderem, 1995</xref>). However, when the ED is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), thereby acquiring more negative charges, Marcks translocates to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brudvig and Weimer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McLaughlin and Aderem, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Depending on their phosphorylation status and subcellular localization, Marcks and Marcksl1 regulate multiple processes in the cell. For example, they have been shown to modulate the polymerization and cross-linking of actin filaments, recruit secretory vesicles to the membrane, and interact with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>), thereby regulating multiple signaling pathways downstream of PIP<sub>2</sub> such as phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartwig et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morash et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yarmola et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wohnsland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaughlin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sundaram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, Marcks and Marcksl1 affect cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, secretion, cell proliferation, and differentiation in the nervous system and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brudvig and Weimer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Amri et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, Marcks and Marcksl1 proteins were found to be upregulated in several different regenerative processes, such as lens regeneration in newts, fin regeneration in lungfish and bichirs, tail regeneration in lizards, and cardiac tissue regeneration following infarction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bock-Marquette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sousounis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nogueira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alibardi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, a Marcks-like protein in axolotls (AxMLP) initiates an early proliferative response in axolotl tail and limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sugiura et al., 2016</xref>). In the nervous system, Marcks and Marcksl1 are also significantly upregulated in outgrowing and/or regenerating neurites of facial motor neurons, dorsal root, and superior cervical ganglia, in the optic nerve and during axonal sprouting after brain stroke, suggesting an essential role for Marcks and Marcksl1 in neurite outgrowth and regeneration in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McNamara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmichael et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Szpara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Veldman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we combined Marcks and Marcksl1 gain- and loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> with histological and behavioral analyses to show, for the first time, that Marcks and Marcksl1 also play essential roles during spinal cord development and regeneration. We demonstrate that both proteins have partly redundant functions and are required for normal neurite outgrowth and the proliferation of neuro-glial progenitors during the development of the spinal cord, as well as for its regeneration after full transection. Rescue experiments with pharmacological compounds in Marcks and Marcksl1 loss-of-function animals further suggest that at least some of the functions of Marcks and Marcksl1 in the spinal cord are mediated by phospholipid signaling. Taken together, these findings identify Marcks and Marcksl1 as critical new players in spinal cord development and regeneration and highlight the power of <italic>Xenopus</italic> as an experimental model for identifying new pathways required for regeneration competence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Marcks and Marcksl1 are expressed in the developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> spinal cord</title><p>To elucidate the role of Marcks and Marcksl1 for spinal cord development, we first analyzed mRNA expression of <italic>marcks.S</italic>, <italic>marcksl1.S</italic>, and <italic>marcksl1.L</italic> in embryos of <italic>X. laevis</italic> at stages 26 and 34 (early and late tailbud stage, respectively).

Marcks, but not Marcksl1 was also occasionally seen in cell nuclei.</p><p>Because shuttling between the membrane and cytoplasm is essential for the function of Marcks and Marcksl1 in other developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Amri et al., 2018</xref>), their subcellular localization to membranes and cytoplasm in the spinal cord and their widespread distribution in the developing spinal cord suggests that these proteins may play hitherto unrecognized roles during normal spinal cord development. To test this hypothesis, we next used two independent approaches, injection of antisense Morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, to determine how loss of function of these proteins affects neurite outgrowth, cell proliferation, and neuro-glial progenitor populations during spinal cord development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Marcks and Marcksl1 are required for normal neurite formation during spinal cord development</title><p>We first studied the role of Marcks and Marcksl1 in neurite formation in the spinal cord individually by injecting a single blastomere in 4- to 8-cell stage embryos with either a MO blocking the translation of both <italic>marcks.L</italic> and <italic>marcks.S</italic> or with a mixture of two MOs blocking the translation of <italic>marcksl1.L</italic> and <italic>marcksl1.S,</italic> respectively. To minimize the gastrulation and axis defects previously observed after knockdown of <italic>marcks</italic> or <italic>marcksl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iioka et al., 2004</xref>), we injected lower amounts of MOs (9 ng) than in previous studies (16–40 ng). This resulted in the unilateral knockdown of the respective proteins on the injected side of the embryo, whereas the uninjected side developed normally. <italic>myc-GFP</italic> mRNA was co-injected to identify the injected side. The effectiveness and specificity of all MOs used were validated by in vitro transcription and translation of the various proteins in the presence or absence of the appropriate MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). None of these injections led to significant alterations in immunostaining for the neurite marker acetylated tubulin on the injected side of the spinal cord relative to the uninjected side in stage 34 embryos compared to an unspecific control MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). However, when the three MOs targeting <italic>marcks.S/L</italic>, <italic>marcksl1.S</italic>, and <italic>marcksl1.L</italic> were co-injected, thus blocking all four homeologs (4M MO), acetylated tubulin staining was significantly decreased on the injected side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E, G</xref>). Co-injection of mRNA constructs encoding chicken Marcks and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> Marcksl1, which were selectively mutated to prevent MO binding, resulted in complete rescue of acetylated tubulin staining, confirming the specific action of the MOs used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). This suggests that Marcks and Marcksl1 are required for neurite formation during spinal cord development but act in a largely redundant fashion. To account for these overlapping functions, we aimed to simultaneously knockdown or gene edit all four proteins (Marcks.L/S, Marcksl1.L/S) for the rest of our study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Marcks and Marcksl1 are required for neurite outgrowth during <italic>Xenopus</italic> spinal cord development.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Evaluation of neurite outgrowth after individual morpholino (MO) knockdown of Marcks or Marcksl1 in stage 34–36 developing spinal cords.

In contrast, the PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis inhibitor ISA-2011B had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, F</xref>). This indicates that the stimulation of neurite formation and progenitor proliferation by Marcks and Marcksl1 is indeed PIP<sub>2</sub> dependent. While PIP<sub>2</sub> is generally thought to act upstream of PLC and PLD, additional experiments will be needed to confirm this for the developing spinal cord.</p><p>The ability of Marcks to promote PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling has been previously suggested to be linked to the subcellular localization of the protein, which depends on its phosphorylation status, with unphosphorylated Marcks being mostly membrane-bound and phosphorylated Marcks being largely cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McLaughlin and Aderem, 1995</xref>). In turn, the phosphorylation status of Marcks is regulated by PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McLaughlin and Aderem, 1995</xref>). Although Marcks and Marcksl1 proteins are severely depleted in our CRISPR-injected embryos, clones of cells with at least partially functional Marcks and Marcksl1 proteins are expected to be present due to the mosaicism of CRISPR gene editing effects in our F0 embryos. Assuming that subcellular localization of Marcks and Marcksl1 is functionally important in the spinal cord, we should thus be able to partially rescue the deficiencies of our CRISPR embryos by modulating PKC activity.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used the potent PKC activator Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor Go6983 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Heckman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen, 2003</xref>). Compared to DMSO-treated controls, embryos treated with the PKC inhibitor Go6983 showed a significant increase in the intensity of acetylated tubulin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) as well as in the proportion of PH3-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) on the CRISPR-injected side relative to the uninjected side. In contrast, the PKC activator PMA had no significant effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>). These findings suggest that the unphosphorylated, presumably membrane-bound fraction of Marcks and Marcksl1 is primarily required for neurite formation and progenitor proliferation in the spinal cord. Our other findings suggest that membrane-bound Marcks and Marcksl1 may promote these processes via the activation of PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated PLC and/or PLD signaling.

In contrast, those treated with a PLD inhibitor showed more severe loss of function phenotypes than untreated CRISPR tadpoles. In distinction to embryos, where FIPI has no effect, the latter finding suggests that residual PLD activity must be present in CRISPR tadpoles either because some Marcks/Marcksl1-independent PLD activity remains or because Marcks/Marcksl1 have not completely been knocked out in the entire spinal cord.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Activation of phospholipid signaling rescues deficiencies of spinal cord regeneration in 4M CRISPR-injected tadpoles.</title><p>(<bold>A–O</bold>) Horizontal sections of 4M CRISPR-injected tadpoles at stage 50 exposed to DMSO only (controls; <bold>A, D, G, J, M</bold>) or to PLD/PLC activator Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) (<bold>B, E, H, K, N</bold>) or PLD inhibitor FIPI (<bold>C, F, I, L, O</bold>) for 7 DPT and analyzed for injury gap closure (<bold>A–C</bold>); the proportion of proliferative EdU+ cells (<bold>D–I</bold>) and the proportion of Sox2+ neuro-glial progenitors (<bold>J–O</bold>).

Our findings indicate that these proteins act redundantly and are required for normal neurite formation, proliferation, and possibly the maintenance of neuro-glial progenitor cells during spinal cord development. However, a reasonably normal spinal cord will eventually develop after the knockdown or gene editing of both proteins, suggesting that Marcks- and Marcksl1-independent mechanisms can subsequently compensate for the loss of these proteins.</p><p>We also demonstrated that Marcks and Marcksl1 play similar roles in spinal cord regeneration in tadpoles after injury. Neurite regrowth, injury gap closure, activation of proliferation, and increase in the number of Sox2+ neuro-glial progenitors near the injury site were drastically reduced in tadpoles after the gene editing of both proteins and functional recovery of swimming was delayed. The upregulation of proliferating Sox2+ cells in the ventricular zone was previously shown to be required for regeneration, suggesting that increased division and migration of these cells contribute to injury gap closure and the generation of a permissive environment for neurite regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaete et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muñoz et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings that Marcks and Marcksl1 are required for proper regeneration of the spinal cord after injury suggest that the downregulation of both proteins in postmetamorphic froglets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kshirsagar, 2020</xref>) may be one of the factors preventing spinal cord regeneration in adults. To test this hypothesis, future studies should determine, whether spinal cord regeneration in froglets can be experimentally promoted by overexpression of these proteins.</p><p>Our observation that Marcks and, to a lesser extent, Macksl1 are upregulated in the entire spinal cord, including the ventricular zone, as well as in cells filling the injury gap, suggests that these proteins may act cell-autonomously in the spinal cord-derived cells to promote these regenerative processes. This is also supported by a recent single-cell RNA-seq study of regenerating <italic>Xenopus</italic> tails, which showed that Marcks and Marcksl1 are highly enriched in many neural cell types during tail regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>). However, since both proteins are known to be expressed in macrophages and other immune cells and can modulate the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carballo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Amri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou and Li, 2000</xref>), Marcks- and Marcksl1-immunopositive immune cells that infiltrate the injury site may also contribute to the regeneration-promoting effects of these proteins. Double-labeling with cell type-specific markers and single-cell RNA-seq following SCI will be required in the future to clarify the relative contribution of different Marcks- and Marcksl1-expressing cell types to spinal cord regeneration. Moreover, transplantations of spinal cords between F0-CRISPants and wild-type embryos will allow to address, whether these proteins are required autonomously or non-autonomously for spinal cord regeneration.</p><p>We also show here that activation of phospholipid signaling can rescue deficiencies of neurite formation and neuro-glial progenitor proliferation after the loss of function of Marcks and Marcksl1 during spinal cord development and regeneration. In contrast, a specific inhibitor of PLD-dependent phospholipid signaling further enhances these deficiencies after SCI. Taken together with our findings that enhancement of PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis and PLC signaling as well as inhibition of PKC is also able to partially rescue the effects of Marcks and Marcksl1 loss of function during spinal cord development, this is compatible with a model in which unphosphorylated, membrane-bound Marcks promotes neurite outgrowth and progenitor proliferation via PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent activation of phospholipid signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9T</xref>). This is in agreement with previous studies showing that unphosphorylated membrane-bound Marcks promotes neurite outgrowth by modulating PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling due to its ability to sequester PIP<sub>2</sub> in membrane rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laux et al., 2000</xref>), thereby potentially stimulating PIP<sub>2</sub> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trovò et al., 2013</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laux et al., 2000</xref>). It also provides a link to previous studies suggesting an essential role of PLD-dependent mTORC1 signaling for the proliferation of neuro-glial progenitors during spinal cord regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peñailillo et al., 2021</xref>). However, most pharmacological compounds are known to modulate additional signaling pathways to some extent and the predicted role of phosphorylation and subcellular localization of Marcks/Marcksl1 needs to be validated.

At least eight transverse 20 µm sections were analyzed per animal, spanning the length of more than 300 µm in developing spinal cords. The integrated density for the injected and uninjected sides was averaged separately for every animal (mean integrated density). Then, a ratio for these averages – the integrated density ratio – was calculated for every animal. To determine Sox2/3-positive cell numbers, individual cells from at least eight alternating serial sections were counted on the injected and uninjected sides. For every animal, the ratio for the average number of cells in the injected to uninjected sides was calculated. The percentage of PH3+ cell nuclei out of all ependymal DAPI-positive nuclei was calculated for quantification of cell division on the injected and uninjected sides. For every animal, the ratio of the percentage of PH3+ cell nuclei as well as the ratio of DAPI+ nuclei in the injected to uninjected sides was calculated.

A one-way ANOVA was chosen to compare how a single variable, MOs or RNPs, could affect neurite formation, cell proliferation, numbers of nuclei, or levels of Marcks or Marcksl1. The mean of each condition was then compared using the Tukey test, which compares every mean with every other mean. For pharmacological treatments on developing embryos, a one-way ANOVA was also used with a Dunnett test to compare every mean to a control mean, which was the DMSO condition. A two-way ANOVA was used to compare how CRISPR-gene disruption and injury time points can affect gap closure length after SCI. Here, an uncorrected Fisher’s least significant difference test was used for pairwise comparisons of two specific groups (uninjected and CRISPR) against each other at every time point. Additionally, the mean percentage of EdU+ and Sox2+ cells in CRISPR and uninjected animals were compared at different time points using a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s test to compare every mean independently.

Following euthanasia, the tadpoles were rinsed twice for 5 min in 1× PBS and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Swimming recovery test</title><p>A quantitative recovery test was designed by recording and measuring vibration-induced swimming to analyze the recovery of tadpoles following SCI. For this, tadpoles were placed in a custom-made six-well plate attached to a 10-mm Pico Vibe vibration motor (Precision Microdrives), connected via USB to a Mega 2560 MCU Board (Arduino). The vibration’s duration was programmed using Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Tadpoles were placed in the recording chamber for a 1-min equilibration period and subsequently recorded for 90 s, during which they were subjected to six 3-s stimulation pulses at equal time intervals. After recording, total swimming distances were measured using EthoVision XT video tracking software (Noldus) and analyzed in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were done in accordance with Irish and European legislation under licenses AE19125/P079 and AE19125/P098 from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98277-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are made available as source data files (gel images) or by deposition into the Dryad database under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzsqm">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzsqm</ext-link> (all other data).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schlosser</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>El Amri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Pandit</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Data from: Marcks and Marcks-like 1 proteins promote spinal cord development and regeneration in Xenopus</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.b2rbnzsqm</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by Research Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under grant number 13/RC/2073_P2.

The phenotype of these knockdown experiments were quite severe (failure to gastrulate and shorten axis respectively Iioka et al. 2004, Zhao et al. 2001). As far as I can tell, the MOs were injected at a higher concentration than in this study, however the phenotype does make sense in terms of what we know of the function of these proteins and their peak of expression during gastrulation. Did the authors observe the same phenotype when the MOs are injected at a similar concentration? At the very least, previous studies describing knockdown phenotype should be discussed.</p><p>– Given the published papers cited above and the expression pattern (mRNAs and proteins) described by the authors, there is a possibility that the defects observed are not directly due to the absence of the Marcks in neural progenitors / neurons but are secondary defects of a wider phenotype (i.e. mesoderm formation). Have the authors look at other tissues (muscle, notochord) to ensure that they were formed properly. It is interesting that knockouts in mice mainly lead to neuronal defects despite being expressed in many other tissues (even if I have not seen a paper describing a double knockout of marcks / marcksl1), a point that could be discussed in this manuscript.</p><p>– I would not describe F0 Crispr-injected tadpoles as &quot;knockouts&quot;, the term F0-Crispants is more appropriate otherwise it becomes difficult to distinguish from a &quot;real&quot; knockout strain (which I am not suggesting to generate, given the complexity of knocking out 4 different genes).</p><p>– The authors went on to use F0-Crispants to perform spinal cord transection at NF50. Given the early phenotype observed in MO / Crispr-Cas9 injected embryos, it is not easy to imagine that NF50 would have a functional spinal cord. This is discussed by the activation of Marcks-independent mechanisms, but could the authors expand on what may be happening mechanistically? An alternative explanation would be that only the tadpoles that can overcome the Crispr injection were selected, and therefore only a hypomorph phenotype is observed. Knowing the survival rate of Crispr-injected tadpoles vs controls at NF50 would be a start to address this issue.</p><p>– The description of pattern of expression of the mRNA is confusing to me. First some of this was done elsewhere (Gawantka et al. 1998; Zhao et al. 2001) and it should be acknowledged. Given the sequence similarities between marcks.S and L, I would label the in situs in Figure 1 / Figure S1 marcks or marcks.S/L. In the supplementary figures (S2/3/4) it would help non-<italic>Xenopus</italic> specialists to have a schematic of the embryos showing where the sections are on the AP axis. In particular when comparing marcks1l.L and S, the sections in S3A/B and S4A/B seem to be at very different levels along the AP axis. Finally, are any of the marcks expressed in the progenitor cells in the spinal cord, I cannot really be sure from the picture provided (in particular for marcksl1). The IF experiments could clarify this issue, but as they are presented, it is difficult to establish in which cell types are the Marcks expressed.</p><p>– Concluding from the anti-Acetylated Tubulin staining that the phenotype is a decrease in the number / length of neurites is not appropriate. Anti-acetylated Tubulin staining will also label the cell bodies of neurons and a reduction of neurons will give rise to fewer neurites / axon without their growth being affected. Given the decrease of progenitor proliferation, an alternative explanation would be an overall decrease of the number of neurons. Therefore the authors need to quantify the proportion of neurons in the wildtype and morphant/crispant spinal cords (using a neuronal marker such as Myt1). Labelling of individual neurons by injecting a low dose of a plasmid encoding mb-GFP in the blastomere giving rise to the spinal cord would also help characterising the phenotype (see Panagiotaki et al. 2010). Finally, did the authors notice any defects in motor / sensory axons that project outside the spinal cord (can be visualised both on sections and whole mount)?</p><p>– The authors observed a decrease in proliferation in the morphants/cripants during development and regeneration. Whilst at NF34-36, this is most probably due to a decrease in proliferation of <italic>Sox2</italic>/3+ cells, this is less clear after injury. As noted by the authors, multiple cell types invade the injury site, double labelling of EdU and <italic>Sox2</italic> would help understand which cell types are affected by the reduction in expression of Marcks and Marcksl1.</p><p>– Using chemical inhibitors, the authors argue that the mechanisms by which Marcks / Marcksl1 exert their roles is by promoting production of PIP2, leading to the activation of PLD. Conversely, PKC-dependant phosphorylation inhibits Marcks activity. I am not an expert on phospholipid signalling but it seems to me that S1P is far from being a specific PLD activator. Similarly, PMA is not a specific PKC activator, I cannot comment on NMI/ISA-2011B. Therefore the conclusion from these experiments needs to be carefully worded as to not convey this message (and reference to S1P as being a specific activator of PLD should be removed, i.e. l 257 / 494 / 1188 / 1200, etc). If the role of Marcks is to activate PLD then FIPI treatments on Crispr-injected embryos should not have an effect (Figure 9) when this is clearly not the case, indicating that either some Marcks activity is still present in the 4M Crispr (and therefore it is not a knockout) or some Marcks-independent activity of PLD remains. For this set of experiments, I am not suggesting further experiments but to clarify the text, presenting clearly the caveats of the approach taken.</p><p>– This is confounded by the way the results are presented: in Figure 4A/B, S1P treatment leads to a ratio of ~1 when comparing injected vs uninjected side. Given that the chemical treatment is applied to the whole embryo, there are 2 ways to get to a ratio of 1: one is by rescuing the phenotype on the injected side, the other is by decreasing the AcTub staining / %PH3 staining on the uninjected side. As the data are currently presented, I cannot distinguish between these possibilities. The authors need to show absolute numbers rather than the ratio of injected vs uninjected. The same applies to the rest of Figure 4.</p><p>– Injections: can the authors be more precise about what was injected where? Injection at the 2-cell stage will not target the dorsal ectoderm (l 614). Were all the MO experiments done by injecting 1 blastomere at the 2-cell stage? When injecting a single blastomere at 4/8 cells, which blastomere was targeted? Given that for some experiments only 1 blastomere at 4/8 cell stage is targeted (i.e. Figure 3), should only GFP+ve cells (the tracer) be taken into account when quantifying the phenotype. For example Figure 3C shows barely any cells in the spinal cord that are GFP+ve.</p><p>– in Figure 3 the authors argue that there is a 50% reduction in the number of PH3+ cells in MO/Crispr injected side vs uninjected side (Figure 3D/H) whereas the images consistently show no PH3+ cells in the injected side and 50% PH3+ cells in the rescue (3D). Can they show representative images and outline the area of the spinal cord.</p><p>– L397: what is the length of the cell cycle of progenitors after injury and the bio-availability of EdU? Thuret et al. 2015 calculated the bio-availability of BrdU at 2.5h and Pelzer et al. 2021 established the cell cycle length in the regenerating spinal cord at 50h (after tail amputation in tropicalis which is different to what is done here). A pulse of 16h is unlikely to label the entire population of proliferating cells. A double staining with PCNA could answer this question. Otherwise the text needs to be corrected (in the methods and the text).</p><p>– Whilst the upregulation of Marcks in the ependymal cell compartment is pretty clear (Figure 5), the data for Marcks1 (Figure S14) is much less convincing. Can the authors quantify (by PCR, WB or % of positive cells) these data?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should consider the following points to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The concern about mosaicism of crispants (related to weakness #2),</p><p>As mentioned in the public review session, the usage of crispants in functional assay involves the issue of reproducibility. Their results would be further strengthened if the authors could show a similar phenotype with a gRNA that binds a different genomic sequence. Alternatively, the authors could include the other gRNA test results (total 18 gRNAs) in the manuscript, although they might not be as efficient as the ones used in the functional experiments.</p><p>2) The concern about the pharmacological rescue assay,</p><p>a) Due to the concern that was pointed out in the public review part (weakness #3, specificity), the authors might consider applying a few more compounds to the assay. Or the authors could deliver the candidate gene (PLD) by overexpression directly in the loss of function conditions. Alternatively, the authors should include the results of titration assays in the manuscript, since those results are particularly helpful for the readers that use similar model animals.</p><p>b) During SC regeneration, the authors tested PLD inhibitor (FIPI) only in the loss of function condition (Figure 9). Since there was no proper control for the inhibitor, the inhibitor needs to be tested in wild type condition as well. One interesting point here from the data (Figure 4 and Figure 9) would be that there is a difference between SC development and regeneration in terms of the response to FIPI in the loss of function condition. During SC development, FIPI treatment did not affect the number of proliferative cells but during regeneration it did. If the authors could include the proper control, it could be interesting to discuss the difference in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Rescue experiments of SC regeneration in froglet,</p><p>The authors mentioned Marcks and Marcksl1 are down-regulated in non-regenerative froglet (L54-57). It could be worth trying over expression Marcks and Marcksl1 during SC regeneration in the froglet stage and assess the number of the proliferative progenitor cells and measure gap distance after SC transection. It could be possible to deliver the genes to the injured site with electroporation or AAVs.</p><p>4) Cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous,</p><p>As the authors pointed out in the text (L481-484), whether the function comes from cell autonomous manner or non-cell autonomous manner would be an interesting question, especially in regenerative animals. Therefore, if the authors could successfully label knock-out cells specifically, then the knock-out cells from the neural plate can be transplanted in the neural plate of wild type embryos (embryonic transplantation). At a later stage, neurite outgrowth and progenitor cell proliferation can be analyzed in the same way on the knock-out cells specifically in wild type environments. Such types of experiments and vice versa can give more depth in the manuscript.</p><p>5) Issues on immunostaining images,</p><p>a) Figure 1. K, L, M: for broader readers, it would be difficult to see where the SC in the section is. It is better to use some SC markers to label the cells or simply enclose SC with a dash line in the images.</p><p>b) Figure 1. K-P: at L131, the authors mentioned Marcks is associated with the outer membrane. However, it is not a convincing image. The author needs to provide even higher resolution images or need different approaches, for example, immuno-electron microscopy.</p><p>c) Figure 5. B, E, H, K: It seems Marcks was upregulated during SC regeneration, however it is not clear. If the authors would like to argue the upregulation, it would be better to quantify the signal intensity or number of positive cells per area or</p><p>perform quantitative RT-PCR to support the idea.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Line 116: please replace &quot;strong&quot; with &quot;expressed&quot; for markscl signal in ISH, as ISH is not quantitative.</p><p>2) Figure 1 memGFP experiments are effective. Please consider presenting confocal images with single colors side by side to clarify overlaps, possibly in a supplementary figure.</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, please refer to CRISPR-injected F0 animals as &quot;crispants&quot; aligning with previous literature terminology for mosaic animals (as it has been carefully noted already).</p><p>4) Normally, it would have been necessary to use non-targeting guides for controls, instead of/in addition to uninjected controls. It was a bit surprising to see the authors didn't do this, considering their well-thought experiments throughout the manuscript. However, this work already demonstrates convincing data demonstrating the role of marcks. So, I am noting this comment for their future research endeavours.</p><p>5) In the introduction, the authors mention the loss of regeneration capacity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> during development. It is a missed opportunity to explore the role of marcks proteins in regeneration-incompetent tadpoles. This could begin by validating previous mass spec experiments with marcks antibodies and investigating if overexpression of marcks can induce spinal cord regeneration. However, these suggestions do not detract from the manuscript's current strength; they could be considered for future studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98277.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers have raised several concerns about potential overinterpretations in their conclusions from their data and areas where the text could be improved for clarity of the text.

We also relabelled the images in Figure 1 as marcks.S/L as requested. For the sections we clarified in the legend the level of sections. These are at relatively comparable levels for all three Figures(forebrain, hindbrain, spinal cord) but in the embryo depicted in Figure S4 (now Figure 1- Figure Suppl. 4) the hindbrain seems to have been somewhat compressed laterally so that the fourth ventricle appears compressed and the thin roof of the fourth ventricle, which is clearly visible in Figures S2 and S3 (now Figure 1- Figure suppls 2 and 3) is folded up. In the immunostained sections shown in Figure 1 L,M,O,P we now also labelled the central canal to make it clear that Marcks and Marcksl1 both are also expressed in progenitor cells of the ventricular zone that directly contact the central canal (described in line 133-136 in the main text)..</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Concluding from the anti-Acetylated Tubulin staining that the phenotype is a decrease in the number / length of neurites is not appropriate.

Cell bodies are not or only very weakly labelled and the staining is, consequently, concentrated in the marginal zone of the spinal cord, where the neurite tracts run. We are therefore confident that the significant changes in acetylated tubulin staining that we observe reflect changes in neurite density (we did not specifically analyse motor or sensory neurites). We agree with the reviewer that this does not necessarily reflect changes in axon outgrowth and we, therefore worded our description of the phenotype more carefully. However, even though proliferation is decreased after Marcks/Marcksl1, overall cell numbers are not significantly different between injected and uninjected sides (see new Figures N, O). Reduction in cell number can, therefore, not account for the reduction in acetylated tubulin staining and we added the following statement: “In spite of the reduction in progenitor proliferation after Marcks/Marcksl1 loss of function, overall cell numbers (as indicated by the numbers of DAPI+ nuclei) on the injected side were not yet significantly reduced in these embryos (Figure 3 N, O) indicating that the decrease in neurite staining described in the previous section cannot be attributed to a reduction in overall cell number.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors observed a decrease in proliferation in the morphants/cripants during development and regeneration. Whilst at NF34-36, this is most probably due to a decrease in proliferation of Sox2/3+ cells, this is less clear after injury.

Given that the chemical treatment is applied to the whole embryo, there are 2 ways to get to a ratio of 1: one is by rescuing the phenotype on the injected side, the other is by decreasing the AcTub staining / %PH3 staining on the uninjected side.

The same applies to the rest of Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new supplemental Figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) to show the effects of compounds on injected and uninjected sides separately in absolute numbers. We have also added a statement to this section of the results explaining why we think that the presentation as ratios (which we keep in Figure 4) is the most appropriate way to present these data: “Because pharmacological compounds may affect the spinal cord in multiple ways, not all of which may be Marcks/Marcksl1-dependent, we present our data here as ratios of acetylated tubulin or PH3 staining in injected/uninjected sides (Figure 4). This allows us to specifically determine, whether compounds are able to rescue deficiencies in Marcks/Marcksl1-depleted spinal cords independent of their potentially additional effects on spinal cord development. For completeness, the individual effects of pharmacological treatments on the injected and uninjected sides of embryos are shown in a supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Injections: can the authors be more precise about what was injected where? Injection at the 2-cell stage will not target the dorsal ectoderm (l 614). Were all the MO experiments done by injecting 1 blastomere at the 2-cell stage? When injecting a single blastomere at 4/8 cells, which blastomere was targeted? Given that for some experiments only 1 blastomere at 4/8 cell stage is targeted (i.e. Figure 3), should only GFP+ve cells (the tracer) be taken into account when quantifying the phenotype. For example Figure 3C shows barely any cells in the spinal cord that are GFP+ve.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified throughout the text that dorsal blastomeres were targeted in all injections at 4-8 cell stages. The distribution and intensity of GFP is nevertheless a bit variable on the injected side. Due to the variable GFP intensity, counting only GFP+ve cells would require to make arbitrary decisions about thresholds. We therefore opted for the more conservative approach of just comparing effects on injected vs uninjected side (which should, if anything, give smaller effect sizes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– in Figure 3 the authors argue that there is a 50% reduction in the number of PH3+ cells in MO/Crispr injected side vs uninjected side (Figure 3D/H) whereas the images consistently show no PH3+ cells in the injected side and 50% PH3+ cells in the rescue (3D). Can they show representative images and outline the area of the spinal cord.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the sparse PH3 labeling most sections on the injected side indeed show no PH3 staining, so these sections are representative. The spinal cord has now been outlined in all Figures showing PH3 staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– L397: what is the length of the cell cycle of progenitors after injury and the bio-availability of EdU? Thuret et al. 2015 calculated the bio-availability of BrdU at 2.5h and Pelzer et al. 2021 established the cell cycle length in the regenerating spinal cord at 50h (after tail amputation in tropicalis which is different to what is done here). A pulse of 16h is unlikely to label the entire population of proliferating cells. A double staining with PCNA could answer this question. Otherwise the text needs to be corrected (in the methods and the text).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know the length of the cell cycle in the regenerating spinal cord of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and therefore have reworded our description in the methods and Results section, where we now no longer refer to saturated labeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Whilst the upregulation of Marcks in the ependymal cell compartment is pretty clear (Figure 5), the data for Marcks1 (Figure S14) is much less convincing. Can the authors quantify (by PCR, WB or % of positive cells) these data?</p></disp-quote><p>We now quantified Marcks and Marcksl1 immunostaining after SCI and added this as new Figures 5V and Figure 5 —figure supplement Figure 1U. Significant upregulation of both Marcks and Marcksl1 was observed at day 10 postinjury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors should consider the following points to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The concern about mosaicism of crispants (related to weakness #2),</p><p>As mentioned in the public review session, the usage of crispants in functional assay involves the issue of reproducibility. Their results would be further strengthened if the authors could show a similar phenotype with a gRNA that binds a different genomic sequence. Alternatively, the authors could include the other gRNA test results (total 18 gRNAs) in the manuscript, although they might not be as efficient as the ones used in the functional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We only analysed the total 18gRNAs for knockout efficiencies but did not subject them to a phenotypic analysis, so we cannot present additional phenotypic data. However, we feel that our morpholino data already address this issue of reproducibility, since we are able to show that they generate the same phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The concern about the pharmacological rescue assay,</p><p>a) Due to the concern that was pointed out in the public review part (weakness #3, specificity), the authors might consider applying a few more compounds to the assay. Or the authors could deliver the candidate gene (PLD) by overexpression directly in the loss of function conditions. Alternatively, the authors should include the results of titration assays in the manuscript, since those results are particularly helpful for the readers that use similar model animals.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed in our responses to reviewer, we have significantly toned down and revised our discussion of pharmacological experiments to address these concerns and added additional data obtained with a PLC activator and inhibitor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) During SC regeneration, the authors tested PLD inhibitor (FIPI) only in the loss of function condition (Figure 9). Since there was no proper control for the inhibitor, the inhibitor needs to be tested in wild type condition as well. One interesting point here from the data (Figure 4 and Figure 9) would be that there is a difference between SC development and regeneration in terms of the response to FIPI in the loss of function condition. During SC development, FIPI treatment did not affect the number of proliferative cells but during regeneration it did. If the authors could include the proper control, it could be interesting to discuss the difference in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, but unfortunately, we cannot do any additional experiments and we therefore cannot address any potential difference of the effect of FIP between spinal cord development and regeneration in normal (not CRISPR injected) <italic>Xenopus</italic>. We wish to point out, however, that to check for the capacity of FIPI to modulate the effect of Marcks/Marksl1-depletion we compare the effects of FIPI (experimental condition) to DMSO (control condition) in both embryos and during SC regeneration in tadpoles. To highlight the differences of FIPI responses between embryos and tadpoles, we added the following sentence: “In distinction to embryos, where FIPI has no effect, the latter finding suggests that residual PLD activity must be present in CRISPR tadpoles either because some Marcks/Marcksl1-independent PLD activity remains or because Marcks/Marcksl1 have not completely been knocked out in the entire spinal cord”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Rescue experiments of SC regeneration in froglet,</p><p>The authors mentioned Marcks and Marcksl1 are down-regulated in non-regenerative froglet (L54-57). It could be worth trying over expression Marcks and Marcksl1 during SC regeneration in the froglet stage and assess the number of the proliferative progenitor cells and measure gap distance after SC transection. It could be possible to deliver the genes to the injured site with electroporation or AAVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this and these experiments were indeed planned and we already had obtained ethical approval to go ahead with them. Unfortunately, the student working on the project ran out of time and our animal license to conduct these experiments has now expired, so they will have to be done in future studies. We have now added the following sentence to point this out: “Our findings that Marcks and Marcksl1 are required for proper regeneration of the spinal cord after injury suggest that the downregulation of both proteins in postmetamorphic froglets (Kshirsagar, 2020) may be one of the factors preventing spinal cord regeneration in adults. To test this hypothesis, future studies should determine, whether spinal cord regeneration in froglets can be experimentally promoted by overexpression of these proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous,</p><p>As the authors pointed out in the text (L481-484), whether the function comes from cell autonomous manner or non-cell autonomous manner would be an interesting question, especially in regenerative animals. Therefore, if the authors could successfully label knock-out cells specifically, then the knock-out cells from the neural plate can be transplanted in the neural plate of wild type embryos (embryonic transplantation). At a later stage, neurite outgrowth and progenitor cell proliferation can be analyzed in the same way on the knock-out cells specifically in wild type environments. Such types of experiments and vice versa can give more depth in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we agree that these would be great experiments, but unfortunately these will have to be done in future studies for the reasons explained above. To highlight this we added the following sentence to the paragraph discussing autonomous vs. non –autonomous effects: “Moreover, transplantations of spinal cords between F0-CRISPants and wildtype embryos will allow to address, whether these proteins are required autonomously or non-autonomously for spinal cord regeneration.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Issues on immunostaining images,</p><p>a) Figure 1. K, L, M: for broader readers, it would be difficult to see where the SC in the section is. It is better to use some SC markers to label the cells or simply enclose SC with a dash line in the images.</p></disp-quote><p>We outlined the spinal cord with a dashed line for clarity</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 1. K-P: at L131, the authors mentioned Marcks is associated with the outer membrane. However, it is not a convincing image. The author needs to provide even higher resolution images or need different approaches, for example, immuno-electron microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>For additional clarity, we added some additional labelling (central canal) and outlined the spinal cord in K and N with a dashed line. Yellow arrows in LM, O and P identify membranes, double-labeled for mem-GFP and Marcks or Marcksl1 immunostaining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Figure 5. B, E, H, K: It seems Marcks was upregulated during SC regeneration, however it is not clear. If the authors would like to argue the upregulation, it would be better to quantify the signal intensity or number of positive cells per area or</p><p>perform quantitative RT-PCR to support the idea.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, we now quantified Marcks and Marcksl1 immunostaining after SCI and added this as new Figures 5V and Figure 5—figure supplement 1U; this confirmed significant upregulation of both Marcks and Marcksl1 at day 10 postinjury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Line 116: please replace &quot;strong&quot; with &quot;expressed&quot; for markscl signal in ISH, as ISH is not quantitative.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1 memGFP experiments are effective. Please consider presenting confocal images with single colors side by side to clarify overlaps, possibly in a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 1- Figure suppl. 4 as a supplementary Figure showing the separate channels (+DAPI for orientation)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, please refer to CRISPR-injected F0 animals as &quot;crispants&quot; aligning with previous literature terminology for mosaic animals (as it has been carefully noted already).</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Normally, it would have been necessary to use non-targeting guides for controls, instead of/in addition to uninjected controls. It was a bit surprising to see the authors didn't do this, considering their well-thought experiments throughout the manuscript. However, this work already demonstrates convincing data demonstrating the role of marcks. So, I am noting this comment for their future research endeavours.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out (we have done the controls with non-targeting guides for the embryo experiments but not after SCI).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the introduction, the authors mention the loss of regeneration capacity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> during development. It is a missed opportunity to explore the role of marcks proteins in regeneration-incompetent tadpoles. This could begin by validating previous mass spec experiments with marcks antibodies and investigating if overexpression of marcks can induce spinal cord regeneration. However, these suggestions do not detract from the manuscript's current strength; they could be considered for future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree wholeheartedly, but as explained above, we were unable to complete our planned experiments of overexpressing Marcks/Marcksl1in froglets due to time constraints.</p></body></sub-article></article>
