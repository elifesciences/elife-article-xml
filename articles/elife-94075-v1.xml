contribute to various cancer-related processes, including therapeutic resistance. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using a well-defined drug-gene pair, we identified an enhancer region for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD, <italic>DPYD</italic> gene) expression that is relevant to the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using reporter systems, CRISPR genome-edited cell models, and human liver specimens, we demonstrated in vitro and <italic>vivo</italic> that genotype status for the common germline variant (rs4294451; 27% global minor allele frequency) located within this novel enhancer controls <italic>DPYD</italic> transcription and alters resistance to 5-FU. The variant genotype increases recruitment of the transcription factor CEBPB to the enhancer and alters the level of direct interactions between the enhancer and <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling sensitivity and resistance to 5-FU.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>5-fluorouracil</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>CEBPB</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA251065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Offer</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_212583</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Largiadèr</surname><given-names>Carlo R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetic variant within a newly identified enhancer regulates the expression of a key pharmacogene and alters the balance between resistance and sensitivity to a widely used chemotherapeutic.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Therapeutic resistance has been reported for nearly all anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramos et al., 2021</xref>), and as many as 90% of mortalities in cancer can be linked to drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mansoori et al., 2017</xref>). Enhancer-mediated regulation of gene expression has been increasingly implicated in multiple cancer-related processes, including resistance, response, and toxicity to cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koutsi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lauschke et al., 2019</xref>). However, the specific molecular mechanisms through which epigenetic changes drive these processes remain mostly elusive.</p><p>Enhancers regulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors (TFs) and subsequently interacting with the promoter region of a target gene to drive expression. The activity of enhancers can be affected by localized epigenetic state and genetic variations that affect TF binding. More than 90% of disease-associated genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) lie in the non-coding portion of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manolio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>). Many of these GWAS variants map to putative enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boix et al., 2021</xref>). Regardless, translating enhancer GWAS variants into disease mechanisms remains a largely unmet challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claringbould and Zaugg, 2021</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, we identified a <italic>cis</italic> expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for the chemotherapeutic metabolism gene dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase enzyme (DPD, encoded by the <italic>DPYD</italic> gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etheridge et al., 2020</xref>). DPD is the initial and rate-defining enzyme for the conversion of the commonly used chemotherapeutic 5-FU into inactive metabolites. Hepatic DPD eliminates approximately 85% of circulating 5-FU within minutes of administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sommadossi et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heggie et al., 1987</xref>), and deficiency of DPD is associated with severe (clinical grade ≥3) toxicity to 5-FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amstutz et al., 2018</xref>). Clinical and preclinical studies have identified missense and splicing variants of <italic>DPYD</italic> that consistently correlate with reduced DPD function and increased 5-FU toxicity risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amstutz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Offer et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Offer et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Offer et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nie et al., 2017</xref>). However, these variants explain &lt;20% of reported cases of grade ≥3 5 FU toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amstutz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meulendijks et al., 2015</xref>), and the mechanisms contributing to 5-FU resistance, and therefore means to overcome resistance, remain elusive.</p><p>In the present study, we used human liver tissues and cellular models to identify and characterize a novel <italic>cis</italic>-enhancer element capable of modulating <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. We additionally provide mechanistic data demonstrating that transcription-factor driven expression of <italic>DPYD</italic> is dependent on allele status for a common germline genetic variant located within this enhancer, suggesting that the variant could be a valuable biomarker of 5-FU toxicity risk. Furthermore, the genotype-dependent regulation of DPD expression offers a potential mechanism for overcoming resistance in patients carrying the risk variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>DPYD</italic> enhancer regions</title><p>Candidate <italic>cis</italic> enhancer regions for <italic>DPYD</italic> (NM_000110.4) were identified using GeneHancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fishilevich et al., 2017</xref>) and Ensembl Regulatory Build (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zerbino et al., 2015</xref>) data mapped to GRCh37/hg19.

Six guide RNAs (gRNAs) were used to target dCas9 fusion proteins to each region of interest, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to monitor changes in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression following transfection.</p><p>Targeting of dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi) to the E9 region significantly decreased <italic>DPYD</italic> expression relative to control for four of six gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Targeting of dCas9-KRAB to E16 resulted in a significant decrease in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression for one of six gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and no significant reductions in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression were noted following transfection of gRNAs for E20 in dCas9-expressing cells; however, two gRNAs increased <italic>DPYD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For reciprocal CRISPRa experiments, targeting dCas9-P300 to E9 significantly increased <italic>DPYD</italic> expression for four of six gRNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas gRNAs specific to E16 and E20 did not elicit any significant changes in <italic>DPYD</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).

As expected, targeting dCas9-KRAB to E9 resulted in a localized increase in H3K9me3 compared to controls, indicating a shift from active to inactive chromatin at E9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; the primer nearest E9 is denoted by the gray box). Targeting of dCas-P300 to E9 caused changes consistent with epigenetic activation of the region, including a localized gain of H3K27ac-marked chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar changes in localized histone modifications were noted when dCas9-KRAB and dCas9-P300 HCT116 cells were directed to E9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>).

Furthermore, using an innovative digital droplet RT-qPCR–based approach, we demonstrate that the rs4294451 T allele is associated with elevated expression of the <italic>cis DPYD</italic> transcript in human liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>).</p><p>Allele frequency data retrieved from gnomAD suggest that a majority (65–70%, estimated from allele frequencies) of individuals of African ancestry carry the rs4294451-T allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), whereas only about 35% of individuals of European ancestry are predicted to be carriers of the T allele. African American patients have worse overall survival in colorectal cancer compared to white patients, owing to biological and non-biological factors. While differential access to healthcare, treatment bias, and socioeconomic factors have been shown to contribute to the poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mayberry et al., 1995</xref>), other unrecognized factors also contribute to this difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govindarajan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2007</xref>). Our data support a hypothesis that higher systemic 5-FU catabolism to due elevated liver DPD expression in carriers of the rs4294451-T allele results in lower exposure to active anti-tumor metabolites of 5-FU. Additionally, we demonstrate that colorectal cancer cell lines likely retain the enhancer functions associated with the rs4294451-T allele, suggesting that tumor cells carrying this variant could more readily inactive 5-FU via increased DPD expression. The higher likelihood of carrying the T-allele in individuals of African ancestry would, therefore, place them at greater risk. Additional studies will be needed to investigate the degree to which rs4294451-T contributes to survival and progression in colorectal cancer and in other solid cancers frequently treated with 5-FU.</p><p>The transcription factor CEBPB is a member of the CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein family, a group of transcription factors that contain basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domains and is highly expressed in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jakobsen et al., 2013</xref>). Multiple CEBPB isoforms have been detected, with some acting as transcriptional activators and others as inhibitors. The data presented herein indicate that active isoforms of CEBPB are up-regulating <italic>DPYD</italic> through binding to the E9 enhancer region. Inhibitory isoforms of CEBPB have also been shown to be important for certain physiological processes including tumorigenesis and liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bégay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Our over-expression studies used the full-length active isoform. Therefore, we cannot rule out a role for the inactive isoform participating in the regulation of <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. In addition to acting as a homodimer, CEBPB can also heterodimerize with other CEBP family proteins and interact with other transcription factors, including P300/CBP, CREB, NFKB, AP1, and NFAT, to co-regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seo et al., 2021</xref>). Additional studies are underway to characterize the role of additional regulatory factors within the <italic>DPYD</italic> enhancer region identified in this manuscript.</p><p>In silico analyses suggested that the rs4294451 A allele created a stronger binding site for CEBPB within the E9 enhancer region. However, our data demonstrate that the T allele is associated with higher reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), higher DPD expression in both knock-in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and human liver tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>), and localized epigenetic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Enrichment of CEBPB to the E9 region was likewise shown to be higher in cells with the rs4294451 T allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and higher levels of interaction were also noted between the E9 region with the T allele and the <italic>DPYD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings are also consistent with previously reported eQTL results for the haplotype block linked to rs4294451, where the T allele was associated with higher levels of <italic>DPYD</italic> expression in human liver specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etheridge et al., 2020</xref>), and our observation that the T allele is associated with cellular resistance to 5-FU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The binding of CEBPB to specific motifs has recently been shown to be cell-type specific and to rely on non-consensus binding motifs with binding strengths that can be modulated by the sequence and structure of surrounding DNA regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lountos et al., 2022</xref>), providing a possible explanation for the discrepancy between predicted and observed results.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first report directly linking CEBPB to 5-FU metabolism and the first mechanistic data demonstrating the <italic>cis</italic> effects of a regulatory variant on <italic>DPYD</italic> expression. The role of CEBPB in modulating 5-FU resistance and toxicity is not without precedent. For example, mir-191 is abnormally expressed in several cancers and has been associated with both 5-FU resistance and the regulation of CEBPB expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; however, the CEBPB–<italic>DPYD</italic> regulatory axis has not previously been recognized. Furthermore, CEBPB signaling has been shown to be activated in colorectal cancer cells following treatment with 5-FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that CEBPB-mediated activation of <italic>DPYD</italic> expression might represent a dynamic response to therapy.</p><p>While the contributions of regulatory variants to 5-FU metabolism have not been widely studied to date, previous studies have explored DPD regulation. Our laboratories previously characterized a <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variant for DPD located within the microRNA mir-27a that was subsequently shown to further increase 5-FU toxicity risk in individuals that carried deleterious nonsynonymous <italic>DPYD</italic> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Offer et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amstutz et al., 2015</xref>). The variant at rs4294451 is in LD with the <italic>DPYD</italic> variants c.85T&gt;C and c.496G&gt;A, which served as coding region proxies for allele-specific expression in our present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). The haplotypes defined by these two coding-region variants together with a third variant (c.1129–5923C&gt;G/rs75017182) previously associated with varied levels of systemic DPD activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamzic et al., 2021</xref>). A subsequent retrospective analysis indicated that these haplotype differences translate to a differential risk of severe 5-FU toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Medwid et al., 2023</xref>); however, additional studies are needed that are powered to evaluate more than the most common haplotypes. Taken together, these results suggest that the differential regulatory effects of rs4294451 alleles could further impact overall DPD activity and, by extension, modulate the risk of severe 5-FU–related toxicity conferred by coding or splice-variants in <italic>DPYD</italic>. Further work is also needed to identify interactions between the linked variants that impact DPD enzyme activity and the regulatory variant to define systemic DPD function and 5-FU toxicity risk.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>HEK293T, HCT116, and HepG2 cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Collection Center (ATCC, Manassas, VA).

DNA sequence corresponding to the 101-nucleotide region centered on rs4294451 was retrieved from genome build GRCh38.p13 (NC_000001.11). A second DNA string was created to mimic the sequence corresponding to the rs4294451 A allele. Position frequency matrices for each transcription factor were retrieved from JASPAR CORE 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castro-Mondragon et al., 2022</xref>) and converted to log-scale position weight matrices using the toPWM method implemented in TFBSTools. JASPAR includes binding site information from multiple sources. ENCODE data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) were available for CEBPB (matrix ID MA04661) and JUND (MA0491.1). In the absence of ENCODE data, alternatives including PAZAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Portales-Casamar et al., 2007</xref>) (HNF4A, MA0114.2; FOXA1, MA0148.3), REMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammal et al., 2022</xref>) (FOXA2, MA0047.3), and data from an individual publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>) (MYBL2, MA0777.1) were used. EP300 is a cofactor that does not recognize a specific DNA motif on its own; instead, it interacts with various DNA-binding factors to modify chromatin and facilitate the activation of target genes. As such, P300 does not have a DNA-binding motif and was not included in analysis. Nucleotide sequences were scanned using the patterns presented in the position weight matrices to identify putative transcription factor binding sites. Forward and reverse strands were searched, and the 70<sup>th</sup> percentile between the minimum and maximum possible value for a matrix was used as the minimum threshold score. Empirical p-values for each score were calculated by an exact method using the TFMPvalue R package. R version 4.2.2 was used for analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Significance was defined as <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 unless otherwise noted in the text. Pairwise comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests calculated using GraphPad Prism version 9. One-way ANOVA statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism. Summary statistics pertaining to allele-specific expression were calculated using Quantasoft software as described in the Allele-specific gene expression section. Transcription factor binding predictions and associated analyses were performed in R version 4.2.2 as described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Currently an AbbVie employee and receives stocks from the company</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reports current research support from Processa Pharmaceuticals, Inc, which are outside of the conduct of this study.

The experimental approach was developed and pursued with in vitro and in vivo strategies. Combining molecular, cellular, and biochemical approaches, the authors identify a germline variant with compromised enhancer control. Several lines of evidence were presented that are consistent with increased CEBP recruitment to the DPYD regulatory domain with consequential modifications in promoter-enhancer interactions that are associated with compromised 5-fluorouracil resistance. Functional identification of promoter and enhancer elements was validated by CRISPRi and CRISPRa assays. ChIP and qPCR documented histone marks that can account for the control of DPYD gene expression were established. Consistency with data from patient-derived specimens and direct assessment of 5-fluorouracil sensitivity provides confidence in the proposed mechanisms. The model is additionally supported by genome data from a population with high &quot;compromised allele frequency&quot;. It can be informative to directly demonstrate DPYD promoter-enhancer interactions. However, the genetic variants support the integration of regulatory activities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

We note the point of possible revision noted from the Public Review: “It can be informative to directly demonstrate DPYD promoter-enhancer interactions. However, the genetic variants support the integration of regulatory activities.” In Figure 4, we provide evidence for direct promoterenhancer interaction though the use of 3C. We furthermore demonstrate that these interactions are dependent upon genotype at rs4294451 as stated by the reviewer. We have highlighted the promoter-enhancer interaction in the revised manuscript, lines 323-325. The role of genotype in this interaction is also specifically discussed in lines 378-381.</p></body></sub-article></article>
