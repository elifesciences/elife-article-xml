glycan characterization. Here, we develop CyTOF-Lec as an approach to simultaneously characterize many protein and glycan features of human immune cells at the single-cell level. We implemented CyTOF-Lec to compare glycan features between different immune subsets from blood and multiple tissue compartments, and to characterize HIV-infected cell cultures. Using bioinformatics approaches to distinguish preferential infection of cellular subsets from viral-induced remodeling, we demonstrate that HIV upregulates the levels of cell-surface fucose and sialic acid in a cell-intrinsic manner, and that memory CD4+ T cells co-expressing high levels of fucose and sialic acid are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Sialic acid levels were found to distinguish memory CD4+ T cell subsets expressing different amounts of viral entry receptors, pro-survival factors, homing receptors, and activation markers, and to play a direct role in memory CD4+ T cells’ susceptibility to HIV infection. The ability of sialic acid to distinguish memory CD4+ T cells with different susceptibilities to HIV infection was experimentally validated through sorting experiments. Together, these results suggest that HIV remodels not only cellular proteins but also glycans, and that glycan expression can differentiate memory CD4+ T cells with vastly different susceptibility to HIV infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living cells have a sugar coating.

To study these proteins, researchers had previously covered them in metal-studded antibodies (which stick to proteins) and used a technique called cytometry time of flight, or CyTOF for short, to quantify the levels of these proteins on the surface of cells susceptible to HIV. Adapting this tool to investigate sugars could answer questions about HIV infection. For example, does the virus prefer to infect cells coated in certain sugar molecules? And does it change the pattern of sugars on the surface of the cells it infects?</p><p>Ma et al. adapted CyTOF to use molecules called lectins (which stick to sugars) in conjunction with the metal-studded antibodies. This made it possible to simultaneously measure the levels of 34 different proteins and 5 different types of sugars on individual cells. The pattern of sugars on the surface of cells from the immune system differed depending on what tissues the cells came from, and what types of cells they were. The results showed that HIV preferred to infect memory CD4 T cells with high levels of two types of sugar: fucose and sialic acid. Furthermore, during infection, the levels of both these sugars increased.</p><p>Current treatments for HIV keep virus levels low but do not cure the infection. Further research could determine whether sugars have a role to play in HIV persistence. It is possible that the sugar patterns preferred by the virus help it to avoid detection. A clearer understanding of cell surface sugars could lead to sugar-targeting drugs that kill infected cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CyTOF</kwd><kwd>glycans</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>lectins</kwd><kwd>sialic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI147777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI131374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK123733</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abdel-Mohsen</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG062383</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abdel-Mohsen</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS117458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abdel-Mohsen</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI143385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abdel-Mohsen</surname><given-names>Mohamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1AI164559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UM1AI164567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>Nadia R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Glycans are remodeled by HIV and are determinants of CD4+ T cell susceptibility to HIV infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses generally need to hijack multiple host cell processes to complete their replication cycle. This virus-mediated manipulation of host processes is called viral-induced remodeling, and has been studied using a variety of approaches, most entailing virally infected cell lines analyzed in bulk. More recently, viral remodeling of primary cells was studied at the single-cell level by characterizing, via cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), human tonsillar T cells infected ex vivo by varicella zoster virus (VZV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sen et al., 2014</xref>). Bioinformatics analyses of high-dimensional CyTOF datasets of VZV-infected cells revealed that VZV infection elicits significant host cell remodeling and alters the skin-trafficking property of subsets of infected cells. We recently implemented a follow-up approach, termed predicted precursor as determined by single-cell linkage using distance estimation (PP-SLIDE), to document HIV-induced remodeling of T cells from blood, lymph node, and genital tract, define the subsets of cells most susceptible to HIV infection, and characterize the phenotypes of HIV-infected cells in viremic and virally suppressed PLWH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>One important feature of PP-SLIDE is that it enables assessment of whether a receptor differentially expressed on HIV-infected cells reflects HIV-induced remodeling or preferential infection of cells harboring that pattern of expression of the receptor. For example, PP-SLIDE established that HIV-infected T cells express low levels of CD4 and CD28 not because HIV preferentially infects CD4<sup>Low</sup>CD28<sup>Low</sup> T cells, but rather because HIV downregulates these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2021</xref>), which were independently shown to be down-modulated by HIV accessory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia and Miller, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swigut et al., 2001</xref>). Other HIV-remodeled surface receptors identified by PP-SLIDE include those involved in T cell migration to lymph nodes and markers of Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, the low levels of surface CD127 expression on HIV-infected tonsillar T cells reflected preferential sparing of CD127<sup>High</sup> T cells from productive infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequent studies demonstrated that CD127<sup>High</sup> memory T cells preferentially undergo latent infection by HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hsiao et al., 2020</xref>). These and other PP-SLIDE-generated findings of preferential infection of cellular subsets have been experimentally validated through a variety of sorting experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that important insights into HIV pathogenesis and persistence can be gained from characterizing HIV-induced remodeling of primary cells at a single-cell level.</p><p>However, such remodeling studies – and in fact all phenotypic characterizations of virally infected cells to date – have only examined the cells’ proteomes. Completely overlooked has been the diverse collection of glycans that are assembled on the surface of all living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams and Thorson, 2009</xref>). Cell-surface glycosylation plays critical roles in regulating multiple cellular processes and immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrera et al., 2002</xref>), as well as cell-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Freitas Junior et al., 2011</xref>) and cell-pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colomb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Everest-Dass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giron et al., 2020b</xref>) interactions. Furthermore, multiple viruses (e.g., HSV-1, CMV, and HTLV1) have been shown to alter the surface glycosylation of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiraiwa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kambara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nyström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nyström et al., 2009</xref>). To date, studies of host glycomes have been limited to analysis of bulk cells, using techniques such as mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography, and lectin microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), although bacteria have been characterized at the single-cell level using lectins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leipold et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study analyzing bulk populations of CD4+ T cells with different glycan features demonstrated that they harbor different levels of HIV transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colomb et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the host cell glycome can affect HIV susceptibility and/or replication. However, robust tools to deeply characterize, at the single-cell level, the glycan features of immune cells – including HIV-infected ones – are lacking to date.</p><p>In this study, we developed a new approach taking advantage of the high-parameter analysis capabilities of CyTOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bendall et al., 2011</xref>), to phenotype cells simultaneously for protein and glycan features. This was achieved through conjugating a collection of lectins (proteins that specifically bind different types of glycans) to metal lanthanides, an approach that has previously been validated at the bulk level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leipold et al., 2009</xref>). We call our approach CyTOF-Lec – as it combines traditional CyTOF (using lanthanide-conjugated antibodies) with lanthanide-conjugated lectins to characterize surface glycosylation patterns of cells – and applied it on both blood and tissue cells. Taking advantage of the high-dimensional nature of our resulting CyTOF-Lec datasets and our PP-SLIDE analysis pipeline, we set out to address the following two fundamental questions about HIV infection: (1) Does HIV preferentially infect cells exhibiting distinct glycan features, and (2) to what extent does HIV remodel the glycan features of its host cell?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development and validation of CyTOF-Lec</title><p>To establish a methodology that could simultaneously characterize protein and glycan features at the single-cell level, we developed a panel of lanthanide metal-conjugated antibodies and lectins compatible with CyTOF, which we refer to as CyTOF-Lec (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> A). As tonsils provide an abundant source of both T and B cells, we used these cells for our initial validation of the panel. First, we confirmed that the staining patterns of the lanthanide-conjugated antibodies were consistent with the known differential expression of their target antigens on tonsillar T vs. B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and with results previously reported using CyTOF without lectin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). To ensure that the lectin staining did not displace or alter the antibodies bound to their protein targets, we developed a protocol whereby surface antibody staining was completed prior to lectin staining (see Materials and methods). We confirmed that all five lectins (AOL, MAL-1, WGA, UEA-1, ABA, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) conjugated to lanthanides stained both T and B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that antibody binding to CD3, CD4, and CD8 was the same whether or not the specimens were subsequently stained with lectins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To establish the specificity of lectin binding, we assessed the effect of sialidase, which degrades cell-surface sialic acid. As expected, binding by WGA and MAL-1, which detect different forms of sialic acid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), was decreased after sialidase treatment of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, binding by AOL and UEA-1, which detect different forms of fucose, and ABA, which detects T antigen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), were all increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). This was expected as removal of sialic acid should enable better detection of these other glycan structures, and is consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giron et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF)-Lec.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Antibody staining for protein markers is not altered by lectins.

Having identified the PRE cells, we then determined which glycans, if any, were remodeled by HIV infection. This was accomplished by assessing for lectins that differentially bound the PRE as compared to the infected cells. Glycans were quantitated by reporting the median signal intensity (MSI) of their corresponding lectins among each population of cells from each donor. Interestingly, we found that both fucose and sialic acid were upregulated during HIV infection. Infected cells from all three sites potently upregulated total fucose as assessed by AOL binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), although this upregulation did not reach statistical significance (after correcting for multiple comparisons) for the endometrium. Binding by UEA1, however, was not significantly different between infected and PRE cells, and tended to be downregulated in the endometrium and tonsils, and upregulated in PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As UEA1 binds α1–2 branched fucose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), these results suggest that fucosylation is globally upregulated upon infection of tissue CD4+ T cells with HIV, although not the type of fucosylation that creates α1–2 branched structure.

We therefore assessed whether HIV infection elicits any glycosylation alterations in bystander cells. To identify bystander memory CD4+ T cells, we gated the infected culture on CD4+ Tm cells that were HSA-negative. Increased binding by all five lectins was observed among bystander tonsillar CD4+ Tm cells relative to their counterparts from uninfected cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that in at least some tissue sites, remodeling of glycans on bystander CD4+ T cells occurs.

We next conducted manual gating to assess whether the HIV-susceptible cells express high levels of both fucose or sialic acid, or whether they belong to distinct subsets of fucose+ vs. sialic acid+ cells. We focused on the AOL and WGA datasets, as they cover total fucose and different forms of sialic acid, respectively. We first examined, within the HIV-infected cultures, the infection rates among CD4+ Tm cells expressing high vs. low levels of AOL or WGA.

Consistent with the MSI data, the percentages of cells expressing high levels of AOL or WGA were higher among PRE cells in both tonsils and PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting preferential infection of fucose- and sialic acid-expressing cells by HIV at these sites. Interestingly, AOL<sup>High</sup> WGA<sup>High</sup> cells were also significantly over-represented among PRE cells at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the HIV-susceptible Tm cells co-express fucose and sialic acid. Indeed, visualization of the PRE cells by t-SNE revealed cells binding high levels of both AOL and WGA among the tonsillar and blood compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although PRE cells from the endometrium did not preferentially express fucose or sialic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), PRE cells co-expressing AOL and WGA could be detected from this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting the endometrium, like the other two sites, harbors HIV-susceptible cells co-expressing fucose and sialic acid.

Fucose levels, however, are higher in PBMCs than endometrium, suggesting that the fact that AOL<sup>High</sup> endometrial CD4+ Tm cells aren’t preferentially targeted for infection cannot be explained by exceptionally high levels of fucose expression.

Interestingly, the fold-enrichment was highest among the tonsils (reaching almost 20-fold in one donor), suggesting that of all three sites, this one exhibits the most preferential selection of subsets for infection. Compared to the other two sites, the tonsils also harbored more enriched clusters with significantly elevated levels of fucose, sialic acid, and T antigens relative to their expression levels on uninfected CD4+ Tm cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess whether the enriched clusters co-express fucose and sialic acid, we assessed by t-SNE heatmaps the levels of AOL and WGA binding on concatenated files of all the enriched clusters from each site. This analysis revealed regions of the t-SNEs co-expressing high levels of fucose and sialic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), confirming the manual gating data that HIV-susceptible cells co-express these two classes of glycans.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>FlowSOM clustering confirms that HIV-susceptible subsets from tonsils and PBMCs harbor high levels of fucose and sialic acid.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) t-SNE plots based on FlowSOM analysis of uninfected CD4+ Tm and PRE cells from endometrium, tonsil, and PBMC specimens, showing 20 color-labeled clusters of cells.

The WGA<sup>High</sup> cells preferentially expressed fucose (as assessed by AOL binding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with earlier observations of co-expression of fucose and sialic acid on HIV-susceptible CD4+ T cells. Relative to their WGA<sup>Low</sup> counterparts, the WGA<sup>High</sup> cells also preferentially expressed higher levels of CD4 and the HIV co-receptor CCR5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), potentially explaining the increased susceptibility of these cells to infection. As activated T cells are known to be preferentially susceptible to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stevenson et al., 1990</xref>), we also compared expression levels of activation markers on the WGA<sup>Low</sup> and WGA<sup>High</sup> cells, and found that six markers of T cell activation (HLADR, CD69, CD38, CD25, CD28, and ICOS) were all elevated on the latter population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To further validate the notion that the high susceptibility of WGA<sup>High</sup> CD4+ Tm cells is closely associated with the activation status of these cells, we phenotyped CD4+ Tm cells from resting vs. PHA-stimulated PBMCs. As expected, the stimulated CD4+ Tm cells expressed higher levels of multiple activation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Importantly, the stimulated CD4+ Tm cells also bound higher levels of WGA, consistent with upregulation of sialic acid upon T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, activated cells, as defined as those expressing high levels HLADR, CD69, CD38, CD25, CD28, or ICOS, all expressed higher levels of sialic acid as compared to cells with low levels of these activation markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data together strongly support the notion that high sialic expression identifies the most activated subsets of CD4+ Tm cells.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that WGA<sup>High</sup> cells may support higher levels of productive infection because these cells better survive the cytopathic effects of HIV replication. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that WGA<sup>High</sup> cells expressed higher levels of CD127, a marker of long-lived self-renewing cells, and Ox40 and BIRC5, which are involved in protecting HIV-infected cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). In comparison, markers preferentially expressed on the WGA<sup>Low</sup> cells were those of central memory T cells, including CD27, CCR7, and CD62L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Additional markers in our CyTOF panel differentially expressed between the WGA<sup>Low</sup> and WGA<sup>High</sup> cells included other glycans, transcription factors, homing receptors, and exhaustion markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although these results suggest that high levels of sialic acid may simply be a biomarker of the most HIV-susceptible CD4+ Tm cells, it did not rule out the possibility that sialic acid plays a direct role in HIV susceptibility. To test this, we tried two approaches to diminish cell-surface sialic acid expression: transient treatment with either sialic acid synthase inhibitor P-3F<sub>AX</sub>-Neu5Ac or sialidase. Inhibitor treatment did not decrease cell-surface sialic acid levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), but sialidase did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We therefore exposed mock- or sialidase-treated cells to HIV-F4.HSA for 3 days and then assessed infection rates by FACS. We found that infection rates were decreased in a sialidase dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). These results suggest that a single glycan – sialic acid – may not only be capable of distinguishing memory CD4+ T cells with vastly different phenotypic features and HIV susceptibility but may also play a direct role in promoting infection by the virus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We describe here the development and implementation of CyTOF-Lec, a high-parameter single-cell method to simultaneously quantitate multiple glycans and proteins on the surface of human cells. We used CyTOF-Lec to identify glycomic and phenotypic differences between immune subsets from blood and multiple tissues, and between uninfected and HIV-infected CD4+ T cells. Moreover, by performing PP-SLIDE bioinformatics on our datasets of HIV-infected blood and tissue cells, we identified unique glycan features characteristic of HIV-susceptible CD4+ T cells, and identified glycan structures that were remodeled as a result of cell-intrinsic HIV replication.</p><p>Multiple studies have demonstrated remodeling of host cells upon HIV infection. HIV infection of cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>) as well as primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavrois et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2021</xref>) leads to up- and downregulation of a variety of host proteins, reflecting the ability of the virus to hijack host processes to complete its replication cycle. We demonstrate in the current study that HIV also remodels the surface glycome of infected cells. By implementing PP-SLIDE to discern antigens differentially expressed as a result of remodeling from those differentially expressed as a reflection of HIV selection, we found that both fucose and sialic acid were upregulated on CD4+ T cells after infection. As core fucosylation on the cell surface is critical for CD4+ T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2018</xref>) and activated cells are more permissive to HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stevenson et al., 1990</xref>), HIV may upregulate fucosylation to maintain an elevated state of activation facilitating the completion of its replication. We cannot rule out, however, that upregulation of fucose is a byproduct of T cell activation, and not a direct consequence of HIV infection. Of note, fucosylation is also important for lymphocyte trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colomb et al., 2020</xref>), and the upregulation of fucose on infected cells, even if not directly promoting viral replication, may facilitate the circulation of infected cells from blood into tissues where ample populations of HIV-permissive CD4+ T cells reside.</p><p>Sialic acid, like fucose, was also upregulated as a result of HIV infection. In general, sialylated glycans on the surface of cells can elicit an immunosuppressive response by effector cells of the immune system. For example, binding of sialic acid on the surface of cancer cells to Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 proteins on the surface of NK cells can diminish NKG2D-mediated activation of the NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, NKG2D may play an important role in NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected cells and NKG2D ligands are actively downregulated by HIV Nef to escape immune recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jost and Altfeld, 2012</xref>). We postulate that through a combination of upregulating sialic acid and downregulating NKG2D ligands, HIV may evade NKG2D-mediated killing by NK cells.</p><p>Interestingly, sialic acid was also preferentially expressed on the memory CD4+ T cells that were preferentially targeted for infection by HIV. These results suggest that the high levels of sialic acid on HIV-infected cells results from preferential infection of cellular subsets with high levels of cell-surface sialic acid, followed by further upregulation of this glycan. Interestingly, however, the preferential selection of WGA<sup>High</sup> memory CD4+ T cells for HIV infection was only observed in tonsils and PBMCs, but not in the endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Because memory CD4+ T cells from the endometrium express higher levels of cell-surface sialic acid than those from tonsils or PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), most endometrial memory CD4+ T cells may already have the WGA<sup>High</sup> HIV-permissive phenotype, resulting in minimal selection of these cells by HIV. Indeed, this would be consistent with the many subsets of endometrial memory CD4+ T cells that are susceptible to HIV infection, as compared to a markedly lower number of HIV-susceptible memory CD4+ T cell subsets from the blood compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). It is also worthwhile to note that the endometrium is a unique tissue in that it serves as the site of blastocyst implantation and development of a semi-allogenic fetus. The unusually high levels of sialic acid on immune cells from this tissue may be important to prevent immune-mediated rejection of spermatozoa or the developing fetus.</p><p>Importantly, HIV’s preference for cells expressing high levels of sialic acid was validated by demonstrating via sorting experiments that blood-derived memory CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of WGA were significantly more susceptible to infection than those expressing low levels of WGA. The WGA<sup>High</sup> population exhibits many features that could explain its high susceptibility: higher expression levels of HIV receptor/co-receptor, higher activation status, and higher expression of markers associated with survival of HIV-infected cells. However, our somewhat surprising finding that sialidase-treated cells are more poorly susceptible to HIV additionally suggest that sialic acid may exert a direct role in promoting HIV infection; the precise step in the viral replication cycle affected by sialic acid should be interrogated in future studies. Regardless, since thus far markers that distinguish memory CD4+ T cells with differing susceptibilities to HIV have been difficult to identify, our findings that WGA may be useful as a tool to isolate a highly susceptible population of CD4+ T cells could be of practical use for the field. On a more fundamental level, our results suggest that host glycan expression can very much influence HIV replication dynamics.</p><p>Of note, we cannot rule out the possibility that the high levels of fucose and sialic acid on HIV-infected cells may also result in part from binding of HIV virions to the surface of the infected CD4+ T cells. HIV particles contain cell-derived glycolipids, including the sialic acid-containing GM3 ganglioside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Puryear et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, HIV gp120 is heavily N-glycosylated, with a majority of high-mannose N-glycan structures and a lower proportion of complex N-glycans carrying lactosamine residues and terminal sialic acid. Sialic acid on gp120 is recognized by multiple members of the Siglec family of lectins, and these lectins can facilitate <italic>trans</italic>- or cell-to-cell infection of CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Izquierdo-Useros et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Varchetta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). However, we note that our studies characterizing infected cells defined these cells as those that express HSA – which is not on the surface of input virions – and that have downregulated cell-surface CD4, a hallmark of productive HIV infection. The fact that we found unique glycan features of these cells relative to bystander CD4+ T cells suggests that productively infected cells have distinct cell-surface glycan features in a manner not attributable to just surface virion sticking.</p><p>Our study has limitations. First, since cells from the different compartments (blood, tonsils, and endometrium) were run in separate batches, it is difficult to compare expression levels between cells from these compartments, which is why our analysis focused on relative glycan expression levels among cells within each compartment. Second, while WGA is commonly used as a reagent to monitor cell-surface sialic acid levels, it also binds GlcNAc, so we cannot rule out that some of the WGA effects we observed were due to GlcNAc and not sialic acid. Notably, a recent study reported that cell-surface GlcNAc is important for HIV binding and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spillings et al., 2022</xref>), which is in line with our observation that WGA<sup>High</sup> cells are highly susceptible to HIV infection. Third, a limited number of donors were analyzed, particularly in the sialidase treatment experiments, as those experiments were technically challenging due to the toxic effects of sialidase treatment on primary CD4+ T cells from most tested donors.</p><p>While our study focused on characterizing cells productively infected with HIV-1, identified as those expressing on their cell surface the LTR-driven HSA reporter protein, we envision that CyTOF-Lec will also be useful for studying the HIV reservoir that persists despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Recent observations suggest that a significant portion of the reservoir in ART-suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) is transcriptionally active, expressing short and incomplete HIV transcripts in the absence of ex vivo stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yukl et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we recently demonstrated using cells from ART-suppressed PLWH that CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of fucose contain significantly more transcriptionally active HIV reservoir cells than those expressing low levels of fucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colomb et al., 2020</xref>). With the development of CyTOF-Lec as a single-cell analysis tool, we will now be able to interrogate glycan expression patterns on transcriptionally active, as well as transcriptionally silent HIV reservoir cells. Specifically, we envision combining CyTOF-Lec with PP-SLIDE analysis of reservoir cells from PLWH. This will entail using bioinformatics approaches to trace ex vivo reactivated cells to their original pre-stimulation states by PP-SLIDE, an approach we previously described and validated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>), but under conditions where we incorporate assessment of the glycan features of the reservoir cells with the CyTOF-Lec panel.</p><p>Beyond HIV, CyTOF-Lec has potentially wide-ranging applications. Glycosylated host receptors play important roles in enabling the attachment of virus. For example, influenza virus enters cells by binding of its hemagglutinin (HA) protein to terminal sialic acid moieties attached to surface proteins of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The novel beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may also exploit host cell glycosylation for infection, as its primary receptor ACE2 is heavily glycosylated. Indeed, blockage of N- and O-glycan synthesis on the host cell can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry by diminishing the ability of the viral spike protein to bind ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Better understanding the surface glycans of virally susceptible host cells through single-cell glycomic analysis by CyTOF-Lec, in conjunction with identifying the protein backbones harboring the glycans, will improve our understanding of viral pathogenesis and can potentially lead to novel prophylactic or therapeutic agents for clinically relevant viral pathogens.</p><p>Further development of CyTOF-Lec in conjunction with next-generation sequencing approaches will also be valuable for developing the tools to better understand how glycan expression associates with or directly regulates host cell processes. A recent report combined glycomic analysis with single-cell RNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kearney et al., 2021</xref>) by incubating cells with a biotinylated version of the lectin L-Pha followed by a DNA-barcoded anti-biotin antibody. Subsequent droplet encapsulation and sequencing revealed the transcriptomes of cells with different levels of L-Pha binding. We envision that by directly conjugating lectins to barcoded DNA oligos, we can expand the numbers of lectins we can simultaneously monitor. Furthermore, additional inclusion of DNA-barcoded antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>) will enable simultaneous surface proteome analysis. Such a technology, while not as high-throughput, scalable, and cost-effective as CyTOF-Lec, will enable a genome-wide analysis of cellular processes associated with differential surface glycosylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Total T cells were then re-exported as FCS files and imported into Cytobank for calculations of MSI, and high-dimensional analyses by t-SNE and FlowSOM. t-SNE and FlowSOM plots were generated with default settings except for a modification of total metaclusters from 10 to 20 for FlowSOM analysis. t-SNE and FlowSOM plots were generated excluding all parameters used upstream in the gating strategy (CD19 and HSA) and all glycan characterization parameters. To map defined populations onto t-SNE plots, subsets were defined by manual gating, and then pseudo-colored on the t-SNE plots using FlowJo software. Box plot graphs were generated using ggplot2 in R.</p><p>Identification of PRE cells by PP-SLIDE was implemented using recently described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neidleman et al., 2020b</xref>) to match each infected cell against every CD4+ T cell in the uninfected sample and using k-nearest neighbor calculations to identify the phenotypically most similar. The degree of enrichment of each FlowSOM cluster in PRE cells was calculated by dividing each cluster’s relative size within the PRE cells by its relative size within total uninfected CD4+ Tm cells:</p><p>Enrichment ratio (Cluster X) = Number of Cluster X cells relative to PRE cells/Number of Cluster X cells relative to uninfected Tm cells.</p><p>Clusters with ratios &gt; 1 were designated as enriched and those with ratios &gt;0 and &lt;1 as non-enriched, while clusters with undetectable PRE cells were not shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Expression levels were reported as MSI for each parameter (protein or glycan) within each cell population analyzed. Student’s two-sided paired t-tests were used to test for differences in MSI among phenotypic subsets (B cell, CD8+ Tm, CD8+ Tn, CD4+ Tm, and CD4+ Tn cells): among uninfected and bystander cells; or among uninfected cells, PRE cells, and infected cells. p-Values were adjusted for multiple testing using false discovery rate (FDR) via the Benjamini-Hochberg or Holm method as indicated in figure legends. FDR adjusted p-values that were &lt;0.05 were considered as significant.</p><p>SLIDE analysis was conducted using the R package SLIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>) as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). SLIDE was developed as a nearest-neighbor approach to identify and quantify viral-induced remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sen et al., 2014</xref>). The ratios between two distance measures in SLIDE (the remodeling score) provides a relative measure of remodeling, and is compared to a background remodeling score generated from SLIDE analysis of non-infected cells, as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-78870-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78870-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw CyTOF data have been deposited in Dryad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7272/dryad.Q6FT8J92">https://doi.org/10.7272/dryad.Q6FT8J92</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Roan</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Single-cell Glycomics Analysis by CyTOF-Lec Reveals Glycan Features Defining Cells Differentially Susceptible to HIV</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7272/Q6FT8J92</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health R01AI127219, R01AI147777, and P01AI131374, UM1 AI164559, and UM1 AI164567 to NRR, and R01DK123733, R01AG062383, R01NS117458, and R21AI143385 to MAM.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Julie M Overbaugh (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These suggested revisions are mostly meant for clarity.</p><p>Ma et al. take a novel approach to an important problem of host cell susceptibility to HIV. They tackle an understudied area of glycan effects on HIV infection using a new method they developed called CyTOF-lec. This method allows single cell detection of infected cells when using a reporter virus for infection. Importantly, the authors go to considerable trouble to use biologically relevant systems, including a transmitted virus and tonsil, endometrial and peripheral T cells. They find that cells expressing higher levels of fucose and sialic acid are more likely to be infected with to HIV than those with low levels. The studies presented here suggest, although didn't fully resolve, that sialic acid itself may be important for infection in CD4, CCR5 positive cells, although they can't really rule out that sialic acid is simply a biomarker for other cell features, such as activation state and entry receptor levels, which are known to impact susceptibility to HIV. Nonetheless, the findings point to glycans as a biomarker and potential determinant for HIV cells susceptibility and open the door to new avenues for studies the interplay between cell surface glycans and viral infections.</p><p>Histograms and dot plots in Figure 1 and S1 show broad unimodal distributions of lectin staining.

They tackle an understudied area of glycan effects on HIV infection using a new method they developed called CyTOF-lec. This method allows single cell detection of infected cells when using a reporter virus for infection. Importantly, the authors go to considerable trouble to use biologically relevant systems, including a transmitted virus and tonsil, endometrial and peripheral T cells. They find that cells expressing higher levels of fucose and sialic acid are more likely to be infected with to HIV than those with low levels. The studies presented here suggest, although didn't fully resolve, that sialic acid itself may be important for infection in CD4, CCR5 positive cells, although they can't really rule out that sialic acid is simply a biomarker for other cell features, such as activation state and entry receptor levels, which are known to impact susceptibility to HIV. Nonetheless, the findings point to glycans as a biomarker and potential determinant for HIV cells susceptibility and open the door to new avenues for studies the interplay between cell surface glycans and viral infections.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and reviewers for the nice summary, and for the positive response to our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Histograms and dot plots in Figure 1 and S1 show broad unimodal distributions of lectin staining. How much overall information is being gained from these lectin stains?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, all the lectins had stained with a unimodal distribution pattern. In fact, many protein phenotyping markers (e.g., the CCR7 and CD27 antigens commonly used to define the Tcm and Tem subsets) also stain unimodally, in contrast to the distinct bimodal staining one gets with CD4 or CD8. Importantly, there is a lot of valuable information to be gained from unimodal staining patterns (including by the lectins), since in high-dimensional space it becomes clear that such staining is not random but very specific for different subsets or clusters of cells. This is now visualized in the new tSNE plots we added as part of Figure S1 (now re-named Figure 1—figure supplement 1 per <italic>eLife</italic>’s format) per the request immediately below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As part of the validation and general description of staining, Figure S1 would benefit from tSNE plots of total CD45 tonsil cells colored by intensities of each of the lectins (perhaps annotated by major subsets).

That being said, given the consistency of the lower staining by some (but not all) of the lectins, and not other CyTOF protein-based markers, we believe that tonsils may indeed express lower levels of some of the glycans (e.g., that recognized by AOL). It was unfortunately not logistically possible to run the tonsil specimens within the same batch as the endometrial and PBMC specimens. We have now acknowledged (Lines 430-433) that a limitation of our study was the need to run specimens in multiple batches, which resulted in the tonsil, endometrial, vs. PBMC specimens to be run in different batches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusions from the section ending on line 262 are not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a sentence to sum up the overall conclusion from this section: “All together, these results suggest that among blood and tonsillar memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, those with the highest levels of fucose and sialic acid are preferentially targeted for infection by HIV; this phenomenon was however not observed among endometrial cells.” (Lines 269-271).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The tSNE plots provided throughout are poorly annotated in terms general features of the different regions of the plot.

This way of visualizing the data is not effective as each compartment has less “space” for visualization, since much space is taken up by cells from a different compartment. This is particularly true for the endometrial cells, which segregated into a very small area of the tSNE when analyzed in this manner. By contrast, when run as its own tSNE, as we had shown in Figure 5, the endometrial cells nicely separate out into distinct visualizable clusters.It is for this reason that we ran separate tSNE plots for each compartment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A general trend in high dimensional analysis has been towards the use of UMAP, which are often more intuitive and easier to annotate.

UMAP, however, like tSNE, has its disadvantages, including that it does not preserve local neighborhoods. Because CyTOF datasets are still commonly depicted by tSNE, and because CyTOF analysis software and scripts commonly use tSNE visualization, we decided to stick with tSNE visualizations. This also enables better visual comparisons with our prior CyTOF datasets on HIV specimens which all implemented tSNE visualizations (e.g., PMID 35296537, PMID 35154118, PMID 33910003, PMID 32990219, PMID 32452381, PMID 28746881).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>tSNE plots colored by AOL and WGA staining in Figure 4C, 5C are difficult to read.
