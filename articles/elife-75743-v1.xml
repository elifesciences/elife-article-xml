While the generation of this library has been described and was cited (White et al. 2018 JBC), the materials of this library are inherently limited, and the generation of this library required substantially intellectual contributions on the part of Prof. Geoffrey C Hoops and Prof. R Jeremy Johnson. We are therefore formally correcting the eLife paper to include both as co-authors on this paper. The figure reporting the structures of this library (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) was derived from an original figure provided by Dr. Hoops. In addition, both Dr. Hoops and Dr. Johnson have reviewed the manuscript for accuracy, have access to primary (raw) data as needed, support the conclusions of this manuscript, and are responsible for all its parts.</p><p>The details of Profs. Hoops and Johnson’s contribution are explained below:</p><p>“Professors Hoops and Johnson first derived and employed the fluorescent ester substrate library as a means of efficiently characterizing esterase substrate specificity and promiscuity. Creation of this library was central to our manuscript and enabled the characterization of human and mouse serum esterases, staphylococcal esterases FrmB and GloB, and whole cell <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.”</p><p><bold>New authors list:</bold></p><p>Justin J Miller, Ishaan T Shah, Jayda Hatten, Yasaman Barekatain, Elizabeth A Mueller, Ahmed M Moustafa, Rachel L Edwards, Cynthia S Dowd, <bold>Geoffrey C Hoops, R Jeremy Johnson,</bold> Paul J Planet, Florian L Muller, Joseph M Jez, Audrey R Odom John</p><p><bold>Original authors list:</bold></p><p>Justin J Miller, Ishaan T Shah, Jayda Hatten, Yasaman Barekatain, Elizabeth A Mueller, Ahmed M Moustafa, Rachel L Edwards, Cynthia S Dowd, Paul J Planet, Florian L Muller, Joseph M Jez, Audrey R Odom John</p><p><bold>Details for the omitted authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Geoffrey C Hoops</bold></p><p>Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana 46208–3443</p><p>Contribution: Methodology</p><p>Competing interests: No competing interests exist</p><p><bold>R Jeremy Johnson</bold></p><p>Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana 46208–3443</p><p>Contribution: Methodology</p><p>Competing Interests: No competing interests exist</p><p><bold>Original Acknowledgements:</bold></p><p>We are grateful to the students of the Spring 2020 Biol 4,522 course at Washington University for the creation of FrmB point mutation plasmids and the purification of FrmB point mutants.
