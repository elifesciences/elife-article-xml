and give rise to the vertebral column. While somite formation has been studied in several animal models, it is less clear how well this process is conserved in humans. Recent progress has made it possible to study aspects of human paraxial mesoderm (PM) development such as the human segmentation clock <italic>in vitro</italic> using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs); however, somite formation has not been observed in these monolayer cultures. Here, we describe the generation of human PM organoids from hPSCs (termed Somitoids), which recapitulate the molecular, morphological, and functional features of PM development, including formation of somite-like structures <italic>in vitro</italic>. Using a quantitative image-based screen, we identify critical parameters such as initial cell number and signaling modulations that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures in our organoid system. In addition, using single-cell RNA-sequencing and 3D imaging, we show that PM organoids both transcriptionally and morphologically resemble their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts and can be differentiated into somite derivatives. Our organoid system is reproducible and scalable, allowing for the systematic and quantitative analysis of human spine development and disease <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans are part of a group of animals called vertebrates, which are all the animals with backbones. Broadly, all vertebrates have a similar body shape with a head at one end and a left and right side that are similar to each other. Although this is not very obvious in humans, vertebrate bodies are derived from pairs of segments arranged from the head to the tail. Each of these segments or somites originates early in embryonic development. Cells from each somite then divide, grow and specialize to form bones such as the vertebrae of the vertebral column, muscles, skin, and other tissues that make up each segment.</p><p>Studying different animals during embryonic development has provided insights into how somites form and grow, but it is technically difficult to do and only provides an approximate model of how somites develop in humans. Being able to make and study somites using human cells in the lab would help scientists learn more about how somite formation in humans is regulated.</p><p>Budjan et al. grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids, and used chemical signals similar to the ones produced in the embryo during development to make the cells form somites. Various combinations of signals were tested to find the best way to trigger somite formation. Once the somites formed, Budjan et al. measured them and studied their structure and the genes they used. They found that these lab-grown somites have the same size and structure as natural somites and use many of the same genes.</p><p>This new organoid model provides a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time. This can provide insights into the development and evolution of humans and other animals that could then help scientists understand diseases such as the development of abnormal spinal curvature that affects around 1 in 10,000 newborns.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>paraxial mesoderm</kwd><kwd>somitogenesis</kwd><kwd>human organoids</kwd><kwd>image-based screen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01GM099117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Budjan</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name><name><surname>Hormoz</surname><given-names>Sahand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL158269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Budjan</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name><name><surname>Hormoz</surname><given-names>Sahand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-183143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Budjan</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name><name><surname>Hormoz</surname><given-names>Sahand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human somites are formed in organoids from human pluripotent stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Paraxial mesoderm (PM) development involves the formation of embryonic segments called somites, which are produced sequentially from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and arranged periodically along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the vertebrate embryo. Somites give rise and contribute to a variety of tissues including skeletal muscle, dermis, cartilage, and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chal and Pourquié, 2017</xref>). Somite formation is controlled by a conserved molecular oscillator, the segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dequéant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oates et al., 2012</xref>). Previous efforts have focused on how this oscillator controls somite formation using a variety of model systems such as mouse, zebrafish, and chick because of ethical and technical limitations of culturing human embryos. Recently, researchers were able to recapitulate PM development using human and mouse pluripotent stem cells cultured as 2D monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>). These cells undergo species-characteristic oscillations similar to their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts. However, final stages of somite development and vertebra formation were not observed in currently published human cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Palla and Blau, 2020</xref>), suggesting that certain aspects of <italic>in vivo</italic> development are not recapitulated in these 2D systems. We reasoned that a 3D cell culture system may exhibit all the stages of PM development including morphogenetic processes associated with somite formation.</p><p>Here, we describe an organoid system derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) called Somitoids, which faithfully recapitulates functional, morphological, and molecular features of PM development, including formation of somite-like structures <italic>in vitro</italic>. To identify the culture conditions that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures, we developed a quantitative image-based screening platform for individual organoids. Our screening approach identified the optimal parameter values for the culture conditions such as the initial cell number and the concentration of the chemical modulators. We show using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR that Somitoids resemble their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts both transcriptionally and morphologically and can be differentiated into somite derivatives such as sclerotome and dermomyotome <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Our Somitoid system is reproducible and scalable, allowing for systematic and quantitative analysis of PM development and somite formation to study human spine development and disease in a dish. Finally, our approach can be used to systematically screen organoid cultures for desired phenotypes and reproducibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Recently, protocols have been developed to differentiate mouse or human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) towards PM using a combination of the WNT agonist CHIR and BMP inhibitor LDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>). To adapt the protocol for a 3D model of human somitogenesis, we first optimized the initial conditions of our cultures by generating pluripotent spheroids of defined cell numbers. hiPSCs were allowed to aggregate for 24 hr as suspension cultures in pluripotency media (mTeSR1) in the presence of ROCK inhibitor and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to promote aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These pluripotent spheroids resemble cavity-stage epiblast embryos as previously described for kidney organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, spheroids were cultured in media containing CHIR and LDN (CL), similarly as done for the monolayer cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>), but with CHIR at a higher concentration (10 µM). After 24 hr in CL media, epiblast-stage cells transition to a neuromesodermal progenitor (NMp) or primitive streak cell fate, characterized by co-expression of T/BRA and SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By 48 hr, cells rapidly downregulate SOX2 and express PSM markers, including TBX6 and MSGN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This PSM state persists from day 2 to day 4 and is also characterized by the expression of segmentation clock genes such as HES7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). On day 5, organoids showed expression of marker genes associated with somite fate as characterized by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Taken together, the order of activation of marker genes in the PM organoids followed the expected stages of differentiation observed during PM development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived paraxial mesoderm (PM) organoids turn on marker genes associated with PM differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of PM organoid differentiation protocol from hPSCs. hPSCs aggregated and formed spheroids for 24 hr prior to differentiation.

To improve reproducibility, we set out to screen for the optimal initial cell number, the concentration of the signaling factors, and the timing of their additions during culture. For our primary screen, we compared organoids with an initial cell number of 500 and 1000 as well as combinations of modulators of candidate signaling pathways that have previously been involved in PM development and somite formation, including FGF, WNT, BMP, and TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aulehla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tonegawa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xi et al., 2017</xref>).

We chose day 3 as a starting point for our systematic screen because PSM marker gene expression was more uniform compared to day 2 organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and day 4 organoids are not significantly different from day 3 organoids based on a previous study and our own immunostaining and qPCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>). To quantitatively compare conditions, we developed an image analysis pipeline to determine organoid diameter and normalized average PAX3 expression intensity per organoid in an automated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We analyzed three organoids per condition. Strikingly, all organoids that were treated with any combination of FGF or WNT inhibitor reproducibly expressed PAX3 within 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). However, organoids that were initiated from 1000 cells displayed a higher fraction of PAX3-negative cells compared with organoids initiated from 500 cells, even though the average PAX3 expression levels across the entire organoid were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additional staining for SOX2, a neural marker, showed that PAX3-negative cells expressed SOX2, suggesting that our PM organoids derive from NMps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, staining for F-ACTIN, together with nuclear expression of PAX3, more consistently revealed somite-like structures (radial arrangement of PAX3+ columnar cells with expression of apical F-ACTIN in the central cavity) in organoids made from 500 cells compared with organoids made from 1000 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>).

Additionally, organoids initiated from 500 cells and then treated for 48 hr had a smaller diameter compared with organoids of the same initial cell number that were treated for only 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that long-term inhibition of WNT and/or FGF, known mitogenic signaling pathways, has detrimental effects on proliferation or cell survival. These results indicate that treatment of PSM-stage organoids with pathway modulators for 24 hr is sufficient to induce somite fate.</p><p>Next, we set out to optimize the culture conditions to increase the number of somite-like structures in addition to the expression levels of the somite marker genes. We looked for morphological hallmarks of somite formation, specifically the formation of rosette-like structures consisting of radially arranged bottle-shaped PAX3+ epithelial cells with their NCAD+ apical surface facing a central cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>).</p><p>We used 500-cell spheroids as an initial starting point and compared two different inhibitor doses for FGF and WNT in addition to the other pathway modulators applied to PSM-stage organoids on day 3.

In addition to quantifying PAX3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we also counted the number of somite-like structures per organoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>; see Materials and methods for a description of the scoring criteria). Comparing PAX3 expression levels in our treated organoids, we observed that somite fate can be broadly induced across a range of treatment regimes, concentrations, and types of WNT and/or FGF inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, the number of somite-like structures is not necessarily correlated with average PAX3 expression levels. For example, the numbers of somite-like structures in several conditions (FGFRi<sup>hi</sup>/PD173, WNTi<sup>hi</sup>/C59, WNT<sup>hi</sup>/C59+ FGFRi<sup>lo</sup>, WNTi<sup>hi</sup>/XAV) were lower in organoids treated for 24 hr followed by culture in basal media for 24 hr compared with organoids that were treated with the same inhibitors for 48 hr, even though they exhibited higher PAX3 expression levels on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Furthermore, we did not detect cells of different developmental origins, suggesting that we are generating homogeneous organoids containing only PM derivatives.</p><p>We next assessed whether our <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived somite-like structures show similar spatial organization and size distribution to their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts.

Day 5 cells co-expressed both somite marker genes TCF15 and PAX3 throughout the Somitoid, and somite-like structures displayed apical localization of F-ACTIN.

Organoid-derived somite-like structures were similar in size (median area = 8892 µm<sup>2</sup>, interquartile range [IQR] = 7698–10682 µm<sup>2</sup>) to Carnegie stage 11 somites (median area = 9681 µm<sup>2</sup>, IQR = 8262–11493 µm<sup>2</sup>) but larger than earlier-stage human somites (Carnegie stage 9 somites, median area = 4399 µm<sup>2</sup>, IQR = 4089–4433 µm<sup>2</sup>; Carnegie stage 10 somites, median area = 4704 µm<sup>2</sup>, IQR = 4477–5343 µm<sup>2</sup>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Using a simple suspension culture that does not require manual matrix embedding, we identified optimal differentiation conditions by systematically screening initial cell numbers and modulating the signaling factors. Importantly, our culture conditions are compatible with high-throughput screening approaches. Many established organoid protocols currently have limited applications because they are not reproducible. Therefore, we set out to identify the optimal differentiation conditions that minimized the variability between organoids as quantified by automated image analysis.</p><p>One critical parameter we identified in our screens was the initial cell number used for aggregation. Our results suggest that if the initial cell number is above a certain threshold then somite fate cannot be induced in a homogeneous manner in our organoid system. This result is in line with previous findings in 3D models such as gastruloids, multi-axial self-organizing aggregates of mouse ES cells, which exhibit a higher degree of variability and multiple elongations when the number of initial cells exceeds a threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beccari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van den Brink et al., 2014</xref>). Another important finding of our screens was that simply removing FGF, WNT pathway agonist as well as BMP inhibitor yielded the most reproducible and efficient somite-like structure-forming organoids. This treatment regime does not necessarily follow from applying prior <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> knowledge of somitogenesis. Previous protocols have used FGF and WNT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>) or inhibition of all four candidate signaling pathways (FGF, WNT, BMP, and TGF-β) to induce somite fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Loh et al., 2016</xref>) in monolayer cultured hiPSCs. While these conditions similarly induced somite fate marker genes in our 3D system, removal of FGF/WNT agonists and BMP inhibitor overall performed better as indicated by larger organoid diameters, higher average PAX3 expression levels, and higher number of somite-like structures. In line with these findings, our scRNA-seq analysis revealed that day 5 somite-like cells from our optimized protocol autonomously downregulate WNT target genes (DKK1, AXIN2, WNT3A, RSPO3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and FGF target genes (FGF8, FGF17, SPRY4, DUSP6/MKP3, SEF/IL17RD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Finally, our screening results also suggest that focusing on marker gene induction as a phenotypic readout alone is not sufficient to optimize culture conditions of more complex organoid models such as somitogenesis.</p><p>The scRNA-seq analysis of our hPSC-derived Somitoids independently confirmed our immunostaining and qRT-PCR results and showed that all major paraxial mesodermal cell types are generated, consistent with the cell types observed during PM development. Comparing our single-cell dataset with previously published <italic>in vitro</italic>-generated human PM transcriptomic data of monolayer cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>) reveals a similar pattern of activation of marker genes. Diaz-Cuadros and colleagues did not generate bona fide somitic cells as their final timepoint cell population does not express canonical somitic markers. Matsuda et al. indeed show expression of several somitic marker genes including TCF15, MEOX1, and PAX3 based on bulk RNA-seq data. Interestingly, our own analysis of day 5 somitic cells revealed multiple distinct subclusters, suggesting transcriptional heterogeneity within this population, which could have not been inferred from bulk data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Importantly, neither of these papers report formation of somite-like structures, suggesting that transcriptional similarity alone is not sufficient to predict morphological features, in line with our screening results showing that average marker gene expression is not a good predictor of <italic>in vitro</italic> induction efficiency of somite-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>).</p><p>While expression patterns of canonical somitic marker genes seem to be conserved in humans, it will be interesting to perform detailed gene expression analysis to identify putative human-specific genes of somite differentiation. Since our Somitoid system is reproducible, it could serve as a versatile platform to perform functional screens of human-specific or disease-relevant genes using CRISPR/Cas9 or small-molecule inhibitor libraries. Somitoids thus provide a powerful <italic>in vitro</italic> system for studying the regulation and dynamics of human somitogenesis, including somite formation.</p><p>One limitation of this work is that the current protocol does not produce an AP axis and therefore does not generate somite-like structures in a bilaterally symmetric fashion as in the vertebrate embryo. A similar phenotype was recently reported in mouse gastruloids grown under similar signaling conditions that were embedded in Matrigel to promote self-organization into trunk-like structures (TLS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veenvliet et al., 2020</xref>). Chemical modulation of BMP and WNT signaling pathways in Matrigel-embedded gastruloids resulted in the formation of somite-like structures arranged like a bunch of grapes, similar to what we observed in our system. In standard culture conditions, gastruloids and TLS recapitulate the axial organization of the embryo, which is missing in our Somitoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beccari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Veenvliet et al., 2020</xref>). To expand the patterning and morphogenetic potential of our Somitoid system, our approach could be combined with a microfluidics setup to generate spatio-temporally controlled morphogen gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Manfrin et al., 2019</xref>). In summary, Somitoids provide a scalable, reproducible, and easy to manipulate platform to study molecular networks underlying the differentiation of PM, as well as the morphogenetic processes of somite formation. Furthermore, Somitoids represent a promising <italic>in vitro</italic> system to study congenital diseases that are linked to the human segmentation clock and somite formation, such as congenital scoliosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCRM1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RUCDR Infinite Biologics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1E71">CVCL_1E71</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">hiPSC line</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACTB-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Allen Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AICS-0016-184;

Somite sizes of human embryos were measured using the Ruler Tool on the Virtual Human Embryo website along the mediolateral and dorsoventral axis of the embryo. The slice with the largest diameter of each somite was used for measurements. Sizes of somite-like structures of day 5 organoids were measured along the X and Y axes of the image since, unlike in the embryo, they do not exhibit morphological anisotropies. Somite areas were approximated by using the two diameter measurements from each somite-like structure to calculate the area of the resulting rectangle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and qPCR</title><p>Organoids were harvested in Trizol (Life Technologies, Cat# 15596-018), followed by precipitation with chloroform and ethanol and transfer onto PureLink RNA Micro Kit columns (Thermo Fisher, Cat# 12183016) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, including on-column DNase treatment. A volume of 22 µl RNase-free water was used for elution, and RNA concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer. Typically, between 0.2 and 1 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III First Strand Synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Cat# 18080-051) and oligo-dT primers to generate cDNA libraries.</p><p>For real-time quantitative PCR, cDNA was diluted 1:30-1:50 in water and qPCR was performed using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green kit (Bio-Rad, Cat# 1725124). Each gene-specific primer and sample mix was run in triple replicates. Each 10 µl reaction contained 5 µl 2X SYBR Green Master Mix, 0.4 µl of 10 µM primer stock (1:1 mix of forward and reverse primers), and 4.6 µl of diluted cDNA. qPCR plates were run on a Roche LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system with the following cycling parameters: initial denaturation step (95°C for 1 min), 40 cycles of amplification and SYBR green signal detection (denaturation at 95°C for 5 s, annealing/extension and plate read at 60°C for 40 s), followed by final rounds of gradient annealing from 65 to 95°C to generate dissociation curves. Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Table S2. All unpublished primers were validated by checking for specificity (single peak in melting curve) and linearity of amplification (serially diluted cDNA samples). For relative gene expression analysis, the ΔΔCt method was implemented using the R package ‘pcr’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcr/">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcr/</ext-link>). PP1A was used as the housekeeping gene in all cases.

For day 1 organoid cell suspension, 30 organoids were pooled. For day 2 organoid cell suspension, 15 organoids were pooled. For day 3 cell suspension, eight organoids were pooled. For day 5 cell suspension, five organoids were pooled. Organoids were briefly rinsed in PBS, then transferred to 500 µl PBS/0.05% BSA and carefully triturated to generate a single-cell suspension. Cell suspension was run through a cell strainer (Falcon, Cat# 352235) and transferred to a 1.5 ml tube. Cells were spun down at 250 × <italic>g</italic> for 3 min at 4°C. Cell pellet was resuspended in 25 µl PBS/0.05% BSA, cell concentration and viability were measured using an automated cell counter, and cell suspension was further diluted as appropriate to reach the optimal range for 10× (700–1200 cells per µl). Cells were subjected to scRNA-seq (10X Genomics, Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3) aiming for the following target cell numbers: day 1, 3000 cells; day 2, 4000 cells; day 3, 5000 cells; day 5, 6000 cells. Estimated actual cell numbers collected were day 1, 2930 cells; day 2, 4977 cells; day 3, 5968 cells; day 5, 4841 cells. Single-cell libraries were generated using standard protocols. Libraries were sequenced together on a NovaSeq 6000 system resulting in 800 million reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of scRNA-seq data</title><p>Statistics and plots were generated using R version 4.0.2 ‘Taking Off Again’ and Seurat version 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>QC analysis/processing of scRNA-seq data</title><p>Cell Ranger pipeline (10X Genomics, version 4.0.0) was used to demultiplex the raw base call files, generate FASTQ files, perform the alignment against the human reference genome (GRCh38 1.2.0), and generate the count matrices.</p><p>For the initial QC, we determined the following thresholds for filtering out low-quality cells: UMI counts less than 500, gene counts less than 200, mitochondrial fraction above 0.2, and a complexity score of less than 0.8 (calculated as log10 (genes)/log10 (UMIs)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Low-dimensional embedding and clustering</title><p>After QC filtering, we normalized our dataset using the sctransform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) framework, which is part of the Seurat package. To regress out confounding variation in our dataset, we performed cell cycle scoring and determined mitochondrial mapping percentage using standard workflows. Next, we performed principal component analysis and determined the K-nearest neighbor graph using the first 40 principal components. We then applied the Leiden clustering algorithm using a parameter range from 0.1 to 1.0 to determine the best resolution/number of clusters, which reflected biological differences (FindClusters, resolution = 0.1–1.0). Clusters were visualized on a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) embedding (RunUMAP, dims = 1:40). To determine optimal resolution for clustering and assign cell types for each cluster, we visualized sets of known marker genes for each predicted cell type on UMAP plots. Prior to marker gene identification and final assignments of cluster identities, we also checked additional quality control metrics (UMI count, gene count, mitochondrial gene ratio) to exclude low-quality clusters from downstream analyses. Through iterative analysis, we determined Leiden clustering with resolution = 0.8, resulting in 22 clusters, to best capture biological variation of the dataset. Using a combination of quality control metrics and unbiased marker gene identification for each cluster (see below), we excluded seven smaller low-quality clusters (as determined by QC metrics and/or expression of stress signature genes) from further downstream analysis (15 clusters after filtering).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Identification of differentially expressed genes</title><p>Marker genes for every cluster were identified by a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing cells from each cluster to all other cells in the combined dataset. Genes were considered differentially expressed if the log2 fold-change average expression in the cluster is equal to or greater than 0.25 relative to the average expression in all other clusters combined, and the adjusted p-value&lt;0.05. Multiple comparison correction was performed using the Bonferroni method. Identified marker genes for the top 20 differentially expressed transcripts are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted the letter below. As you will see, the reviewers raise some significant concerns, particularly regarding the morphological resemblance of somitoids to somites in vivo. If you feel you can address these concerns, we would be open to receiving a significantly revised version for full in depth review. Equally, we realize that you may prefer to go to a different journal at this juncture rather than make extensive revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the great utilities of organoids is their self-organising ability which enables them to adopt morphological and molecular features that closely resemble their in vivo counterparts.

Just extending the CL+ FGF by 24hrs (day3 to day4) and then changing media to basal condition (no growth factors) for 24hrs is sufficient for differentiation.

We agree that it is important to clearly show the morphological features of our <italic>in vitro</italic> generated somites because it is one the main advances of our 3D Somitoid system over previously published 2D models. In the revised manuscript, we have included high-magnification images of somite-like structures, which clearly show the shape of the somitic cells and the polarity of these epithelial cells by staining for multiple polarity markers (new Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1; new Figure 3-Video 1). Consistent with the morphology and polarity of <italic>in vivo</italic> somites, we observe PAX3+/TCF15+ bottle-shaped cells radially arranged around a central cavity, which form rosette-like structures that are approximately the same size as the Carnegie stage 11 <italic>in vivo</italic> somites (Figure 5B). This can be observed in multiple new images added to our revised manuscript (Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1A-A’’, Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1B-B’’, Figure 2-Supplemental Figure 3A,B). Additionally, apical surface markers F-ACTIN (Figure 5A) and N-CADHERIN (Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1) are both expressed around the central cavity, suggesting that the apical side of the somitic cells is facing the inside of the somite structure, again consistent with their in vivo counterparts. This is particularly evident in the newly added high-magnification images (Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1) and accompanying video showing a full confocal z-stack through the <italic>in vitro</italic> somites (Figure 3- Video 1). Together with our protein (Figure 3B,C and Figure 5A) and gene expression data (both in bulk (Figure 1C, Figure 5C, Figure 1-Supplemental Figure 1B) and at the single-cell level (Figure 4, Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 1-5)), and directed differentiation experiments of Somitoid-derived cells towards sclerotome (Figure 5C) and dermomyotome (newly added Figure 5-Supplemental Figure 1), we conclude that our <italic>in vitro</italic> somites are molecularly, morphologically, and functionally equivalent to <italic>in vivo</italic> somites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The full reviews are included to help with a possible revision.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Three human iPSC lines are mentioned in the methods and replicates are mentioned throughout the text. The authors should make clear for each data set/figure presented which iPSC line(s) was used. Moreover, they should comment any between-line variability in the differentiation protocol. I can only find inter-organoid (so within-experiment) variability in the supplemental data. The extent of technical (between experiment) and biological variation is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a very important point. To clarify which cell lines were used for each figure, we have added the information to each figure caption in the revised manuscript. We have also specified the number of organoids used to quantify variation for each experiment in the figure captions. As described below, we have conducted new experiments to further quantify the technical variability across experiments, as well as quantify the efficacy of our optimized differentiation protocol when applied to genetically independent cell lines.</p><p>For our initial screens (Figures 2 and 3), we only used one cell line (NCRM1 hiPSCs). As mentioned by the reviewer, we measured variability across individual organoids for each condition of the screen to help identify the conditions that minimized variability and produced the most reproducible organoids (Figure 2-Supplemental Figure 2B; Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1B).</p><p>To analyze technical variability of our optimized protocol, we have repeated our optimized protocol two more times and quantified the number of somites across 10 organoids for each experiment (see newly added Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 3). Inter-organoid variability was comparable to our initial results from the secondary screen (CV for Experiment 1 = 17% and CV for Experiment 2 = 9.8%; see also Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 2B). Furthermore, mean and median are very comparable between the two additional experiments (Experiment 1: 39+/-8 (mean+/-std), median=40; Experiment 2: 43+/-4 (mean+/-std), median=41, p-val = 0.16). Please note that the absolute number of somites in our new experiments has increased compared to our initial screen (see Figure 3). This is a result of improvements in both our immunostaining protocol as well as the image acquisition workflow. The two new experiments both used the same improved staining and image acquisition workflow and are therefore comparable with each other.</p><p>To extend our variability analysis to other cell lines, we tested the following cell lines: our original cell line (NCRM1), the WTC cell line released by the Conklin Laboratory at the Gladstone Institute, and a reporter cell line, ACTB-GFP, from the Allen Cell Collection. We tested our optimized protocol alongside another high scoring condition in all three cell lines:</p><p>– CL+FGF2 for 24h, basal media for 24h (our optimized protocol)</p><p>– WNTi<sup>hi</sup>(C59, 2 µM) for 48h</p><p>Applying our optimized protocol to two other cell lines confirmed that our protocol is reproducible across different genetic backgrounds/cell lines. NCRM1, average somite number = 43+/-4 (mean+/-std); ACTB-GFP, average somite number = 40+/-6; WTC, average somite number = 33+/-4. We also tested one additional top scoring condition (C59, 2µM for 48 hours) in all three cell lines. Notably, for this condition, the ACTB-GFP derived Somitoids (32+/-4 (mean+/-std)) showed a higher average number of somites compared with the Somitoids derived from the other cell lines (NCRM1, 20+/-3; WTC, 17+/-4). However, our optimized protocol resulted in the highest number of somites across all cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not indicated clearly anywhere exactly what the authors are scoring as a somite. The clearest depiction is Figure 5A where rosettes of TCF15 with apical F actin can be observed. Is each of these scored as a somite? A higher magnification should be provided in Figure 3 showing clearly how somites are scored.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for an insightful comment and question. Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we generated new organoids with somite structures and imaged them at a higher magnification (shown in the newly added Figure 3-Supplement Figure 1). The higher magnification clearly shows the ‘bottle-shaped’ morphology of the cells that comprise the somites in that the apical surface of these columnar cells is typically smaller than their basal side. These higher-magnification images also more clearly show the rosette structure (radial arrangement of columnar cells) with a central cavity in which NCAD is highly expressed. Nuclear expression of PAX3 is also clearly visible in these cells. These empirical observations were the criteria used to manually identify somites in the images acquired from the organoid screen. We have clearly described these scoring criteria in a new paragraph added to the Methods section (section titled “Quantification of per organoid somite numbers for secondary screen”).</p><p>To further illustrate the scoring criteria for identifying somites, we have also included a new figure panel, Figure 3B. In this figure, we show examples of somite quantification using our scoring criteria. Two z-sections are used as examples and the manually scored somites are highlighted using dashed circles.</p><p>Additionally, we generated videos of z-stacks acquired on a confocal microscope showing examples of organoids with and without somite-like structures based on our scoring criteria using PAX3 and NCAD staining (Newly added Figure 3-Video 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The combinatorial FGFRi/Wnti treatments using various small molecules mentioned in Figure 2C, D, 3B, C, D does not impact the overall understanding of the differentiation protocol. Moreover, data suggests that inhibition of FGF and Wnt signalling using small molecules is not required to derive PAX3+ somites. Just extending the CL+ FGF by 24hrs (day3 to day4) and then changing media to basal condition (no growth factors) for 24hrs is sufficient for differentiation. This condition also results in significantly higher PAX3+ cells and somite number (Figure 3C, D). Why was this condition not utilised further? Why is the use of FGFRi/Wnti essential?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviewer if this important point was not clear in the main text. We indeed end up using CL+FGF2 from Day 3 to Day 4 followed by culture in basal media as our preferred differentiation protocol for all subsequent experiments (shown in Figure 4-5), including our single-cell RNA-seq experiment. This optimized protocol is a direct conclusion from our systematic screens and was not obvious prior to performing these screens. We have revised the manuscript so that this point is clear to the reader (see line numbers 176-183 on page 6).</p><p>Our screens focused on modulating the timing and duration of WNT and FGF signaling pathways (in addition to BMP and TGF-β) based on long-established <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence (Aulehla et al., 2008, 2003; Delfini et al., 2005; Dubrulle et al., 2001; Dunty et al., 2008; Greco et al., 1996; Yamaguchi et al., 1999)(Loh et al., 2016; Xi et al., 2017)(Aulehla et al., 2008, 2003; Delfini et al., 2005; Dubrulle et al., 2001; Dunty et al., 2008; Greco et al., 1996; Yamaguchi et al., 1999) and recently published <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation protocols (Chal et al., 2015; Loh et al., 2016; Matsuda et al., 2020; Sakurai et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2013). To make the rationale for designing the screens more clear, we describe it in the revised manuscript and include citations for <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence and <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation protocols using hPSCs (see line numbers 97-105 on page 4).</p><p>Importantly, one main conclusion from the screen and our in-depth single-cell RNA-seq analysis is that while it is not necessary to actively inhibit WNT and/or FGF signaling to induce somite fate <italic>in vitro</italic>, day 5 somite-like cells from our optimized protocol autonomously downregulate WNT target genes (DKK1, AXIN2, WNT3A, RSPO3; Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 2) and FGF target genes (FGF8, FGF17, SPRY4, DUSP6/MKP3, SEF/IL17RD) in addition to NOTCH target genes (DLL1, DLL3, HES7). To illustrate this, we have generated a heatmap of single-cell gene expression of canonical target genes for these signaling pathways (see newly added Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 5) over the course of the differentiation protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) d5 Somites are TCF15+ (Figure 4E, 5A) how different are these cells from the Somatic mesoderm population published in Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020; Matsuda et al., 2020?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid and important point. To address the reviewer’s question, we compared the single-cell RNA-seq data from Diaz-Cuadros et al., with our own single-cell RNA-seq data. The 2D differentiated cells in Diaz-Cuadros et al., at the final time point of their experiment do not show a clear somitic cell state signature. PAX3, MEOX1, MEOX2, FOXC2, UNCX, and TBX18 are not expressed (compared for example to FOXC1). FOXC1 does not appear to be a somite-specific marker as it is expressed in early and late PSM-like cells as seen in our own data, starting on day 2 (Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 3). In the Diaz-Cuadros et al., dataset, TCF15 is not expressed uniformly in all cells nor specifically in the late-stage cells (see UMAP plots and single-cell heatmap in the newly generated figure). Conversely, TCF15 is specifically expressed in day 5 somitic cells in our dataset both in a uniform manner and at high levels (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and Figure 4C).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68925-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also analyzed the bulk RNA-seq data in Matsuda et al., 2020 as shown in Figure 1B of their paper. They show the expression of 4 somite markers (TCF15, MEOX1, PAX3, and RIPPLY1). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> (and Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 3), all markers highlighted in their paper are specifically expressed in our day 5 somitic cell population, including RIPPLY1 (see also updated Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 3). Beyond comparison of marker gene expression, it is difficult to assess the similarities and differences with the Matsuda dataset since their data lacks single-cell resolution. Thus, heterogeneity and efficiency of somitic fate induction within their cell population is unclear.</p><p>Finally, neither of these two papers report the formation of somite-like structures. To make this comparison more clear, we have added it to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (see line numbers 291-304 on page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure1A and 2A: What is the rationale behind choosing D3 for modulating the FGFi/Wnti treatments. D4 aPSM (Figure 1A) are further committed towards somitogenesis and wouldn't modulating small molecule treatment provide a better output?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point by the reviewer which we considered when designing the screen. Based on the 2D data from Diaz-Cuadros et al., D3 and D4 cells have similar gene expression profiles. Their own analysis of clustering the single-cell gene expression profile of these two populations of cells does not distinguish D3 cells from D4 cells. This is not surprising because D3 and D4 cells are kept in the same media containing FGF and WNT agonists. <italic>In vivo</italic>, down-regulation of FGF and WNT signaling is correlated with differentiation to somite fate. In addition, in their data both D3 and D4 cells show HES7 oscillations, indicating that D4 cells are not significantly more differentiated than D3 cells. Finally, the comparison in Diaz-Cuadros et al., of the gene expression profiles of D3 and D4 cells to E9.5 mouse <italic>in vivo</italic> data shows that both populations closely resemble the posterior PSM and that D4 cells are no closer to an anterior PSM fate than D3 cells. Taken together, we chose to start our differentiation protocol with D3 cells, which also reduces the duration of the protocol by one day. Our earlier version of Figure 1 was therefore misleading and we have changed the labels on Figure 1A to ‘PSM’ to not falsely suggest that cells progress to a more anterior PSM fate under these conditions.</p><p>We have also considered whether D2 organoids could already be efficiently differentiated towards somite fate. Although D2 organoids expressed PSM markers, such as TBX6 and MSGN1 (Figure 1B), the expression was not as uniform as that observed in D3 organoids. This observation is consistent with our single-cell RNA-seq data. Although both D2 and D3 organoids express PSM makers, D2 organoids also still express primitive streak markers at higher levels such as T/BRA, MIXL1, POU5F1. Additionally, WNT target genes such as WNT3A and DKK1, which are markers of posterior PSM cells, are more highly expressed in D2 organoids compared with D3 organoids (Figure 4C, Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 2). In conclusion, based on both previously published data and our own single-cell RNA-seq and qPCR data, we concluded that day 3 of our differentiation protocol constitutes the best time window to optimize somite differentiation in our organoid system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2C and D: 500 cells was chosen for all downstream experiments based on f-actin arrangement (line111). Authors need to significantly elaborate on this rationale. Does this relate to the definition of an in vitro somite? The data seem to suggest that using 500 cells (in 24hour condition) generates smaller organoids with no significant difference in PAX3 expression intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising an important point. One of the main goals of our primary screen was to investigate whether initial cell number has any effect on the ability of organoids to robustly form somites without the generation of undesired (i.e. non-PSM derived) cell types. We concluded that organoids made from 500 cells were preferable over organoids made from 1000 cells based on the following observations:</p><p>1. We used F-ACTIN expression as a marker of somite-structure in the primary screen comparing organoids made from 500 cells with organoids made from 1000 cells. Qualitative assessment of F-ACTIN staining showed more consistent somite structures (radial arrangements of PAX3+ columnar cells with high expression of F-ACTIN in the central cavity) in organoids made from 500 cells. To make this more clear to the reader, we have included representative images showing differences of F-ACTIN expression across organoids made from 500 cells and 1000 cells in the newly added Figure 2-Supplemental Figure 3.</p><p>2. Although average PAX3 intensity is similar between organoids made from 500 cells and organoids made from 1000 cells, a higher fraction of PAX3-negative cells were observed in the organoids made from 1000 cells. We only made this assessment using qualitative observation by eye because single-cell segmentation of our images was not possible. To do so, additional nuclear or membrane markers would be required. Figure 2-Supplemental Figure 2A shows examples of organoids generated from 1000 cells which show patches of PAX3-negative cells. By contrast, organoids generated from 500 cells and treated with the same small-molecule inhibitors show more uniform PAX3 induction across the organoids.</p><p>3. Finally, we observed <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup>/PAX3- cells in organoids made from 1000 cells but did not observe these contaminating cells in organoids made from 500 cells. Figure 2-Supplemental Figure 2A shows examples of organoids from 1000 cells with patches of PAX3-negative cells. These cells are positive for <italic>SOX2</italic>, suggesting neural contaminants in organoids generated from 1000 cells. Organoids generated from 500 cells using the same treatment conditions, do not show <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> patches of cells.</p><p>Taken together, we concluded that organoids made from 500 cells were a better choice than organoids made from 1000 cells. To make this clear in the revised manuscript, we carefully outline our reasoning on page 4-5 (line numbers 118-129).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4: Which differentiation condition was eventually used for sc-RNA seq analysis (Figure 4).

To further expand our <italic>in vivo</italic> comparison, we quantified somite size in the later stages of the Carnegie collection up to stage 11. We were not able to quantify somite size beyond stage 11 because later stages already showed further differentiation of somites into sclerotome and dermomyotome and therefore did not have a well-defined rosette structure to quantify. Comparing our <italic>in vitro</italic> generated somites to stage 11 human somites, we observed that they are very similar in size (see updated Figure 5B). It is therefore conceivable that our somites correspond to later stages of the Carnegie collection, at least based on their relative sizes.

This can be observed in multiple images shown in our manuscript (Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1A-A’’, Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1B-B’’, Figure 2-Supplemental Figure 3A,B). Importantly, both F-ACTIN (Figure 5A) and N-CADHERIN (Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1) are indeed expressed around the central cavity, suggesting that the apical side of the PAX3+/TCF15+ somitic cells is facing the inside of the somite structures. This is especially evident in the newly added high-magnification images (Figure 3-Supplemental Figure 1) and accompanying video showing a full confocal z-stack through the <italic>in vitro</italic> somites (Figure 3-Video 1). Taken together with our protein (Figure 3B,C and Figure 5A) and gene expression data (both in bulk (Figure 1C, Figure 5C, Figure 1-Supplemental Figure 1B)) and at the single-cell level (Figure 4, Figure 4-Supplemental Figure 1-5) and our directed differentiation experiments of our Somitoid cells to dermomyotome (Figure 5-Supplemental Figure 1) and sclerotome fates (Figure 5C), we believe that the somite structures generated by our optimized <italic>in vitro</italic> protocol are indeed equivalent to their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts.</p><p>References</p><p>Aulehla A, Wehrle C, Brand-Saberi B, Kemler R, Gossler A, Kanzler B, Herrmann BG. 2003.
