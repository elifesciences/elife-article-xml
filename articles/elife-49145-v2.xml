However, it remains unclear how active dendritic integration relates to somatic output in vivo. We imaged semi-simultaneously GCaMP6s signals in the soma, trunk and distal tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the awake mouse primary visual cortex. We found that apical tuft signals were dominated by widespread, highly correlated calcium transients throughout the tuft. While these signals were highly coupled to trunk and somatic transients, the frequency of calcium transients was found to decrease in a distance-dependent manner from soma to tuft. Ex vivo recordings suggest that low-frequency back-propagating action potentials underlie the distance-dependent loss of signals, while coupled somato-dendritic signals can be triggered by high-frequency somatic bursts or strong apical tuft depolarization. Visual stimulation and locomotion increased neuronal activity without affecting somato-dendritic coupling. High, asymmetric somato-dendritic coupling is therefore a widespread feature of layer 5 neurons activity in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dendrites</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>awake behaving mice</kwd><kwd>apical tuft</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>layer 5 neurons</kwd><kwd>somato-dendritic coupling</kwd><kwd>backpropagating action potentials</kwd><kwd>pyramidal neuron</kwd><kwd>primary visual cortex</kwd><kwd>GCaMP6</kwd><kwd>calcium spike</kwd><kwd>dendritic spike</kwd><kwd>layer 5</kwd><kwd>GCaMP6s</kwd><kwd>GCaMP6f</kwd><kwd>calcium indicator</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>behavioral state</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102857/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rochefort</surname><given-names>Nathalie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102857/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rochefort</surname><given-names>Nathalie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000848</institution-id><institution>University Of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Francioni</surname><given-names>Valerio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rochefort</surname><given-names>Nathalie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011102</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIG 631770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rochefort</surname><given-names>Nathalie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RS MacDonald Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seedcorn Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rochefort</surname><given-names>Nathalie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Royal Commission for the Exhibition 1851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padamsey</surname><given-names>Zahid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Layer 5 neuron apical tuft in mouse visual cortex display widespread, highly correlated calcium signals, with a strong and asymmetric coupling to somatic signals, independent of visual stimulation and locomotion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Active dendritic conductances impact the integration of synaptic inputs and the resulting somatic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grienberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). Different types of active dendritic currents have been described to support local dendritic nonlinear events, primarily driven by NMDA- and voltage-gated conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schiller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larkum et al., 1999b</xref>). In cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons, nonlinear dendritic spikes have been reported in the long apical dendrite and tuft, both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grienberger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). These dendritic events are generally associated with calcium influx both locally and globally in the apical tuft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the coincident occurrence of back-propagating action potentials and tuft depolarization was shown to generate widespread calcium transients in the apical tuft dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spruston et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magee, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Svoboda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helmchen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larkum et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manita et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The frequency and dynamics of local dendritic nonlinearities in vivo have been a matter of debate. Events described as local dendritically-generated spikes were reported in layer 2/3 neurons of the visual and somatosensory cortex during sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>). In the visual cortex, it has been suggested that dendritic spikes triggered by visual input enhance somatic tuning to the preferred orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). However, single dendrite recordings prevented conclusions about the spatial extent and the branch-specific nature of the detected events. Using calcium imaging in the mouse motor cortex, one study suggested that individual branches of densely labelled layer 5 neurons selectively display local calcium transients correlated with specific motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cichon and Gan, 2015</xref>). However, other studies reported prevalent global calcium signals throughout layer 5 apical tuft dendrites in the barrel and motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill et al., 2013</xref>). While layer 5 apical dendritic calcium transients were shown to correlate with behaviourally relevant features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>), the coupling between apical tuft activity and somatic output remains poorly understood.</p><p>By using semi-simultaneous imaging of apical trunk and somatic GCaMP6f signals in layer 5 neurons, a recent study has shown that apical trunk dendritic calcium signals were highly correlated with somatic signals in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake behaving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>). Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in V1 display selective responses to physical features of visual stimuli, such as the orientation and direction of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) and their activity is modulated by locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erisken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dadarlat and Stryker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pakan et al., 2018a</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al. (2019)</xref> found that neither visual stimulation nor locomotion altered the high somato-dendritic coupling of calcium transients.</p><p>Here, we used a similar approach to image GCaMP6s calcium signals in the soma, trunk and distal tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, both in darkness and during the presentation of drifting gratings, while head-fixed mice were either running or stationary. In agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al. (2019)</xref>, we found that the apical trunk dendritic calcium signals were highly correlated with somatic signals. We extended these results by showing that the whole apical tuft was highly correlated to trunk activity; the vast majority of dendritic calcium transients in the apical tuft were coincident with global events, with rare cases of branch-specific activity, limited to the smallest amplitude events. In addition, by imaging somatic and dendritic GCaMP6s signals, we found that somato-dendritic coupling was asymmetric; while almost all events observed in the tuft were also visible in the soma, around 40% of somatic events attenuated in an amplitude and distance-dependent manner from the soma to the apical tuft. Ex vivo recordings of GCaMP6s signals suggested that coupled somato-dendritic events likely reflected either strong apical tuft inputs or high frequency somatic activity, whereas attenuated events were likely caused by low frequency back-propagating action potentials. We compared GCaMP6s with GCaMP6f signals and showed that due to a reduced sensitivity, attenuation of events from soma to dendrite were underestimated with GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, our results show that neither visual stimulation nor locomotion affected the in vivo coupling of somatic and apical tuft calcium signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Highly correlated, widespread calcium signals in apical tuft dendrites of single layer 5 neurons</title><p>We imaged changes in fluorescence over time in apical dendrites of individual layer 5 pyramidal neurons sparsely labelled with either the calcium sensor GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) in the primary visual cortex of adult mice. Using single-plane two-photon imaging (at 120 Hz), we first monitored changes of GCaMP6f signals in individual apical tuft dendrites of head-fixed, awake behaving mice that were free to run on a cylindrical treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our results showed highly correlated calcium signals in all apical dendritic branches belonging to the same neuron and imaged in a given field of view (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.92, SEM = 0.01, n = 25 fields of view recorded from 14 neurons, 6 animals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and D</xref>). Given that electrical signals are known to attenuate in a distant dependent manner, we tested whether the correlation of calcium transients between apical tuft branches decreased with distance from the apical trunk (nexus). We reconstructed each individual neuron for which we imaged the apical tuft and quantified the correlation of fluorescence signals across sibling branches. We found that calcium signals in sibling branches were highly correlated (average Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.92) regardless of their branching order (One-way ANOVA, p=0.34) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

However, the correlation of calcium signals between all imaged dendritic branches remained high (r ≥ 0.92) during periods of darkness and visual stimulation as well as during stationary and locomotion periods, without a significant difference across conditions (Two-way ANOVA, p=0.43, 0.62 and 0.97 for visual stimulation, locomotion and interaction between both conditions, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>In line with these findings, we found that branch-specific activity in the apical tuft was rare. We quantified the amount of branch-specific activity in all pairs of branches belonging to the same neuron as the proportion of calcium transients present in one branch and absent in the other. Among the 70 imaged branches across 14 neurons, branch-specific calcium transients represented less than 3% of the total number of transients. Among all imaged calcium transients, these local signals were dominated by calcium transients of the smallest amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In addition, neither visual stimulation nor locomotion significantly affected this small proportion of branch-specific calcium signals (Three-way ANOVA, p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup> for event amplitude and p=0.29; 0.8 and 0.94, for visual stimulation, locomotion and interaction between both conditions, respectively; no other interaction effect was statistically significant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). We tested the robustness of our quantification by using different thresholds for the detection of individual calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We found that lowering the threshold by 30% in one of the two pair branches reduced the proportion of branch-specific events from 3.8% to 0.8%, suggesting that most of these already rare events were near detection threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

For this, we semi-simultaneously imaged GCaMP6s calcium signals at two focal planes, separated by 170 μm in depth, in four different pairs of neuronal compartments from the soma to the apical tuft: Soma-Trunk, proximal Trunk-distal Trunk, distal Trunk-apical Tuft, proximal Tuft-distal Tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We used GCaMP6s which has higher signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio than GCaMP6f, in order to maximise our ability to detect somatic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We found that calcium transients simultaneously imaged in each pair of proximal and distal compartments were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-D</xref>). Since the rise and decay kinetics of calcium events were slower in the soma than in the dendrites, we performed our quantification on individual peaks of calcium transients (see Materials and methods). For each pair of compartments, we found that the average Pearson’s correlation value between the peak amplitude of individual transients was 0.88 between the proximal and distal parts of the apical tuft, 0.92 between the trunk and the apical tuft and 0.85 between the proximal and distal trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We projected the decay measured within 170 μm, to the distance between each soma and distal apical tuft, estimated by the depth of the soma from the dura (panel A). We multiplied the amplitude-dependent decay function by the corresponding scaling factor and we applied this scaled function to the frequency distribution of calcium transient amplitudes (lower panel) at each bin (0.05 ΔF/F0). The frequency distribution was derived by averaging all the calcium events in all proximal compartments (see distribution of event amplitudes for each proximal compartment in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The vast majority of compartment-specific events were dominated by calcium transients in proximal compartments that were not detected in distal ones (red trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while only few calcium transients were found in distal compartments and not in the corresponding proximal compartment (blue trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

With GCaMP6f, somatic signals could not be observed at lower stimulation frequencies (5 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, F, H</xref>).</p><p>Our findings suggest that: 1) somatically-triggered back-propagating action potentials below the critical frequency (&lt;50–100 Hz) may underlie the distant-dependent loss of dendritic calcium signals we observed in vivo; 2) spiking driven by strong apical tuft input or high-frequency spiking driven by somatic depolarization may underlie the strong somato-dendritic coupling detected in vivo.</p><p>Notably, compared to GCaMP6s, GCaMP6f had a reduced sensitivity for detecting calcium signals, specifically in the soma during low frequency spiking driven either by somatic or dendritic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). Consequently, as compared to GCaMP6s, attenuation of events from soma to dendrite was underestimated whereas attenuation of events from dendrite to soma was overestimated with GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> vs 5H). With GCaMP6s, by contrast, attenuation of signals was asymmetric; we only found attenuation from soma to distal dendrites, as observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>We further examined GCaMP6s signals across a number of dendritic stimulation intensities (25–100% of somatic spike threshold) and frequencies (5–200 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) allowing for analysis of ex vivo somato-dendritic coupling across a range of stimulus-evoked depolarizations. We could not detect any global calcium signals in the apical tuft when L1 stimulation failed to evoke a somatic action potential, indicating a strong coupling between global calcium events and somatic spiking in our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, no calcium signal was detected in either compartment (soma and apical tuft) in trials with no action potential. When L1 stimulation only evoked a single action potential, apical tuft calcium signals were observed in 60% of the trials; however, these events were below the detection threshold of GCaMP6s in the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Consequently, under these conditions, somato-dendritic coupling was low. Provided L1 stimulation evoked at least two action potentials, calcium signals in both apical tuft and soma were robustly detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Across stimulation parameters, both somatic and dendritic calcium transients increased with the number of action potentials evoked by L1 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Collectively, our findings reveal that evoked apical tuft calcium events are strongly coupled to somatic spiking, and that this coupling can be detected by GCaMP6s imaging provided that somatic output is above the limits of detection (≥2 action potentials ex vivo).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Visual stimulation and locomotion do not alter the coupling of calcium signals between neuronal compartments from soma to apical tuft</title><p>We then tested whether visual stimulation and locomotion altered the coupling between the different compartments of individual layer 5 neurons.

However, their frequency was found to decrease in a distance-dependent manner from soma to apical tuft. Whereas almost all transients observed in the tuft were present in proximal compartments, the frequency of calcium transients in apical tuft was about 60% of their frequency in the corresponding soma. Ex vivo experiments suggest that attenuated dendritic signals were likely associated with low frequency back-propagating action potentials, whereas highly correlated somato-dendritic signals were likely associated with high frequency somatic activity, or strong apical tuft inputs.

The analysis of our data set showed that several experimental constraints may bias results towards signals mistakenly interpreted as local dendritic activity. Dense labelling was already demonstrated to strongly affect correlation values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2012</xref>); even in cases of relatively sparse labelling of individual neurons, contamination from axons or dendrites of other labelled neurons may lead to local signals detected in single dendrites. In our data set, we had a sparse labelling and we systematically reconstructed our imaged neurons and excluded regions of interest where overlapping dendrites from other neurons were observed. Movement artefacts may also lead to inaccurate detection of local dendrite signals; these artefacts are more likely to be found during specific behaviour, such as locomotion, and therefore can bias the interpretation of the results. In our data set we used the activity-independent marker tdTomato to correct for motion artefacts and excluded the recordings in which tdTomato marker was not detected. For most of our imaged neurons, baseline fluorescence of both GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f could also be used for the same purpose. Another parameter that may cause artefactual local dendritic signals, is the length of the imaged dendritic segments (and therefore the size of the regions of interest used to extract the changes of fluorescence over time). Small regions of interest could include spines not clearly distinguishable from the corresponding dendritic shaft, especially when the spine is located above the dendrite at the imaged focal plane. As a consequence, in small regions of interests, spine signals may be incorrectly interpreted as local dendritic signals.</p><p>Differences in calcium buffering properties of individual compartments also create detection biases as they lead to different decay times of fluorescent calcium indicators between somatic and dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>). In order to account for this difference, we based our analysis on the detection of peak amplitudes of individual calcium transients. This detection depends on arbitrary thresholds; we thus showed the robustness of our results across different detection thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). An additional source of bias is linked to the affinities of calcium indicators. Previous studies have shown that dendritic calcium spikes can reliably be detected by calcium indicators with lower sensitivity than GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Helmchen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). However, while it was shown that GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f could detect individual somatic action potentials in layer 2/3 neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), this is not the case in layer 5 neurons neither for GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>), nor for GCaMP6s based on our own ex vivo experiments. We did however find that GCaMP6s was superior in detecting somatic calcium events during low frequency spiking (&lt;25 Hz) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Nonetheless, the detection of somatic action potentials in layer 5 neurons in vivo with GCaMP sensors may be biased towards larger events, and as a consequence, the attenuation from soma to tuft may be underestimated.</p><p>The relatively low temporal resolution of genetically-encoded calcium signals presents another key limitation to the study of dendritic calcium signals in vivo. In our study, we found branch-specific events to be rare. Whereas ex vivo studies have demonstrated that branch-specific stimulation can trigger localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> events detected by calcium indicators (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sandler et al., 2016</xref>; review: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Major et al., 2013</xref>), the detection of these events in vivo is more challenging, principally because they may be masked by ongoing global dendritic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>). Given the relatively low temporal resolution of GCaMP6s, dissociating global dendritic calcium signals from potential underlying branch-specific events is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>).

In our study, we found a stronger asymmetry with 98.6% of dendritic events paired with somatic ones and 60 % of somatic events paired with dendritic ones. This discrepancy may be explained by differences in imaging conditions including a denser labelling, which increases the amount of background signals, and the use of GCaMP6f, which has a lower signal amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio than the GCaMP6s indicator used in our study, leading to a lower probability of detecting small events in layer 5 somata, as shown by our ex vivo recordings (Figure 5G-H).</p><p>In our study, we estimated that 60% of somatic calcium signals were highly correlated with global apical tuft calcium signals.

Further experiments are needed to resolve these potential mechanisms in vivo, for example using voltage-sensitive dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Villette et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roome and Kuhn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2019</xref>) or dendritic electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2017</xref>), that would provide the temporal resolution to resolve the different types of dendritic events.</p><p>Notably, both apical tuft signals and the somato-dendritic coupling may differ between different subtypes of layer 5 pyramidal neurons. It is known that at least two main types exist: intratelencephalic neurons which connect cortical areas, and pyramidal tract neurons which project to multiple subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerfen et al., 2018</xref>). These two types display different morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groh et al., 2010</xref>) and receive different types of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Young, 2019</xref>). The neurons included in this study had their soma located at various depths within layer 5 (median 528 μm, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and mainly displayed thick-tufted morphology, characteristic of pyramidal tract neurons. Since we selected the imaged neurons visually based on their GCaMP6 fluorescent signal, our sampled is likely biased towards layer 5 neurons with thick trunk and thick-tufted morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Integration of visual and locomotion-related inputs in layer 5 neurons in awake behaving mice</title><p>Our results show that, in our passive viewing conditions, changes in visual inputs (darkness versus drifting gratings) and locomotion-related inputs do not affect the relationship between somatic, trunk and apical tuft calcium signals nor the prevalence of branch-specific dendritic events in the apical tuft. These results are in agreement with a previous study showing that somato-dendritic correlations of calcium transients remain unchanged by visual stimulation and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019</xref>). It is however possible that in both studies, untracked behavioural states (e.g. arousal, attention) during stationary and locomotion periods may differentially shape somato-dendritic activity.</p><p>It is known that the prevalence and the dynamics of synaptic inputs received by layer 5 pyramidal neurons strongly vary between passive sensory stimulation and active learning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Apical tuft dendrites of layer 5 neurons receive a barrage of thousands of synaptic inputs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>) and it was shown that V1 neurons receive synaptic inputs conveying information not only about visual stimuli but also about non-visual variables (e.g. arousal/attention, motor activity, reward-related and spatial information) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pakan et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pakan et al., 2018b</xref>). Finally, in addition to excitatory inputs, both inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs were shown to modulate electrical interactions between soma and dendrites in layer 5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larkum et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Labarrera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams and Fletcher, 2019</xref>). It is therefore possible that during the active learning of a behavioural task, the synaptic inputs associated with this learning process would lead to different mechanisms of dendritic integration than during passive viewing. For example, dendritic integration of multiplicative combinations of sensory and motor inputs in the tuft dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons has been described during an active sensing task in mouse somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranganathan et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, it was proposed that changes in neuronal representations during learning would rely on active dendritic signals generating calcium plateau potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grienberger et al., 2017</xref>). In that case, somato-dendritic coupling may change during the course of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>). This remains to be tested in the visual cortex. Similarly, somato-dendritic coupling may evolve during postnatal development when sensori-motor associations are formed. Recently, it was shown in the mouse primary visual cortex, that dendrites of layer 2/3 neurons increase their coupling during adulthood, as a consequence of decreased responsiveness of dendrite-targeting interneurons to locomotion-related inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yaeger et al., 2019</xref>). Further investigations are needed to reveal these mechanisms in layer 5 visual cortical neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments and procedures involving animals were approved by the University of Edinburgh Animal Welfare and the ethical review board (AWERB).

For a cranial window over V1, a section of scalp was removed, the underlying bone was cleaned before a rectangular craniotomy of about 2 × 1.5 mm was made over the left primary visual cortex (centred around 2.5 mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior to lambda). The dura was kept intact. The craniotomy was then sealed with a glass cover slip and fixed with cyanoacrylate glue. To stabilize the brain during imaging, we used a triple glass window by stacking three cover-slip glasses (Menzel-Glaser 24 × 32 mm # 0) on top of each other. These were glued together using an optically clear UV-cured glue (Norland Optical adhesive). Overall, the thickness of the glass window inserted through the cranial window, was comparable to the thickness of the skull at the time of imaging. A custom-built metal headplate was fixed on top of the skull with glue and cemented with dental acrylic (Paladur, Heraeus Kulzer). At the end of the procedure, a single dose of 25 mL/kg of Ringer’s solution was injected subcutaneously to rehydrate the animal after the procedure.

As a consequence, peaks detected as coincident could not be further apart than 2 s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the distribution of time intervals between events detected as coincident. The mean time interval was close to 0 (2.19xe<sup>−4</sup> seconds) with standard deviation of 0.28 s, meaning that 95% of all coincident events were found within a time interval of 0.56 s. Each calcium transient could only be considered coincident with one transient. The peak amplitude of a calcium transient was determined by taking the difference between the ΔF/F0 amplitude at the frame in which the peak was detected and a local minimum in a 2 s, backward sliding window. Correlation values were calculated as the Pearson's correlation values between peak calcium transient amplitudes in pairs of branches or compartments. Whenever a peak was detected in only one compartment and not in the other (compartment-specific events), the correlation was made between the peak amplitude in one compartment and the difference between the maximum and minimum ΔF/F0 values in a 3 s window centred around the frame of the detected peak in the other compartment. Shuffling values were obtained by randomly shuffling the order of the events in one branch or compartment of each pair. Residuals were extracted by calculating the robust linear regression line between normalised event amplitudes in each compartment, and then extracting the distance, along the y-axis, of each individual point from this robust line.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Locomotion analysis</title><p>Changes in the position of the cylindrical treadmill (sampled at 12,000 Hz) were interpolated to match the rate of imaging. To define stationary and locomotion periods we used the following criteria: Stationary corresponded to periods where the instantaneous speed (as measured at the 40 Hz sampling rate) was less than 0.1 cm/s. Locomotion corresponded to periods meeting three criteria: instantaneous speed ≥0.1 cm/s, 0.25 Hz lowpass filtered speed ≥0.1 cm/s, and an average speed ≥0.1 cm/s over a 2 s window centered at this point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>).

Cellular electrophysiology was recorded using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and associated pCLAMP software (Molecular Devices). Data were acquired at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz. For somatic stimulation, 10 current pulses (2–5 ms, 1–1.5nA) were delivered at 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 Hz. Each pulse was of sufficient amplitude to trigger an action potential. For dendritic stimulation, a monopolar tungsten electrode was placed in L1.

Electrophysiological traces were analysed using pCLAMP software and custom MATLAB scripts. ΔF/F0 was calculated as: (F – F0)/(F0 – F<sub>background</sub>) where F0 was the mean baseline fluorescent signal during the 1 s baseline recording, and F<sub>background</sub> was the background fluorescence. F0 in the distal dendrites was often very low ex vivo, leading to inflated ΔF/F0 values. Consequently, ΔF/F0 signals in the soma and dendrite were standardized to the maximum signal evoked in each compartment. This allowed for fairer comparisons between compartments, and across cells. Calcium transient amplitudes were measured as the peak ΔF/F0 observed within 1 s after the cessation of stimulation. These values were then subtracted by the average peak ΔF/F0 measured in sham stimulation trials. The procedure was repeated for each sham stimulation trial in order to derive a null distribution of peak amplitudes for statistical comparison. Calcium events were also classified as successfully detected if they exceeded 2.8 standard deviations from the expected null, similar to what was used to analyse our in vivo data. An event was considered compartment specific if it was detected in one compartment but not in the other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>All analysis was performed either using MATLAB (Mathworks, MA), or GraphPad Prism 8.

across the soma and the dendritic tree of layer 5 pyramidal neurons by recording from the primary visual cortex of awake mice. They show that (1) calcium transients are highly correlated across different dendritic compartments and the soma, and (2) the somato-dendritic coupling is asymmetric in that ~40% of somatic events are attenuated as function of distance towards the distal tuft but not in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the two findings appear to be independent of the locomotive state of the animal or the presentation of visual stimuli. While the first main finding of the correlated somato-dendritic signals that occur irrespectively of visual stimulation and locomotion, recapitulates a recent study (Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019), the second key finding further extends the prior observations in demonstrating that a large fraction of somatic and/or proximal dendritic events are uncoupled from the global dendritic events.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Francioni and Rochefort have investigated the coupling of calcium transients across the soma and the dendritic tree of layer 5 pyramidal neurons by recording from V1 of awake mice. The two major findings are: (1) calcium transients are highly correlated across different dendritic compartments and the soma, and (2) the somato-dendritic coupling is asymmetric in that ~40% of somatic events are attenuated as function of distance towards the distal tuft but not in the opposite direction. Furthermore, the two findings appear to be independent of the locomotive state of the animal or the presentation of visual stimuli.</p><p>The first of the two main findings – of correlated somato-dendritic signals that occur irrespectively of visual stimulation and locomotion – recapitulates the very recent study by Beaulieu-Laroche et al. (Neuron 2019). The second of the two findings further extends the observations by showing that a large fraction of somatic/proximal dendritic events are uncoupled from the global dendritic events, thereby suggesting that the generation of global dendritic events require the integration of different source of input. Overall this is a carefully executed study focusing on an important problem in dendritic processing in awake behaving animal.</p><p>However, the crucial concern raised by all three reviewers relates to the idea of the apical tuft acting as a single computational unit. Such a conclusion is not compellingly supported by the results shown. If the calcium imaging only picks up large calcium spikes (cf. Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019), then it remains possible that single dendritic branches integrate synaptic input non-linearly via local electrical events below the imaging detection limit, which then lead to a large nexus spike that can be imaged. In this case, the apical tuft could still contain multiple computational units, and the authors cannot exclude this possibility with the current data. In fact, the data show that around 15% of small calcium transients are branch specific, which could correspond to local spikes that did not cause a nexus spike. Therefore, the strength of somato-dendritic coupling is likely to be over-estimated in this study. Moreover, there could also be other possibilities for not observing local branch signals. During awake behaving conditions, untracked behavioral events or cognitive processes may produce dendritic spikes, and therefore it is not clear what behaviorally-relevant event is triggering the calcium transients.</p><p>In order to address the crucial concerns raised above, it is suggested that the authors (1) tone down the interpretations of the data and draw conclusions that are directly supported by the observations under the specific experimental conditions and (2) further analyze the relation between dendritic calcium signals and behavioral events. What kind of behavioral events are responsible for the somatic signals that failed to invade distal dendrites? Also, with respect to the distal dendritic calcium signals that always correlate to the proximal/somatic compartment events, the authors should modify their view and focus on the relationship between the global dendritic signals and behavioral events. It would be valuable if the authors could analyze how the interaction between locomotion and visual stimulation influences the dendritic global signals, and this may provide new insights into dendritic computation. Additional major comments and requests are listed below.</p><p>Provided the authors are able to fully address the major concerns, the manuscript should be of sufficient interest to <italic>eLife</italic>. Assuming that the authors already have the data concerning the dendritic calcium signals and behavioral events needed for the analysis, it is expected that 2 months should be sufficient to complete the revision.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The observation that behavior or visual stimulation did not influence the coupling between distal tuft and soma may seem intriguing. But the current behavior paradigm does not fully engage the animal in a well-controlled task. There could be untracked behavioral events other than locomotion, and there could be covert cognitive processes going on even in the darkness without running. These untracked behavioral events or cognitive processes may produce global dendritic spikes. Even without locomotion and visual stimulation, there can still be hidden variables that would produce local dendritic signals that cannot be isolated. The authors should provide a more comprehensive and cautious interpretation to their observations.</p><p>2) The analysis of dendritic calcium signals is relatively crude, regarding their relationship to behavioral parameters. The two most important variables in the behavioral paradigm are the visual stimulation and locomotion. When studying dendritic integration, an obvious key question is how dendrites in the large L5 neurons integrate these two inputs. How might locomotion influence visual responses in the dendrites? Would there be a gain modulation of visual responses by locomotion, and if so, could such gain modulation be mediated by dendritic integration? The authors should at least quantify the relationship between dendritic signals and locomotion, and compare dendritic responses to the same visual stimuli between stationary and locomotive state. The authors showed orientation tuning of dendritic responses and its relationship to correlations, which is nice. But how would locomotion influence such orientation tuning and correlations? Currently there is only Figure 1H showing the mean fluorescence changes under different conditions, which is not very informative.</p><p>3) It's not clear what the biophysical interpretation of the asymmetric coupling is. Electrically, in a passive dendritic tree, proximal to distal propagation is more efficient than distal to proximal propagation. Here the data show an asymmetry of calcium transients in the reverse direction. In principle this could be due to distal calcium transients being associated with large dendritic spikes, which would always trigger somatic action potentials and thus an apparent strong &quot;coupling&quot;, while proximal transients might include action potentials that do not backpropagate fully into the apical dendrite. However, looking at the data in Figure 3, there are examples of proximal/distal transient pairs that are smaller than large proximal transients that don't show up in the apical dendrites. What is the authors interpretation? Is the asymmetry coming from inhibition?</p><p>4) The authors should provide some measure of the relationship between calcium and voltage by performing whole-cell recordings from soma and dendrites of GCamp6-expressing L5 cells in vitro, as Beaulieu-Laroche et al. have done. This is particularly important because the asymmetry in the somato-dendritic coupling reported here contradicts the findings of Beaulieu-Laroche et al. While the difference could be due to the indicator, it would be important to experimentally clarify where the difference comes from.</p><p>5) The conclusion about the correlation between distal dendrites and soma is based on indirect measurements. In Figure 2, the authors showed the correlations between compartments of neighboring focal planes. But presumably due to the technical limitation, there is no direct measurement of the correlation between the distal tuft branches and somatic signals. The author should at least provide certain estimation about to what extent the multiple correlations between neighboring compartments may tell about the direct correlation between distal branches and soma.</p><p>6) Although the authors used CaMKII to restrict the expression of Cre in excitatory neurons, this study did not distinguish different subtypes of L5 pyramidal neurons. It is known that there are at least two or more different subtypes of L5 neurons with distinct dendritic morphologies, dendritic integrative properties, and downstream projection patterns. For example, the cortico-cortical projection L5 neurons are mostly thin tufted neurons, showing less bursting activity, which may be attributable to differences in the properties of dendritic spikes. Additionally, the distal tuft of the thick tufted neurons may be more compartmentalized than the thin tufted neurons, and show large dendritic calcium spikes. How such differences in different subtypes of L5 neurons may influence the observations in the current study? At least, the authors should include a discussion on this issue.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;High and asymmetric somato-dendritic coupling of V1 layer 5 neurons independent of visual stimulation and locomotion&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by two of the original reviewers and overseen by Joshua Gold (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The revised manuscript has been significantly improved with inclusion of additional experiments and analysis and careful editing of the text. However, there is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed prior to further consideration of the manuscript. This requires an additional set of ex vivo experiments that is crucial to the main conclusions of the paper, which we think are feasible to complete within a month.</p><p>The reviewers have pointed out the shortcomings related to the new ex vivo experiments (Figure 4). Specifically, the use of suprathreshold dendritic stimulation that also evokes somatic APs strongly activates both dendrites and soma, and produces an apparent strong coupling in the dendrite to soma direction. However, given that dendritic stimulation can evoke somatic APs, bpAPs could have interacted with local dendritic activity. Therefore, it is not clear if in the present imaging conditions, how local dendritic events lead to global dendritic spikes and if there are dendritic events that do not cause the soma to fire. In order to support the claim of the rarity of such events in vivo, or to test for the possibility that they cannot be detected, the authors need to show by imaging using a range of subthreshold dendritic stimulations given to layer 1 in the ex vivo preparation, the dendrite to soma coupling as a function of the level of dendritic calcium activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49145.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] However, the crucial concern raised by all three reviewers relates to the idea of the apical tuft acting as a single computational unit.

Our results show that, on average, the percentage of coincident calcium signals across compartments of individual neurons was not significantly modified either by visual stimulation or behavioural state changes (n=19 neurons) (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2) (subsection “Visual stimulation and locomotion do not alter the coupling of calcium signals between neuronal compartments from soma to apical tuft”).</p><p>We have added a full new figure showing how the interaction of locomotion and visual stimulation with drifting gratings affects global dendritic calcium signals and somatic responses (Figure 6). We have analysed the responses of 15 orientation-selective neurons. These results show that locomotion increased calcium transient amplitudes both in apical tuft and soma, without a significant difference between compartments (Figure 6G). This gain in calcium transient amplitude was not significantly different during the presentation of preferred and non-preferred orientations (Figure 6H). As a consequence, the orientation selectivity index (OSI) of somatic and apical tuft responses remained unchanged during both stationary and locomotion periods (Figure 6I). In line with these results, we found that the preferred orientation was similar throughout tuft dendritic branches and neuronal compartments of individual neurons, both during stationary and locomotion periods (Figure 6J and K). Finally, the Pearson’s correlation between apical tuft branches calcium signals and across compartments remained high and unchanged regardless of the gratings orientation and behavioural state (still or locomotion) (Figure 6L, 6M) (subsection “Visual stimulation and locomotion do not alter the coupling of calcium signals between neuronal compartments from soma to apical tuft” paragraph three).</p><p>Consequently, based on the repertoire of behavioural states and visual stimuli assessed in this study, we did not find a significant impact of behavioural events or stimuli on the proportion of somatic signals that fail to invade the distal dendrite.

Our findings from ex vivoexperiments suggest that: 1) somatically-triggered back-propagating action potentials below the critical frequency (&lt;50-100Hz) may underlie the distant-dependent loss of dendritic calcium signals we observed in vivo; 2) spiking driven by strong apical tuft input or high-frequency spiking driven by somatic depolarization may underlie the strong somatic-dendritic coupling detected in vivo.</p><p>We thank the reviewers to point out the important observation that some relatively large calcium transients in soma and proximal trunk were not detected in the distal compartments (see examples in Figure 3B(iii) and 3B(iv) and percentage of compartment-specific event in Figure 3C(iii) and 3C(iv) for ΔF/F0&gt;0.3), suggesting the presence of active mechanisms inhibiting calcium transients along the apical trunk.

We imaged the soma and distal apical dendrite (nexus) of GCaMP6s- and GCaMP6f- expressing layer 5 neurons whilst driving neuronal spiking either by somatic current injections (somatic stimulation) or L1 electrical stimulation (dendritic stimulation) (new Figure 4). These findings are described in a new result section (“Ex vivo calibration of GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f signals in layer 5 soma and apical tuft dendrites”).</p><p>These results show that, compared to GCaMP6s, GCaMP6f had a reduced sensitivity for detecting calcium signals, specifically in the soma during low frequency spiking driven either by somatic or dendritic stimulation (Figure 4E-4H). Consequently, as compared to GCaMP6s, attenuation of events from soma to dendrite was underestimated whereas attenuation of events from dendrite to soma was overestimated with GCaMP6f (Figure 4G vs 4H). With GCaMP6s, by contrast, attenuation of signals was asymmetric; we only found attenuation from soma to distal dendrites, as observed in vivo(Figure 4G). This difference between GcaMP6s and GCamP6f is consistent with the observation of a symmetric somato-dendritic coupling in the study of (Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019) using GCaMP6f and the observation of an asymmetric coupling in our results, using GCaMP6s (paragraph four of subsection “Ex vivo calibration of GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f signals in layer 5 soma and apical tuft dendrites”). We added a discussion about the difference between Beaulieu-Laroche et al., and our findings (subsection “High but asymmetric coupling of calcium signals from soma to apical tuft” paragraph two).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The conclusion about the correlation between distal dendrites and soma is based on indirect measurements. In Figure 2, the authors showed the correlations between compartments of neighboring focal planes. But presumably due to the technical limitation, there is no direct measurement of the correlation between the distal tuft branches and somatic signals. The author should at least provide certain estimation about to what extent the multiple correlations between neighboring compartments may tell about the direct correlation between distal branches and soma.</p></disp-quote><p>It is correct that due to technical limitations of the piezoelectric device we did not simultaneously image the soma and corresponding apical tuft. Pairs of compartments (soma-trunk, trunk-trunk, trunk-tuft, tuft-tuft) were imaged at a distance of 170 μm. We now provide a detailed explanation of our estimation of the proportion of compartment-specific events from soma to apical tuft (Figure 3—figure supplement 1): we estimated a decrease of about 40% of calcium transients from soma to the distal part of the apical tuft. This quantification was confirmed by a second data set, in which somatic and apical tuft calcium transients were imaged independently in individual layer 5 neurons. We found that the mean frequency of calcium transients in the apical tuft corresponded to 62% of the frequency of events in the corresponding soma (n = 13 neurons, Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We have edited the text accordingly (subsection “Frequency of calcium transients decreases in a distance- and amplitude</p><p>dependent manner from soma to apical tuft” and Figure legend of Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although the authors used CaMKII to restrict the expression of Cre in excitatory neurons, this study did not distinguish different subtypes of L5 pyramidal neurons. It is known that there are at least two or more different subtypes of L5 neurons with distinct dendritic morphologies, dendritic integrative properties, and downstream projection patterns. For example, the cortico-cortical projection L5 neurons are mostly thin tufted neurons, showing less bursting activity, which may be attributable to differences in the properties of dendritic spikes. Additionally, the distal tuft of the thick tufted neurons may be more compartmentalized than the thin tufted neurons, and show large dendritic calcium spikes. How such differences in different subtypes of L5 neurons may influence the observations in the current study? At least, the authors should include a discussion on this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We have added a discussion of how both apical tuft signals and the somato-dendritic coupling may differ between different subtypes of layer 5 pyramidal neurons (subsection “High but asymmetric coupling of calcium signals from soma to apical tuft” paragraph four). The neurons included in this study had their soma located at various depths within layer 5 (median 528 μm, see Figure 3—figure supplement 1) and mainly displayed thick-tufted morphology, characteristic of pyramidal tract neurons. Since we selected the imaged neurons visually based on their GCaMP6 fluorescent signal, our sampled is likely biased towards layer 5 neurons with thick trunk and thick-tufted morphology.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The revised manuscript has been significantly improved with inclusion of additional experiments and analysis and careful editing of the text. However, there is a remaining issue that needs to be addressed prior to further consideration of the manuscript. This requires an additional set of ex vivo experiments that is crucial to the main conclusions of the paper, which we think are feasible to complete within a month.</p><p>The reviewers have pointed out the shortcomings related to the new ex vivo experiments (Figure 4). Specifically, the use of suprathreshold dendritic stimulation that also evokes somatic APs strongly activates both dendrites and soma, and produces an apparent strong coupling in the dendrite to soma direction. However, given that dendritic stimulation can evoke somatic APs, bpAPs could have interacted with local dendritic activity. Therefore, it is not clear if in the present imaging conditions, how local dendritic events lead to global dendritic spikes and if there are dendritic events that do not cause the soma to fire. In order to support the claim of the rarity of such events in vivo, or to test for the possibility that they cannot be detected, the authors need to show by imaging using a range of subthreshold dendritic stimulations given to layer 1 in the ex vivo preparation, the dendrite to soma coupling as a function of the level of dendritic calcium activity.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now included a new supplementary figure that shows the dendrite to soma coupling for a range of subthreshold dendritic stimulations given to layer 1, in our ex vivopreparation (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have shown this both as a function of somatic output (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E), and as a function of the level of dendritic calcium activity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>Specifically, we present data in which we image GCaMP6s in both the soma and dendrite while delivering stimulation to L1 at varying frequencies (5-200Hz) and with intensities at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of action potential threshold. Our principle findings are:</p><p>1) We could not detect any global calcium signals in the apical tuft when L1 stimulation failed to evoke a somatic action potential. Thus, there is a strong coupling between global calcium events and somatic spiking in our experimental conditions. This is largely consistent with several studies demonstrating that apical tuft electrogenesis is associated with somatic spiking (<italic>e.g.</italic> Helmchen et al., 1999, Larkum and Zhu, 2002, also Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2019).</p><p>2) Provided L1 stimulation evoked at least 2 action potentials, we could detect calcium signals in both apical tuft and soma using GCaMP6s. However, when L1 stimulation only evoked a single action potential, apical tuft calcium signals were still observed in 60% of the trials; however, these events were now below the detection limit of GCaMP6s in the soma. Consequently, under these conditions, soma-dendrite coupling was low.</p><p>These data reveal that evoked apical tuft calcium events are strongly coupled to somatic spiking, and that this coupling can be detected by GCaMP6s imaging providing that somatic output is above the limits of detection (&gt;2 action potentials ex vivo). We have edited the manuscript accordingly (Results subsection “Ex vivo calibration of GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f signals in layer 5 soma and apical tuft dendrites” paragraph 5; Materials and methods subsection “Ex vivo patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging”).</p><p>We have also added to the discussion (in the section “Limitations of the use of calcium imaging to assess dendritic activity in awake behaving mice”), a paragraph about the limitations of detecting branch-specific events in vivo. Whereas previous ex vivo studies have demonstrated that branch-specific stimulation can indeed trigger localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> events detected by calcium indicators (e.g. Cai et al., 2004; Sandler et al., 2016; review: Major et al., 2013), the detection of these events in vivo is more challenging, principally because they may be masked by ongoing global dendritic events. Given the relatively low temporal resolution of GCaMP6s, dissociating global dendritic spikes from potential underlying branch-specific events is challenging (Kerlin et al., 2019). The contribution of branch-specific calcium signalling to ongoing neuronal activity in vivo therefore remains an open question.</p><p>References:</p><p>Cai X, Liang CW, Muralidharan S, Kao JP, Tang CM, Thompson SM. 2004.
