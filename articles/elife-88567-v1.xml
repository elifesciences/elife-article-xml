populations. However, current applications of TMS to pain have been restricted to measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from peripheral muscles. Here, TMS was combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to determine whether experimental pain could induce alterations in cortical inhibitory/facilitatory activity observed in TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). In Experiment 1 (n=29), multiple sustained thermal stimuli were administered to the forearm, with the first, second, and third block of thermal stimuli consisting of warm but non-painful (pre-pain block), painful (pain block) and warm but non-painful (post-pain block) temperatures, respectively. During each stimulus, TMS pulses were delivered while EEG (64 channels) was simultaneously recorded. Verbal pain ratings were collected between TMS pulses. Relative to pre-pain warm stimuli, painful stimuli led to an increase in the amplitude of the frontocentral negative peak ~45 ms post-TMS (N45), with a larger increase associated with higher pain ratings. Experiments 2 and 3 (n=10 in each) showed that the increase in the N45 in response to pain was not due to changes in sensory potentials associated with TMS, or a result of stronger reafferent muscle feedback during pain. This is the first study to use combined TMS-EEG to examine alterations in cortical excitability in response to pain. These results suggest that the N45 TEP peak, which indexes GABAergic neurotransmission, is implicated in pain perception and is a potential marker of individual differences in pain sensitivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>combined TMS-EEG</kwd><kwd>experimental pain</kwd><kwd>acute pain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R61NS113269-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seminowicz</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schabrun</surname><given-names>Siobhan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined TMS-EEG can be used to further elucidate the mechanisms for pain perception and to discover biomarkers for the development of chronic pain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pain is a complex subjective experience, and understanding how pain is processed remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apkarian, 2021</xref>). Several neuroimaging techniques have been applied to disentangle these complexities: functional magnetic resonance imaging has assisted in identifying brain structures implicated in pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reddan and Wager, 2018</xref>), while electroencephalography (EEG) has contributed to our understanding of the temporal sequence of pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ploner and May, 2018</xref>). Another useful technique that has been used to examine the role of inhibitory and facilitatory neural circuits in pain has been transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schabrun and Hodges, 2012</xref>). However, current applications of TMS to pain have involved recording the output of TMS from a muscle, a signal that could be influenced by many intermediate (subcortical, spinal, peripheral) factors, and which restricts investigations to the motor system only. Here, we used combined TMS-EEG measure to record output of TMS directly from the cortex and from multiple brain regions, in pain-free and tonic pain conditions.</p><p>When TMS is delivered over the primary motor cortex (M1), a magnetic pulse induces an electrical current in underlying cortical tissue that, if the intensity is sufficient, activates corticomotor pathways, inducing a motor evoked potential (MEP) in a target muscle. The magnitude of the MEP serves as an index of corticomotor excitability. Past systematic reviews on studies measuring MEPs during acute experimental pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bank et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rohel et al., 2021</xref>) have shown a reduction in MEP amplitude during pain and after pain resolution, with stronger reductions in MEP amplitude associated with lower acute pain severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>). It has been hypothesized that this reduction in MEP amplitude is an adaptive mechanism that restricts movement in the pain-afflicted area, to protect the area from further pain and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodges and Tucker, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While previous findings show promise for the use of TMS to discover and validate potential biomarkers for pain, limitations exist when using TMS to measure MEPs. First, MEP responses to TMS reflect the net sum of cortical, spinal, and peripheral activity within the corticomotor pathway. This makes it unclear as to whether pain processes occur at the cortical, spinal, or peripheral level. Further, measurement of MEPs restricts investigations to M1. One way of overcoming these limitations is by combining TMS and EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). TEPs index cortical excitability <italic>directly</italic> from the cortex (i.e. without influence of subcortical, spinal, and peripheral processes), as well as from regions <italic>outside M1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farzan et al., 2016</xref>). TEPs also provide an index of the activity of specific neurotransmitter circuits within the cortex. For example, TEP peaks that occur at ~45 ms and 100 ms post-stimulation are linked to GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> neurotransmission, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Premoli et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the TEP peak ~60 ms post-stimulation is linked to glutamatergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belardinelli et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, TEPs provides additional spatial and temporal information about cortical activity over MEPs, making it ideal for understanding the brain mechanisms involved in pain perception.</p><p>TEPs have already shown potential to serve as a biomarker for the development and prognosis of various neurological and psychiatric conditions for reviews see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kallioniemi and Daskalakis, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tremblay et al., 2019</xref>). However, the applicability of TEPs to pain research is yet to be established. While GABAergic processes indexed by TEPs have been hypothesized to be involved in pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barr et al., 2013</xref>), direct evidence is scarce. Two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Che et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2022</xref>) examined whether the potential analgesic effects of repetitive TMS (rTMS) over the dorsal prefrontal cortex are associated with plasticity in TEPs. These studies separately measured TEPs and ratings to painful stimuli, before and after rTMS, with one finding that increases in pain thresholds following rTMS were associated with changes in TEPs that index GABAergic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ye et al., 2022</xref>). While these studies assist us in understanding whether TEPs might mediate rTMS-induced pain reductions, no study has investigated whether TEPs are altered in direct response to pain.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to use TMS-EEG to determine whether acute experimental pain induces alterations in cortical inhibitory and facilitatory peaks observed using TEPs. We used a tonic heat pain paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Granot et al., 2006</xref>), in which multiple thermal stimuli were applied over the right extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) muscle via a thermode. For each thermal stimulus, the temperature increased from a neutral baseline of 32 °C to either a warm non-painful or a painful (46 °C) temperature, with this temperature maintained for 40 s. During this time, TMS was administered to the left M1 with concurrent EEG to obtain TEPs from 63 scalp channels, and MEPs from the ECRB muscle (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Verbal pain ratings were obtained between pulses. It was hypothesized that TEP peaks that index GABAergic processes, including the peaks at ~45 and 100 ms after TMS, would increase in response to painful stimuli relative to warm non-painful stimuli.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of experimental apparatus.</title><p>The apparatus consisted of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) to simultaneously record motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs).

The protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) consisted of three blocks of stimuli, in chronological order: pre-pain, pain, and post-pain blocks. The pre-pain and post-pain blocks each consisted of six 40 s thermal stimuli (20 s interstimulus interval) delivered at a non-painful temperature (calibrated to each participant’s warmth detection threshold), while the pain block consisted of six 40 s thermal stimuli delivered at 46 °C. The pre-pain/pain/post-pain design has been commonly used in the TMS-MEP pain literature, as many studies have demonstrated strong changes in corticomotor excitability that persist beyond the painful period. Indeed, in a systematic review, we showed effect sizes of 0.55–0.9 for MEP reductions 0–30 min after pain had resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>). As such, if we had used an alternative design with blocks of warm stimuli intermixed with blocks of painful stimuli, the warm stimuli blocks would not serve as a valid non-painful baseline. Based on a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dubé and Mercier, 2011</xref>) which also used sequences of painful (50 °C) and warm (36 °C) thermal stimuli, we did not anticipate that the stimulus in the pain block would entrain pain in the post-pain block.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the protocol for Experiment 1.</title><p>Participants experienced three blocks of thermal stimuli: a pre-pain, pain, and post-pain block, with each block consisting of multiple thermal stimuli delivered 40 s at a time, and during which TMS measurements (indicated by blue arrows) and verbal pain ratings were obtained.

Three participants were excluded from the MEP analysis due to EMG software failure – these participants were still included in the TEP analysis.

Further multimodal work is required to confirm this finding.</p><p>While our findings are consistent with some studies that show increases in GABAergic activity in response to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kupers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>), other studies have also reported reduced GABAergic activity in response to experimental pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cleve et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Matos et al., 2017</xref>). Differences between studies can be attributed to the duration of the noxious stimulus (tonic pain lasting several seconds/minutes vs. transient pain stimuli lasting &lt;1 s). Indeed, pooled data have shown that the cerebral response to pain is highly dependent on the duration of the painful stimuli, as the adaptive response (to suppress or increase cortical activity) changes depending on the duration of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>). This highlights the need for further work to replicate our findings using different durations of experimental pain and in chronic pain populations.</p><p>Another finding of Experiment 1 was the increase in the amplitude of N100 peak, a marker of GABA<sub>B</sub> neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Premoli et al., 2014</xref>), and the parietal-occipital P60 peak, a marker of glutamatergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belardinelli et al., 2021</xref>). However, this was not replicated in Experiments 2 and 3, potentially due to the smaller sample size. Nonetheless, we encourage further investigations of alterations in these peaks during pain, particularly the P60 peak, as several magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have reported increases in glutamate concentration during experimental pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Archibald et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Predicting individual differences in pain using TEPs</title><p>Experimental pain models are useful tools to explore brain measures that may predict individual differences in pain sensitivity, with an ultimate goal of determining whether such measures explain why some people develop chronic pain. Experiment 1 showed that higher pain ratings were associated with a larger increase in the N45 peak during pain. This analysis was not conducted in Experiments 2 and 3 due to smaller sample sizes and given the primary aims of Experiments 2 and 3 were to isolate the source of the group-level effect. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the N45 peak is a potential marker of sensorimotor GABAergic activity and may be associated with individual differences in pain sensitivity. This is consistent with other studies measuring GABAergic responses to pain, showing associations between higher pain sensitivity and larger sensorimotor gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barr et al., 2013</xref>) and higher left somatosensory cortical GABA laterality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niddam et al., 2021</xref>). However, the direction of this relationship likely depends on the duration of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>). Our results have implications for understanding the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Further TMS-EEG studies are required to determine whether the N45 peak is altered in chronic pain populations and whether the N45 peak can explain why some individuals in the acute stages of pain transition to chronic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The TEP vs. MEP response to pain</title><p>The present study showed that a larger reduction in MEP amplitude during pain was correlated with lower pain ratings, consistent with a recent systematic review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>) and the idea that reduced MEP amplitude is an adaptive mechanism that restricts movement in the pain-afflicted area, to protect the area from further pain and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodges and Tucker, 2011</xref>). The novelty of this study was the use of an experimental heat pain paradigm that has not yet been used in combination with TMS research, and a paradigm that controls for non-painful somatosensory stimulation.</p><p>The finding of a pain-induced increase in the amplitude of the N45 peak, which indexes GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity, is consistent with TMS research showing pain-induced increases in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Salo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schabrun and Hodges, 2012</xref>). SICI refers to the reduction in MEP amplitude to a TMS pulse that is preceded 1–5ms by a subthreshold pulse, with this reduction believed to be mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kujirai et al., 1993</xref>). Some studies have reported associations between SICI and the TEP N45 peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leodori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rawji et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting the two may share common neurophysiological mechanisms. However, we also found that a larger reduction in MEP amplitude during pain was associated with less pain, while a larger increase in the TEP N45 peak during pain was associated with stronger pain ratings, suggesting that inhibitory processes mediating MEPs and the TEP N45 peak during pain are distinct. Further work is required to disentangle the relationship between corticomotor excitability measured by MEPs and cortical activity measured by TEPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Some methodological limitations should be noted. Firstly, while there was no conclusive evidence for a difference in pain ratings between the six thermal stimuli of the pain block, there was evidence for fluctuations in pain ratings during each painful stimulus. This suggests that the perceived pain intensity was not stable across 40 s, which may have introduced noise in the TEP data. Future studies could use pain paradigms that can more effectively maintain a constant level of pain, for example hypertonic saline infusion paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Svensson et al., 2003</xref>). Secondly, the use of verbal pain ratings prevented the characterization of pain on a finer time scale. However, verbal ratings were used to eliminate potential contamination of MEPs introduced by using the hand for providing pain rating. Thirdly, the increased N45 peak amplitude in response to pain may reflect increased alertness/arousal during pain. However, a recent study showed that higher alertness is associated with reduced TEP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noreika et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the increase in the N45 peak amplitude is not related to pain-induced arousal. Lastly, future research should consider replicating our experiment using intermixed pain and no pain blocks, as opposed to fixed pre-pain and pain blocks, to control for order effects (the explanation that successive thermal stimuli applied to the skin results in an increase in the N45 peak, regardless of whether the stimuli are painful or not). However, we note that there was no conclusive evidence for a difference in N45 peak amplitude between pre-pain and post-pain conditions of Experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting it is unlikely that the observed effects were an artefact of time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study is the first to use TMS-EEG methodology to examine alterations in cortical activity in direct response to acute pain. Findings across three experiments suggest that tonic heat pain leads to an increase in the amplitude of the frontocentral TEP N45 peak (associated with GABAergic neurotransmission), and that larger increases in this peak are associated with higher pain ratings. The findings suggest that TEP indices of GABAergic neurotransmission have the potential to be used as predictive markers of pain severity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Experiment 1 consisted of 29 healthy participants (18 males, 11 females, mean age; 26.24±5.5).

They viewed a fixation cross to minimize eye movements. TMS was applied to left M1 while participants wore an EEG cap containing 63 scalp electrodes to record TEPs. Surface electromyographic (EMG) electrodes were placed over the distal region of the right ECRB to record MEPs. EMG signals were amplified (x 1000) and filtered (16–1000 Hz), and digitally sampled at 2000 Hz (Spike2, CED). A thermode was attached over the proximal region of the right ECRB in close proximity to the EMG electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The TMS coil was covered in a layer of foam (5 mm thickness) to minimize decay artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogasch et al., 2017</xref>). Participants also wore both foam earplugs and headphones to reduce any potential discomfort from the TMS click. Auditory masking was not used.

The thermode commenced at a baseline temperature of 32 °C. The pre-pain and post-pain blocks consisted of six thermal stimuli delivered at the warm threshold (the temperature that led to any detectable change in skin temperature from baseline). In the pain block, six thermal stimuli were delivered at 46 °C, which has been shown to produce lasting pain with a mean rating of ~5/10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furman et al., 2020</xref>). Given we were interested in the individual relationship between pain and excitability changes, the fixed temperature of 46 °C ensured larger variability in pain ratings as opposed to calibrating the temperature of the thermode for each participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamczyk et al., 2022</xref>).

During each 40-s thermal stimulus, TMS pulses were manually delivered, with a verbal pain rating score (0=no pain, and 10=worst pain imaginable) obtained between pulses. To avoid contamination of TEPs by verbal ratings, the subsequent TMS pulse was not delivered until the verbal rating was complete, and the participant was cued by the experimenter to provide the pain rating after each pulse. As TMS was delivered manually, there was no set interpulse interval. However, the 40-s thermal stimulus duration allowed for 11 pulses for each thermal stimulus (hence 66 TMS pulses for each of the pre-pain, pain, and post-pain blocks), and 10 verbal pain ratings between each TMS pulse (~4 s in between pain ratings).

Bayesian inference was used to analyze the data using JASP software (Version 0.12.2.0, JASP Team, 2020). Bayes factors were expressed as BF<sub>10</sub> values, where BF<sub>10</sub>’s of 1–3, 3–10, 10–30 and 30–100 indicated ‘weak’, ‘moderate’, ‘strong’ and ‘very strong’ evidence for the alternative hypothesis, while BF<sub>10</sub>’s of 1/3–1, 1/10-1/3, 1/30-1/10 and 1/100-1/30 indicated ‘anecdotal’, ‘moderate’, ‘strong’ and ‘very strong’ evidence in favour of the null hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Doorn et al., 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Pain ratings</title><p>A 6 (thermal stimulus number: 1–6) x 10 (timepoint:1–10) Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA with default priors in JASP (r scale fixed effects = .5, r scale random effects = 1, r scale covariates = .354) was conducted on the pain ratings during the pain block. This was to assess differences in pain ratings between the six painful stimuli and whether pain ratings differed between the timepoints of each painful stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Motor-evoked potentials</title><p>A Bayesian one-way repeated measures ANOVA with default priors in JASP was performed to assess differences in MEP amplitudes between pre-pain, pain, and post-pain blocks of Experiment 1. As there is now increasing emphasis placed on investigating the individual level relationship between changes in cortical excitability and pain and not only the group level effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seminowicz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seminowicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Summers et al., 2019</xref>), we also investigated the correlations between pain ratings and changes in MEP (and TEP) amplitude, A Bayesian correlation analysis with default priors in JASP (stretched Beta prior width = 1) was run to determine whether the change in mean MEP amplitude during pain (as a proportion of pre-pain) was associated with the mean verbal pain rating score. Data were checked for assumptions of normally distributed data using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Where assumptions were violated, data were log-transformed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>TMS-evoked potentials</title><p>The grand-averaged signals for the pre-pain, pain, and post-pain condition were obtained. For Experiment 1, a cluster-based permutation analysis was used to compare amplitude levels between pre-pain and pain, and pre-pain and post-pain, at each time-point and for each electrode. For all experiments, the mean TEP waveform of any identified clusters from Experiment 1 were plotted, and peaks (e.g. N15, P30, N45, P60, N100) were identified using the TESA peak function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogasch et al., 2017</xref>). Any identified peaks were then compared between conditions using Bayes paired sample t-tests with default priors in JASP (Cauchy scale = .707). A Bayesian correlation analysis with default priors in JASP was performed to determine whether the difference in identified peaks between pre-pain and pain blocks was associated with the mean pain rating score. Data were checked for assumptions of normally distributed data using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Where assumptions were violated, data were log-transformed.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Procedures adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the human research ethics committee of UNSW (HC200328).

To this end, heat pain stimuli are applied to healthy human participants. Simultaneously, TMS pulses are applied to M1 and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and pain ratings are assessed after each TMS pulse. TEPs are used as measures of cortical excitability. The results show that TEP amplitudes at 45 msec (N45) after TMS pulses are higher during painful stimulation than during non-painful warm stimulation. Control experiments indicate that auditory, somatosensory, or proprioceptive effects cannot explain this effect. Considering that the N45 might reflect GABAergic activity, the results suggest that pain changes GABAergic activity. The authors conclude that TEP indices of GABAergic transmission might be useful as biomarkers of pain sensitivity.</p><p>Pain-induced cortical excitability changes is an interesting, timely, and potentially clinically relevant topic.

Painful stimuli led to an increase in the amplitude of the fronto-central N45, with a larger increase associated with higher pain ratings. Experiments 2 and 3 studied the correlation between the increase in the N45 in pain and the effects of a sham stimulation protocol/higher stimulation intensity. They found that the centro-frontal N45 TEP was decreased in acute pain. The study comes from a very strong group in the pain fields with long experience in psychophysics, experimental pain, neuromodulation, and EEG in pain. They are among the first to report on changes in cortical excitability as measured by TMS-EEG over M1. While their results are in line with reductions seen in motor-evoked responses during pain and effort was made to address possible confounding factors (study 2 and 3), there are some points that need attention. In my view the most important are:</p><p>1. The method used to calculate the rest motor threshold, which is likely to have overestimated its true value : calculating highly abnormal RMT may lead to suprathreshold stimulations in all instances (Experiment 3) and may lead to somatosensory &quot;contamination&quot; due to re-afferent loops in both &quot;supra&quot; and &quot;infra&quot; (aka. less supra) conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The method used to assess motor threshold was the TMS motor threshold Assessment Tool (MTAT) which estimates motor threshold using maximum likelihood parametric estimation by sequential testing (Awiszus et al., 2003; Awiszus and Borckardt, 2011). This was developed as a quicker alternative for calculating motor threshold compared to the traditional Rossini-Rothwell method which involves determining the lowest intensity that evokes at least 5/10 MEPs of at least 50 microvolts. The method has been shown to achieve the same accuracy of determining motor threshold as the traditional Rossini-Rothwell method, but with fewer pulses (Qi et al., 2011; Silbert et al., 2013).</p><p>We have now made this clearer in the manuscript:</p><p>“The RMT was determined using the TMS motor thresholding assessment tool, which estimates the TMS intensity required to induce an MEP of 50 microvolts with a 50% probability using maximum likelihood parametric estimation by sequential testing (Awiszus, 2003; Awiszus &amp; Borckardt, 2011). This method has been shown to achieve the accuracy of methods such as the Rossini-Rothwell method (Rossini et al., 1994; Rothwell et al., 1999) but with fewer pulses (Qi, Wu, &amp; Schweighofer, 2011; Silbert, Patterson, Pevcic, Windnagel, &amp; Thickbroom, 2013). The test stimulus intensity was set at 110% RMT to concurrently measure MEPs and TEPs during pre-pain, pain and post-pain blocks.”</p><p>Therefore, the high RMTs in our study cannot be explained by the threshold assessment method. Instead, they are likely explained by aspects of the experimental setup that increased the distance between the TMS coil and the scalp, including the layer of foam placed over the coil, the EEG cap and the fact that the electrodes we used had a relatively thick profile. This has been explained in the paper:</p><p>“We note that the relatively high RMTs are likely due to aspects of the experimental setup that increased the distance between the TMS coil and the scalp, including the layer of foam placed over the coil, the EEG cap and relatively thick electrodes (6mm)”</p><p>Awiszus, F.

The low number of pulses used for TEPs (close to ⅓ of the usual and recommended)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that increasing the number of pulses can increase the signal to noise ratio. During piloting, participants were unable to tolerate the painful stimulus for long periods of time and we were required to minimize the number of pulses per condition.</p><p>We note that there is no set advised number of trials in TMS-EEG research. According to the recommendations paper, the number of trials should be based on the outcome measure e.g., TEP peaks vs. frequency domain measures vs. other measures and based on previous studies investigating test-retest reliability (Hernandez-Pavon et al., 2023). The choice of 66 pulses per condition was based on the study by Kerwin et al., (2018) showing that optimal concordance between TEP peaks can be found with 60-100 TMS pulses delivered in the same run (as in the present study). The concordance was particularly higher for the N40 peak at prefrontal electrodes, which was the key peak and electrode cluster in our study. We have made this clearer:</p><p>“Current recommendations (Hernandez-Pavon et al., 2023) suggest basing the number of TMS trials per condition on the key outcome measure (e.g., TEP peaks vs. frequency measures) and based on previous test-retest reliability studies. In our study the number of trials was based on a test-retest reliability study by (Kerwin, Keller, Wu, Narayan, &amp; Etkin, 2018) which showed that 60 TMS pulses (delivered in the same run) was sufficient to obtain reliable TEP peaks (i.e., sufficient within-individual concordance between the resultant TEP peaks of each trial).”</p><p>Further supporting the reliability of the TEP data in our experiment, we note that the scalp topographies of the TEPs for active TMS at various timepoints (Figures 5, 7 and 9) were similar across all three experiments, especially at 45 ms post-TMS (frontal negative activity, parietal-occipital positive activity).</p><p>In addition to this, the interclass correlation coefficient (Two-way fixed, single measure) for the N45 to active suprathreshold TMS across timepoints for each experiment was 0.90 for Experiment 1 (across pre-pain, pain, post-pain time points), 0.74 for Experiment 2 (across pre-pain and pain conditions), and 0.95 for Experiment 3 (across pre-pain conditions). This suggests that even with the fluctuations in the N45 induced by pain, the N45 for each participant was stable across time, further supporting the reliability of our data. These ICCs are now reported in the supplementary material (subheading: Test-retest reliability of N45 Peaks).</p><p>Hernandez-Pavon, J. C., Veniero, D., Bergmann, T.

However, recent studies have shown that even when these methods are used, sensory contamination of TEPs is still present, as shown by studies that show commonalities in the signal between active and sensory sham conditions that mimic the auditory/somatosensory aspects of real TMS (Biabani et al., 2019; Conde et al., 2019; Rocchi et al., 2021). This has led many authors (Biabani et al., 2019; Conde et al., 2019) to recommend the use of sham conditions to control for sensory contamination. To separate the direct cortical response to TMS from sensory evoked activity, Experiment 2 included a sham TMS condition that mimicked the auditory/somatosensory aspects of active TMS to determine whether any alterations in the TEP peaks in response to pain were due to changes in sensory evoked activity associated with TMS, as opposed to changes in cortical excitability. Therefore, the lack of auditory masking does not impact the main conclusions of the paper.</p><p>We have made this clearer:</p><p>“… masking methods have been used to suppress these sensory inputs, (Ilmoniemi and Kičić, 2010; Massimini et al., 2005). However recent studies have shown that even when these methods are used, sensory contamination of TEPs is still present, as shown by commonalities in the signal between active and sensory sham conditions that mimic the auditory/somatosensory aspects of real TMS (Biabani et al., 2019; Conde et al., 2019; Rocchi et al., 2021). This has led many leading authors (Biabani et al., 2019; Conde et al., 2019) to recommend the use of sham conditions to control for sensory contamination.”</p><p>Ilmoniemi, R. J., &amp; Kičić, D.

To this end, heat pain stimuli are applied to healthy human participants. Simultaneously, TMS pulses are applied to M1 and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and pain ratings are assessed after each TMS pulse. TEPs are used as measures of cortical excitability. The results show that TEP amplitudes at 45 msec (N45) after TMS pulses are higher during painful stimulation than during non-painful warm stimulation. Control experiments indicate that auditory, somatosensory, or proprioceptive effects cannot explain this effect. Considering that the N45 might reflect GABAergic activity, the results suggest that pain changes GABAergic activity. The authors conclude that TEP indices of GABAergic transmission might be useful as biomarkers of pain sensitivity.</p><p>Pain-induced cortical excitability changes is an interesting, timely, and potentially clinically relevant topic. The paradigm and the analysis are sound, the results are mostly convincing, and the interpretation is adequate. The following clarifications and revisions might help to improve the manuscript further.</p><p>1. Non-painful control condition. In this condition, stimuli are applied at warmth detection threshold. At this intensity, by definition, some stimuli are not perceived as different from the baseline. Thus, this condition might not be perfectly suited to control for the effects of painful vs. non-painful stimulation. This potential confound should be critically discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>In Experiment 3, we also collected warmth ratings to confirm whether the pre-pain stimuli were perceived as different from baseline. This detail has been added to them methods:</p><p>“In addition to the pain rating in between TMS pulses, we collected a second rating for warmth of the thermal stimulus (0 = neutral, 10 = very warm) to confirm that the participants felt some difference in sensation relative to baseline during the pre-pain block. This data is presented in the supplementary material”.</p><p>We did not include these data in the initial submission but have now included it in the supplemental material. These data showed warmth ratings were close to 2/10 on average. This confirms that the non-painful control condition produced some level of non-painful sensation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. MEP differences between conditions. The results do not show differences in MEP amplitudes between conditions (BF 1.015). The analysis nevertheless relates MEP differences between conditions to pain ratings. It would be more appropriate to state that in this study, pain did not affect MEP and to remove the correlation analysis and its interpretation from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The interindividual relationship between changes in MEP amplitude and individual pain rating is statistically independent from the overall group level effect of pain on MEP amplitude. Therefore, conclusions for the individual and group level effects can be made independently.</p><p>It is also important to note that in the pain literature, there is now increasing emphasis placed on investigating the individual level relationship between changes in cortical excitability and pain as opposed to the group level effect (Seminowicz et al., 2019; Summers et al., 2019).
