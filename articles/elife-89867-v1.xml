(THC) and its intoxicating effects, mainly owing to the aversive response of rodents to THC that limits intake. Here, we developed a palatable THC formulation and an optimized access paradigm in mice to drive voluntary consumption. THC was formulated in chocolate gelatin (THC-E-gel). Adult male and female mice were allowed ad libitum access for 1 and 2 hr. Cannabimimetic responses (hypolocomotion, analgesia, and hypothermia) were measured following access. Levels of THC and its metabolites were measured in blood and brain tissue. Acute acoustic startle responses were measured to investigate THC-induced psychotomimetic behavior. When allowed access for 2 hr to THC-E-gel on the second day of a 3-day exposure paradigm, adult mice consumed up to â30 mg/kg over 2 hr, which resulted in robust cannabimimetic behavioral responses (hypolocomotion, analgesia, and hypothermia). Consumption of the same gelatin decreased on the following third day of exposure. Pharmacokinetic analysis shows that THC-E-gel consumption led to parallel accumulation of THC and its psychoactive metabolite, 11-OH-THC, in the brain, a profile that contrasts with the known rapid decline in brain 11-OH-THC levels following THC intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. THC-E-gel consumption increased the acoustic startle response in males but not in females, demonstrating a sex-dependent effect of consumption. Thus, while voluntary consumption of THC-E-gel triggered equivalent cannabimimetic responses in male and female mice, it potentiated acoustic startle responses preferentially in males. We built a dose-prediction model that included cannabimimetic behavioral responses elicited by i.p. versus THC-E-gel to test the accuracy and generalizability of this experimental approach and found that it closely predicted the measured acoustic startle results in males and females. In summary, THC-E-gel offers a robust preclinical experimental approach to study cannabimimetic responses triggered by voluntary consumption in mice, including sex-dependent psychotomimetic responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cannabinoids</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>route of administration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The use of <italic>Cannabis</italic> products containing high concentrations of Î<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is rapidly increasing despite our limited understanding of its potential impact on physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Compton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlini and Schauer, 2022</xref>). These products are typically inhaled as combusted plant matter, vaporized extracts, or consumed in edible formulations. THC acts as a partial agonist at cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>R) to trigger a myriad of responses such as physiological responses (e.g., increase heart rate), altered mood and time perception, inhibition of motor control, and impaired learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Santos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zuurman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hollister and Gillespie, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hollister, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weinstein et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weinstein et al., 2008b</xref>). Subsequently, a relationship between <italic>Cannabis</italic> and psychotic/affective symptoms and an observable increase in <italic>Cannabis</italic>-associated vehicle crashes has become apparent without an understanding of the neural effects of higher-dose THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hindley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2007</xref>). Many of these effects translate to preclinical models, where in rodents THC reduces spontaneous locomotion and locomotor control, and induces hypersensitivity to tactile and auditory stimuli, ataxia, and sedation; all of which have been shown to be mediated through action at CB<sub>1</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holtzman et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beardsley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metna-Laurent et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siemens and Doyle, 1979</xref>). Importantly, some cannabimimetic responses are sex-dependent, as exemplified by the finding that THC (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) triggers a more pronounced reduction in spontaneous locomotion and anxiogenic response in females than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasten et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to these cannabimimetic responses, preclinical investigations have pursued psychosis-related behaviors through the acoustic startle response, finding that involuntary administration of THC impairs psychomotor/sensorimotor gaiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibarra-Lecue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoffman and Ison, 1980</xref>), emphasizing the translational value in understanding THCâs bioactivity in humans.</p><p>Understanding the effects of increased THC use in humans through preclinical models of voluntary THC administration has proven difficult to establish due to the aversive behaviors to higher doses in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgdorf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lepore et al., 1995</xref>). In recent years, progress has been made in promoting voluntary oral consumption of THC in rodents, but results have been limited to mild, acute CB<sub>1</sub>R-dependent cannabimimetic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruse et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smoker et al., 2019</xref>). This lack of experimental tools to translate higher-dose THC intake in humans to preclinical models emphasizes the urgent need to develop and fully characterize a novel experimental approach. To bridge this translational gap, we initially developed an approach where mice are given ad libitum access to consume a sugar-water gelatin (CTR-gel) containing fixed amounts of THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruse et al., 2019</xref>). Matching previous rodent studies, we found that mice consumed more vehicle gelatin than THC gelatin, indicating that they detected and avoided THC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrus et al., 2018</xref>). To overcome this limitation, in this study we developed and characterized a palatable oral gelatin formulation that increases voluntary consumption by formulating THC in a chocolate-flavored nutritional shake, Ensure (E-gel). Previous work has shown that mice have a preference for chocolate flavor, making it an ideal THC formulant to increase palatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ventura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbano et al., 2009</xref>). We leveraged this approach to determine whether oral consumption of high-concentration THC gelatin induces commonly studied cannabimimetic responses in mice (hypolocomotion, analgesia, and hypothermia), and then we examined the effects of THC E-gel consumption on acoustic startle response, a preclinical measure of reflexive response rate and psychomotor arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>). The model developed here leverages acute voluntary consumption of a sweetened gelatin to investigate psychomotor and reflexive behaviors, pharmacokinetics, and triad responses following consumption of THC E-gel in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>Animal studies followed the guidelines established by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Washington.

Animals experienced either a triad of behaviors (open field, tail flick, and body temperature) measured immediately preceding and following the consumption window or an acoustic startle trial immediately following consumption. On the third and final day of access, animals were placed into the same cage with a vehicle gelatin cup. For all gelatin access days, gelatin cups and animals were weighed before and after the consumption window.

On day 2, spontaneous locomotor activity between mice that consumed VEH-E-gel and THC-E-gel diverged after 40 min, showing a significant decrease in total locomotion in mice that consumed THC-E-gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>, two-way ANOVA, repeated measures <italic>F</italic><sub>1,14</sub> = 11.18, p=0.005, Sidakâs).

Importantly, spontaneous locomotion of mice exposed to VEH-E-gel and THC-E-gel was similar on day 3. Together, these results show that consumption of THC-E-gel induced hypolocomotion on day 2 after 40 min of access. Additionally, the decreased consumption of VEH-E-gel on day 3 is likely due to an aversive memory of the THC exposure period and not to hypolocomotion. Thus, E-gel incentivizes voluntary THC consumption to induce robust hypolocomotion, a hallmark cannabimimetic response, within 40 min of access.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Consumption of THC-E-gel results in concomitant increases in the levels of THC and its metabolites in brain tissue</title><p>Several studies have shown that the PK profile of THC (5 mg/kg, i.p.) results in peak circulating concentrations of THC (1000 pmol/g), its bioactive metabolite 11-OH-THC (300 pmol/g), and its inactive metabolite 11-COOH-THC (100 pmol/g) in the brain after 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vozella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torrens et al., 2020</xref>). To determine the PK profile of THC-E-gel consumption (10 mg/15 ml) and considering the hypolocomotion behavior occurring during the consumption window, we collected plasma and brain tissue samples after 1 hr of consumption, at the end of the 2 hr access period, as well as 30 min (2.5 hr) and 24 hr (26 hr) following the 2 hr access period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> shows THC levels in the brain reached 500â600 pmol/g tissue between 1 hr and post 2.5 hr time point and was below 50 pmol/g tissue after 24 hr.

Thus, levels of both CB<sub>1</sub>R agonists, THC, and 11-OH-THC, concomitantly peaked after 1 hr of THC-E-gel consumption, a result that matches the hypolocomotion response measured starting at 40 min during the 2 hr consumption period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, THC and 11-OH-THC levels in brain tissue were lower, near zero, 24 hr after the 2 hr exposure, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kreuz and Axelrod, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansson et al., 1989</xref>).

Thus, we extrapolated the relative i.p. dose for each cannabimimetic response triggered by consumption by plotting the cannabimimetic response following consumption onto the doseâresponse curve of THC-i.p. as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4bâd</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4bâd</xref> also shows that 1 hr access to high-concentration THC-E-gel triggered greater cannabimimetic responses compared to 2 hr access.

Of note, 1 hr access to high-dose THC-E-gel triggered stronger hypolocomotion and reduction in core body temperature corresponding to 10.3 and 11.6 mg/kg THC i.p., respectively, and analgesia corresponding to 4.5 mg/kg THC i.p.

Access to E-gel for 2 hr over a 2-day period incentivizes robust consumption, and at the highest dose tested here (10 mg/15 ml), mice of both sexes consumed ~30 mg/kg THC in 2 hr on the second day. Acute consumption of THC triggers commonly established cannabimimetic responses, the potencies of which were right-shifted compared to the responses measured with i.p. injections. Furthermore, we discovered that acute consumption of 10 mg/15 ml THC-E-gel increases the acoustic startle response in males and not in females; whereas i.p. injection of THC triggers a dose-dependent, inverse U-shaped, impairment of acoustic startle response that was also more pronounced in males than females. Our study provides important translational results at two levels: voluntary consumption of THC by rodents and its sex-dependent impact on acoustic startle response as a measure of psychomotor reflexive behavior.</p><p>Mice of both sexes consumed similar amounts of VEH-CTR-gel and VEH-E-gel, and none consumed more than 20% of their daily caloric intake, indicating comparable consumption behaviors. However, consumption of high-concentration THC-CTR-gel (4 mg) was inconsistent, and 41% of the mice completely avoided consumption (as assessed by an unbroken gelatin surface at the end of the 2 hr access period) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). By contrast, consumption of THC-E-gel (10 mg, i.e., 2.5Ã more concentrated) was more consistent with a total consumption rate of 0.95 g/2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This difference in consumption between THC-CTR-gel (4 mg/15 ml) and THC-E-gel (10 mg/15 ml) is likely due to the chocolate flavoring in Ensure that masks the strong odor and bitter taste of high-concentration THC and its aversive properties. At higher doses of THC-E-gel exposure, we found more variability in dose consumed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), a consumption behavior similar between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). Future studies of such increased variability at even higher doses of THC may reveal differences in absorption or metabolism for example. Significantly, mice that consumed the higher-dose THC-E-gel on day 2 consumed remarkably less VEH-E-gel on day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2c</xref>). This decrease in consumption is likely due to the development of aversive conditioned associations to higher-dose THC. Thus, the THC-E-gel experimental approach reported here also enables the study of aversive memory to voluntary oral consumption of high-dose THC.</p><p>I.p. injection of THC induces hypolocomotion, analgesia, and hypothermia in mice with different median effective doses (ED<sub>50</sub>, 1.3, 3.9, and 14.4 mg/kg, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2bâd</xref>). By comparison, 1 hr access to 10 mg THC-E-gel produced cannabimimetic responses that paralleled the ED<sub>50</sub> of i.p. injections and are equivalent to an i.p. dose of ~9 mg/kg. Also, 1 hr access to 10 mg THC-E-gel evoked a more pronounced cannabimimetic response compared to 2 hr access, agreeing with prior studies that have shown that oral gavage increases brain peak concentration of THC 1â2 hr after administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deiana et al., 2012</xref>). Oral consumption also increases 11-OH-THC levels in the brain with comparable kinetics and concentration as THC, and the levels of both cannabinoids decrease in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). Considering that ~600 pmol/g of THC and 11-OH-THC is roughly equivalent to 3 nM of both compounds in the brain that persists over several hours, and both activate CB<sub>1</sub>R with comparable potencies, our results suggest that the accumulation of both THC and 11-OH-THC in the brain might contribute to cannabimimetic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinis-Oliveira, 2016</xref>). Because of the experimental design implemented for this study, we did not determine whether the variation in the time course of distinct cannabimimetic response was different following consumption. Thus, future studies that prioritize behavioral responses at multiple time points following consumption of THC using E-gel results might reveal differences in the dynamics of onset and decay in cannabimimetic responses.</p><p>We found that oral consumption of THC-E-gel produced a higher brain concentration of the primary metabolite 11-OH-THC in the brain compared to previously published concentrations after i.p. administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Torrens et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests oral administration may modify the accumulation of 11-OH-THC or its metabolism in the brain. Both males and females were studied for all pharmacokinetic time points, and we found no significant sexual differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2">Figure 3âsource data 1 and 2</xref>). Finally, considering that voluntary oral consumption of 10 mg/15 ml THC results in nanomolar concentrations of THC and 11-OH-THC for several hours, the time-dependent reduction in cannabimimetic response that follows their maximal response may also be due either to CB<sub>1</sub>R desensitization/tolerance or to redistribution of the drug within brain parenchyma.</p><p>An i.p<italic>.</italic> injection of THC 6 and 10 mg/kg in male mice reduces acoustic startle behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tournier and Ginovart, 2014</xref>). We show here that THC-i.p. induces a dose-dependent biphasic behavioral response that is more pronounced in males than females, demonstrating sex-dependent sensorimotor behaviors, and confirming that THC impacts neurocognitive function in a sex-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harte and Dow-Edwards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gur et al., 2012</xref>). THC-E-gel (10 mg/15 ml) consumption also increased the response to acoustic startle preferentially in males compared to females. Whether the dose of THC formulated in E-gel can be increased to levels that remain palatable to mice and might trigger the pronounced reduced acoustic startle measured with 10 mg THC injection i.p. remains an open question.</p><p>Analysis of the behavioral responses following i.p. injection and consumption of THC-E-gel enabled us to propose a model that correlates the doses of THC capable of producing comparable behavioral responses, emphasizing the robustness of this experimental approach. Thus, the flexibility of the THC-E-gel experimental approach may extend its utility as a substitute for traditional i.p. injections, better bridging the translational gap between preclinical investigations and human use. For example, the THC-E-gel experimental model can be easily modified and implemented to measure, in a less invasive manner, the impact of oral THC consumption on additional mouse behaviors, including self-administration and preference/aversion, paradigms that require multiple treatment regimens.</p><p>In conclusion, we report a new experimental approach that achieves robust voluntary oral consumption of THC in adult mice by formulating THC in a chocolate-flavored sweetened E-gel.

The authors compared the effects of THC consumed in this highly palatable gelatin (termed E-gel) to THC dissolved in a less palatable gelatin (CTR-gel), and to i.p. injections of multiple doses of THC, on the classic triad of CB1R dependent behaviors (hypolocomotion, antinociception, and body temperature).</p><p>The authors found that they could achieve consumption of higher concentrations of THC in the E-gel than the CTR-gel, and that this led to larger total dose exposure and decreases in locomotor activity, antinociception, and body temperature reductions similar to 3-4 mg/kg THC when tested after 2 hour consumption and roughly 10 mg/kg if tested immediately after 1 hour consumption. The majority of THC E-gel consumption was found to occur in the first hour on the first exposure day. THC E-gel consumption was lower than VEH E-gel consumption and this persisted on a subsequent consumption day, suggesting that the animals may form a taste aversion and that THC at the dose consumed likely has aversive properties, consistent with the literature on i.p. dosing. The authors also report the pharmacokinetics in brain and plasma of THC and metabolites after 1 or 2 hour consumption, finding high levels of THC in the brain that begins to dissipate at 2.5 hours is gone 24 hours later. Finally, the authors tested THC effects on the acoustic startle response and found an inverted dose response that was more pronounced in males than females after i.p. dosing and a greater startle response in males after E-gel dosing.</p><p>Overall, the authors find that voluntary oral consumption of THC can achieve levels of intake that are consistent with the present and prior reported literature on i.p. dosing.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of the article include a direct comparison of voluntary oral THC consumption to noncontingent i.p. administration, the use of multiple THC doses and oral THC formulations, the inclusion of multiple assays of cannabinoid agonist effects, and the inclusion of males and females. Additional strengths include monitoring intake over 10 minute intervals and validating that effects are CB1R dependent via antagonist studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The abstract does not discuss the reduction of E-gel consumption that occurs after multiple days of exposure to the THC formulation, but rather implies that a new model for chronic oral self-administration has been developed. Given that only two days of consumption was assessed, it is not clear if the model will be useful to determine THC effects beyond the acute measures presented here. The abstract should clarify that there was evidence of reduced consumption/aversive effects with repeated exposures.</p><p>2. In the results section, the authors sometimes describe effects in terms of the concentration of gel as opposed to the dose consumed in mg/kg, which can make interpretation difficult. For example, the text describing Figure 1i states that significant effects on body temperature were achieved at 4 mg CTR-gel and 5 mg THC-gel, but were essentially equivalent doses consumed? It would be helpful to describe what average dose of THC produced effects given that consumption varied within each group of mice assigned to a particular concentration.</p><p>3. The description of the PK data in Figure 3 did not specify if sex differences were examined. Prior studies have found that males and females can exhibit stark differences in brain and plasma levels of THC and metabolites, even when behavioral effects are similar. However, this does depend on species, route, timing of tissue collection. It would be helpful to describe the PK profile of males and females separately.</p><p>4. In Figure 5, it is unclear how the predicted i.p. THC dose could be 30 mg/kg when 30 mg/kg was not tested by the i.p. route according to the figure, and if it had been it would have likely been almost zero acoustic startle, not the increased startle that was observed in the 2 hr gel group. It seems more likely that it would be equivalent to 3 mg/kg i.p. Could there be an error in the modeling, or was it based on the model used for the triad effects? This should be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89867.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The work fruitfully adds to the tools to study cannabinoid action and pharmacology specifically, but also this method is applicable to other drugs, in particular, if lipophilic in nature.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The addition of chocolate flavor overcomes aversive reactions which are often experienced in pharmacological treatments, leading to possible caveats in the interpretation of the behavioral outcomes.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Certainly, more THC mediated behavioral outcomes could have been tested, but the work presents a proof-of-concept study to investigate acute THC treatment.</p><p>It would have been interesting if this application form is also possible for chronic treatment regimen.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89867.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: This manuscript explores the development of a rodent voluntary oral THC consumption model.

It might be interesting to follow up the issue that the individual THC consumption is considerable, as depicted in Fig. 1e (at high dose). This will presumably also lead to different behavioral responses. Or is there individual metabolism, also difference male vs. female?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agree that the distribution of THC doses consumed (calculation based on weight) would be worth further investigating and have now included language about this (page 20, line 436). Please note that we did not find a sex difference (Supplemental Figure S1b), but it would be exciting to discover some biologically relevant cause such as individual absorption or metabolism</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Major</p><p>1. Methods: Were the observers of experiments blinded to animal treatment? Why or why not?</p></disp-quote><p>Multiple investigators performed the behavioral measurements and were not blinded to mouse treatments, but the dose consumed by each mouse remained blind. Thus, because animals consumed THC gelatin of their own volition while having ad libitum access, we performed the correlational analysis presented in Figure 1 l-n.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Methods: The authors could consider relating their study design to the ARRIVE guidelines and providing a statement as to whether their study adheres to these guidelines. Related to this, were mice provided with any environmental enrichment during the study?</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the ARRIVE guidelines with exception to investigator blinding (described above). Please note that mice were not provided with additional environmental enrichment during the study, a point that we specified in our methods (page 5, line 91).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Methods / Results: In the Methods it is stated that the triad of cannabimimetic behaviors was measured 1 h post-injection or immediately after gelatin exposure. Why were these timepoints chosen? Perhaps this wording should be revised because measurements of cannabimimetic effects were taken several times after drug exposure. Peak i.p. drug may occur earlier than 1 h whereas peak oral drug effect is likely to occur over a longer time period (i.e., not immediately after) due to delays of absorption and first pass metabolism. Is it possible that the authors have underestimated oral drug effects by selecting these timepoints? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed a reduction in locomotion activity starting 1 h following the beginning of exposure to the gelatin (Figure 2), suggesting initial cannabimimetic changes. Based on this observable response we chose to measure all cannabimimetic behaviors immediately following gelatin exposure. The exposure timeline for i.p. injection (1 h post-injection) was selected based on a standard published protocol (Metna-Laurent et al, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Pharmacodynamics: Related to this and because the aim of this paper is to establish a rodent oral dose model, could the authors discuss the need for better characterization of the time course of drug effects? For example, how might anti-nociception or locomotor activity vary following THC E-gel consumption? This is somewhat addressed in the locomotion time course in Figure 2G but could be elaborated on or discussed in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that future studies should include additional time points measuring behavioral changes. This important point is now emphasized in the discussion (page 21, line 455).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Pharmacokinetics: Related to this point above, have the authors considered collecting blood or tissue samples from their i.p.-injected animals to assess drug pharmacokinetics as they relate to drug effect and as compared to oral THC consumption? I am not suggesting the authors conduct a completely new study for this manuscript; however, this could be raised as a future study and/or as a weakness of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not measure blood and tissue concentrations after i.p. administration due to the number of studies reporting these values by our co-author, Dr. Daniele Piomelli, that established these pharmacokinetic measures. Thus, we chose to reference these studies. Please note that repeating such measurements would be labor intensive, unnecessary use federal NIH resources and animals, while being very redundant to the existing literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Minor, but related to these points: In the results, page 14 line 299: the first sentence of this paragraph is confusing as written. The Reviewer recognizes that the authors are relating the pharmacokinetic work to previously published findings, but still thinks that measuring and comparing THC levels from their cohort of i.p.-injected animals would have benefitted the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this edit has been made in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Methods, Histology: The methods as described do not contain sufficient detail regarding THC and THC metabolite quantification. In addition, it is not clear from this section what Histology was performed and how (no histology results appear in the manuscript). Please add more detail to this section of the Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this typo and have corrected it in the methods section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Methods / Results: The statistics section requires additional detail regarding the rationale for tests being performed on different datasets. In addition, a description of the curve fitting used for data in figures 1H-J, 4B-D, and S4 would be helpful to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have updated and provided more information regarding the curve fitting that was used in the methods and results section for the respective figure panels (page 9, line 183-184).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>1. Throughout: The use of the phrase &quot;high&quot; dose is somewhat arbitrary and not defined relative to other doses of the THC formulation throughout the manuscript. The Reviewer suggests simply stating that THC was used, specifying the dose, or justifying in the Abstract and/or Introduction the classification of &quot;high&quot; based on relevant literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the observation. We have removed this ambiguity by specifically mentioning the dose that was consumed (e.g., abstract page 2, line 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Abstract: define &quot;CB1&quot; in the abstract. Although this is a common abbreviation within the field, its use should be defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this definition in the abstract for clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 2: why are the consumption panels B, C, and D given separate labels but the locomotor data are all labeled together as panel G?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the observation, we have adjusted the labeling, so it is equal for both sets of panels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
