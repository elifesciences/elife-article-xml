Mis-expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle causes facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), whereas expression in cancers suppresses IFNγ induction of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) and contributes to immune evasion. We show that the DUX4 protein interacts with STAT1 and broadly suppresses expression of IFNγ-stimulated genes by decreasing bound STAT1 and Pol-II recruitment. Transcriptional suppression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) requires conserved (L)LxxL(L) motifs in the carboxyterminal region of DUX4 and phosphorylation of STAT1 Y701 enhances interaction with DUX4. Consistent with these findings, expression of endogenous DUX4 in FSHD muscle cells and the CIC-DUX4 fusion containing the DUX4 CTD in a sarcoma cell line inhibit IFNγ induction of ISGs. Mouse Dux similarly interacted with STAT1 and suppressed IFNγ induction of ISGs. These findings identify an evolved role of the DUXC family in modulating immune signaling pathways with implications for development, cancers, and FSHD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DUX4</kwd><kwd>DUX</kwd><kwd>DUXC</kwd><kwd>STAT1</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>interferon stimulated genes</kwd><kwd>interferon-gamma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR045203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HG000035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spens</surname><given-names>Amy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012644</institution-id><institution>Friends of FSH Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chris Carrino Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapscott</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The developmental transcription factor DUX4 interacts with STAT1 and broadly suppresses expression of IFNγ-stimulated genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Double homeobox (DUX) genes encode a family of transcription factors that originated in placental mammals, consisting of DUXA, DUXB, and DUXC subfamilies that all have similar paired homeodomains. The DUXC family is characterized by a small conserved region at the carboxy-terminus of the protein that includes two (L)LxxL(L) motifs and surrounding conserved amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leidenroth and Hewitt, 2010</xref>). Members of this family, including mouse <italic>Dux</italic> and human <italic>DUX4</italic>, are expressed in a brief burst at early stages of development and regulate an initial wave of zygotic gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Iaco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whiddon et al., 2017</xref>). While <italic>DUX4</italic> expression has also been reported in testes and thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Das and Chadwick, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Snider et al., 2010</xref>), it is silenced in most somatic tissues.</p><p>Mis-expression of <italic>DUX4</italic> in skeletal muscle is the cause of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tawil et al., 2014</xref>), the third most prevalent human muscular dystrophy. DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle activates the early embryonic totipotent program, suppresses the skeletal muscle program, and ultimately results in muscle cell loss. Many of the genes induced by DUX4 in skeletal muscle encode proteins that are normally restricted to immune-privileged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2012</xref>) and their expression in skeletal muscle could induce an immune response. In this context, it is interesting that FSHD muscle pathology is characterized by focal immune cell infiltrates. However, our prior studies have also suggested that DUX4 might suppress antigen presentation and aspects of an immune response. Expression of DUX4 in cultured muscle cells blocked lentiviral induction of innate immune response genes such as <italic>IFIH1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, we reported that expression of DUX4 in primary cancers and engineered cancer cell lines blocks the interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-mediated induction of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) antigen presentation and promotes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade treatments, such as anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chew et al., 2019</xref>). The scope and mechanism(s) of how DUX4 suppresses immune signaling remain unknown.</p><p>DUX4 contains one LxxLL and one LLxxL motif at its C-terminal end that are among the most highly conserved regions of DUXC family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leidenroth and Hewitt, 2010</xref>). LxxLL motifs are alpha-helical protein-interaction domains that were first identified in nuclear-receptor signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heery et al., 1997</xref>). Proteins containing LxxLL motifs, such as the Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT or PIAS family, have been shown to modulate immune signaling of STATs, IRFs, NF-kB, and other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shuai and Liu, 2005</xref>). PIAS proteins block the function of these transcription factors in four ways: preventing DNA binding, recruiting co-repressors, stimulating SUMOylation, or sequestering them within nuclear or subnuclear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shuai and Liu, 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we show that a transcriptionally inactive C-terminal fragment of DUX4 is sufficient to block IFNγ induction of most interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and this requires the (L)LxxL(L) domains. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified the IFNγ-signaling effector STAT1 and several other proteins involved in immune signaling as proteins that interact with the DUX4 C-terminal domain (DUX4-CTD). We show that the DUX4-CTD interacts with STAT1 phosphorylated at Y701 and interferes with stable DNA binding, recruitment of Pol-II, and transcriptional activation of ISGs. Consistent with these mechanistic studies, endogenous DUX4 in FSHD muscle cells and the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein expressed in a subset of EWSR1-negative small blue round cell sarcomas suppress IFNγ induction of ISGs. The comparable CTD of mouse Dux containing (L)LxxL(L) motifs similarly interacts with STAT1 and blocks IFNγ stimulation of ISGs. These findings suggest an evolved role of the DUXC family in modulating immune signaling pathways and have implications for the role of DUX4 in development, cancers, and FSHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DUX4 broadly suppresses ISG induction</title><p>Our prior studies showed that DUX4 inhibited ISG induction in response to lentiviral infection and suppressed induction of MHC class I proteins in response to IFNγ (type II interferon) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geng et al., 2012</xref>). To determine whether DUX4 broadly inhibited ISG induction by IFNγ, we used the MB135-iDUX4 cell line, a human skeletal muscle cell line with an integrated doxycycline-inducible DUX4 (iDUX4) transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for schematics and sequences of the transgenes used in this study). Doxycycline induction of DUX4 expression in the MB135-iDUX4 cell line has been validated as an accurate cell model of the transcriptional consequences of DUX4 expression in FSHD muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jagannathan et al., 2016</xref>) and in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whiddon et al., 2017</xref>). Using a stringent eightfold induction cut-off (log2 fold-change &gt;3), RNA-seq showed that IFNγ treatment induced 113 genes, whereas the expression of DUX4 suppressed ISG induction by IFNγ more than fourfold for 76 (67%) of these genes and more than twofold for 102 genes (90%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Informed by the RNA-seq results, we used RT-qPCR to measure the response of four ISGs that represent different components of the response to immune signaling: the RNA helicase <italic>IFIH1</italic>; the interferon-stimulated exonuclease <italic>ISG20</italic>; the chemoattractant <italic>CXCL9</italic>; and the MHC II chaperone <italic>CD74</italic>. IFNγ induction of all four genes was robustly blocked by DUX4 expression while a DUX4-target gene <italic>ZSCAN4</italic> was strongly induced, indicating that the ISG suppression did not represent a universal block to gene induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, MB135-iDUX4, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> [for this and subsequent constructs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows RT-qPCR data from additional independent cell lines together with protein expression and nuclear localization]), whereas doxycycline treatment in the absence of iDUX4 did not suppress induction of the ISG panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, MB135 parental). In contrast to DUX4, a paralog in the DUX family, DUXB, did not suppress induction of the ISG panel by IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, MB135-iDUXB).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DUX4 suppresses interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MB135 cells expressing doxycycline-inducible DUX4 (MB135-iDUX4), parental MB135 cells, or MB135 cells expressing doxycycline-inducible DUXB (MB135-iDUXB) were untreated, treated with IFNγ, or treated with doxycycline and IFNγ.

Additionally, we stimulated the cells with interferon-beta (IFNβ, type I interferon), which primarily signals through JAK-STAT pathways via a STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 complex, as opposed to the STAT1 homodimers induced by IFNγ. For all signaling pathways, DUX4 suppressed the induction of a subset of the panel of ISG genes induced by each ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). One exception, <italic>CXCL9</italic> was induced by IFNβ, poly(I:C), and the RIG-I ligand but not suppressed by DUX4. cGAMP did not induce <italic>CXCL9</italic> or <italic>CD74</italic>, precluding evaluation of the role of DUX4 in regulating these ISGs. These results indicate that DUX4 can modulate the activity of multiple signaling pathways. However, because these pathways converge on common nodes, such as the induction of interferon, additional studies are needed to determine whether DUX4 inhibits unique components in each pathway or a common component responsible for ISG upregulation across pathways. We decided to focus further efforts on identifying the mechanism behind the suppression of IFNγ-mediated transcription as this pathway was most broadly suppressed by DUX4.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DUX4 transcriptional activity is not necessary for ISG suppression</title><p>There are two conserved regions of the DUX4 protein, the N-terminal homeodomains (aa19-78, aa94-153) and an ~50 amino acid region at the end of the C-terminal domain (CTD) that is required for transcriptional activation by DUX4 (aa371-424) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leidenroth and Hewitt, 2010</xref>). A mutation in the first homeodomain, F67A, significantly diminishes DUX4 DNA binding and target gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wallace et al., 2011</xref>). When expressed in MB135 cells, iDUX4-F67A minimally activated the DUX4 target gene <italic>ZSCAN4</italic>, yet still suppressed ISG induction by IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A second construct, iDUX4aa154-424, has the N-terminal homeodomain region replaced by a cassette containing a 3x FLAG tag and two nuclear localization signals (3xFLAG-NLS). The iDUX4aa154-424, hereafter called iDUX4-CTD, was completely transcriptionally silent yet equally suppressed activation of ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We used the DUX4-CTD because the prior experiments showed that it contained the regions necessary and sufficient to suppress ISG induction. In the first experiment, we used MB135iDUX4-CTD cells either untreated, treated with doxycycline alone, or with both doxycycline and IFNγ. In the second experiment, we used MB135iDUX4-CTD and MB135iDUX4mL1dL2 cells both treated with doxycycline and IFNγ compared to these two cell lines untreated and combined as a control. Proteins with a minimum of two peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) in at least one sample that were identified in both experiments were assigned to 1 of 10 categories (see ‘Materials and methods’) to separate candidate interactors from other categories that might be co-purified because of obligate interactions (e.g., proteasome or ribosome) or might be less likely to be relevant to immune responses (e.g., cytoskeletal proteins). Candidate interactors were then ranked based on the total PSMs for that protein across all samples. (It is important to note that the ‘bait’ constructs were expressed at low levels in the samples not treated with doxycycline and that the immunoprecipitation concentrated this background, which might account for some of the candidate proteins appearing in the untreated samples.) STAT1 and DDX3X, two key regulators of innate immune signaling, ranked at the top of the list of candidate DUX4-CTD interactors, together with several other proteins implicated in modulating innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, left panel, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

The αMYC signal of the IFNγ-treated samples suggests that our iSTAT1, iSTAT1-Y701A, and iSTAT1-S727A transgenes are expressed at similar levels, and yet the wild-type STAT1 and STAT1-S727A showed enhanced binding to the CTD with IFNγ treatment while the STAT1-Y701A did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

(Top) In the absence of the DUX4-CTD, pSTAT1 Y701 (black ‘P’) dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, binds its GAS motif in the ISG promoter, acquires secondary phosphorylation at S727 (gray ‘P’), and recruits a stable transcription complex that includes Pol-II to drive transcription of ISGs. (Bottom) In the presence of the DUX4-CTD, STAT1 is phosphorylated, translocates to the nucleus, and binds its GAS motif as evidenced by the pSTAT1 S727 in complex with the CTD. However, diminished steady-state occupancy of STAT1 at the ISG promoters and absence of Pol-II recruitment indicate that the STAT1-DUX4-CTD complex does not stably bind DNA and fails to recruit Pol-II and the pre-initiation complex. The (L)LXXL(L) motifs (black bars in DUX4-CTD) are necessary to interfere with transcription suppression and likely prevent STAT1 from interacting with a factor in the pre-initiation complex or recruit a co-repressor.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><label>Figure 7—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Mouse Dux co-IP, anti-STAT1.</title><p>Western blot showing anti-STAT1 signal for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. * marks correct size bands.

These data demonstrate that the suppression of ISG induction and interaction with phosphorylated STAT1 is conserved in the DUXC family.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that the DUX4-CTD, a transcriptionally inactive carboxyterminal fragment of DUX4, is necessary and sufficient to broadly suppress ISG induction by IFNγ as well as partially inhibit induction through the IFNβ, cGAS, IFIH1/MDA5, and DDX58/RIG-I pathways. The DUX4-CTD colocalizes with STAT1 in the nucleus, diminishes steady-state STAT1 occupancy at ISG promoters, and prevents Pol-II recruitment and transcriptional activation of ISGs by IFNγ. Whereas the conserved DUX4 (L)LxxL(L) motifs are necessary to suppress transcriptional activation by STAT1, they are not necessary for the interaction of DUX4 and STAT1. The suppression of IFNγ signaling by endogenous DUX4 in FSHD muscle cells and the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein in sarcomas provides support for the biological relevance of these findings.</p><p>Our data support a simple model of how DUX4 inhibits STAT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). IFNγ binding to its receptor, IFNGR, leads to the phosphorylation of STAT1 at Y701, subsequently STAT1 forms a homodimer, translocates to the nucleus, and binds the gamma-activated sequence (GAS) in the promoters of ISGs. DNA-bound STAT1 is additionally phosphorylated at S727 and recruits Pol-II to the ISG promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sadzak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wen et al., 1995</xref>). Our studies show that DUX4-CTD interacts with STAT1 phospho-Y701 in the absence of phospho-S727 (i.e., binds the S727A STAT1 mutant), yet also efficiently co-immunoprecipitates with STAT1 phospho-S727 from cell lysates. This indicates that despite DUX4 interacting with STAT1 phospho-Y701, DNA binding of this complex is not fully impaired because of the association with STAT1 phospho-727. However, our ChIP and CUT&amp;Tag studies show decreased STAT1 steady-state occupancy of ISG promoters and failure to recruit Pol-II. Together, these data support a model of DUX4 interaction with pSTAT1-Y701 that prevents the formation of a stable DNA-bound complex and recruitment of Pol-II, but likely not the initial binding of STAT1 to DNA because of the abundance of phospho-S727 associated with DUX4. The (L)LxxL(L) motifs are necessary to prevent transcriptional activation, presumably by blocking Pol-II recruitment, but not necessary for the interaction of DUX4 with STAT1. This could be due to recruitment of a repressor or by simply blocking the interaction of STAT1 with an intermediate factor necessary to recruit Pol-II.</p><p>The (L)LxxL(L)-dependent inhibition of STAT1 by DUX4 in this study bears a striking similarity to the inhibitory mechanisms displayed by LxxLL-containing members of the PIAS family. LxxLL motifs were first identified in nuclear-receptor (NR) signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heery et al., 1997</xref>) where they were found to facilitate protein-protein interactions between unbound NRs and co-repressors such as RIP140 and HDACs, or agonist-bound NRs and co-activators such as CBP/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Plevin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Savkur and Burris, 2004</xref>). LxxLL motifs have since been characterized in multiple protein families, including the PIAS family, and specifically implicated in modulating immune transcriptional networks via interaction with and inhibition of STATs, IRFs, and NF-kB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shuai and Liu, 2005</xref>). While the (L)LxxL(L) region of DUX4 is required for suppression of IFNγ-mediated ISG induction and its enhanced interaction with pSTAT1-Y701, it is not required for its apparently weaker interaction with unphosphorylated STAT1. In a similar manner, the LxxLL motif of PIASγ is not required for initial binding to STAT1, but is required to suppress ISG induction mediated by STAT1 in response to both IFNβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubota et al., 2011</xref>) and IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). The same motif is required for the trans-repression of androgen receptor (AR) signaling by PIASγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gross et al., 2001</xref>) and of Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF or KLF1) by PIAS3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Siatecka et al., 2015</xref>), though again it is not required for the initial interaction of either pair. The studies referenced above hypothesize that this trans-repression relies on the recruitment of co-repressors, although the specific interactors were not determined. Additionally, just as DUX4 reduces the steady-state occupancy of STAT1 to DNA, PIAS proteins can suppress transcriptional networks by blocking DNA binding, as with PIAS3 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 1997</xref>) or PIAS1 and NF-kB p65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). These studies describe the mechanisms of transcriptional suppression by LxxLL motifs in PIAS and other proteins that have strong parallels to the (L)LxxL(L) motifs in human DUX4 and mouse Dux. It is important to emphasize that the xx amino acids in the DUXC family are acidic and there is conservation of flanking amino acids as well, suggesting that the DUXC family likely evolved target specificity through these larger areas of conservation.</p><p>In addition to STAT1, the mass spectrometry identified several proteins that interact with the DUX4-CTD that might also have a role in modulating immune signaling. Although additional work is needed to validate the biological relevance of these interactions, many have functions related to immune signaling and that will need to be evaluated in future studies. DDX3X and PRKDC are the top-ranked candidates, together with STAT1. DDX3X has been shown to regulate RNA processing, translation, and innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mo et al., 2021</xref>). It was also shown to be a pathway-specific regulator of IRF3 and IRF7 in part by acting as a scaffolding factor necessary for IKK-ε and TBK1 phosphorylation of IRFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schröder et al., 2008</xref>). DDX3X was also shown to be a sensor of dsRNA and viral stem-loop RNA with a role in the initial induction of ISGs, including IFIH1 and DDX58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Oshiumi et al., 2010</xref>) that then serve to amplify the signaling mechanisms. PRKDC is known mostly for its major roles in DNA repair but also has been implicated in regulating the response to cytoplasmic DNA through the cGAS and IRF3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our current findings also provide a molecular mechanism for the suppression of IFNγ-stimulated genes in DUX4-expressing cancers. Previously we reported that the full-length DUX4 is expressed in a diverse set of solid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chew et al., 2019</xref>). Cancers expressing DUX4 had diminished IFNγ-induced MHC class I expression, reduced anti-tumor immune cell infiltration, and showed resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. In this study, we show that the CIC-DUX4 fusion in EWSR1-fusion-negative sarcomas blocks IFNγ-induced ISG expression and the upregulation of MHC I. This fusion protein contains the terminal 98 amino acids of DUX4, aa327-424, that encompasses a region shown to be sufficient to suppress IFNγ signaling in the iDUX4-aa339-424 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is reasonable to suggest that this fusion protein in the CIC-DUX4 sarcomas, or the full-length DUX4 in some other cancers, contributes to immune evasion at least in part through its interaction with STAT1, and that targeting DUX4 or its interaction with STAT1 might improve immune-based therapies for DUX4-expressing cancers.</p><p>The conservation of the (L)LxxL(L) motifs in mouse Dux and its similar interaction with STAT1 and inhibition of IFNγ signaling indicates that this is a conserved function of the DUXC family. DUX4, Dux, and the canine DUXC all induce expression of endogenous retroelements, as well as pericentromeric satellite repeats that form dsRNAs that, at least in the case of DUX4, induce a dsRNA response that results in activation of PKR and phosphorylation of EIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shadle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shadle et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the interaction with STAT1 and other immune signaling modulators might prevent the activation of the ISG pathway while permitting the PKR response, although the biological consequences remain to be further explored. It is also interesting that DUX4, Dux, and possibly other members of the DUXC family are expressed in immune-privileged tissues – that is, cleavage embryo, testis, and thymus – and our study suggests that their expression might contribute to this immune-privileged state.</p><p>It is also important to emphasize the limitations of this study and areas for future research. Although our data show that the DUX4-CTD interacts with STAT1 and prevents Pol-II recruitment to ISGs, further studies will be necessary to determine the mechanism(s). Testing specific steps in the formation of a stable pre-initiation complex might indicate an inhibition of a specific protein interaction necessary for the completion of stable Pol-II recruitment. Although the inhibitory activity of the DUX4-CTD was limited to ISG induction in our experimental system, extending these studies to other signaling pathways and even to artificial gene regulation systems, such as Gal4-Sp1 fusion factors, will be necessary to determine the specificity of the DUX4-CTD activity on STAT1 activity relative to other mechanisms of transcription regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Cell types used: primary human fibroblasts, primary human myoblasts, and immortalized human myoblasts.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vittorio Sartorelli (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agreed that the manuscript would be strengthened by demonstrating the key findings with new experiments in a more biologically relevant system. Specifically,</p><p>1) Please plan to address Reviewer #1, Comment #2, and Reviewer #2, Comment #4 with additional experiments.</p><p>2) Please address all other reviewer points with clarification or discussion, as requested, or with additional experiments if appropriate. It would be helpful to include a section on limitations in the Discussion to address comments such as Reviewer #1, Comment #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 4. It seems as if IFN-γ treatment increases the expression of the STAT1 and STAT1 S727A vectors (see Inputs). If my interpretation of the data is correct, the IP'ed STAT1 and STAT1 S727A should be corrected for their respective inputs.</p><p>2. Figure 6. Documenting the interaction of CIC-DUX4 with STAT1 in Kitra-SRS cells would reinforce the present findings.</p><p>3. The interesting finding that DUX4 prevents STAT1 binding and Pol-II recruitment may be mechanistically clarified by employing DUX4 and Gal4-Sp1 expression vectors with a Gal4-reporter followed by ChIP-qPCR with Gal4 and Pol-II antibodies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Statistical analyses are missing in most panels, please add and also add &quot;non-significant&quot; where important to interpret the data (i.e. Figure 4C).</p><p>2. Please provide a rationale for using DUX4-CTD from Figure 3 (related to the concern of missing regulatory elements). There may be regulatory domains missing from the full-length protein.</p><p>3. The conclusion in line 242 that the STAT1-DUX4-CTD interaction is happening in the nucleus is not possible with the data provided. Making this claim will require additional experiments, i.e. pulldowns and /or colocalization studies with DUX4 lacking an NLS.</p><p>4. Validation of key findings of STAT1-DUX4 interaction with a system not relying on doxycycline, and using different cells, preferentially primary cells that do not at steady-state have total STAT1 in the nucleus, is needed.</p><p>5. Description of protein domains and mutants in Figure 2 is not clear. Please add a more detailed description of the different annotated domains and information on whether the NLS is the same as endogenous NLS and information on whether this NLS has been mapped functionally or by homology.</p><p>6. Figure 1B, naming &quot;RIG-I&quot; is misleading, as not RIG-I is provided, but a ligand for RIG-I. Suggest renaming to &quot;3'ppp-dsRNA&quot;.</p><p>7. A lot of pressure lies on the data in Figure 6A, i.e. the physiological relevance statement made in line 387. While this is a beautiful experiment, the phenotype is very difficult to spot with the data provided and does not seem consistent across events marked with an arrow. Suggest quantification of the events with a higher number of cells and biological repeats to allow for statistical analysis and drive this conclusion home.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82057.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

However, the IFN-γ-treated samples from each transgenic cell line have comparable transgene expression as seen by both the α-STAT1 and α-Myc signals. Rather than computationally correcting for untreated-to-IFNγ expression levels in these samples, we have revised the text to acknowledge the reviewers point and direct the reader to compare the IFNγ-treated samples. We have added text edits to clarify this comparison in lines 202-206.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 6. Documenting the interaction of CIC-DUX4 with STAT1 in Kitra-SRS cells would reinforce the present findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional data from the Kitra-SRS cell lines, including both a Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) and a flow cytometry experiment.</p><p>In our PLA, we compared the PLA signal resulting from CIC-DUX4/STAT1 or CIC-DUX4/pSTAT1-Y701 interaction in untreated or IFNγ-treated Kitra-SRS cells (Figure 6C). We counted the number of PLA foci per nucleus in each condition and antibody pair and plotted these data. We found that there was a significant increase in the nuclear interaction of CIC-DUX4 and both total STAT1 and pSTAT1-Y701 with IFNγ treatment, consistent with our results suggesting that the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein is interacting with STAT1 in the nuclei of IFNγ-treated cells and interfering with its ability to upregulate ISGs.</p><p>In our flow cytometry experiment, we treated both MB135 parental cells (which endogenously express full-length CIC) and Kitra-SRS cells (expressing the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein) with either control siRNAs (siCTRL) or siRNAs targeting CIC and DUX4 (siCIC-DUX4) in the absence or presence of IFNγ (Figure 6—Figure Supplement 1). While knockdown of endogenous CIC in MB135 cells had no effect on MHC-I upregulation in IFNγ-treated cells, knockdown of the CIC-DUX4 fusion in Kitra-SRS cells increased MHC-I positive cells from 27.9% to 48.1%, suggesting that the CIC-DUX4 fusion protein interferes with MHC-I upregulation in this cell type.</p><p>Together, these provide additional data documenting the interaction of CIC-DUX4 with STAT1 in Kitra-SRS cells and further show that interaction suppresses MHC-I surface presentation. We thank the reviewer for suggesting adding such experiments to reinforce the original findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have added a final paragraph to the Discussion to acknowledge that additional studies, such as the Gal4-Sp1 experiment suggested by this reviewer, will be necessary to clarify the mechanism(s) of preventing Pol-II recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Please provide a rationale for using DUX4-CTD from Figure 3 (related to the concern of missing regulatory elements). There may be regulatory domains missing from the full-length protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. Figures 1 and 2 used both full-length DUX4 constructs and different mutants and deletions to map the necessary and sufficient domains for inhibition of ISG induction. For the discovery of interacting proteins, we decided to use the DUX4-CTD because it contained both the necessary and sufficient region. While we agree there might be other regulatory domains missing, we wanted to first identify the factors interacting with the necessary and sufficient regions. We hope future studies can identify the roles of other domains and factors. We have added additional text to clarify our rationale in lines 170-172.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The conclusion in line 242 that the STAT1-DUX4-CTD interaction is happening in the nucleus is not possible with the data provided. Making this claim will require additional experiments, i.e. pulldowns and /or colocalization studies with DUX4 lacking an NLS.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the potential for confusion and thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify our point in the text. While we are not arguing against the formal possibility of interactions in the cytoplasm, we are arguing for the presence and importance of interactions between the DUX4-CTD and STAT1 in the nucleus. We have made edits to lines 214-218, accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Validation of key findings of STAT1-DUX4 interaction with a system not relying on doxycycline, and using different cells, preferentially primary cells that do not at steady-state have total STAT1 in the nucleus, is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to show that treatment with doxycycline is not contributing to the suppression of ISGs. In our original submission, and also retained in our revised manuscript, we show in Figure 1 that doxycycline induction of iDUX4 suppresses ISGs, whereas doxycycline treatment of parental MB135 cells or MB135-iDUXB cells does not suppress ISGs. And in Figure 2 we show that doxycycline induction of the iDUX4 (L)LxxL(L) mutant (iDUX4-CTDmL1dL2 / iDUX4-mL1dL2) does not suppress ISG induction. Therefore, we interpret the reviewer’s concern as focused on the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of STAT1 in the immortalized cells and demonstrating the interaction of STAT1 and DUX4-CTD in other cells and/or primary cells.</p><p>Together with data from the original submission, we have also added data to the revised manuscript to show that the distribution of STAT1 in the immortalized MB135iDUX4 cells is similar to that in primary cells. As shown in the original submission, Figure 4—Figure Supplement 1A and B show low level cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution of STAT1 in the absence of IFNγ and enhanced overall STAT1 expression and nuclear accumulation in the presence of IFNγ. In the revision, we have added a Figure 4—Figure Supplement 1C to show that pSTAT1(Y701) is only detectable with IFNγ treatment and is nuclear; and we have added Figure 4—Figure Supplement 1D showing the distribution of total STAT1 in primary human fibroblasts, primary MB135 myoblasts, and immortalized MB135 myoblasts is similar to the distribution in the immortalized MB135iDUX4 myoblasts, which is also the same total STAT1 distribution described for different cell types in the Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org). Together, these data show that the distribution of STAT1 in the MB135iDUX4 cells is not abnormal but is similar to that in primary cells and other cell types.</p><p>To validate the DUX4 STAT1 interaction in a primary cell system not relying on doxycycline, we transduced primary human fibroblasts with lentiviral constructs constitutively expressing either 3XFLAG-DUX4-CTD or 3XFLAG-DUXB-CTD and performed a Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) with anti-FLAG and anti-STAT1 antibodies, as we had done to show the interaction of STAT1 with the DUX4-CTD in the MB135iDUX4 cells in the original submission (see Figure 4C). Figure 4—Figure Supplement 2 shows a significantly higher PLA signal in nuclei expressing the DUX4-CTD compared to no transgene or the DUXB-CTD transgene and validates the DUX4-STAT1 interaction in primary cells in the absence of doxycycline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Description of protein domains and mutants in Figure 2 is not clear. Please add a more detailed description of the different annotated domains and information on whether the NLS is the same as endogenous NLS and information on whether this NLS has been mapped functionally or by homology.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have described the protein domains, mutations, and NLS more clearly in the legend of Figure 1—Figure Supplement 1 and referred to this description in the legend of Figure 2. The DUX4 nls domains have not been well characterized and map, in part, to the homeodomains. Therefore we used two NLS domains: the SV40 nls and the eight amino-acid nls from the SMCHD1 protein, as now described in the Figure1—Figure Supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 1B, naming &quot;RIG-I&quot; is misleading, as not RIG-I is provided, but a ligand for RIG-I. Suggest renaming to &quot;3'ppp-dsRNA&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have edited both Figure 1B and the corresponding figure legend to reflect that our experiments were using the RIG-I ligand 5’ppp-dsRNA, not RIG-I itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. A lot of pressure lies on the data in Figure 6A, i.e. the physiological relevance statement made in line 387. While this is a beautiful experiment, the phenotype is very difficult to spot with the data provided and does not seem consistent across events marked with an arrow. Suggest quantification of the events with a higher number of cells and biological repeats to allow for statistical analysis and drive this conclusion home.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that some of the pressure of proving physiological relevance lies with Figure 6A (though we note that the Kitra-SRS cells, which have endogenous expression of a CIC-DUX4 fusion protein, also carry much of the weight of physiological relevance). We have moved these data to Figure 7A to make space for additional Kitra-SRS data in Figure 6, and we have quantified the microscopy images appropriately using Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) analysis to show the mutual-exclusivity of IDO1 and DUX4 signal. Through our MFI analysis, we show quantitatively that for all nuclei imaged DUX4-signal is significantly lower in nuclei expressing IDO1 (IDO1+), and IDO1-signal is significantly lower in nuclei of myotubes expressing DUX4 (DUX4+). This supports our earlier statement that DUX4-expressing myotubes do not activate ISGs, such as IDO1, as robustly as DUX4-negative myotubes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
