Insects have a hard exoskeleton that protects their segmented bodies, and adult insects and their young are also well protected from pathogens. To fight off infection by bacteria or viruses, these creatures release antimicrobial molecules in the fluid that bathes their internal organs. Insects can also mount a localized immune response that kills off invading microbes.</p><p>Most of what scientists have learned about the insect immune system has come from studying fruit flies. While much of the knowledge gained has been applicable to other insects, there is an important exception—fruit fly eggs are incredibly vulnerable to infection. Eggs from other insects are far better protected. In some species, the mother insect protects her eggs either through scrupulous care or by coating them with her own antimicrobial fluids. However, it was unclear if insect eggs could also defend themselves and counter an infection with a strong immune response.</p><p>To better understand the immune response in insect eggs, Jacobs et al. studied the eggs of red flour beetles. These beetles are common agricultural pests that eat stored grains and are often studied by scientists in the laboratory. The beetle eggs share a trait with all other insect eggs that is missing from fruit flies and some other flies; the beetle eggs have an extra layer—called the serosa—that envelops the yolk and the developing embryo.</p><p>To test whether this extra layer provides immune protection for the egg, Jacobs et al. used a technique called RNA interference to prevent the formation of the serosa. Beetle eggs either with or without a serosa were then pricked with a bacteria-covered object, and Jacobs et al. observed that the bacteria grew twice as fast in the eggs lacking a serosa compared with the eggs that had a serosa.</p><p>Next, Jacobs et al. examined gene expression in response to the infection in the eggs. Over 500 genes that are expressed after an infection were identified, and of these genes, 481 were only expressed in eggs with a serosa. Three of these genes, including two that encode antimicrobial molecules, were looked at in more detail, and found to be only expressed within the serosa, indicating that the serosa is the most likely source of the egg's immune response. Importantly, Jacobs et al. found that eggs with a serosa produce the same immune system response as adult insects and concluded that most insect eggs are far from defenseless and are capable of fending off infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04111.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04111.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic></kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>serosa</kwd><kwd>NF-kappaB</kwd><kwd>Toll</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VENI grant - 863.09.014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Zee</surname><given-names>Maurijn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Contrary to the current perception, insect eggs are very capable of defending themselves against pathogens.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To combat infection, insects rely on humoral and local immune responses. The humoral immune response is characterized by the massive secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph and is mainly exerted by the fat body. Epithelia and hemocytes play the main role in local immune defenses that comprise melanisation, local AMP production, phagocytosis, and encapsulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganesan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Engstrom, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrandon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ligoxygakis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms regulating these innate immune responses have largely been uncovered with the aid of genetic and molecular studies in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> When microbes invade the fly, their released peptidoglycans are sensed by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) and Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBPs) leading to the activation of the main immune signaling pathways. The meso-diaminopimelic acid-type (DAP-type) peptidoglycans of Gram-negative bacteria activate the IMD pathway, whereas the Lys-type peptidoglycans of Gram-positive bacteria activate the Toll pathway. The activation of the Toll pathway is mediated by a proteolytic cascade of serine proteases leading to the cleavage of the cytokine Spätzle, the ligand of the transmembrane receptor Toll. Activation of the immune signaling pathways leads to nuclear localization of the NF-kappaB factors Dorsal, Dif, or Relish that induce antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Other upregulated genes are prophenoloxidases (proPOs which mediate melanisation) and dual oxidase (DUOX which produces reactive oxygen species).</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> has been extremely helpful uncovering those mechanisms, but research in other insects, such as the mealworm beetle <italic>Tenebrio molitor</italic>, has also generated insightful results. The biochemical details of pathway activation, for instance, have mainly been unraveled using this beetle (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2010</xref> for review). With the availability of tools such as RNAseq and RNAi, more insect species are being established as model organism for innate immunity research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altincicek and Vilcinskas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waterhouse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerardo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnston and Rolff, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). In particular the red flour beetle (<italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>) has received much attention in innate immune studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altincicek et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Contreras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milutinović et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 2014</xref>). Comparative genome analysis has revealed that components of intracellular immune signaling pathways (Toll, IMD, and JAK/STAT) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are 1:1 conserved in <italic>Tribolium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou et al., 2007</xref>). The RNAi knockdown technology has shown that the IMD and Toll pathway are largely functionally conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yokoi et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2012b</xref>). Their activity does, however, not strictly depend on either Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yokoi et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2012b</xref>), but this distinction is also not completely black and white in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leulier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leone et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, species-specific family expansion and sequence divergence in the PGRP and AMP families indicate species-specific differences, possibly required for effective recognition and elimination of evolving pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christophides et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altincicek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Not only larvae and adults but also insect eggs are constantly threatened by pathogens (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum and Hilker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kellner, 2008</xref> for review). <italic>Serratia</italic> bacteria, for instance, have been found inside eggs of corn earworms and corn borers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lynch et al., 1976</xref>) and can infect eggs in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikorowski et al., 2001</xref>). We have also shown that <italic>Serratia</italic> infection leads to reduced egg survival in the burying beetle <italic>Nicrophorus vespilloides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>). Maternal investments have been proposed to counter microbial infections. Female medflies, for example, cover their eggs with antimicrobial secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marchini et al., 1997</xref>) and in the absence of maternal care, eggs of earwigs die of fungal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boos et al., 2014</xref>). Two studies focusing on transgenerational immune priming, however, have shown that the antimicrobial activity of eggs is of internal origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sadd and Schmid-Hempel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zanchi et al., 2012</xref>). This is often implicitly interpreted as maternal loading of antimicrobials into the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreau et al., 2012</xref>), but maternal transfer of bacteria to the eggs also leaves zygotic investment as possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Trauer and Hilker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freitak et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, it is ecologically relevant to gain a better understanding of the immune system in insect eggs.</p><p>The zygotic response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs, however, seems poor. It is not until late stage 15, (one of the latest stages in development when ectoderm and trachea have differentiated), that eggs show up to 25-fold upregulation of antimicrobial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). This is incomparable to the upregulation in adult flies that is at least an order of magnitude larger. Except for Cecropin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tingvall et al., 2001</xref>), stage 11 embryos do not show any induction of antimicrobial peptides and cannot contain an infection of non-pathogenic bacteria, leading to reduced survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). In strong contrast, we have shown that the eggs of <italic>Tribolium</italic> which were not even half way during development could upregulate several AMPs to levels comparable to the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</xref>). This upregulation depends on the serosa, an extraembryonic epithelium that envelopes yolk and embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</xref>). This membrane is present in all insects but was lost in a small group of higher Diptera (the Schizophora) to which <italic>Drosophila</italic> belongs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt-Ott, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rafiqi et al., 2008</xref>). Although two maternal extracellular coverings, the chorion and the vitelline membrane, envelop the insect egg, the serosa is the first cellular epithelium surrounding the egg at the interface between the microbe rich external milieu on the one side and the yolk and embryo at the other side. Thus, the serosa could function as an immune competent barrier epithelium. This has been suggested before, as the NF-kappaB factor Dorsal is highly expressed in the presumptive serosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). The absence of the serosa might account for the poor immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs.</p><p>To gain deeper insights into the role of the serosa, we chose <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, a beetle that possesses a serosa like all non-Schizophoran insects. In this beetle, we can prevent the development of the serosa by parental RNA interference with <italic>Tc-zerknüllt1</italic> (<italic>Tc-zen1)</italic>. This technique generates <italic>Tribolium</italic> eggs with an amnion at the dorsal side, but without a serosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>). At the relative humidity of the air of the laboratory, normal larvae hatch from these eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobs et al., 2013</xref>). As <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> is only expressed in the early serosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>) and is not expressed anymore by the time the experiments are performed (See discussion), we expect only to find effects that are a consequence of the absence of the serosa. We investigated the growth of bacteria in serosa-less and wild-type eggs, sequenced the whole transcriptome of naive and immune-challenged eggs with and without a serosal epithelium and confirmed constitutive and induced gene expression in the serosa by in situ hybridization. We conclude that the serosa is a frontier epithelium that provides immune competence to the insect egg.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacteria propagate twice as fast in serosa-less eggs</title><p>To examine the influence of the serosa on bacterial growth in infected eggs, and to standardize our infection method, we counted colony forming units (cfu's) directly after infection (t = 0) and 6 hr later (t = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We pricked 24–40hr old eggs (i.e. up to half-way during development) with a tungsten needle dipped in a concentrated mix of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> cultures (see ‘Materials and methods’). To determine cfu's, we shortly treated eggs with 0.5% hypochlorite to sterilize the outside.

Sterile injury did not increase this number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lower lines). In contrast, septic injury introduced on average 53 bacteria into wild-type eggs and 49 into serosa-less eggs. These numbers increased on average to 747 cfu's in wild-type eggs and to 7260 cfu's in serosa-less eggs.

id="s2-3"><title>The immune response is dependent on the extraembryonic serosa</title><p>To investigate the role of the serosa in the immune response, we compared the transcriptional response of wild-type and control eggs to the response of serosa-less eggs. Of all 538 genes differentially regulated upon bacterial challenge, 481 genes are only responsive in eggs with a serosa. The vast majority, 276 genes, are differentially regulated in both wild-type and control eggs but not in serosa-less eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the serosa-less <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi eggs, merely 57 genes are differentially regulated upon microbial challenge, despite our finding that RNAi rather increases the number of immune responsive genes. Of all 368 <italic>Tribolium</italic> genes that are annotated as immune genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altincicek et al., 2013</xref>), only nine were differentially regulated upon infection in serosa-less eggs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Except for <italic>serpin24</italic>, all of the other eight genes were also differentially regulated in response to sterile injury, indicating that they do not respond to infection but to wounding. Notably, none of the AMPs is induced upon infection in serosa-less eggs, neither <italic>proPO1</italic> nor the DUOX ortholog <italic>Hpx11</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Thus, the serosa is essential for the early immune response of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> egg.</p><p>These data corroborate our previous qPCR study showing that AMP and PGRP upregulation upon infection is abolished in serosa-less eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacobs and van der Zee, 2013</xref>). To see if we could also independently confirm serosa-dependent induction of some of our newly identified candidates, we performed qPCR on the transmembrane recognition protein of the IMD pathway <italic>PGRP-LC</italic>, the serine proteases <italic>cS-P8</italic>, <italic>SPH-H57</italic>, <italic>SPH-H70</italic>, the serine protease inhibitors <italic>serpin24</italic> and <italic>serpin26</italic>, the Toll receptor <italic>toll3</italic> and the novel potential AMPs <italic>TC004646</italic>, <italic>TC007763</italic>, <italic>TC007857</italic>, <italic>TC008806</italic>, and <italic>TC015479</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The fold-changes detected by qPCR after sterile and septic injury of wild-type eggs match the values found in the RNAseq data. The largest deviation was found for the potential AMP <italic>TC007858</italic> that is upregulated 156 times upon septic injury in our qPCRs but 484 times according to the RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

This response is entirely dependent on the serosa, an extraembryonic epithelium that envelops yolk and embryo. This immune competent frontier epithelium constitutively expresses some immune genes and can induce massive amounts of AMPs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have provided the first characterization of the complete transcriptional immune response in an insect egg. We identified 538 immune responsive genes in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> egg, of which 481 are only found in eggs with a serosal epithelium. The number of immune-responsive genes found in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> egg is comparable to the number found in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 2014</xref>) and higher than what was found in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altincicek et al., 2013</xref>), but this might be due to differences in sequence coverage. We cannot exclude that some expression differences we found might be due to somewhat delayed development after pricking the eggs. However, the GO-categories of the differentially regulated genes (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are mainly immune-related, suggesting that an effect of delayed development is negligible.</p><p>The induction of several genes from both the Toll and IMD pathway indicates that both pathways are utilized in the immune response of the <italic>Tribolium</italic> egg. It is striking that Toll signaling seems to be involved in innate immunity in the egg, because Toll signaling at this stage has only been associated with developmental functions until now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Toll1 has been described as the essential immune-related Toll receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leulier and Lemaitre, 2008</xref>). Other Tolls are not essential for the immune response, except for an antiviral function of Toll7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>toll3</italic> is significantly upregulated upon infection of the egg and not <italic>toll1</italic>. <italic>Toll3</italic> is also upregulated in infected adults and larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altincicek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a novel role for <italic>toll3</italic> in <italic>Tribolium</italic> innate immunity. It should be noted that Toll1-4 in <italic>Tribolium</italic> are all closely related to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll1 and more distantly to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nunes da Fonseca et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, sub-functionalization into developmental and immune-related functions might have occurred among the <italic>Tribolium</italic> Toll1-4 paralogs.</p><p>In <italic>Tribolium</italic>, only 19 AMPs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou et al., 2007</xref>). This is in strong contrast to another beetle species, <italic>Harmonia axyridis</italic>, in which more than 50 putative AMPs have been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vilcinskas et al., 2013</xref>). We were able to identify 20 new potential AMPs based on the antimicrobial properties of known AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bulet and Stöcklin, 2005</xref>). Additional AMPs might still be discovered<italic>,</italic> as we have not investigated peptides longer than 200 amino acids. Some of these long peptides, for instance the Thaumatins, are known to have antimicrobial properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altincicek et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2013</xref>). We might also have missed AMPs because some might be specifically expressed at other stages, for instance in larvae or adults. Although activity assays against bacteria and fungi are needed to verify antimicrobial properties, the discovery of 20 new potential AMPs shows the power of our experimental strategy for getting an unbiased understanding of insect immunity.</p><p>The most important conclusion of our study is that the immune response in <italic>Tribolium</italic> eggs depends on the extraembryonic serosa. To delete the serosa, we used parental <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>). Formally, it is possible that the lack of the immune response we reported is not caused by the absence of the serosa but by a more direct effect of <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi, for instance if the transcription factor Zen would directly regulate immune genes in the embryo. This is highly unlikely, as <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> is only expressed in the early serosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Zee et al., 2005</xref>) and is not expressed anymore by the time we performed infection. Indeed, we found only three RNAseq reads that map to <italic>Tc-zen1</italic>, confirming that <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> is practically not expressed at the time we performed experiments. Thus, we are confident to conclude that the lack of the full-range immune response after <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi is exclusively due to the absence of the serosa.</p><p>Eggs with a serosa express crucial bacterial recognition genes, such as <italic>PGRP-LA</italic>, and many extracellular signaling components, such as serine proteases, at higher levels than serosa-less eggs, indicating constitutive expression in the serosa. It could be that these components activate receptors elsewhere in the egg, for instance the <italic>toll3</italic> receptor that is more ubiquitously expressed. However, our in situ hybridizations unambiguously demonstrate that it is the serosal epithelium itself that expresses AMPs upon infection, indicating that it is the serosal epithelium itself that harbors the functional immune response reducing bacterial propagation in infected eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, bacterial infection of <italic>Tribolium</italic> eggs induces genes involved in melanisation, the acute-phase oxidative response, and AMP production and differentially regulates many other immune genes. This response is completely abolished in eggs without a serosa, the extraembryonic epithelium that envelopes yolk and embryo at the interface with the microbe-rich external milieu. Barrier epithelia like the midgut have recently been highlighted as key players in the local immune defenses in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Engstrom, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrandon, 2013</xref>). We conclude that the serosa is a frontier epithelium that provides the insect egg with a full-range immune response.</p><p>Interestingly, the separation of the serosal cells from the germ rudiment is the first morphological distinction that can be made in the blastoderm of the developing egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Handel et al., 2000</xref>). The serosal cells will have enveloped the complete embryo before the ectoderm starts to differentiate. These serosal cells can provide the insect egg with an innate immune response long before the embryonic ectoderm or trachea is immune responsive. In addition, the polyploid nuclei allow the serosal cells to quickly synthesize large amounts of proteins providing protection for the vulnerable developing embryo. Thus, the serosa is well suited to provide early immune protection to the egg. <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs do not develop a serosa, as this extraembryonic membrane was lost in the Schizophoran flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt-Ott, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rafiqi et al., 2008</xref>). A trade-off with developmental speed might have driven the loss of the serosa in these flies living on ephemeral food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobs et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest that the absence of the serosa in the Schizophora accounts for the poor immune response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs. Since all other insects possess a serosa, we propose that early immune competence is a general property of insect eggs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> eggs can mount a full-range innate immune response involving antimicrobial peptides, melanisation, and the production of reactive oxygen species.

For t = 0, 25 µl of this suspension was directly plated on LB agar plates; for t = 6 these 100 microliters were either diluted 50 times in 50 µl water (for wild-type eggs) or 500 times in 50 µl water (for <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi eggs).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors should try to address the comments below as much as they can. Much of it can be addressed by revisions of the text. The broad significance of the results should be better explained to make the study more appealing to a broad audience. The main concern of the reviewers was that the study was largely descriptive. However, the reviewers recognize the fact that initial description is necessarily descriptive but can still enable future mechanistic and biological analyses.</p><p>The authors argue that the serosa is an important immune organ in a beetle and back this up with some evidence showing that deletions of the serosa changes bacterial growth and the transcriptional response and they do this using RNAseq. They go further and use in situ hybridization to show that some potentially antimicrobial transcripts are made in this tissue.</p><p>The result that the serosa is important for the transcriptional response to an infection in this beetle has been published already by these same authors (Jacobs and Van der Zee 2013), although the past work used QRTPCR and not RNAseq. This manuscript is stronger than the past one because this includes some work on microbe growth but that doesn't seem like enough. What is the message in this manuscript that makes it important to be published in a broad biology journal that is aiming for a high impact? Tell me why I should care about the immune response in beetle eggs. I want the authors to tell me the biological stories that make this important.</p><p>I thought that the analysis of bacterial growth was poor and quantitation was poor in general. It is hard to write a story about gene induction if you don't have anything more to go on for function than annotation. The result here is better than many but it doesn't have a lot of information that couldn't be gathered simply from a table.</p><p>Specific comments are below:</p><p>“Epithelia and hemocytes play the main role in local immune defenses that comprise melanization, local AMP production and encapsulation”. This is true but it is like saying that T cells play the main role in T cell responses. The authors have highlighted the processes that are driven by these tissues. My point is that it doesn't seem necessary to push epithelia this hard.</p><p>“When microbes enter the fly, they are bound by recognition proteins...” Is this how it works? Is there evidence that it is the actual microbes that are bound or is it the free peptidoglycans released from dividing bacteria that induce the immune response? I thought it was the latter.</p><p>There is more to an immune response than up-regulation; there is considerable down regulation upon immune activation and it would be good to mention these things as well.</p><p>When discussing what various insects and model organisms have taught us it might be useful to point out the purpose of the studies. Drosophila has been a useful immunological tool because it provoked those working on vertebrate immunity to work on Toll. It has also been useful in scaffolding other insect immune systems and I think that people understand that these various immune systems differ some from each other. What is the purpose of studying the beetle? What has the beetle taught us that is of interest to those that work on beetles, other insects and immunology in general? To get published in a broad biological journal, it is important to have a broad message.</p><p>Thanks for mentioning that there are not black and white rules for Gram positive versus Gram negative signaling in Drosophila. It might be useful to just discuss this in terms of elicitors, which is what the host reacts to instead of mentioning the Gram status at all. Why should we expect that a 19th century description of microbiology would be useful in distinguishing signaling mechanisms in the 21st century?</p><p>Regarding the activity of the immune response in eggs, there is some recent work from Will Wood's lab that could be cited about the maturation of the immune response in relation to ecdysone signaling.</p><p>What is the evidence that “eggs are constantly threatened by pathogens”? When I worked as a developmental biologist I was frustrated with the difficulty of getting anything into a Drosophila egg. Entry isn't easy. Maybe the fly has adopted an alternative response to infection by making impermeable eggs. Why invest in an inducible immune response if you don't need it? I ask because we are often get the argument that insects need a strong immune response because they live in such a dirty environment and the argument makes little sense in light of our developing understanding of our own microbiota. We are filled with microbes and mostly this is good for us. I fear that immunologists often confuse microbes with pathogens.</p><p>The lack of attention for immunity in the egg might be explained by the response in Drosophila eggs but it could also be due to a lack of a strong biological question. If it was clear that there were diseases that people cared about that were transmitted through the egg this would drive more research.</p><p>“Eggs of this main model organism hardly upregulate AMPS...” Please be quantitative. There is a serious problem in this field where workers substitute relativistic adjectives for quantitation. “Hardly upregulate” is a relative term that reflects more what the authors’ thoughts on the result than what the fly thought of the result. Did the upregulated AMPS do what they were supposed to do? Did they clear bacteria? If they did then the fly is being efficient. Alas, microbe loads and changes in microbe loads were not measured in that paper. There is another problem: often people report immune inductions without reporting the amount of elicitor injected into the host. Immune induction only makes sense when considered as a response to microbes. In the cited paper, the microbe loads weren't measured for the injections and no comparison was made between the amount of bacteria injected into the eggs of the two insects. Eggs from different species have different properties; how can you be sure that the eggs are getting the same amount of material when you are just stabbing them with a dirty needle? I wouldn't be willing to conclude that the cited paper shows a quantitative difference in gene expression.</p><p>“…and this absence might account for the poor immune response in Drosophila eggs” I won't win this, but I would love it if immunity wasn't just used as a word to describe the simple transcriptional response of a host but rather it was used to functionally describe the response of the host and then, of course, to look at the effects on the fitness of the host. Do fly eggs kill injected bacteria? That is the real measure of the immune response and not whether some arbitrary marker that hasn't been tested for its antimicrobial activity on the injected microbe is modulated.</p><p>Did the flies in this experiment carry Wolbachia? I ask because the authors state that the eggs did not contain many bacteria but they assayed this by culture methods designed to look at enteric human pathogens and not Drosophila native microbiota. Fly eggs are often decorated with a little drop of feces that is full of Lactobacilli and Acetobacter. These won't show up easily on LB plates grown at 37C. I don't know what the native microbiota is for these beetles or whether the beetles use this egg-pooping trick but it makes me wonder.</p><p>I am pleased that the authors are finally including some microbe counts in their experiments. I wish that they would use microbes other than <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>M. luteus</italic>. Why were these chosen? What biological relevance do they have? One of the reasons to switch to other insects is to use their natural history to ask interesting experiments. It seems sad to repeat the mistakes that were made when testing the immune response of Drosophila.</p><p>“These numbers increased to 747 +/- cfu's.” I don't understand this - +/- what? This is usually followed by a variance. I would be much more comfortable with the growth dynamics if the authors would use more than one timepoint. Presumably these bacteria are growing exponentially in the beginning and the authors have looked at less than one doubling. The formula used for bacteria growth is for exponential growth but the authors have only shown a single timepoint and thus can't tell us anything about the shape of the curve. Wouldn't a logistic function be a better idea? The bacteria presumably aren't going to grow forever and will hit a ceiling. True, the beginning of the growth curve will be exponential but if the authors haven't provided the growth curve, how do we know that they are at the beginning? It could be that these two types of flies simply have different maximum loads of bacteria and the bacteria have already reached their maxima. The authors are making a lot of unsubstantiated assumptions about bacterial growth here and it would be easy to solidify this work.</p><p>The authors treat the parents with RNAi and knock down a tissue. Is there a control for the effects of an RNAi response on the eggs where tc-zen1 is not knocked down? I ask because I'm worried about the following artifact – RNAi induces an immune response in insects. The authors show that the RNAi induction has an impact on the transcriptional profile of the eggs yet they didn't follow this up with controls. Immune responses have costs. The cost could be that the mother does not endow the egg with the same supplies because the mother is busy fighting a perceived infection. Thus eggs from RNAi treated mothers might have poor immune responses that are poor regardless of what gene was knocked down. I'm making this up but it is plausible – things like this do happen and it is a simple control. Without this control the authors conclude that their knockdown is responsible for the phenotype when it could be that any knockdown produces this phenotype.</p><p>One can determine based on the sequence whether a PGRP is likely to be enzymatically active. Which of the Tribolium PGRPs fall into this group? If the authors want to suggest that the expressed PGRPs are effectors, they should do this preliminary legwork.</p><p>“We also found induction of PGRP-LB but this was not significant” Then they didn't find induction of PGRP-LB. They should not report insignificant results.</p><p>How do the authors propose that the immune response is turned on? Is it a switch and a mere whiff of bacteria turns on the response or is it dose responsive? If dose responsive, is it linear or does it have some other shape. I ask because the authors did not report microbe loads for their immune inductions and we expect them to be different. The results they see could be even larger than they reported as there are 10x more bacteria in the knockdown eggs and low gene expression, therefore the ratio of gene expression to dose is 10x larger than the effects they see without including microbe load.</p><p>“We chose the receptor Toll3” Is this an immune signaling Toll? Drosophila has many Tolls and it isn't clear whether more than 2 or 3 have immune functions. Some that had been written off as being non-immune have immune functions but we really don't know. It is risky to make assumptions about a gene without a functional test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04111.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors should try to address the comments below as much as they can.

The reviews we already cite treat a very extensive body of evidence for infections in insect eggs and their antibacterial activity. In our revised manuscript, we now cite 6 extra primary research papers with concrete examples. Furthermore, we make clearer that, until now, immuno-ecologists have been thinking in terms of maternal investments in antimicrobial activity of eggs. Our paper could shift this paradigm towards attention for the zygotic investment. Furthermore we stress the importance of choosing a model organism that possesses a serosa if one wants to study the immune response in an egg. Drosophila is not representative for insects in this respect.</p><p><italic>I thought that the analysis of bacterial growth was poor and quantitation was poor in general.

As described in its figure legend, we indicate repressed genes in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> has separate columns for down regulated genes.

Maybe the fly has adopted an alternative response to infection by making impermeable eggs. Why invest in an inducible immune response if you don't need it? I ask because we are often get the argument that insects need a strong immune response because they live in such a dirty environment and the argument makes little sense in light of our developing understanding of our own microbiota. We are filled with microbes and mostly this is good for us. I fear that immunologists often confuse microbes with pathogens</italic>.</p><p>Besides the two excellent and extensive reviews we cite, we now cite extra papers that show the deleterious effect of infections in eggs, for instance by pathogenic fungi or <italic>Serratia</italic> bacteria that are able to penetrate eggs.</p><p><italic>The lack of attention for immunity in the egg might be explained by the response in Drosophila eggs but it could also be due to a lack of a strong biological question. If it was clear that there were diseases that people cared about that were transmitted through the egg this would drive more research</italic>.</p><p>We removed this sentence in our revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>“Eggs of this main model organism hardly upregulate AMPS...” Please be quantitative. There is a serious problem in this field where workers substitute relativistic adjectives for quantitation. “Hardly upregulate” is a relative term that reflects more what the authors’ thoughts on the result than what the fly thought of the result. Did the upregulated AMPS do what they were supposed to do? Did they clear bacteria? If they did then the fly is being efficient. Alas, microbe loads and changes in microbe loads were not measured in that paper</italic>.</p><p>We now mention the exact fold upregulation in fly eggs and adults. Furthermore, we cite an excellent paper from the Wood laboratory nicely showing that stage 11 <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos cannot contain an infection of non-pathogenic bacteria leading to reduced survival.</p><p><italic>There is another problem: often people report immune inductions without reporting the amount of elicitor injected into the host. Immune induction only makes sense when considered as a response to microbes. In the cited paper, the microbe loads weren't measured for the injections and no comparison was made between the amount of bacteria injected into the eggs of the two insects. Eggs from different species have different properties; how can you be sure that the eggs are getting the same amount of material when you are just stabbing them with a dirty needle? I wouldn't be willing to conclude that the cited paper shows a quantitative difference in gene expression</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, we can’t be sure that we introduced the same number of bacteria in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium</italic> in our previous paper. In this manuscript, we show that we introduce around 50 bacteria into the eggs of <italic>Tribolium</italic>. To the same “stabbing with a dirty needle”-approach, <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs do not respond. OK, as this reviewer criticizes: we could have introduced fewer bacteria. However, the Woods laboratory has published an experiment in stage 11 <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs introducing a number of bacteria in the order of magnitude of 10<sup>3</sup>. Still, there was no transcriptional response of AMPs. Thus, I think we can confidently conclude that the response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is poor.</p><p><italic>“…and this absence might account for the poor immune response in Drosophila eggs” I won't win this, but I would love it if immunity wasn't just used as a word to describe the simple transcriptional response of a host but rather it was used to functionally describe the response of the host and then, of course, to look at the effects on the fitness of the host. Do fly eggs kill injected bacteria? That is the real measure of the immune response and not whether some arbitrary marker that hasn't been tested for its antimicrobial activity on the injected microbe is modulated</italic>.</p><p>No, the Will Wood laboratory has shown that stage 11 <italic>Drosophila</italic> eggs cannot contain an infection and die of even non-pathogenic bacteria. We cite this paper in our revised version.</p><p><italic>Did the flies in this experiment carry Wolbachia? I ask because the authors state that the eggs did not contain many bacteria but they assayed this by culture methods designed to look at enteric human pathogens and not Drosophila native microbiota. Fly eggs are often decorated with a little drop of feces that is full of Lactobacilli and Acetobacter. These won't show up easily on LB plates grown at 37C. I don't know what the native microbiota is for these beetles or whether the beetles use this egg-pooping trick but it makes me wonder</italic>.</p><p>No, remarkably, <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> does not carry <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Chang and Wade, 1996). But we agree with the reviewer. In the revised version we now explicitly write: “...did hardly contain bacteria that grow on LB agar plates”.</p><p><italic>I am pleased that the authors are finally including some microbe counts in their experiments. I wish that they would use microbes other than E.coli and M. luteus. Why were these chosen? What biological relevance do they have? One of the reasons to switch to other insects is to use their natural history to ask interesting experiments. It seems sad to repeat the mistakes that were made when testing the immune response of Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>These bacteria were obtained from the laboratory of Dominique Ferrandon in Strasbourg. These bacteria have traditionally been used for studying the immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. An extensive body of work has been done using these bacteria. We understand that this might be a “mistake” in some sense, but we set out to compare the immune response in <italic>Tribolium</italic> to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We think that using the exact same strains is required to compare the responses. We added this to the Materials and methods in the revised version.</p><p><italic>“These numbers increased to 747 +/- cfu's.” I don't understand this - +/- what? This is usually followed by a variance. I would be much more comfortable with the growth dynamics if the authors would use more than one timepoint. Presumably these bacteria are growing exponentially in the beginning and the authors have looked at less than one doubling. The formula used for bacteria growth is for exponential growth but the authors have only shown a single timepoint and thus can't tell us anything about the shape of the curve. Wouldn't a logistic function be a better idea? The bacteria presumably aren't going to grow forever and will hit a ceiling. True, the beginning of the growth curve will be exponential but if the authors haven't provided the growth curve, how do we know that they are at the beginning? It could be that these two types of flies simply have different maximum loads of bacteria and the bacteria have already reached their maxima. The authors are making a lot of unsubstantiated assumptions about bacterial growth here and it would be easy to solidify this work</italic>.</p><p>Although the error bars are indicated in the graph, we erroneously omitted the exact numbers from the text. We added these numbers to the figure legend in the revised version. Indeed, from the presented data no conclusions can be drawn on the shape of the curve. However, we have data on the bacterial load after 24 hours. This is on average 32,975. We left these data out of the manuscript for the exact concern this reviewer raises: at that point the bacteria might have hit a ceiling. But it makes us confident that after 6h, bacteria are still in their exponential phase. We have added this line of reasoning to the materials and methods. A little bit of calculation supports this assumption: in <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> RNAi eggs, the bacterial load increases from 49 to 7260 in 6 hours. This requires more than 7 divisions. That means slightly more than one division per hour. This is actually close to what bacteria can reach in LB medium, and likely is exponential.</p><p><italic>The authors treat the parents with RNAi and knock down a tissue. Is there a control for the effects of an RNAi response on the eggs where tc-zen1 is not knocked down? I ask because I'm worried about the following artifact – RNAi induces an immune response in insects. The authors show that the RNAi induction has an impact on the transcriptional profile of the eggs yet they didn't follow this up with controls. Immune responses have costs. The cost could be that the mother does not endow the egg with the same supplies because the mother is busy fighting a perceived infection. Thus eggs from RNAi treated mothers might have poor immune responses that are poor regardless of what gene was knocked down. I'm making this up but it is plausible – things like this do happen and it is a simple control. Without this control the authors conclude that their knockdown is responsible for the phenotype when it could be that any knockdown produces this phenotype</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we included a control RNAi. It is also clearly indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> outlining the experimental set-up. We even discuss this issue in the originally submitted manuscript, explaining that the effect of RNAi alone leads to a larger number of differentially regulated genes after infection. Yet, knockdown of <italic>Tc-zen1</italic> using RNAi leads to a dramatic reduction of differentially regulated genes. This makes us confident to conclude that it is this specific knockdown of this gene that causes the phenotype and not any knockdown.</p><p>In the main text of the revised version, we now explicitly mention that this control RNAi uses a 500 bp vector sequence without target in the <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> genome. We added the details to the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>One can determine based on the sequence whether a PGRP is likely to be enzymatically active. Which of the Tribolium PGRPs fall into this group? If the authors want to suggest that the expressed PGRPs are effectors, they should do this preliminary legwork</italic>.</p><p>PGRP-SB possesses all the characteristic residues for catalytic PGRPs: His 42, Tyr78, His152, Thr158 and Cys160. We added this to the main text. PGRP-SA does not have the Zinc-binding His152 and Cys160.</p><p><italic>“We also found induction of PGRP-LB but this was not significant” Then they didn't find induction of PGRP-LB. They should not report insignificant results</italic>.</p><p>In our revised version, we have deleted this sentence.</p><p><italic>How do the authors propose that the immune response is turned on? Is it a switch and a mere whiff of bacteria turns on the response or is it dose responsive? If dose responsive, is it linear or does it have some other shape. I ask because the authors did not report microbe loads for their immune inductions and we expect them to be different. The results they see could be even larger than they reported as there are 10x more bacteria in the knockdown eggs and low gene expression, therefore the ratio of gene expression to dose is 10x larger than the effects they see without including microbe load</italic>.</p><p>I don’t see completely what this reviewer is aiming at. We are pleased that this reviewer thinks that the effect of the serosa could be even larger, but in our eyes complex corrections for bacterial loads are speculative and we prefer sticking to our conservative and clear conclusions.</p><p><italic>“We chose the receptor Toll3” Is this an immune signaling Toll? Drosophila has many Tolls and it isn't clear whether more than 2 or 3 have immune functions. Some that had been written off as being non-immune have immune functions but we really don't know. It is risky to make assumptions about a gene without a functional test</italic>.</p><p>We chose Toll3 because it was the only Toll receptor that showed a higher expression in eggs with a serosa. This is mentioned 4 lines before in the manuscript. We do not know its function. Our RNAseq paper identifies lots of genes for further research; it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate them all functionally. We only speculate that Toll3 might have an immune function, as it is also upregulated in response to infection. This was independently found in larvae and adults by other groups.</p></body></sub-article></article>
