id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiovascular disease in general population and is frequently associated with the development of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). There is no effective strategy to intervene with TAA progression due to an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis. Insufficiency of NOTCH1 expression is highly related to BAV-TAA, but the underlying mechanism remains to be clarified.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A comparative proteomics analysis was used to explore the biological differences between non-diseased and BAV-TAA aortic tissues. A microfluidics-based aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model was constructed to evaluate the effect of NOTCH1 deficiency on contractile phenotype and mitochondrial dynamics of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs).</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Protein analyses of human aortic tissues showed the insufficient expression of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondrial dynamics in BAV-TAA. HAoSMCs with NOTCH1-knockdown exhibited reduced contractile phenotype and were accompanied by attenuated mitochondrial fusion. Furthermore, we identified that mitochondrial fusion activators (leflunomide and teriflunomide) or mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi-1) partially rescued the disorders of mitochondrial dynamics in HAoSMCs derived from BAV-TAA patients.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model simulates the human pathophysiological parameters of aorta biomechanics and provides a platform for molecular mechanism studies of aortic disease and related drug screening. This aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model and human tissue proteomic analysis revealed that impaired mitochondrial dynamics could be a potential therapeutic target for BAV-TAA.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>National Key R and D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project, Shanghai Science and Technology Commission, and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>To function properly, the heart must remain a one-way system, pumping out oxygenated blood into the aorta â the largest artery in the body â so it can be distributed across the organism. The aortic valve, which sits at the entrance of the aorta, is a key component of this system. Its three flaps (or âcuspsâ) are pushed open when the blood exits the heart, and they shut tightly so it does not flow back in the incorrect direction.</p><p>Nearly 1.4% of people around the world are born with âbicuspidâ aortic valves that only have two flaps. These valves may harden or become leaky, forcing the heart to work harder. This defect is also associated with bulges on the aorta which progressively weaken the artery, sometimes causing it to rupture.</p><p>Open-heart surgery is currently the only way to treat these bulges (or âaneurysmsâ), as no drug exists that could slow down disease progression. This is partly because the biological processes involved in the aneurysms worsening and bursting open is unclear.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted that many individuals with bicuspid aortic valves also have lower levels of a protein known as NOTCH1, which plays a key signalling role for cells. Problems in the mitochondria â the structures that power up a cell â are also observed. However, it is not known how these findings are connected or linked with the aneurysms developing.</p><p>To answer this question, Abudupataer et al. analyzed the proteins present in diseased and healthy aortic muscle cells, confirming a lower production of NOTCH1 and impaired mitochondria in diseased tissues. They also created an âaorta-on-a-chipâ model where aortic muscle cells were grown in the laboratory under conditions resembling those found in the body â including the rhythmic strain that the aorta is under because of the heart beating. Abudupataer et al. then reduced NOTCH1 levels in healthy samples, which made the muscle tissue less able to contract and reduced the activity of the mitochondria. Applying drugs that tweak mitochondrial activity helped tissues from patients with bicuspid aortic valves to work better.</p><p>These compounds could potentially benefit individuals with deficient aortic valves, but experiments in animals and clinical trials would be needed first to confirm the results and assess safety. The aorta-on-a-chip model developed by Abudupataer et al. also provides a platform to screen for drugs and examine the molecular mechanisms at play in aortic diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organ-on-a-chip</kwd><kwd>thoracic aortic aneurysm</kwd><kwd>bicuspid aortic valve</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial dynamics</kwd><kwd>human aortic</kwd><kwd>smooth muscle cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1005002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82070482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81772007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21734003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Weijia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51927805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model indicated that NOTCH1 insufficiency in HAoSMCs induced phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype accompanied by an impairment of mitochondrial fusion, implying its potential role as a therapeutic target for BAV-TAA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality and is found in nearly 1.4% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Michelena et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verma and Siu, 2014</xref>). BAV arises from incomplete separation or fusion of the aortic valve cusps and is associated with an approximately 40% risk of developing thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA), namely, bicuspid aortopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verma and Siu, 2014</xref>). BAV-TAA poses a severe health threat to a large population because progressive aneurysmal dilation can potentially develop into lethal dissection or rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldfinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Olsson et al., 2006</xref>). The current clinical management mainly relies on prophylactic surgical repair of the notably dilated aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coady et al., 2010</xref>). At present, the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms of BAV-TAA is incomplete, which leads to the absence of effective pharmaceutical therapy to alleviate aortopathy progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindeman and Matsumura, 2019</xref>). Multiple factors, such as genetics and hemodynamics, are involved in the etiologies of BAV-TAA. In particular, genetic factors are considered to play a pivotal role in the disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isselbacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prakash et al., 2014</xref>). NOTCH1 insufficiency has been observed in the population with BAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balistreri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malashicheva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sciacca et al., 2013</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism through which insufficient NOTCH1 induces aortopathy remains to be explored.</p><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction has been closely linked to a variety of cardiovascular disorders, such as heart failure and atherosclerosis. Recent studies found that mitochondrial dysfunction was also related to the development of arterial aneurysm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van der Pluijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oller et al., 2021</xref>). A single-cell transcriptome analysis on aneurysmal human aortic tissue suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction and increased chromatin oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were found in TAA tissues and insufficient ATP production might not be sufficient for the contractile activities of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly, mitochondrial fission and fusion are dynamically balanced to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and functions; and a shift toward fission event is one of the main causes of mitochondrial dysfunction. In a mice model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), impaired mitochondrial dynamics was found to play salient roles in disease development, and could be attenuated by the mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>). However, these studies focused on the analysis of abdominal aortic aneurysms and genetic TAA with FBN1 or Fubulin-4 mutation. It has been reported that there was close interaction between NOTCH1 signaling and homeostatic mitochondrial dynamics in the differentiation of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasahara et al., 2013</xref>) and the survival of breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the relationship between NOTCH1 signaling pathway and mitochondrial dynamics in BAV-TAA needs to be clarified.</p><p>The traditional TAA animal models are frequently applied for the pathogenesis research and pharmaceutical therapy, however, not suitable for studying BAV-TAA. Although Koenig et al. generated NOTCH1-haploinsufficient mice in a preliminary 129S6 background that exhibited aortic root dilation, these mice did not show BAV characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koenig et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, these models may not provide sufficient information of pathogenesis and drug response of BAV-TAA. Owing to the bioengineering advance, microfluidic-based organ-on-chip models have been widely developed to replicates human tissue microenvironment for toxicity analysis, drug screening and disease modeling and thus promotes pharmaceutical translation from preclinical studies to clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thacker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hofemeier et al., 2021</xref>). It provides an opportunity to use a novel platform to study BAV-TAA on a susceptible human genetic background and may fill the gap between animal and human medicine. Here, we engineered an in vitro aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model of primary HAoSMCs that emulates the biomechanics of the human aortic wall. We characterized the association between mitochondrial dynamics and NOTCH1 deficiency in BAV-TAA on this platform. Our study provides the first demonstration previously undocumented role of impairment of mitochondrial fusion in bicuspid aortopathy, which may serve as a potential pharmacological target for preventing disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NOTCH1</td><td>NCBI</td><td>ID: 4851</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Human aortic smooth muscle cell line</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL1999, Lot Number: 70019189, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_4009">CVCL_4009</ext-link></td><td>Female, 11 months old, Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells</td><td>ATCC</td><td>PCS100012</td><td>Male, 29 years old, African American</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from non-diseased and BAV-TAA patients (Asian).</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (human)</td><td>NOTCH1 targeted shRNA</td><td>GeneChem <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shao et al., 2015</xref>).</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (human)</td><td>Ascending aorta</td><td>Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University</td><td/><td>Ascending aortic tissues from non-diseased and BAV-TAA patients.</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-DRP1 (D6C7)Â (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat #

The size of the three layers were 100 mm Ã 40 mm Ã 6 mm. The top and bottom layers had microchannels with dimensions of 70 mm Ã 6 mm Ã 4 mm, and the middle layer contained a microchannel with dimensions of 70 mm Ã 6 mm Ã 6 mm. Molds of the three layers were custom-made using a high-precision computer numerical control (CNC) engraving machine (Jingyan Technology). The frame of the molds and the microchannels were carved out of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) plates, which were then glued on another PMMA plate. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) was polymerized in defined casts at a weight ratio of base to curing agent of 10:1. The mixed PDMS was poured into the molds and underwent cross-linking at 70Â°C for 2 hr. Commercialized PDMS membranes were purchased from Hangzhou Bald Advanced Materials. Detailed parameters of the commercialized PDMS membrane were provided as follows:Â thickness of 200 Â± 2 Î¼m, shore A hardness of 50, Yang's elastic modulus of 1.7 MPa, tensile strength of 4 MPa, tear strength of 7 KN/m and light transmittance of 93%. The Young's modulus values were obtained by the following experiments. The tensile stressâstrain responses was measured using a tensile testing machine (Instron). Prior to the measurement, the PDMS membrane was cut into a piece of 3 cm length and 3 mm width membrane. The membrane was fixed to the testing machine with a fixture. The sample was automatically stretched in a gradient within the proportional limit. The Young's modulus of the PDMS membrane was calculated by the slope value of the tensile stressâstrain curve. Subsequently, the three PDMS layers were peeled off the molds. The bottom layer of the PDMS slab was bonded with one PDMS membrane after oxygen plasma treatment (Harrick Plasma), and the top PDMS layer was bonded to another PDMS membrane in a similar manner. The middle PDMS layer was then sandwiched between the top and bottom membranes; this step was performed under a microscope to guarantee that the upper and lower microchannels fully overlapped with the middle microchannel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mechanical stimulation</title><p>The cells were stretched by applying different percentages of rhythmic strain to the PDMS membranes for 24 hr. The vacuum pump was connected to a water-oil separator, which dried the gas to protect the downstream vacuum regulator and solenoid valve. The inlet of the vacuum pumps was then connected to the computer-controlled solenoid system by applying rhythmic stretching at a frequency of 1 Hz and then connected to the gas channel of the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model. The regulator was used to control the vacuum magnitude. The solenoid valve was a voltage-dependent on/off valve used to control the stretching frequency of the PDMS membrane. When the supply voltage was greater than 24 V, the gas in the channel was pumped out, which stretched the PDMS membrane. Otherwise, the gas channel was connected to the atmosphere, and the membrane deformation recovered. The on/off frequency of the solenoid valve was controlled by a microcontroller unit (MCU). Thus, the stretching frequency could be controlled by changing the preset program of the MCU, and the stretching amplitude could be controlled by adjusting the vacuum regulator manually. We used two pressure ranges, 10 kPa (7.18 Â± 0.44%, low strain) and 15 kPa (17.28 Â± 0.91%, high strain), throughout the experiments. As the control, cells were cultured in aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip models under static conditions. After 24 hr of rhythmic strain, samples were collected for immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, western blotting and mitochondrial membrane dynamics analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Human aortic sample collection</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before participation.

Echocardiography was used to characterize aortic valve morphology and ascending aortic diameter prior to surgery. The tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80Â°C. Six aortic tissues were obtained from patients with a tricuspid aortic valve but without aortic dilation (non-diseased; mean age: 62.2 years; range: 51â74 years; four males), and another six samples were obtained from patients with BAV-related thoracic aortic aneurysm (BAV-TAA; mean age: 59.3 years; range: 43â72 years; four males).

The ascending aortic tissues were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The intima and adventitia layers of the tissues were removed, and the media layer was preserved for the harvesting of p-HASMCs. Subsequently, the media layer was cut into small pieces (2â3 mm in length) and cultured in high-glucose Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM, Gibco) with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (p/s, Gibco) for 2â3 weeks at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. After approximately 10â12 days, the p-HASMCs started to migrate out of the tissue pieces. When the cells reached approximately 80% confluency, first-passaged cells were rinsed with PBS, digested using 0.25% trypsin (Gibco), and replated in smooth muscle cell culture medium (SMCM, ScienCell). The cells were characterized through an immunofluorescence analysis of four different specific markers of smooth muscle cells (CNN1, SM22, MYH11 and Î±-SMA).

Prior to cell seeding, the surface of the cell culture channel was coated with mouse collagen at a concentration of 80 Âµg/mL (Sigma) by incubating for 1 hr at room temperature and drying for 2 hr at 70Â°C. Afterward, the cell culture channel was washed with PBS, and cells were seeded on the PDMS membranes in a cell culture channel at a density of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. The cells were cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS in a cell culture channel.

Prior to cell treatment, fresh medium was used to obtain a concentration of 75 Î¼M for both drugs. After the cells were fully attached to the PDMS membrane in the cell culture channel, medium containing a mitochondrial fusion activator (leflunomide and teriflunomide) or mitochondrial fission inhibitor (Mdivi-1) was added to the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip models.

Ten micrograms of each protein sample were then separated by running on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and subsequently transferred to 0.2 Âµm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk (Beyotime) for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated with different primary antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) overnight at 4Â°C.

When the cells reached 30% confluency, the cells were divided into three groups: control (WT), negative control shRNA (NC) and NOTCH1 knockdown (NOTCH1-KD). The cells in the NC and NOTCH1-KD groups were infected with lentivirus-nonspecific shRNA and lentivirus-shRNA-NOTCH1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 according to the manufacturerâs recommended protocol (GeneChem). After 8â12 hr of infection, the virus particles were removed from the respective wells, and fresh SMCM was added. The cells were further cultured for 72 hr in a humidified incubator at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. To establish a stable cell line, the cells were treated with puromycin at a concentration of 2 Âµg/mL for 5 days.

The extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm and 4Â°C for 25 min, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. The protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) was performed for protein digestion. Before alkylation with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma) and 30 mM iodoacetamide (IAA, Sigma), the proteins were loaded in 10 kDa centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore) and treated twice with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> (Sigma).

One hundred micrograms of peptides containing 0.1% TFA was loaded in high-pH reversed-phase fractionation spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). We obtained 10 flow-through fractions, and two fractions were combined to obtain one sample. The resulting five fractions were dried by vacuum centrifugation. The samples were resuspended in 30 Î¼L of solvent A (A: water with 0.1% formic acid; B: ACN with 0.1% formic acid), separated by nanoLC and analyzed by on-line electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The experiments were performed using a nanoAquity UPLC system (Waters Corporation) connected to a quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive HF) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an online nanoelectrospray ion source. Two microliters of peptide sample were loaded onto an analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 75 Î¼m x 25 cm) and subsequently separated with a linear gradient from 5% B to 30% B over 110 min. The column flow rate was maintained at 300 nL/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 45Â°C. An electrospray voltage of 2.2 kV versus the inlet of the mass spectrometer was used.</p><p>The Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode to switch automatically between MS and MS/MS acquisition. Survey full-scan MS spectra (m/z 350â1500) were acquired with a mass resolution of 60 K. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to 3000000 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Fifteen sequential high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans with a resolution of 15.0 K were acquired with the Orbitrap. The intensity threshold was 50,000, and the maximum injection time was 80 ms. The AGC target was set to 100,000, and the isolation window was 1.6 m/z. Ions with charge states of 2+, 3+, and 4+ were fragmented with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 30%. In all cases, one microscan was recorded using dynamic exclusion of 20 s. In the MS/MS, the fixed first mass was set to 110. Online peaks were used for the analysis of proteomic data. The precursor mass error tolerance was set to 10 ppm with a fragment mass error tolerance of 0.05 Da. In all software programs, carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification, and variable modifications of oxidation (M), acetylation (N-term) and deamidation (NQ) were included. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide and protein identifications was set to 1%. Total ion chromatography (TIC) was used for normalization.

The model was composed of three chambers: (i) a top vacuum chamber deforming the upper PDMS membrane; (ii) a middle chamber containing the culture medium to maintain cell growth on the PDMS membranes; and (iii) a bottom vacuum chamber deforming the lower PDMS membrane. HAoSMCs were cultured on the PDMS membranes in the middle cell culture chamber. The dimensions of the model are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1a</xref>. The measured Young's elastic modulus values of the commercialized PDMS membrane were 1.71 MPa within 25% tensile strain and 1.67 MPa within 500% tensile strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and it shows excellent homogeneity and tensile properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The rhythmic tensile strain was generated by connecting the top and bottom chambers to a vacuum pump that cyclically deformed the PDMS membrane. The rhythm and value of the dynamic negative pressure in the chambers were controlled by a set of apparatuses consisting of a monochip computer, a pressure regulator and a solenoid valve.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic design and strain characterization of the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of the in vitro chip model.

No significant difference in MFN1, MFN2, DRP1, and MFF protein expression was found between the WT and NC groups under static conditions, which suggested that the expression of these mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins was not affected by the lentivirus vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1dâe</xref>).

In addition, the three drugs all decreased DRP1 expression to different extents but did not affect MFF expression. The three drugs also increased SM22 and CNN1 expression to different extents, and the maximal expression of SM22 and CNN1 was obtained with leflunomide. In p-HAoSMCs isolated from patients in the non-diseased group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), the three drugs increased MFN1 expression, but no significant difference was found compared with the control group. Teriflunomide significantly increased MFN2 and DRP1 expression and significantly decreased MFF expression. Although the effects of these drugs on mitochondrial dynamics were not desirable, all three drugs increased the expression of SM22 and CNN1 to different extents. In p-HAoSMCs (ATCC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), none of the three drugs exerted an obvious effect on MFN1, MFN2, and DRP1 expression, and teriflunomide significantly decreased MFF expression. All three drugs increased the expression of SM22 and CNN1 to different extents.</p><p>To further evaluate the potential of these drugs for clinical use in the treatment of NOTCH1-insufficient patients with BAV-TAA, we isolated p-HAoSMCs from the aortic tissues of three individual patients with BAV-TAA. The clinical characteristics of three patients with BAV-TAA are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>. Significantly lower NOTCH1 protein expression was found in p-HAoSMCs from BAV-TAA aortic tissues compared with p-HAoSMCs from non-diseased aortic tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The three drugs exerted different effects on mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6eâg</xref>). All three drugs enhanced MFN2 expression to different extents, and maximal MFN2 expression was obtained with the treatment of teriflunomide. The three drugs increased MFN1 expression and decreased DRP1 expression to different extents in two lines of BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs, and the greatest decrease in DRP1 expression was obtained with teriflunomide. The three drugs decreased MFF expression to different extents in the two lines of BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs and exerted different effects on the expression of the contractile proteins SM22 and CNN1, and teriflunomide significantly increased SM22 expression in the two lines of BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs. All three drugs enhanced CNN1 expression to different extents, and Mdivi-1 or teriflunomide significantly increased CNN1 expression in one line of BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs.</p><p>Different individual cases exhibited unevenness in drug response. Racial differences may lead to different cellular response to experimental stimuli or to drug treatment. HAoSMCs used in this study were from different human races. One primary HAoSMC line (ATCC, CRL1999) was isolated from a Caucasian donor and another one (ATCC, PCS-100â012) was isolated from an African American donor. Other four primary HAoSMCs were isolated from East Asian patients. Differences in patientsâ clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, and aortic diameter, may also have an impact on the experiment results. BAV aortopathy exclusively involves proximal aorta, including aortic root, ascending aorta and aortic arch, but spares the descending aorta and abdominal aorta. The majority of VSMCs at the proximal aorta and descending aorta arise from lineages of neural crest and paraxial mesoderm respectively. The heterogeneity of VSMCs could lead to section-specific microphysiology in the aortic wall and differences in the vulnerability of VSMCs to pathogenic stimuli. Thus, for the purpose of minimizing bias in drug response, HAoSMCs derived exclusively from the proximal aorta should be preferentially utilized in BAV aortopathy models. Overall, the data from BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs indicated that teriflunomide exerted a more obvious effect on rescuing impaired mitochondrial dynamics and the expression of the contractile phenotype proteins SM22 and CNN1 under rhythmic high-strain conditions. These results indicated that leflunomide, Mdivi-1, and, in particular, teriflunomide, could serve as drug candidates for ameliorating the disease progression of BAV-TAA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, protein analyses of human aortic aneurysm tissues suggested the insufficient expression of NOTCH1 in BAV-TAA was associated with the impaired mitochondrial dynamics and OXPHOS. To verify it, we established a microfluidic model of aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip, inspired by previous organ-on-chips models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yasotharan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huh et al., 2010</xref>), enabling us to reproducibly generate the rhythmic tensile strain of the native human aortic wall. We showed that this model could apply a biomimetic rhythmic tensile strain with a confined amplitude/magnitude and rhythm to HAoSMCs. We also confirmed that impaired mitochondrial fusion contributed to the attenuated contractile phenotype observed in NOTCH1-KD HAoSMCs. We further identified that MFN1/2 agonists and DRP1 inhibitors were able to reverse the imbalance in mitochondrial dynamics and partly rescue the contractile phenotype in NOTCH1-insufficient HAoSMCs.</p><p>The majority of studies on the molecular mechanism and pharmacotherapy for TAA have been conducted using conventional cell culture models and animal models. The pathophysiological features of human aortic aneurysm can be induced in animal models by elastase, calcium chloride, angiotensin II or transgenesis, which partially enable investigation of the etiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic targets of TAA at an early stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eckhouse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikonomidis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mao et al., 2015</xref>). However, all these animal models cannot replicate the native characteristics of BAV-TAA. Moreover, the apparent species gap between preclinical animal experiments and clinical studies might also impede pharmaceutical discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindeman and Matsumura, 2019</xref>). In contrast, the shortcoming of the conventional cell culture model of aortic disease lies in its inability to recapitulate in vivo biomechanical stimuli. Advances in microfabrication and microfluidics have provided novel techniques for building organ-on-a-chip models that integrate rhythmic tensile strains into in vitro cell culture. Differently from conventional two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) cell culture methods, which are widely used in biological research, organ-on-a-chip models can replicate multicellular architectures, tissue-tissue interfaces, and biomechanical forces that exist in vivo, and precisely pattern cells and manipulate various mechanical and chemical parameters, such as flow rate, stretch, pressure, oxygen, and pH, providing controllable culture conditions not possible with conventional cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahadian et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of cardiovascular research, the functionally important cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle, are constantly subjected to hemodynamic factors in vivo, including blood flow shear stress, rhythmic strain and fluid pressure, which cannot be simulated and given to the cells by conventional cell culture techniques. Organ-on-a-chip models can be broadly defined as any form of microfabricated cell culture device that models organ-specific biochemical and physical microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2019</xref>) and represent an in vitro platform that is complementary to animal models.</p><p>The present aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model was designed based on the inspiration and reference of pioneering researchers' works, such as progeria-on-a-chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribas et al., 2017</xref>), artery-on-a-chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yasotharan et al., 2015</xref>), and so on. Previous reported 'artery-on-a-chip' platforms are mainly focused on peripheral vessel, cerebral artery, or other arterial diseases. Yasotharan et al. reported an artery-on-a-chip platform that mimicked in vivo transmural pressure of an outer diameter of 120 Î¼m olfactory artery segment, in which vascular tone and calcium dynamics were simultaneously assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poussin et al., 2020</xref>). Poussin et al. have established a model of microvessels-on-a-chip under flow using primary human coronary arterial endothelial cells, to measure the adhesion of monocytes to the lumen of perfused microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poussin et al., 2020</xref>). Arterioles with a diameter of 15 Î¼m, branches of the large artery, are mainly affected by fluid shear but receive little tensile tension. In contrast, aorta diameter is about 25â35 mm with thick three layers, in which smooth muscle cells are the main component in tunica media and experience high tensile strain. Aortopathies are the degenerative changes in the aortic wall inducing thinning or even rupture of the aorta. Thus, HAoSMCs in tunica media and the tensile strain they receive are essential components for the success of aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model.</p><p>By anatomizing the complexity of the biomechanical microenvironment, this study focused on the physiological rhythmic strain on HAoSMCs in the aortic tunica media, which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of aneurysms. In particular, the strain of the ascending aorta, which was defined as the maximal change in the ascending aorta diameter over a cardiac cycle, can vary diversely from a low value of 7.0 Â± 2.5% to a high value of 21.5 Â± 12.4% depending on age, sex and disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akazawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morrison et al., 2009</xref>). Under rhythmic strain, healthy HAoSMCs maintain a contractile phenotype, which allows regulation of the vascular tone. While, diseased HAoSMCs dedifferentiate into a synthetic phenotype under pathological conditions, and this dedifferentiation represents the initial step toward an aneurysm pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petsophonsakul et al., 2019</xref>). The aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model developed in this study featured the controlled magnitude and rhythm of mechanical stimuli relevant to the human pathophysiological parameters of aorta biomechanics. In this study, HAoSMCs exhibited longer shapes in morphology, align unidirectionally, and present contractile phenotype on the on-chip model. In static conventional condition, HAoSMCs present more synthetic phenotype, which is oppositely different from the phenotype exist in native normal aortic wall. Most importantly, the on-chip model recapitulated the imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics which was accordant with analyses on tissues from human BAV-TAA and in vivo mouse model of abdominal aortic aneurysm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>). In short, organ-on-a-chip models can mimic the biomechanical parameters, which are essential for aortopathy disease development and more fully explore the pathophysiological changes of the cells and their real responsiveness to drugs, in a complementary manner with conventional cell culture and in vivo models. However, both of extracellular matrix and vascular cells, including epithelial cells, VSMCs, fibroblasts, macrophages, contribute to the pathological process of the aortic diseases. The present reductionist on-chip model merely represented HAoSMCs activities and did not recapitulated the entire aortic wall. Future works are expected to incorporate more components, especially the aortic extracellular matrix, into the on-chip model and explore ECM degradation and interactive molecular mechanisms involved in human aortopathies.</p><p>NOTCH1 has an important role in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial dynamics. Previous studies have reported that the expression of NOTCH1 signaling was attenuated in the aortic tissues of patients with BAVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sciacca et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, Balistreri et al. found decreased mRNA levels of NOTCH1-4 in aortic aneurysm tissues and decreased protein levels of soluble NOTCH1 in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balistreri et al., 2018</xref>). Using clinical samples, our protein analysis also indicated that patients with BAV-TAA presented lower expression of NOTCH1 protein in ascending aortic aneurysms; and the NOTCH1 insufficiency was accompanied with attenuated mitochondrial fusion. This was consistent with the previous studies that reported NOTCH1 regulates mitochondria dynamics in cardiovascular cell differentiation and survival. Kasahara et al. found that mitochondrial fusion regulates the differentiation of myocardial cells through NOTCH1 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasahara et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we found that NOTCH1 insufficiency induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HAoSMCs by reducing mitochondrial fusion, along with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing ROS production and generating insufficient ATP under rhythmic strain. These results indicated that the relationship between impaired mitochondrial fusion and NOTCH1 deficiency in BAV-TAA. Consistently, we found decreased contractile phenotype in NOTCH1-deficient HAoSMCs under rhythmic tensile strain and in BAV-TAA aortic tissues, accompanied by lower NOTCH1 expression and impaired mitochondrial fusion.</p><p>NOTCH1 signaling is also involved in the regulation of HAoSMCs differentiation and the expression of contractile proteins. HAoSMCs are highly plastic cells and undergo reversible changes in phenotype in response to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">VÃ¡squez-Trincado et al., 2016</xref>). In the aorta, HAoSMCs are considered to have the functional roles of both maintaining aortic tone in response to hemodynamic stimuli, and synthesizing and modeling the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michel et al., 2018</xref>). Most healthy HAoSMCs in the vascular wall in vivo exhibit a contractile phenotype, which allows them to maintain vascular tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Milewicz et al., 2008</xref>). HAoSMCs contractile units associated proteins, such as SM22, CNN1, MYH11, and Î±-SMA, distribute the force on the aortic wall through regulation of extracellular matrix. Decreases in Î±-SMA, MYH11, SM22, and CNN1 attenuate HAoSMCs contractility unit formation and further disrupt force generation, promoting the development of aortic aneurysm or dissections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gillis et al., 2013</xref>). Differentiated HAoSMCs have a contractile phenotype with little proliferation and little secretion of extracellular matrix. HAoSMCs transform from a contractile into a synthetic phenotype and induce loose of vascular tone, which is one of the major pathological process in TAA. Thus, the enhancement of HAoSMCs contractility is indicative of the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for controlling aortic aneurysm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oller et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we found that NOTCH1 insufficiency in HAoSMCs downregulated the contractile phenotype proteins SM22 and CNN1 under rhythmic strain. Also, the expressions of SM22 and CNN1 were decreased in BAV-TAA aortic tissues compared to non-diseased aortic tissues. Noseda et al. reported that NOTCH1 activation was needed for expression of the contractile phenotype protein Î±SMA in VSMCs <italic>via</italic> the NOTCH/CSL axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Noseda et al., 2006</xref>). High et al. reported that NOTCH1 promotes the differentiation of the cardiac neural crest into differentiated VSMCs and the expression of Î±SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">High et al., 2007</xref>). However, the specific mechanism by which NOTCH1 leads to a reduced contractile phenotype has not been fully investigated. Based on results obtained from the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model, it comes to the assumption that NOTCH1-insufficiency reduced the contractile phenotype through decreasing mitochondrial fusion.</p><p>Mitochondrial dynamics itself has been recognized as one of the critical factors that regulate the phenotype switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Salabei and Hill reported that PDGF-BB induces the dedifferentiation of VSMCs into the synthetic phenotype through overactivation of mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salabei and Hill, 2013</xref>). Chen et al. found that the expression of MFN2 is markedly reduced in hyperproliferative VSMCs from spontaneously hypertensive rat arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). Using the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model, we demonstrated the decreased mitochondrial fusion in NOTCH1-insufficient HAoSMCs, accompanied with decreased contractile phenotypes. Thus, mitochondrial dynamics regulated by NOTCH1 may have a role in maintains of contractile phenotype. In addition, we also found the contractile phenotype was upregulated in NOTCH1-insufficient HAoSMCs after treatment with mitochondrial fusion activators and mitochondrial fission inhibitors, which further verified the hypothesis that contractile phenotype of HAoSMCs was regulated by NOTCH1-mitochondrial fusion axis. In clinical samples, our protein analysis indicated that aortic tissues from patients with BAV-TAA presented the reduced expressions of mitochondrial fusion proteins and contractile phenotype proteins, compared with non-diseased aortic tissues. Further, the mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of aortic tissue samples indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction and OXPHOS pathways were significantly altered in BAV-TAA aortic tissues. Consistent with the previous single-cell transcriptome analysis, TAA aortic tissues showed decreased mitochondrial function; and this finding suggests that OXPHOS ATP production might be insufficient for VSMC contractile activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, maintaining normal mitochondrial dynamics <italic>via</italic> NOTCH1 could be one of the mechanisms through which NOTCH1 regulates HAoSMCsâs contractility and maintains vascular wall tension.</p><p>The mitochondria morphology, thatÂ is fragmentation or elongation, which is controlled by precisely regulated mitochondrial fusion and fission, has been related to cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>). Excessive mitochondrial fission induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and contractile phenotype of vascular VSMCs, and an increase in oxygen species production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 2015</xref>). These effects induced by mitochondrial fission were prevented by Mdivi-1, which is an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission related protein DRP1. Cooper et al. found that the upregulated DRP1 and mitochondrial fission in mouse abdominal aortic aneurysm, associated with impaired mitochondrial function and decreased contractility of mouse VSMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>). The induction of the contractile to synthetic phenotype switch of VSMCs by platelet-derived growth factor, was also found to be associated with mitochondrial fragmentation/fission and attenuated MFN2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salabei and Hill, 2013</xref>). In this study, the excessive mitochondrial fragmentation of HAoSMCs implied diseased phenotype, while the restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis, i.e. the balance of fragmentation/fission and elongation/fusion, implied the rescue of HAoSMC contractility abnormality. However, the specific mechanism by which reduced mitochondrial fusion causes a reduction in the contractile phenotype requires further investigation. In addition, our proteomic analysis of tissue samples showed that several mitochondrial dysfunction-related pathways, namely, EIF2 signaling and the sirtuin signaling pathway, were also altered in BAV-TAA aortic tissue, which may provide research directions to investigate further mechanisms.</p><p>Lastly, we demonstrated that MFN1/2 agonists and DRP1 inhibitors reversed the imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics in BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs with intrinsic NOTCH1 insufficiency or in NOTCH1-KD HAoSMCs on the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model, which provides a prototype for an in vitro drug testing platform. Two FDA-approved drugs, leflunomide or teriflunomide, rescued the contractile phenotype of BAV-TAA p-HAoSMCs and showed their potential to ameliorate disease progression. Zorzanoâs group first found that dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitors (leflunomide, teriflunomide, or brequinar sodium) could promote mitochondrial elongation through induction of the mitochondrial proteins MFN1 and MFN2 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miret-Casals et al., 2018</xref>). The experimental data obtained in this study encourage further studies on the application of leflunomide and teriflunomide in BAV-TAA.</p><p>This study has several limitations. Although the phenotypic reversal has observed after treatments of mitochondrial fission inhibitor and fusion agonists based on aorta smooth muscle-on-chip model, in vivo genetically modified mouse experiments are still needed to further confirm the therapeutic effects, thatÂ is whether these drugs can halt the progression of the disease. Also, genetically modified mouse aortic aneurysm model is required to further elucidate the genetic mechanism of NOTCH1âmitofusin axis in ascending aortic aneurysm. At the current stage, aorta smooth muscle-on-chip is still insufficient to alone predict clinical success, but it may be complementary with animal models in the sense that, together they are able to provide more comprehensive basis for preclinical assays with greater predictive power. Therefore, more verification tests, including in vitro on-chip tests and in vivo animal validations, are needed before translating the finding into prospective clinical tail.</p><p>In conclusion, we constructed an aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model, which could serve as a complementary tool to the current cell culture system and animal models. Using the aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model, we found that NOTCH1 insufficiency in HAoSMCs induced phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype accompanied by an impairment of mitochondrial fusion, implying its potential role as a therapeutic target for BAV-TAA. At the current stage, in vitro microphysiological models and animal models are complementary to each other in the sense that they are able to provide more comprehensive basis for preclinical assays with greater predictive power.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We Thank Drs.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors have developed a microfluidics-based aorta-on-a-chip model and, using comparative proteomics analysis, identified potential mechanisms underlying the association between NOTCH1 signaling and BAV-TAA pathology, as well as evidence that impaired mitochondrial dynamics may be a therapeutic target. These studies are highly likely to drive in vivo experiments aimed at validation. The reviewers and editors feel this paper will be of great interest in the fields of organ-on-a-chip as well as bicuspid aortic valve disease and thoracic aortic aneurysm research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Aorta-on-a-chip reveals impaired mitochondrial dynamics as a therapeutic target for aortic aneurysm in bicuspid aortic valve disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Balram Bhargava as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Aortic smooth muscle cells and its related tunica media play a central role in the development of aortopathy, but multiple other types of cells, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages, are also involved in the aortic wall and contribute to the pathological process. This work could inspire future work of integration of other cell types on the chip to study their network effect involved in the aortopathy, but the present study cannot represent the whole aortic wall on the chip. The authors should rephrase the statement of 'aorta-on-a-chip' in the entire manuscript since the current wording leaves the impression that they integrate entire aortic cells. The &quot;aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip&quot; or a name would be more accurate. The title should be similarly clarified. Additionally, the limitations of this approach/model need to be discussed, for example the inability to recapitulate pathologic changes associated with disease such as ECM degradation, etc.</p><p>2. The authors used primary smooth muscle cells form patients with BAV-TAA. However, the population of VSMCs comprising the aortic microstructures is heterogeneous. In the ascending aorta and aortic arch, VSMCs are derived from the neural crest. VSMCs in the descending thoracic aorta are derived from the paraxial mesoderm, while neural crest and secondary heart field-derived VSMCs intermingle in the aortic root. The heterogeneity of VSMCs could lead to section-specific microphysiology in the aortic wall and differences in the vulnerability of VSMCs to pathogenic stimuli. Therefore, the authors should clarify which section of aorta they used and explain why they used that section. Furthermore, the authors should include a discussion of how heterogeneity of the primary cells can contribute to variability in outcomes in this model and how it should be appropriately dealt with.</p><p>3. This appears to be the first report of aortic function unit-on-a-chip to study aortopathy, the authors should clarify in more detail what discriminates this study from the other reported 'artery-on-a-chip' platforms (Artery-on-a-chip platform for automated, multimodal assessment of cerebral blood vessel structure and function, Lab Chip 2015;15(12):2660-9.doi: 10.1039/c5lc00021a) and where the novelty is. The reviewers were all excited by this work, but the novelty should not be overstated and prior studies using similar models should be given due credit.</p><p>4. In Figure 6, the patients-derived cells were used on the chip. The effect of drug testing on aorta-on-a-chip model was desirable, even though the results did not exhibit all the positive responses. Please explain the potential reasons for the unevenness. Additionally, Figure 6 needs to include the control condition and statistical comparisons between this and the high strain condition.</p><p>5. A discussion regarding device design and optimization should be included. Did the authors try other designs? For instance, the stretching chip, demonstrated by Ingber's group, incorporates two lateral chambers for manipulating cyclic stretching forces on cells. Why was the chosen design selected, and what parameters are most critical to its success?</p><p>6. Details on chip fabrication must be included for the methodology to be adequate for publication. Detailed description on &quot;commercialized highly flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes&quot;, which is a key component of the chip, is needed. Definitions and descriptions of the ascending aorta, common value ranges for physiologic parameters, how they correlate with the vacuum pressure, etc, need to be discussed in the 'construction of aorta on a chip model' section rather than (or in addition to) the discussion.</p><p>7. In Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 figure caption (b) Young's modulus of the PDMS membrane, the caption doesn't match the image. The image doesn't show the Young's modulus directly. What was the calculated value of Young's modulus? It seems the measured value was different from the commercially labeled value, 1.7 MPa, Line 548, Page 15. How did authors measure it? This is missing in the Materials and methods Part. Authors should describe measurement protocol in Methods and calculated value in Results. Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 figure (b) should present a scatter plot instead of a line chart.</p><p>8. In Figure 2, the authors only presented the video snapshots. The authors should provide movie clips, or GIF animation images, for the purpose of repeating this experiment and evaluating results by readers.</p><p>9. While beyond the scope of this study, the on-a-chip model is clearly insufficient to alone predict clinical success, and the authors need to discuss the importance of following up on these studies using in vivo validation. This reductionist on-a-chip model is viewed as powerful for drug discovery, but not sufficient to motivate clinical trials without in vivo validation. Please add some discussion regarding these points.</p><p>10. Please specify the z-scores of individual pathways in Figure 1F, and the scale of the horizontal axis in Figure 1H (log2 or log10?).</p><p>11. Please add any discussion regarding implications of enhanced cell contractility and changes to mitochondria morphology.</p><p>12. Please discuss in greater detail the benefits of the on-a-chip model compared to conventional cell culture.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69310.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The majority of VSMCs at the proximal aorta and descending aorta arise from lineages of neural crest and paraxial mesoderm respectively. The heterogeneity of VSMCs could lead to section-specific microphysiology in the aortic wall and differences in the vulnerability of VSMCs to pathogenic stimuli.

Previous reported 'artery-on-a-chip' platforms are mainly focused on peripheral vessel, cerebral artery, or other arterial diseases. Yasotharan et al. reported an artery-on-a-chip platform that mimicked in vivo transmural pressure of an outer diameter of 120 Î¼m olfactory artery segment, in which vascular tone and calcium dynamics were simultaneously assessed [3]. Poussin et al. have established a model of microvessels-on-a-chip under flow using primary human coronary arterial endothelial cells, to measure the adhesion of monocytes to the lumen of perfused microvessels [3]. Arterioles with a diameter of 15 Î¼m, branches of the large artery, are mainly affected by fluid shear but receive little tensile tension. In contrast, aorta diameter is about 25-35 mm with thick three layers, in which smooth muscle cells are the main component in tunica media and experience high tensile strain. Aortopathies are the degenerative changes in the aortic wall inducing thinning or even rupture of the aorta. Thus, HAoSMCs in tunica media and the tensile strain they receive are essential components for the success of aorta smooth muscle-on-a-chip model. â</p><p>References</p><p>1.

Racial differences may lead to different cellular response to experimental stimuli or to drug treatment. HAoSMCs used in this study were from different human races.

But we did not use it and designed a chip with up and down vacuum chambers for the main reason of its easier fabrication. We tested three prototypes with varying culturing channels, i.e. 2, or 4, or 6 mm in width. Finally, we opted for the current size mainly because we aimed to harvest enough cells for multiple protein analysis replication.

While beyond the scope of this study, the on-a-chip model is clearly insufficient to alone predict clinical success, and the authors need to discuss the importance of following up on these studies using in vivo validation.

Please add some discussion regarding these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We discussed limitation in revised manuscript, as follows.</p><p>Page 24, Line 857: âThis study has several limitations. Although the phenotypic reversal has observed after treatments of mitochondrial fission inhibitor and fusion agonists based on aorta smooth muscle-on-chip model, in vivo genetically modified mouse experiments are still needed to further confirm the therapeutic effects, i.e., whether these drugs can effectively halt the progression of the disease. Also, genetically modified mouse aortic aneurysm model is required to further elucidate the genetic mechanism of NOTCH1âmitofusin axis in ascending aortic aneurysm. At the current stage, aorta-on-chip is still insufficient to alone predict clinical success, but it may be complementary with animal models in the sense that, together they are able to provide more comprehensive basis for preclinical assays with greater predictive power. Therefore, more verification tests, including in vitro on-chip tests and in vivo animal validations, are needed before translating the finding into prospective clinical tail.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

Most healthy HAoSMCs in the vascular wall in vivo exhibit a contractile phenotype, which allows them to maintain vascular tone [2]. HAoSMCs contractile units associated proteins, such as SM22, CNN1, MYH11 and Î±-SMA, distribute the force on the aortic wall through regulation of extracellular matrix. Decreases in Î±-SMA, MYH11, SM22, and CNN1 attenuate HAoSMCs contractility unit formation and further disrupt force generation, promoting the development of aortic aneurysm or dissections [3]. Thus, the enhancement of HAoSMCs contractility is one of indicators of the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for controlling aortic aneurysm [4].â</p><p>References</p><p>1.

Excessive mitochondrial fission induced a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and contractile phenotype of vascular VSMCs, and an increase in oxygen species production [2]. These effects induced by mitochondrial fission were prevented by Mdivi-1, which is an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission related protein DRP1. Cooper et al. found that the upregulated DRP1 and mitochondrial fission in mouse abdominal aortic aneurysm, associated with impaired mitochondrial function and decreased contractility of mouse VSMCs [3]. The induction of the contractile to synthetic phenotype switch of VSMCs by platelet-derived growth factor, was also found to be associated with mitochondrial fragmentation/fission and attenuated MFN2 protein levels [4]. In this study, the excessive mitochondrial fragmentation of HAoSMCs implied diseased phenotype, while the restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis, i.e., the balance of fragmentation/fission and elongation/fusion, implied the rescue of HAoSMC contractility abnormality.â</p><p>References</p><p>1.

In the case of cardiovascular research, the functionally important cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle, are constantly subjected to hemodynamic factors in vivo, including blood flow shear stress, rhythmic strain and fluid pressure, which cannot be simulated and given to the cells by conventional cell culture techniques.â</p><p>Page 22, Line 746: âIn this study, HAoSMCs exhibited longer shapes in morphology, align unidirectionally, and present contractile phenotype on the on-chip model. In static conventional condition, HAoSMCs present more synthetic phenotype, which is oppositely different from the phenotype exist in native normal aortic wall. Most importantly, the on-chip model recapitulated the imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics which was accordant with analyses on tissues from human BAV-TAA and in vivo mouse model of abdominal aortic aneurysm [2]. In short, organ-on-a-chip models can mimic the biomechanical parameters, which are essential for aortopathy development and more fully explore the pathophysiological changes of the cells and their real responsiveness to drugs, in a complementary manner with conventional cell culture and in vivo models.â</p><p>References</p><p>1.
