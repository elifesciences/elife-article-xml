The various cells act coherently, as an ensemble, in order to execute a physiologic response. Modern approaches for identifying and dissecting novel physiologic mechanisms would benefit from an ability to identify specific cell types in live tissues that could then be imaged in real time. Current techniques require the use of fluorescent genetic reporters that are not only cumbersome, but which only allow the study of three or four cell types at a time. We report a non-invasive imaging modality that capitalizes on the endogenous autofluorescence signatures of the metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD. By marrying morphological characteristics with autofluorescence signatures, all seven of the airway epithelial cell types can be distinguished simultaneously in mouse tracheal explants in real time. Furthermore, we find that this methodology for direct cell type-specific identification avoids pitfalls associated with the use of ostensibly cell type-specific markers that are, in fact, altered by clinically relevant physiologic stimuli. Finally, we utilize this methodology to interrogate real-time physiology and identify dynamic secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) that form in response to cholinergic stimulus. The identical process has been well documented in the intestine where the dynamic formation of SAPs and goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) enable luminal antigen sampling. Airway secretory cells with SAPs are frequently juxtaposed to antigen presenting cells, suggesting that airway SAPs, like their intestinal counterparts, not only sample antigen but convey their cargo for immune cell processing.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Imaging several cell types, at the same time, within a living tissue is no small endeavor.

Further studies should uncover more details about this new function of secretory lung cells. Other exciting discoveries may also emerge from researchers adopting the method developed by Shah, Hou et al. to examine a range of organs (both healthy and diseased), and attempting to apply it to human tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autofluorescence</kwd><kwd>airway epithelia</kwd><kwd>secretory cell associated antigen passages</kwd><kwd>NADH</kwd><kwd>FAD</kwd><kwd>goblet cell associated antigen passages</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>003338L121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Viral S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HL142559</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Charles P</given-names></name><name><surname>Rajagopal</surname><given-names>Jayaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1HL118185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajagopal</surname><given-names>Jayaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HL157221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rajagopal</surname><given-names>Jayaraj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autofluorescence imaging permits label-free cell type identification in live airway tissue and reveals the dynamic formation of airway secretory cell associated antigen passages.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The airway epithelium is composed of myriad distinct cell types, many of which have only been recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deprez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goldfarbmuren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>). Studying the function of each of these cells and their contribution to the physiology of the entire epithelial ensemble often requires cell type-specific genetic perturbation. Indeed, even the simple identification of a given class of cells within a live tissue requires genetic labeling with a fluorophore. Currently, cells are most commonly identified post-fixation using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining, but this prohibits the assessment of real-time cellular dynamics and thus real-time physiology. Since post-fixation cell identification is destructive, it also precludes the study of long-term processes or the effect of multiple serial stimuli which are both essential features of normal organ physiology. Additionally, markers used for cell type identification in unperturbed tissue can often be non-specific or misleading after injury. We reasoned that a methodology for identifying and tracking diverse cell types within an organ in real time in a non-destructive fashion would permit the study of physiologically relevant processes that are currently hidden from view.</p><p>Label-free imaging based on endogenous fluorescence of metabolic cofactors has been deployed to measure cell metabolism in various tissues, particularly in tumors and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Katz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Skala et al., 2007</xref>). NADH, NADPH, and FAD, the major endogenous fluorophores, have been used to monitor metabolism in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heikal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasischke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rocheleau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sepehr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tiede et al., 2007</xref>). Since NADH and NADPH cannot be distinguished by their autofluorescence, the combination has been reported as an aggregate quantity, NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>). To account for the effects of light scattering and variation in the number of mitochondria, a metabolic ratio of FAD/(NAD[P]H+FAD) is often employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chance et al., 1979</xref>). Two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy can be used to measure this metabolic ratio in intact tissues and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dilipkumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreiß et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, abundant common intestinal epithelial cell types can be distinguished based on their morphology when imaged in this manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreiß et al., 2020</xref>). Most recently, these measures of metabolic activity have been used to identify immune cells in differing functional states during fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemire et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, immune cell interactions have been visualized using autofluorescence in the murine trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kretschmer et al., 2016</xref>). In this manuscript, we describe a mouse tissue explant system that readily permits the label-free identification of abundant epithelial cell types in living airway tissue. Furthermore, a combined assessment of the cell resolution fine features of autofluorescence signatures can be coupled to cell morphometric measurements to permit the identification of exceedingly rare epithelial cell types. We also use live autofluorescence imaging to reveal the existence of secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs) in the airway. The biology of such structures has only recently been dissected in the gut where they have been referred to as both SAPs and goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gustafsson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gustafsson and Johansson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noah et al., 2019</xref>). We describe the real-time dynamics of the formation of these structures using physiologic cholinergic stimulation and their association with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Finally, we demonstrate that autofluorescence signatures can be used for live cell tracing. Indeed, under some circumstances, this technique is more reliable than the use of ostensibly cell type-specific markers whose expression can be altered by injury, physiologic stimulus, and in disease states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Label-free autofluorescence-based live imaging of an intact murine tracheal explant</title><p>We hypothesized that we would be able to specifically assign airway epithelial cell type identity by directly imaging specific metabolic signatures at single-cell resolution. In order to preserve subtle and complex features of normal cellular and tissue architecture, we developed a mouse tracheal explant setup that allows upright two-photon imaging in a physiologic chamber over days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwok et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To facilitate optimal detection and separation of NAD(P)H and FAD, the samples were scanned at 730 nm and 900 nm sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). A short pass 505 nm dichroic was used to separate the NAD(P)H and FAD signal, and each fluorescence signal was detected using 450/100 nm (NAD(P)H) and 540/80 nm (FAD) band pass filters, respectively (Supplement 1B). Using this setup, we ascertained NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence emissions across the excitation spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to the curvature of the trachea, we performed digital ‘flattening’ during image analysis where the subepithelial region was linearized to the same Z plane. To accomplish this, we utilized second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging of collagen fibers to identify the basement membrane (SHG signal was excited with a 900 nm laser) and developed a MATLAB algorithm to ‘flatten’ the epithelial surface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vss11/Label-free-autofluorescence">https://github.com/vss11/Label-free-autofluorescence</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shah, 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence can be measured from murine tracheal epithelial cells and is stable across days.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mounting of tracheal explant for upright two-photon imaging.

We first measured and recorded autofluorescence using live tissue and then subsequently identified cell types in that same tissue following fixation. Specifically, autofluorescence was first imaged in live tissues, locations were registered to subepithelial landmarks, and the same fixed tissue was subsequently stained with conventional markers to identify cell types. Live autofluorescence signatures were then associated with each cell that was identified by conventional staining. In order to register autofluorescence live images to that of fixed and stained images, we imaged the SHG signals of the subepithelial collagen. These signals served as fiduciary marks which facilitated exact localization of individual cells. We first visualized ciliated cells with live autofluorescence imaging given their very unique morphology. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ciliated cells have a robust FAD signal which is primarily located near the luminal cell surface. Fixation and staining with acetylated tubulin (ac-tub, green) demonstrated coincidence of this autofluorescence signature with the presence of ciliated cells identified by immunofluorescence. Secretory cells demonstrated a more robust NADH signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that was in sharp contrast to that of ciliated cells.

Ionocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) had a characteristic shape by autofluorescence imaging which was similar to the shape of ionocytes delineated by immunohistochemical staining with BSND (green). Additionally, ionocytes were found to have puncta of high FAD signal toward the apical aspect of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Biv</xref>). The distinct shape of tuft cells could be identified by an autofluorescence ratio corresponding to immunofluorescent staining with GNAT3 (red). Of all airway epithelial cells, neuroendocrine cells labeled by PGP9 (cyan) displayed the lowest NAD(P)H and FAD autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, as an aggregate, rare cells are characterized by very similar autofluorescence intensity ratios and could not be distinguished by this criterion alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Given the diversity of morphologies of airway cell types, we then quantified a number of morphometric measures to better distinguish rare cell identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Live autofluorescence imaging permits the segmentation of cell boundaries enabling the measurement of the distance of the nucleus from the basement membrane (nuclear position), the largest dimension in the X, Y, and Z plane (X length, Y length, and Z length), the aspect ratios (X length/Y length) and (Y length/Z length), and the SD of fluorescence ratio intensities across the cell in the Z plane (SD of autofluorescence intensity ratio above the nucleus, SD of autofluorescence intensity ratio below nucleus, and the ratio of these two measures). We measured these parameters for the common cells (basal, ciliated, and secretory), hillocks, and rare cells (ionocyte, neuroendocrine, and tuft). Aggregated data from a total of 30 basal cells, 32 ciliated cells, 32 secretory cells, 30 hillock cells, 21 ionocytes, 30 tuft cells, and 31 neuroendocrine cells were compiled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Given the spread of various morphologic variables across different cell types, we performed unsupervised clustering of the cell types based upon both their autofluorescence intensity ratio and their morphological differences. In aggregate, these characteristics allowed the separation of all airway epithelial cell types into distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In order to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms designed to distinguish cell types, we divided our data set into training and testing subsets. We utilized 75% of the total cells (154 cells) for machine learning training, leaving 25% (52 cells) for subsequent validation. We then trained three machine learning models using k-nearest neighbors, multinomial logistic regression, and XGBoost algorithms to classify the different cell types. We then compared the identity assigned by the machine learning algorithms based on the autofluorescence and morphology data to the known identities determined by staining. K-nearest neighbor analysis and multinomial logistic regression resulted in 96% accuracy, while XGBoost performed with 92% accuracy. This was suggestive of high-quality modeling with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.95, 0.95, and 0.91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then established the weight that each characteristic contributes to cell type-specific identification when using a XGBoost machine learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which shows that nuclear position, aspect YZ, NADH autofluorescence, ratio of deviation, and FAD autofluorescence are the most important characteristics for cell type assignment.

Thus, we are able to assign secretory cell identity at the single-cell level even after stimulation, thereby allowing us to follow individual secretory cell physiologic responses over time.</p><p>To our surprise, we found that methacholine stimulation resulted in the development of non-fluorescent spherical ‘voids’ within secretory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> boxes, further magnification of these boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These ‘voids’ were distinct from a non-autofluorescent region that represented the nucleus. We performed detailed examination of the field in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and found that ‘voids’ were present in approximately 9% of secretory cells prior to stimulation, but the fraction of secretory cells with ‘voids’ dramatically increased to 78% following methacholine stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). We hypothesized that these novel structures resulted from the uptake of extracellular luminal contents. Indeed, such a sampling process has been demonstrated in the gut epithelium during which secretory and goblet cells internalize luminal contents. In this case, internalization results in the formation of SAPs and GAPs within the intestinal secretory and goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gustafsson and Johansson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noah et al., 2019</xref>). Given that airway secretory cells adopt a goblet cell morphology within hours, airway SAPs and GAPs are likely equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Evans et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>To definitely evaluate our hypothesis concerning the origin of the spherical autofluorescence ‘voids’ in our system, we incubated tracheal explants cultures in 10Kd FITC-dextran. Upon stimulation with methacholine, secretory cells showed uptake of FITC-dextran that was clearly distinguishable from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since autofluorescence imaging alone cannot be used to establish the presence of a membrane, we resorted to employing epithelia expressing membrane tdTomato to assess whether the ‘voids’ were membrane bound. Indeed, we found uptake of FITC-dextran into membrane encapsulated structures delineated by membrane tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This uptake of dextran occurs both in unstimulated and methacholine stimulated samples, though is dramatically exaggerated following stimulation with methacholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The increased SAP formation following stimulation with methacholine recapitulates the induction of intestinal GAPs following cholinergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>). In order to visualize this process on a faster time scale, we utilized air liquid interface (ALI) cultures since they are significantly thinner than the native trachea, thus allowing rapid imaging across the Z-axis. In our ALI models, we captured the fine dynamics of the formation of intracellular membrane bound structures that housed contents that were previously located in the airway lumen. Live imaging over 60 min demonstrates the uptake of FITC-dextran into the cell from the apical surface, further accumulation of FITC-dextran into the cell, and a major secretion event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1 fig5video2 fig5video3">Figure 5—videos 1–3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This process bears a striking resemblance to the formation of intestinal SAPs and GAPs which are generated through an endocytic process that can be stimulated by acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gustafsson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knoop et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, further mirroring their gut counterparts, airway secretory cells with SAPs containing either FITC-dextran or FITC-ovalbumin closely associate with CD11c+APCs that had been recruited to the airway epithelium following an LPS challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDole et al., 2012</xref>). Many of these LPS-stimulated APCs are intraepithelial and possess dendriform processes that extend toward SAPs.

We also show that autofluorescence coupled to morphology allows one to distinguish all the known airway epithelial cell types without the need for genetic labels. Unexpectedly, cell identity can be established in a way that is sometimes more accurate than destructive immunofluorescent approaches. This may be of particular relevance to disease states since it has been noted that markers of cell type such as the secretory cell marker CCSP can be misleading when used for the enumeration of cell numbers in COPD patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pilette et al., 2001</xref>), in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shijubo et al., 1999</xref>), and in smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shijubo et al., 1997</xref>) presumably due to the fact that CCSP has been secreted into the lumen. However, despite its advantages, it should be noted that infection and inflammation may alter autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dilipkumar et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, our methodology must be re-optimized in each new experimental setting, and in each case, it is very likely that machine learning algorithms will require re-training. However, the training set provided in this manuscript will be a useful validation for native mouse tracheal epithelia. With these caveats in mind, we hope our methodology will eventually find applications in assessing human airway specimens, including the real-time assessment of disease-specific physiologic parameters and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.</p><p>Finally, our discovery of airway SAPs demonstrates that this new methodology can be used to define novel unappreciated physiologic processes that currently remain hidden from view. Recently, using a new fixation procedure, luminal dextran uptake has been documented in murine airway goblet and secretory cells, suggestive of GAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). We now definitively demonstrate endocytic uptake of luminal antigens, and we show that this process is stimulated by a classic cholinergic challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gustafsson and Johansson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDole et al., 2012</xref>). However, although we see that SAPs are associated with APCs, we have not demonstrated that APCs receive cargo from SAPs.</p><p>Thus, the actual functions of airway SAPs are yet to be discovered. Intestinal GAPs play a role in immune tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knoop et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2020</xref>), the imprinting of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kulkarni et al., 2020</xref>), and participate in inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knoop et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knoop et al., 2020</xref>). Analogous phenomenon has been documented to occur in the case of goblet cells of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ko et al., 2018</xref>). It will be of great interest to establish the functions of airway SAPs and their role in airway mucosal immunity, tolerance, and autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Label free autofluorescence imaging permits comprehensive and simultaneous assignment of cell type identity and reveals the existence of airway secretory cell associated antigen passages (SAPs)&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Paul Noble as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers find great merit in the interesting study. However, they both raise important issues that we would like the authors to address below:</p><p>A) Reproducibility:</p><p>– Figure 3E, list how many cells were measured in each instance.</p><p>– Figure 3F unclear from figure or legend what dimension reduction algorithm was used (PCA? Other?).</p><p>– Figure 3 Suppl 2 is not useful as authors don't analyze subsets, any data can form new clusters based on the method used.</p><p>– Code should ideally be shared in Github, or in a containerized format in supplement, or anything other than in a PDF file.</p><p>B) Minimalism:</p><p>– Can the same be achieved just with morphological characteristics? (w/o FAD/NAD(P)H). Using your already existing data, repeat classification analysis omitting the ratios, and show the effect on accuracy/clustering.</p><p>– Alternatively, figure 3E: Show which features contribute most to detection in each case. E.g.: Secretory cells' low ratio, ciliated vs ionocyte YZ aspect, etc.</p><p>C) Generalizability:</p><p>– Describe in conclusions the conditions in which you predict that the method may need to be re-optimized (e.g. inflammation, infection, others) due to metabolic changes.</p><p>– Change P3L83: &quot;autofluorescence signature <italic>under the conditions studied in this work</italic> can be used..&quot;</p><p>– Relatedly, using your already existing data, is your ability to detect cell types maintained after Rotenone, Antimycin A, or FCCP? this would provide a clue as to the limitations. This loss of resolution is alluded to in P23L328 although not clear how much this is affected.</p><p>D) SAPs:</p><p>– Using your already existing data, quantify what proportion of secretory cells show the &quot;SAP-like&quot; empty structures at baseline.</p><p>– Figure 5C put times in figure (1, 9, 31, 40, 53, 60 minutes).</p><p>– Supplemental video: add a timescale.</p><p>– The methacholine time course should be improved by quantification of more instances of secretion, and by including appropriate controls:</p><p>– Compare SAP formation in absence of methacholine stimulation. Epithelia are very sensitive.</p><p>– How often do secretory cells take up and secrete FITC-dextran? This analysis does not need to be extensive as you are only claiming the &quot;existence&quot; of the SAPs, however, would be best to show more than one time only.</p><p>E) Others:</p><p>– Cite the preprint by coauthor Vinarsky (Kwok et al. 2022) when describing ex vivo prep.</p><p>– Cite Kretschmer et al. 2016 (airway-immune interaction, did not separate cell types).</p><p>– P2L50, unclear what authors refer to, reference Lin et al. is listed as &quot;submitted&quot; and not available, either remove mention or update citation.</p><p>– P23L321, &quot;333% decrease in the CCSP&quot; clarify, as absolute fluorescence value should not possibly decrease by more than 100%.</p><p>– Figure 5 confusing choice of colors as Tomato is shown as the same color as Draq5.</p><p>1) For the validation in Figure 2, it's not clear whether the cell type was identified by the autofluorescence and then confirmed by the immunostaining, or if and how &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; cells were inferred by autofluorescence. For instance, in Figure 2A, some cells are relatively bright in yellow fluorescence but negative for acetylated tubulin. If this is because the yellow fluorescence pseudocolor is only one feature of the ratiometric signature, that seems fine, but it would be useful to somehow demonstrate visually that the autofluorescence-based identification is independent of the immunostaining. It's just not clear if this is the case from the legend. Panel iii legend says it is an overlay of the staining and autofluorescence but to my eye, it looks like just the autofluorescence with a dotted line demarcating the cell boundaries.</p><p>2) Segmentation of single cells by autofluorescence looks excellent for ciliated and secretory cells but is less obvious for basal cells (Figure 2C). Was this done manually (drawing the dashed line) or is the workflow capable of performing this accurately independent of the immunostaining?</p><p>3) In Figure 3, it's difficult to get a sense of both of these issues (mentioned in 1 and 2) since in all of the panels A-D it is not easy to distinguish the &quot;positive&quot; cells or to segment the cell by eye based on the autofluorescence image shown.</p><p>4) The accuracy of cell type discrimination is quite good however it would be helpful to provide more details about how this was defined and performed. What was the &quot;ground truth&quot; for the cell type used to measure the accuracy? Did this involve immunostaining for cell-type markers?</p><p>5) It would be helpful to know how long mouse tracheal explants can be cultured with reasonable maintenance of the autofluorescence features.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84375.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A) Reproducibility:</p><p>– Figure 3E, list how many cells were measured in each instance.</p></disp-quote><p>The numbers of each cell type measured are now included in the Figure 3 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3F unclear from figure or legend what dimension reduction algorithm was used (PCA?

We performed additional analysis of Figure 4C and determined that SAP formation does occur at baseline prior to stimulation in 9% of secretory cells. Methacholine leads to 78% of secretory cells to form SAPs in this image (Figure 4 Source Data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How often do secretory cells take up and secrete FITC-dextran?

We have also included a cross section of air-liquid interface culture to show that this process does occur frequently (Figure 5 Supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) Others:</p><p>– Cite the preprint by coauthor Vinarsky (Kwok et al. 2022) when describing ex vivo prep.</p><p>– Cite Kretschmer et al. 2016 (airway-immune interaction, did not separate cell types).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewers bringing this study to our attention. We now include it in the manuscript in the introduction:</p><p>“And immune cell interactions have also been seen using autofluorescence in the murine trachea (Kretschmer et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– P2L50, unclear what authors refer to, reference Lin et al. is listed as &quot;submitted&quot; and not available, either remove mention or update citation.</p></disp-quote><p>This reference has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– P23L321, &quot;333% decrease in the CCSP&quot; clarify, as absolute fluorescence value should not possibly decrease by more than 100%.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this input and have revised the text to indicate a 70% decrease in fluorescence compared to the time zero sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5 confusing choice of colors as Tomato is shown as the same color as Draq5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the color scheme so that Draq5 (nucleus) is visualized as blue instead of magenta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) For the validation in Figure 2, it's not clear whether the cell type was identified by the autofluorescence and then confirmed by the immunostaining, or if and how &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; cells were inferred by autofluorescence.

It's just not clear if this is the case from the legend. Panel iii legend says it is an overlay of the staining and autofluorescence but to my eye, it looks like just the autofluorescence with a dotted line demarcating the cell boundaries.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the Reviewer comments, we have provided further clarity to describe the process of identifying each cell type and then assigning the measured autofluorescence for each cell type:</p><p>“We first measured and recorded autofluorescence using live tissue and then subsequently identified cell types in that same tissue following fixation. Specifically, autofluorescence was first imaged in live tissues, locations were registered to subepithelial landmarks, and the same fixed tissue was subsequently stained with conventional markers to identify cell types. Live autofluorescence signatures were then associated with each cell that was identified by conventional staining. In order to register autofluorescence live images to that of fixed and stained images, we imaged the second harmonic generation (SHG) signals of the subepithelial collagen. These signals served as fiduciary marks which facilitated exact localization of individual cells.”</p><p>Regarding the yellow fluorescence pseudocoloring, the ciliated cells do have a strong FADH signal seen as very fine yellow fluorescence, however the presence of yellow fluorescence is not limited to ciliated cells. Furthermore, the measured characteristic is the average fluorescence intensity in the entire cell rather than a binary “yellow present” vs “yellow absent”.</p><p>We have also further clarified in the Figure 2 legend to indicates that the dotted line demarcates the cell border in Panel iii.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Segmentation of single cells by autofluorescence looks excellent for ciliated and secretory cells but is less obvious for basal cells (Figure 2C). Was this done manually (drawing the dashed line) or is the workflow capable of performing this accurately independent of the immunostaining?</p></disp-quote><p>This was done manually by comparing the fixed immunostained image to the autofluorescence image. The workflow is not independently able to draw the borders at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, it's difficult to get a sense of both of these issues (mentioned in 1 and 2) since in all of the panels A-D it is not easy to distinguish the &quot;positive&quot; cells or to segment the cell by eye based on the autofluorescence image shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope with the above clarifications, this issue is clearer. As mentioned, the cell types were identified with immunostaining. Autofluorescence was then measured retrospectively from captured lived images of the same sample.</p><p>A major conclusion from Figure 3A-D is that autofluorescence alone may not be sufficient to identify the rare cells. Thus, it is expected that the Reviewer may have difficulty identifying the rare cells by this measure in isolation. This was the rationale for Figure 3E in which we show that quantifying non-invasive morphologic measures provides a method to further discriminate the rare cell populations. Of note, the non-invasive morphologic measurements can be determined using autofluorescence alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The accuracy of cell type discrimination is quite good however it would be helpful to provide more details about how this was defined and performed. What was the &quot;ground truth&quot; for the cell type used to measure the accuracy? Did this involve immunostaining for cell-type markers?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and now provide additional clarity regarding this approach as described above. The “ground truth” was determined after the live imaging using immunostaining. Autofluorescence and other characteristics measured from live imaging were then attributed to each cell type after identification in post-hoc analysis. This has now been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful to know how long mouse tracheal explants can be cultured with reasonable maintenance of the autofluorescence features.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in Figure 1E tracheal explants can be cultures for at least 2 days with no significant changes in autofluorescence features.</p></body></sub-article></article>
