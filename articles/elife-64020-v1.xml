coronary lesions exceeds the protection exerted by the fibrous cap overlying the necrotic lipid core. However, very little is known about the biomechanical stress exerting this disrupting force. Employing optical coherence tomography (OCT), we generated plaque models and performed finite-element analysis to simulate stress distributions within the vessel wall in 10 ruptured and 10 non-ruptured lesions. In ruptured lesions, maximal stress within fibrous cap (peak cap stress [PCS]: 174 ± 67 vs. 52 ± 42 kPa, p&lt;0.001) and vessel wall (maximal plaque stress [MPS]: 399 ± 233 vs. 90 ± 95 kPa, p=0.001) were significantly higher compared to non-ruptured plaques. Ruptures arose in the immediate proximity of maximal stress concentrations (angular distances: 21.8 ± 30.3° for PCS vs. 20.7 ± 23.7° for MPS); stress concentrations excellently predicted plaque rupture (area under the curve: 0.940 for PCS, 0.950 for MPS). This prediction of plaque rupture was superior to established vulnerability features such as fibrous cap thickness or macrophage infiltration. In conclusion, OCT-based finite-element analysis effectively assesses plaque biomechanics, which in turn predicts plaque rupture in patients. This highlights the importance of morpho-mechanic analysis assessing the disrupting effects of plaque stress.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Heart attacks are caused by a blockage in arteries that supply oxygen to the heart.

One of the main challenges in modern therapy of patients with CAD is the detection of atherosclerotic plaques that do not yet limit flow in the coronary artery, but may potentially cause an acute coronary syndrome by rupturing with subsequent acute occlusion of the artery. Decades ago, these lesion entities have been defined as ‘vulnerable plaques’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Virmani et al., 2003</xref>). Pathology-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Virmani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falk, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Virmani et al., 2000</xref>) as well as intravascular imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehara et al., 2004</xref>) have been used over time to explore potential features of plaque vulnerability, that is morphological characteristics which may predispose a plaque to rupture. The presently accepted features assessed using intravascular imaging include the thickness of the fibrous cap (FCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>), the extent of the necrotic lipid core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>), the presence of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>), microvessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>), small calcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reith et al., 2018</xref>), or a positive remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Varnava et al., 2002</xref>). Features of coronary plaque vulnerability may also be assessed with different imaging modalities, such as coronary computed tomography angiography, and include also low-attenuation plaques and a higher plaque burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conte et al., 2017</xref>). These features may predict the incidence of future major cardiac events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prati et al., 2020</xref>), if such high-risk plaques are not timely recognized and sealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dettori et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>From a mechanistic perspective, plaque rupture originates from an excessive stress concentration on the fibrous cap, which trespasses the tensile strength of the material and ultimately causes material failure and consequently plaque rupture. The fibrous cap yields, in this view, a protective effect, by avoiding the exposure of prothrombotic material present in the necrotic lipid core. Thus, it is not surprising that minimal FCT has been considered the most established parameter of plaque vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>): in fact, the thickness of the fibrous cap seems a good surrogate parameter of its ability to resist stresses. Still, evaluating solely the fibrous cap addresses only the main stabilizing factor in plaque biomechanics, leaving the destabilizing factors almost completely ignored. However, plaque rupture occurs if the stress within coronary lesions exceeds the protection exerted by the fibrous cap. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to also calculate the stress within the plaque as the disrupting force within the lesion and not only focus on the protective effects of the fibrous cap. However, very little is known about the determinants of the disrupting force pushing coronary plaques to rupture. In addition, the spatial relationship between rupture and the balance of stabilizing and destabilizing forces in the plaque remains largely unexplored: in other words, whether plaque rupture occurs at the site with the lowest FCT, as point of least resistance, or rather in sites of highest stress concentration, as point of maximal disruption is unclear.</p><p>It is self-evident that such research questions cannot be addressed by ‘standard’ plaque imaging analysis. Therefore, we chose to develop a morpho-metric finite-element analysis to determine the influence of plaque morphology on the biomechanics of coronary lesions in patients and investigate the relationship between this calculated morpho-mechanic stress and plaque rupture.</p><p>As a source of patient-specific, high-quality images of coronary plaques for this <italic>proof-of-concept</italic> study, we selected optical coherence tomography (OCT), an established intravascular imaging technique which, due to a supreme resolution (up to 10–20 µm), is able to depict peri-luminal structures with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgmaier et al., 2014</xref>). Based on the images obtained, we generated patient-specific reconstructions of coronary plaques, which we used as a basis to analyze stress concentration as a possible predictor of plaque rupture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Population and lesion characteristics</title><p>Of the 20 patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in this study, 10 underwent coronary angiography due to acute coronary syndrome and 10 due to chronic coronary syndrome.

The main morphologic characteristic that emerged from previous studies is FCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>), which has been constantly related to a higher incidence of plaque rupture. This is not surprising, considering its role as the last barrier resisting the stresses exerted on the atheroma and thus preventing plaque rupture. Measuring FCT, in this perspective, is indirectly assessing the mechanical resistance – and thus the protection – of the coronary plaque to rupture. But the decrease of this protection in cases of a low FCT cannot completely determine plaque rupture, which arises from the difference between protection exerted by the fibrous cap and its disrupting forces. Data on these disrupting forces as the <italic>primum movens</italic> of plaque rupture are still very scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loree et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finet et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, in this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to assess stress concentrations on and determined by coronary plaques in vivo and analyzed their relationship with plaque rupture. To perform this analysis, we developed a morpho-mechanic model reconstructed from in vivo OCT images.</p><p>Previous pioneering studies could show the applicability of finite-element analysis to the assessment of the biomechanics of the atherosclerotic plaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loree et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>). However, pathology-based simulations lack a direct applicability in patient care. Other studies, although based on intravascular imaging, were based on single lesions, which were analyzed on a qualitative basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Reith et al., 2019</xref>). On the contrary, our study is to the best of our knowledge first to perform complex mechanistic analysis of coronary plaques based on high-definition intravascular imaging on a patient-specific level, with a high potential for direct clinical application.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stress concentration is closely associated to plaque rupture</title><p>First, we could in vivo detect higher stress concentrations both within the fibrous cap and within the whole plaque in ruptured plaques compared to non-ruptured plaques. This is in line with previous simulation studies based on pathology specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loree et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>) and confirms our hypothesis of stress concentration as a central factor in the genesis of plaque rupture. As a further step in confirming this theory, we extended current knowledge by showing that plaque ruptures arise in the immediate proximity of maximal stress concentrations. This spatial coincidence between maximal stress concentrations and sites of plaque rupture confirms the causal link between plaque biomechanics on the one hand and plaque rupture and acute coronary syndromes on the other. In fact, on the basis of our data, it is tempting to speculate about the mechanistic process eventually leading to plaque rupture. Stress within the fibrous cap and overall within the plaque is concentrated in a pattern which is closely dependent on the morphology of the plaque (for instance, in dependence of the extent and morphology of the necrotic lipid core and/or of calcification). A specific force is exerted on each point of the fibrous cap; should this stress concentration trespass the ultimate tensile strength of the vessel wall – which is highly likely to happen in points of maximal stress concentration – material failure and, eventually, plaque rupture occurs.</p><p>An interesting question is, of course, the magnitude of the threshold that needs to be trespassed to cause material failure and plaque rupture. A previous pathology-based study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1993</xref> sets the stress threshold for plaque rupture to 300 kPa. In our study, we found 150.5 kPa in the fibrous cap and 169.5 kPa in the vessel wall to be the optimal thresholds for predicting plaque rupture. The difference between these values and the initially estimated threshold of 300 kPa may be explained through the different imaging modalities used to reconstruct the coronary plaque. In fact, in pathology specimens (on which the 300 kPa value is based on), the fixation process may cause a shrinkage of the fibrous cap with a shortening of ca. 10–20% compared to the thickness measured in vivo with OCT. This effect may be sufficient to explain the numerical difference of the ‘critical’ peak cap stress needed for plaque rupture, especially considering – as pointed out by Finet et al. – that the relationship between FCT and peak cap stress is exponential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finet et al., 2004</xref>). Further clinical validation of these thresholds is, however, needed. Another possible explanation might be the hyperelastic behavior of certain plaque components, which has been described by some authors previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardoso et al., 2014</xref>); such an effect is, however, only present at large displacements (&gt;20–30% of the initial dimensions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobielarz et al., 2020</xref>), which are way over the average displacements reported in our study. In this range, a linear equation adequately depicts the behavior of the material. Also, stress on the lesion in patients is not only derived from the static factors included in our analysis, but also dynamic flow shear stress caused by blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourantas et al., 2020</xref>), which was not included in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential clinical utility of finite-element analysis in predicting plaque rupture</title><p>Although dynamic flow shear stress was not included in our analysis, we could also show an excellent diagnostic efficiency of our finite-element analysis in predicting plaque rupture. Furthermore, the model we developed presented a clearly superior diagnostic efficiency compared with accepted parameters of plaque vulnerability as FCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>) or plaque macrophage infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Uemura et al., 2012</xref>) and a numerically superior efficiency when compared to lipid volume index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2012</xref>) in our cohort. The diagnostic efficiency of our model even presented a comparable efficiency when compared with the combination of lesion morphologies including FCT, plaque macrophage infiltration, and lipid volume index. In the light of these findings, it may be tempting to speculate about the strong link existing between stress concentrations and plaque rupture, which may explain the excellent predictive value of our model and may pave the way for widespread use of morpho-mechanical analysis in the clinical routine to detect vulnerable plaques.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, although we are first to develop an OCT-based finite-element model allowing patient-specific analysis of plaque biomechanics, several limitations have to be acknowledged. First of all, we faithfully reproduced plaque morphology in a 2D-based reconstruction; on the other hand, we are not taking into account several phenomena that may influence stress concentration, as for instance the longitudinal structure of the plaque or the longitudinal profile of the stenosis and flow shear stress – the relevance of these factors needs to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Furthermore, in spite of the excellent resolution of OCT in the near field, we cannot exclude imprecisions in the segmentation due to limited light penetration to the deeper vessel wall. Limited tissue penetration, in fact, does not allow to assess sites with positive remodeling, which may yield higher stresses due to accelerated plaque growth and therefore cause a higher rupture risk. This needs to be assessed through different imaging modalities, such as IVUS or coronary computed tomography. Moreover, dedicated computational techniques in order to reconstruct the deep structure of the lipid core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kok et al., 2016</xref>) have not been employed, in order to simplify plaque reconstruction; moderate imprecisions in the deep contour of the lipid core cannot therefore be excluded.</p><p>For our study, we employed a linear elastic model; other authors, though, suggest an hyperelastic behavior of the vessel wall, particularly for displacements &gt; 20% of the initial dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobielarz et al., 2020</xref>). In spite of an average displacement ‘small enough’ (10%) to justify linearity, we cannot exclude underestimation of stress concentrations for very few plaques with larger displacements.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, although being the first to employ a morpho-metric approach in assessing plaque vulnerability on in vivo intravascular imaging, this pilot study still includes a low number of patients chosen among patients with and without plaque rupture, which may reduce the reliability of exact AUC and cut-off values in our predictive models; further analyses are needed to confirm the results of our proof-of-concept analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient population</title><p>We retrospectively selected 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CAD, who underwent OCT prior to percutaneous coronary intervention at the Department of Cardiology of the University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen. Clinical presentation was stable CAD without evidence of plaque rupture in the OCT pullback (n = 10) or acute coronary syndrome with plaque rupture (n = 10). Sample size calculation was performed based on previous results of calculation of mechanical stresses in histopathological samples, resulting in a minimal sample size of seven lesions per group in order to achieve α = 0.001 and power of 0.95; this was then arbitrarily rounded to 10 lesions per group. Informed consent of all patients was obtained prior to inclusion in the study.

In particular, as widely employed in clinical practice and in previous intravascular imaging studies, FCT is measured at different sites (conventionally 3) per frame, with an analysis performed on different frames in 0.1–0.2 mm intervals. Usually, the rupture is localized in a single point or in a localized area of the cap, not impeding measurement even in the frame(s) with evident rupture, though in slightly different sites.</p><p>In order to combine different features of plaque vulnerability for comparison with results of morpho-mechanical analysis, we calculated two different, established scores. The score validated in a publication from Burgmaier et al. (following: Burgmaier Score) is calculated as −2.401 + 1.568 * (insert one if macrophages present; else 0) + 2.639 * (medium lipid arc in multiples of 90°) + 0.255 * (lipid plaque length in mm) − 0.738 * (minimal FCT in multiples of 10 μm), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgmaier et al., 2014</xref>).

In ruptured plaques, the frame immediately preceding the site of the rupture was chosen; this was based on the consideration that, due to rupture of the fibrous cap and to the present artifacts (caused for instance by thrombotic material), exact reconstruction of the rupture site may be inaccurate. For stable lesions, the frame with the minimal lumen area was selected; this was based on the need to select in a uniform way the site with the most advanced plaque development, assuming only a negative remodeling. After image selection, the operator (AM) was blinded to clinical presentation, as each frame was marked with a random ID. The selected image was then scaled 10:1 previous to segmentation of the different components of the atherosclerotic plaque, which was manually performed using commercial software (AutoCAD 2017, AutoDesk INC, San Rafael, CA). Plaque composition was analyzed according to the Consensus standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tearney et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically for segmentation, we first delineated the vessel lumen, defined as the signal-poor region centrally located in the OCT image. We then proceeded to tracing the boundaries of the fibrous cap, which was defined as the signal-rich region surrounding the lumen; for clarity’s sake, this area will be denominated fibrous cap also when overlying a calcific or fibrocalcific plaque. When present, we segmented the necrotic lipid core, which was identified as a signal-poor region with poorly delineated borders, a fast signal drop-off, and little or no signal backscattering. When present, calcifications have also been segmented; as calcifications we considered signal-poor or heterogeneous regions with a sharply delineated border. In case of non-detectable borders of each of the segmented components due to artifacts or to the limited penetration of light, we delineated contours with the automatic interpolation function of the software. We conventionally shaped the coronary vessel as a cylinder and set its external diameter to 4 mm.

This is a consequence of the very limited number of samples used for mechanical testing, of the need for pre-treatment of pathology samples (which may potentially alter their mechanical properties), and of the intrinsic difficulty of the measurement of some properties (specifically, the Poisson’s ratio, which is only indirectly measurable). In particular, some authors hypothesized an incompressible behavior of the vessel wall, which would lead to a Poisson’s ratio of 0.48 for this component (instead of 0.27 as used in our simulations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, very different values of stiffness of calcifications have been detected and employed in previous studies, ranging from about 10 MPa for mildly calcified tissues to even 17–25 GPa emulating the properties of bone tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loree et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobielarz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holzapfel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalane et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, the use of smaller Young’s moduli is justified by the inhomogeneity of macrocalcifications, which may be only partly constituted by crystalline calcium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; this could be associated, in previous studies, to the density of calcifications in computed tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalane et al., 2018</xref>). Though, as calcium density is not defined in OCT, we preferred to use 10 GPa, as the Young’s modulus of crystalline calcium, as calcification’s stiffness. Nevertheless, in order to exclude a relevant impact of these assumptions on our stress analysis, we assessed stress distribution in the presence of different assumptions.

Then, results of stress analysis for both the fibrous cap and the overall vessel wall were reported on the OCT-image of the rupture site, correlating them to anatomic landmarks (morphology of lumen; morphology of the fibrous cap; presence of calcifications, lipid deposits, cholesterol crystals, or macrophage accumulations).

Furthermore, in order to validate the finite-element simulation, we correlated results obtained in different models and after segmentation through different operators using one-way random effects model; results were expressed as intraclass correlation coefficient. We performed ROC analysis to validate diagnostic value of the results of simulation models as well as ‘classical’ features of plaque vulnerability (FCT, lipid volume index, extent of plaque macrophages infiltration) in predicting plaque rupture.

In order to evaluate the value of a combination of OCT-derived morphologic parameters to predict plaque rupture, we performed multivariable logistic regression including minimal or mean FCT, lipid volume index, and macrophage volume index.

This new method may offer valuable insights on the interplay between various plaque components in the determination of the net vulnerability of a plaque, bringing stress concentrations – the disrupting force of plaque rupture – back into clinical practice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>EDLs postdoctoral position at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is funded via a research fellowship of the Alexander-von-Humboldt Foundation.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital of the RWTH Aachen (EK 071/11 and EK 277/12) and is in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.Informed consent of all patients was obtained prior to inclusion in the study.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the mesh.</title><p>Maximum and minimum element size, respectively, limits how big and how small each mesh element can be.

model</title><p>In order to test some possible limitations of our models, we performed several analyses and controls.</p><p>Firstly, we analyzed the magnitude of the displacements of the simulated components of the vessel wall. Average displacement was 0.39 ± 0.45 mm. These values are compatible with the biological dimensions of the considered vessel. Due to this average displacement of approximately 10% of the original dimensions of the considered vessel (4 mm), we assumed the linear elasticity of the vessel wall for further analysis, as previous publication showed a hyperelastic behavior starting from much larger deformations (&gt;20–30%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobielarz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, in order to analyze the effects of considering vessel ends as fixed constraints, we performed finite-element analysis both with and without these boundary conditions. We could detect no relevant difference between these two scenarios in the exemplarily analyzed vessels (respectively, intraclass correlation coefficients 0.998 for maximal stress in the fibrous cap, 1.000 for maximal stress in the whole plaque, and 1.000 for maximal displacement). An example of the stress distributions and displacements with and without constraint is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. As the calculated difference was minimal (&lt;5%), for further analyses we employed the model without constraints on the vessel ends.</p><p>Then, in order to assess the magnitude of edge effects, we analyzed stresses in 2 mm intervals along the vessel axis. Exemplary results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>. As expected, differences were minimal (&lt;5%) between following sections and approximately symmetrical with respect to the vessel ends, which led us to consider the cross-sections with a distance of 5 mm from each end for further analyses.</p><p>As biomechanical properties of atherosclerotic coronary vessel are not unanimously accepted in the literature due to the scarcity of data and the difficulty of measurement, we aimed to test the robustness of our model by assessing the variations of stress concentrations in the presence of different assumptions. By accepting the hypothesis of incompressible materials advanced in some previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2009</xref>) and thus setting a Poisson’s ratio of 0.48, no significant difference in MPS could be detected in the overall population (MPS: 244.5 ± 234.4 kPa with ν = 0.27 vs. 240.4 ± 248.2 kPa with ν = 0.48; p=0.433; intraclass correlation coefficient 0.996). This reflects previous findings that variations of the Poisson’s ratio does not play a major role in plaque biomechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldewsing et al., 2004</xref>). Due to the minimal impact of this assumption on results of our analysis, we employed the Poisson’s ratios indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for further analysis.</p><p>Similarly, as properties of calcification may vary due to the density of calcium in the intravascular calcification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Loree et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobielarz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holzapfel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahalane et al., 2018</xref>), we rerun our finite-element analysis including a much lower stiffness (1 MPa) for calcifications. In the overall population, this had no significant impact on stress concentration (MPS: 244.5 ± 234.4 kPa with E<sub>Calcification</sub> = 10 GPa vs. 246.1 ± 242.1 kPa with E<sub>Calcification</sub> = 1 MPa; p=0.753; intraclass correlation coefficient 0.996). As this effect may be due to the limited incidence of calcified plaques in our study (n = 5, 20%), we assessed the role played by a lower stiffness of calcification in stress concentration in this specific subgroup of lesions.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work presents results on the finite element analysis of OCT-reconstructed plaque &quot;3D-models&quot; of 10 ruptured and 10 non-ruptured lesions. The manuscript is well written and structured. The results are found to be of great interest for the assessment of the plaque rupture risk in patients. The study confirms the excellent correlation between the location of the maximum stress in the arterial tissue and the location of the plaque rupture already reported by the authors in a previous study (Reith et al., Cardiovasasc Diabetol 2019; 18(1): 122). In addition, the study finds that in the ruptured lesions, the maximal stress in the fibrous cap and vessel wall were significantly higher than in the non-ruptured plaques. So, the stress concentration excellently predicts plaque rupture, underlying the importance of morpho-mechanic analysis to assess the disrupting effects of plaque stress. However, the ROC curves for the prediction of plaque rupture indicate an Optimal cut-off stress of 150kPa and 169.5kPa for the fiber cap and the plaque respectively. This threshold value is significantly lower than the threshold value of 300kPa reported in literature. The authors explain this difference through the different imaging modalities used to reconstruct the coronary plaque. However, a more plausible explanation can be found in the finite element model itself, in particular in the mechanical properties used for the analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. In the introduction the authors mention among the accepted features of plaque vulnerability: thickness of the fibrous cap, the extent of necrotic lipid core. However, recent studies also indicate the positive remodeling index, low-attenuation plaque, and plaque burden as significant markers of plaque vulnerability. I suggest to extend the literature review in this regard and to also include a recent analysis published in Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging. 2017 Oct 1;18(10):1170-1178. doi: 10.1093/ehjci/jew200. PMID: 27679600.</p><p>2. Stress analysis considered an oversimplified model for the tissues. The authors make reference to rather old publications [14] 1992, [15] 1993, [16 ] 2004, [17] 2019 that do not certainly provide adequate information. The stress field, and therefore the peak stress value, will be significantly affected by the adopted mechanical model for the tissue. You are assuming the vessel wall with a Poisson's ratio of ~0.3 when in reality it is a quasi-incompressible material with a Poisson ratio ~0.5. In addition, the authors are using a value for the initial Young modulus for the calcification that is 4 orders of magnitude larger than those reported in literature. A similar observation is made for the arterial tissue, assumed as linear elastic when in reality is non-linear. Using a non-linear hyper-elastic material model for the arterial wall and the plaque will significantly affect the peak wall stress in ruptured and non-ruptured plaques and could modify the ROC curves. In conclusion, the authors should rerun the finite element analysis of all models with adequate material parameters. Please check the work by Yang et al. IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 56(10): 2420-2428 (2009), and references within to update the material parameters used in your analysis and rerun the simulations. Make sure you are using a quasi-incompressible material by imposing a Poisson's ratio of at least 0.48 in the case that a hybrid finite element formulation is not available in the software.</p><p>3. Also, the reviewers recommend including a comment regarding the choice of the frame with the minimal lumen area for stable lesions in the Section &quot;Manual segmentation and reconstruction&quot;, just for completeness. In the case of ruptured plaques, the reviewers think that the frame immediately preceding the site of the rupture is the best choice. However, in the case of non-ruptured plaques, the choice of the frame with the minimal lumen area is the more intuitive from an engineering point of view, while from a clinical point of view it could be also interesting to assess a section with a positive remodeling, if present.</p><p>4. The 3D model was reconstructed by extruding the segmented section for a total length of 10mm. At this point, the results are equivalent to considering a plane-strain model of the plaque i.e., a 2D model. This will significantly reduce the computational cost and significantly simplify the analysis of the results. This fact is demonstrated in Suppl. Figure 3 that show the same results in sections C, D, and E, away from the end caps were boundary effects make the stress field unreliable.

Insert a comment in the limitations regarding the sample size. Twenty plaques are not a small number but maybe not sufficiently large as to completely ensure the conclusions of the manuscript. The results are very promising though.</p><p>6. Although the authors aptly analyzed the correlation between biomechanical stress and other plaque characteristics, it would be even better and more clinically applicable if the authors could combine the aforementioned factors as a single prediction tool, such as scoring system or a simplified formula to ease its application.</p><p>7.

We agree that the choice of input data for FEM simulations in coronary plaque analysis is a complex topic, especially regarding materials properties which are difficult to measure directly, e.g. Poisson´s ratio. Moreover, mechanical values are not measured on in vivo samples, but on animal or human specimen collected post mortem and treated for preservation, which may alter their properties. We briefly commented on it in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In order to follow the reviewer´s suggestions, we performed the required experiments by 1) accepting the hypothesis of incompressible materials (setting ν≈0.5) and 2) setting the Young´s modulus of calcification at 1 MPa. However, this did not relevantly change the results of our analysis. In order to further improve our manuscript and in order to address the reviewer´s point, we include these analyses in the revised Supplementary Results. Since these assumptions do not meet overall consensus in the literature and, most importantly, do not show a significant effect on stress concentrations, we chose to also show our initial model (ν=0.27, E<sub>Calcification</sub>=10GPa) in the manuscript.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers suggested to use a hyperelastic model to better simulate the mechanical behavior of the materials upon larger displacements. Though, the material properties assumed in the literature for hyperelastic behavior of the vessel wall are often extrapolated by single sample analysis and very different in the studies considered. After thoughtful consideration, we maintained a linear elastic model, because in most simulations the resulting displacement field is lower than 20% [Kobielarz M, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater. 2020] of the vessel lumen approximate diameter (average displacement: 0.39±0.45mm). Therefore, deformations can still be considered as „small enough“ to justify the linearity. We agree that for larger displacement fields, a hyperelastic model could better describe the vessel behavior and in turn increase the calculated Peak Cap Stress or Maximum Plaque Stress; this seems to be the case, though, starting from a displacement ratio of 1.2 – a condition not commonly met in our simulations. As the reviewer´s point is well taken, though, we included this in the Limitation section.</p><p>Methods, Finite elements analysis,</p><p>“Nevertheless, in the literature there is no consensus regarding mechanical properties of the atherosclerotic plaque. […] If not differently specified, the data presented in the rest of the manuscript derive from the model using constants shown in Table 2.”</p><p>Suppl. Results, Validation of the finite element analysis model,</p><p>“Firstly, we analyzed the magnitude of the displacements of the simulated components of the vessel wall. […] Again, no significant difference could be detected (MPS in calcified lesions: 115.3 kPa with ECalcification=10GPa vs. 114.1±137.3 kPa with ECalcification=1MPa; p=0.954). Again, in the light of the very small variations of the results, we employed the Poisson´s ratios indicated in Table1 for further analysis.”</p><p>Discussion, Stress concentrations…,</p><p>“Further clinical validation of these thresholds is, however, needed. Another possible explanation might be the hyperelastic behavior of certain plaque components, which has been described by some authors previously [Yang C et al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2009; Cardoso L et al., J Biomech. 2014]; such an effect is, however, only present at large displacements (&gt;20-30% of the initial dimensions) [Yang C et al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2009; Kobielarz M, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater. 2020], which are way over the average displacements reported in our study. In this range, a linear equation adequately depicts the behavior of the material.”</p><p>Discussion, Limitations,</p><p>“For our study, we employed a linear elastic model; other authors, though, suggest an hyperelastic behavior of the vessel wall, particularly for displacements&gt;20% of the initial dimensions [Yang C et al., IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2009; Kobielarz M, J Mech Behav Biomed Mater. 2020]. In spite of an average displacement “small enough” (10%) to justify linearity, we cannot exclude underestimation of stress concentrations for very few plaques with larger displacements.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Also, the reviewers recommend including a comment regarding the choice of the frame with the minimal lumen area for stable lesions in the Section &quot;Manual segmentation and reconstruction&quot;, just for completeness.

However, in the case of non-ruptured plaques, the choice of the frame with the minimal lumen area is the more intuitive from an engineering point of view, while from a clinical point of view it could be also interesting to assess a section with a positive remodeling, if present.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out to us. We commented on the frame selection in the revised text. Regarding positive remodeling, we agree with the reviewer that these areas may be interesting in a clinical perspective; however, it must be noted that OCT, due to its limited tissue penetration, is not adequately suitable to assess positive remodeling. As this remains a limitation, we acknowledged it in the “Limitations” section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Methods, Manual segmentation and reconstruction,</p><p>“In order to obtain a patient-specific model of the coronary plaque, we selected a single frame from every OCT-pullback. In ruptured plaques, the frame immediately preceding the site of the rupture was chosen; this was based on the consideration that, due to rupture of the fibrous cap and to the presents artefacts (caused for instance by thrombotic material), exact reconstruction of the rupture site may be largely inaccurate. For stable lesions, the frame with the minimal lumen area was selected; this was based on the need to select in a uniform way the site with the most pronounced plaque development, assuming only a negative remodeling.”</p><p>Discussion, Limitations,</p><p>“Furthermore, in spite of the excellent resolution of OCT in the near-field, we cannot exclude imprecisions in the segmentation due to limited light penetration to the deeper vessel wall. Limited tissue penetration, in fact, does not allow to assess sites with positive remodeling, which may yield higher stresses due to accelerated plaque growth and therefore cause a higher rupture risk. This needs to be assessed through different imaging modalities, such as IVUS or coronary computed tomography.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
