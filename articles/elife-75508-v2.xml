CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> double negative (DN) stage to CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive (DP) stage prior to the formation of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper and CD8<sup>+</sup> cytolytic T cells ready for circulation. Each developmental stage is tightly regulated by sequentially operating molecular networks, of which only limited numbers of transcription regulators have been deciphered. Here, we identified Zfp335 transcription factor as a new player in the regulatory network controlling thymocyte development in mice. We demonstrate that <italic>Zfp335</italic> intrinsically controls DN to DP transition, as T-cell-specific deficiency in <italic>Zfp335</italic> leads to a substantial accumulation of DN3 along with reduction of DP, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes. This developmental blockade at DN stage results from the impaired intracellular TCRβ (iTCRβ) expression as well as increased susceptibility to apoptosis in thymocytes. Transcriptomic and ChIP-seq analyses revealed a direct regulation of transcription factors <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> by Zfp335. Importantly, enhanced expression of TCRβ and <italic>Bcl6/Rorc</italic> restores the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition and improves thymocytes survival, respectively. These findings identify a critical role of <italic>Zfp335</italic> in controlling T-cell development by maintaining iTCRβ expression-mediated β-selection and independently activating cell survival signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thymocyte</kwd><kwd>T-cell development</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>β-selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3217080356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Baojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Baojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Major International Joint Research Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81820108017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Baojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetically modified mouse model and comprehensive analysis reveal the molecular mechanisms regulating early T-cell development through intracellular TCRβ expression-mediated β-selection and independent cell survival signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T-cell development proceeds in a series of developmental stages, which is precisely orchestrated by multiple signaling and molecular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosokawa and Rothenberg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López-Rodríguez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothenberg, 2014</xref>). Prethymic progenitor cells originated from bone marrow migrate into the thymus and sequentially differentiate into CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> (DN), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (DP), and the CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> (SP) stage. Based on the expression of CD44 and CD25, DN thymocytes are divided into several phenotypically distinct stages, including DN1 to DN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rothenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yui and Rothenberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurd and Robey, 2016</xref>). In the presence of Notch signaling, early thymic progenitor (ETP)-DN1 cells transit into DN2a stage, initiating the T-cell lineage commitment, which is immediately accompanied by TCRβ gene arrangement. The majority of DN2 cells enter the DN3 stage with αβ lineage potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Godfrey et al., 1993</xref>). Only DN3 cells with a complete pre-TCR complex, which consists of the functional TCRβ protein, pre-Tα (pTα) chain, and CD3 molecule, can successfully trigger the subsequent maturation into DN4 and DP thymocytes. Further differentiation into mature CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells requires positive and negative selection at DP stage before they migrate to peripheral lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dudley et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">von Boehmer and Fehling, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malissen et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Pre-TCR signals regulate thymocyte differentiation by mediating protection from apoptosis, stimulating proliferation, and inducing allelic exclusion at the TCRβ locus in post-β-selection DN3b cells and promoting DN to DP transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aifantis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kruisbeek et al., 2000</xref>). Inactivation of pre-TCR components dampens T-lymphocyte development by arresting thymocytes at the DN3 stage and inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fehling et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malissen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mombaerts et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mombaerts et al., 1992b</xref>). Multiple transcription factors downstream of pre-TCR signaling are involved in T-cell differentiation and survival. The major pre-TCR signaling is conducted through the dose-dependent expression of Notch controlled by the Id3–E2A axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Abrogation of either Notch or E2A expression may lead to the developmental block of thymocytes at multiple stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shah and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belle and Zhuang, 2014</xref>). In addition, activation of NF-κB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voll et al., 2000</xref>), Ets1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eyquem et al., 2004</xref>), and NFAT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berga-Bolaños et al., 2013</xref>) by pre-TCR signals also contributes to the developmental block. The transcription factor T-cell factor 1 (TCF1), together with its downstream Bcl-11b, not only increases the potential to differentiate into T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ikawa et al., 2010</xref>), but also positively regulates thymocyte development via promoting TCRβ recombination and expression, as well as DP cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Apart from the essential role in the T follicular helper cell lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2009</xref>), Bcl6 induced by pre-TCR signals is also involved in the DN to DP transition and protection of DN4 cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solanki et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, abrogation of Rorc expression in thymocytes leads to a decreased DP proportion and impaired DP survival in a Bcl-xl-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although pre-TCR signaling is crucial for the β-selection checkpoint, it is not sufficient for progression to the DN3 stage. Other pathways or transcription factors coupled with or independent of conventional pre-TCR signaling are found to play important roles in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciofani et al., 2004</xref>). The developmental blockade in <italic>Smarca5-</italic> or <italic>Nkap</italic>-deficient thymocytes is confirmed by intact pre-TCR signals in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pajerowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zikmund et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, it remains largely unknown which factors are crucial for T-cell development through mechanisms independent of pre-TCR signaling.</p><p>Zfp335, also known as the nuclear hormone receptor coregulator (NRC) – interacting factor 1 (NIF-1), is a zinc finger protein with a 13 C2H2 zinc finger repeating structure consisting of 1337 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>). The C2H2-ZF family encodes more than 700 proteins in the human genome, some of which play important roles in ontogenesis, immune cell differentiation, and disease occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heizmann et al., 2018</xref>), yet the biological characteristics and functions of most members are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stubbs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Emerson and Thomas, 2009</xref>). Zfp335 regulates gene transcription by recruiting H3K4 methyltransferase complexes, interacting with coactivators, or directly binding to certain gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahajan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>). Zfp335 plays important regulatory roles in early embryonic development and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Germline knockout of Zfp335 is embryonic lethal, while deletion of Zfp335 gene in nerve cells impairs the proliferation and differentiation of nerve progenitor cells in mice, eventually leading to severe microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Function of Zfp335 in T-cell development has been observed in the study of the <italic>Zfp335bloto</italic> allele, a missense mutation derived from ENU mutagenesis. While thymocyte development is not significantly affected by this hypomorph mutation, there is a significant reduction in the number of peripheral T cells due to defects in the maturation and migration of thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2014</xref>). Without loss of function studies, it remains to be determined whether Zfp335 is required for intrathymic T-cell development.</p><p>In this study, we investigated Zfp335 expression during different thymocyte stages, as well as its function at the β-selection checkpoint and during DN to DP transition. We found that in the thymus, Zfp335 has the highest expression in DN3 thymocytes. Zfp335 is indispensable for thymocyte β-selection and supports the transition from DN to DP stage by maintaining intracellular TCRβ (iTCRβ) expression, as well as by promoting DN and DP thymocyte survival via directly regulating <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impaired thymic αβ T-cell development in <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient mice</title><p>To study the role of Zfp335 in T-cell development, we first assessed the expression of Zfp335 among different thymocyte subsets, including DN3, DN4, DP, CD4, CD8, NKT, and γδ T cells. We found that DN3 cells displayed a relatively high level of <italic>Zfp335</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis also revealed that Zfp335 protein had the highest expression in DN3 thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Consistently, microarray data from ImmGen showed higher expression of <italic>Zfp335</italic> specifically at the DN3a stage during T-cell development from ETP to CD4/CD8 SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although RNA-seq data from ImmGen exhibited the highest expression of <italic>Zfp335</italic> in DP thymocytes, a gradually increased expression was observed from ETP to DN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Given the importance of DN3 stage during β-selection checkpoint, we obtained T-cell-specific <italic>Zfp335</italic> mice by crossing <italic>Zfp335<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> strain with Lck-Cre strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). <italic>Zfp335</italic> deletion was confirmed by real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis in DN4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>LckCre<sup>+</sup>Zfp335<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (KO) mice exhibited significantly smaller thymi and drastically decreased thymocyte numbers than WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further analysis showed that both percentages and numbers of DP cells, as well as CD4 SP and CD8 SP cells, were considerably reduced in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Conversely, the percentage of DN cells was increased by nearly 10–15-folds, although the total number was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In secondary lymphoid organs, we also observed reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the spleen and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–J</xref>). Thus, Zfp335 is essential for the development of αβT cells in the thymus.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Impaired thymocyte development in <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DN3, DN4, DP, CD4, CD8, NKT, and γδT cells were sorted from C57BL/6 thymocytes by flow cytometry.

Zfp335 deficiency in T cells led to a significant loss of DP, CD4 SP, and CD8 SP cells while an accumulation of DN3 cells. Mechanistically, the developmental blockade is attributed to both impaired pre-TCR signal and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Serving as a transcription factor, Zfp335 directly promotes <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> expression in DN thymocytes to ensure their survival during early development.</p><p>Zfp335 was previously demonstrated to be crucial for early embryonic development as homozygous deletion of this gene resulted in neonatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garapaty et al., 2009</xref>). Conditional knockout of <italic>Zfp335</italic> in neural system led to severely reduced cortical size and impaired neurogenesis. Mechanistically, Zfp335 was required for neural progenitor cell self-renewal and proliferation, and neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) and neuronal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Besides, deficiency of naive T cells in mice carrying a hypomorph allele of <italic>Zfp335</italic> (<italic>Zfp335<sup>bloto</sup></italic>) uncovered its role in immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2014</xref>). So far, there is still very limited information about the functions of Zfp335 in other aspects of immune system. Here, we found that Zfp335 is absolutely required for multiple steps of early T-cell development. Of note, it will be worth investigating whether and how Zfp335 is involved in the regulation of mature T-cell differentiation and functions under static and immunized conditions in future.</p><p>We have shown that Zfp335 expression was upregulated specifically in DN3 thymocytes and significantly decreased in the subsequent stages, suggesting a critical role at the DN3 stage. Of note, loss of Zfp335 led to a dramatic reduction in both thymus size and thymocyte number. The accumulation of DN3 cells results from an intrinsic mechanism that hinders the transition from DN3 to DN4 stage, leading to the reduction of DP thymocytes and mature T cells in the periphery. These data are in line with another recent study reporting that <italic>Zfp335</italic> mutation led to a reduction in peripheral T cells as a result of defective naive T cells and SP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2014</xref>). However, given the intact thymic selection with <italic>Zfp335</italic> mutation, the report was inconsistent with our observation of decreased β-selection with Zfp335 deficiency. The discrepancy is likely due to the different approaches used to disrupt Zfp335 function since a single-nucleotide missense mutation of Zfp335 may affect its function differently. Nevertheless, by knocking out the entire Zfp335 protein, we provide evidence that Zfp335 is indispensable for early thymocyte development.</p><p>Thymocyte β-selection is a critical developmental checkpoint allowing for the progression from DN3 to DN4 stage and the maintenance of DP cell numbers, which is primarily dependent on TCRβ and pre-TCR signals constituted with a functional iTCRβ paired with a pTα chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamasaki and Saito, 2007</xref>). Pre-TCR signaling regulates thymocytes differentiation, proliferation, and survival in the full developmental process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch and Radtke, 2011</xref>). In addition, there are reports that other pathways or transcription factors coupled with or independent of conventional pre-TCR signaling are found to play important roles in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciofani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pajerowski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zikmund et al., 2019</xref>). While <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient DN4 cells exhibited no defects in the rearrangement of TCRβ chain genes and pTα gene expression, our results clearly demonstrated that Zfp335 deficiency markedly impaired iTCRβ expression and led to an unbiased reduction of the majority of Vβ genes in DN4 populations. Future studies will investigate the mechanisms how Zfp335 regulates iTCRβ expression. Importantly, forced iTCRβ expression in DN3 and DN4 cells by transduction of OT1-TCR completely rescued the developmental impairment during the DN3-DN4 transition in <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient mice despite the failure to rescue the DN3, DN4, and DP population size. This suggests that Zfp335 controls the DN3–DN4 transition dependent on pre-TCR signals, but other mechanisms may also regulate the DP population size.</p><p>The large population of DP thymocytes is maintained by both cell proliferation and survival mechanisms. <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient DN3 and DN4 cells showed slightly higher or unchanged incorporation of BrdU, suggesting that cell proliferation was not affected. However, our data revealed a significant increase in apoptosis in <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient DN3 and DN4 thymocytes. Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq and qPCR) unveiled the downregulation of <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> signaling which are critically involved in thymocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solanki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xi et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, we have demonstrated that Zfp335, a transcription factor, direct bound to the promoter regions of <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> genes. More importantly, enhanced expression of <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> could improve thymocyte survival and substantially restore the DP thymocyte population. Trp53 deletion resulted in a partial recovery of DP cells, further supporting the role of <italic>Bcl6</italic> in <italic>Zfp335-</italic>controlled thymocyte survival. Of note, Zfp335 may also control thymocyte survival through directly regulating other targets.</p><p>In our study, Zfp335 is indispensable for thymocyte β-selection given that T-cell-specific deficiency in Zfp335 leads to impaired iTCRβ expression, blockade of thymocytes at DN stage as well as a substantial DN cell apoptosis. Though enhanced expression of TCRβ restores the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition, it had little impact on the population size of DN3, DN4, and DP cells, suggesting the regulation of Zfp335 on DN cell apoptosis through mechanisms more than β-selection. Indeed, we provided the evidence that Zfp335-controlled DN cell survival through regulating <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> expression. Moreover, Zfp335 regulates TCRβ expression independent on <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> since overexpression of neither <italic>Bcl6</italic> or <italic>Rorc</italic> in <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient DN3 thymocytes could restore the decreased iTCRβ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Several key factors have been shown to involve in the regulation of T-cell developmental process from DN3 to DP stages. Notch signaling is required for early T-cell commitment and β-selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radtke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciofani and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hosokawa and Rothenberg, 2018</xref>), which is subsequently weaken by Bcl6 repression for the differentiation from DN to DP stage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Solanki et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, our results found that Zfp335 could directly target <italic>Bcl6</italic>, and Zfp335 deficiency led to decreased expression of <italic>Bcl6</italic> and upregulation of Notch target genes such as <italic>Dtx1</italic> and <italic>Notch1</italic> (data not shown), which collectively contributing to the developmental block from DN to DP stage. In addition, Tcf1 plays a vital role in T-cell lineage commitment since <italic>Tcf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> DN3 thymocytes failed to progress to DN4 and subsequent DP stage through regulating <italic>Bcl11b</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Perez et al., 2020</xref>). Bcl11b and Gata3 also differentially regulate the differentiation and survival of thymocytes at DN3, DN4, and subsequent ISP stages via TCR or/and survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pai et al., 2003</xref>). However, we did not detect reduced expression of <italic>Tcf1</italic>, <italic>Bcl11b</italic>, or <italic>Gata3</italic> in <italic>Zfp335</italic>-deficient DN4 cells, suggesting that Zfp335 regulates DN3 to DP thymocyte development independent on these molecules.</p><p>In conclusion, our study reveals that the C2H2 zinc finger protein Zfp335 plays a novel and crucial role during thymocyte development, specifically during the transition from DN to DP stage. Mechanistically, Zfp335 promotes <italic>Bcl6</italic> and <italic>Rorc</italic> signaling to prevent thymocytes apoptosis and ensure the survival and differentiation of thymocytes. Collectively, we provide evidence that Zfp335 is essential for thymocyte development through both pre-TCR-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J background</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock No. 000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6-<italic>Zfp335tm1Caw</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock No. 022413</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6-Tg(<italic>TcraTcrb</italic>)1,100Mjb/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock No. 003831</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Common Name: OT-1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Tg(Lck-cre)548Jxm/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock No. 003802</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/002547">C3Ou.129S2(B6)-Trp53tm1Tyj/J</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock No. 002547</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-mouse CD4 APC/Cyanine7 (Rat monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 100414;

RNA isolation was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and quantity were detected by the Qubit RNA broad range assay in the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). After quality control using RNase-free agarose gel and Agilent 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), RNA-seq libraries were prepared by using 200 ng total RNA with TruSeq RNA sample prep kit (Illumina). Oligo(dT)-enriched mRNAs were fragmented randomly with fragmentation buffer, followed by first- and second-strand cDNA synthesis. After a series of terminal repair, the double-stranded cDNA library was obtained through PCR enrichment and size selection. cDNA libraries were sequenced with the Illumina Hiseq 2000 sequencer (Illumina HiSeq 2000 v4 Single-Read 50 bp) after pooling according to its expected data volume and effective concentration.</p><p>Two biological replicates were performed in the RNA-seq analysis. Raw reads were then aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using Tophat2 RNA-seq alignment software, and unique reads were retained to quantify gene expression counts from Tophat2 alignment files.

Anti-Zfp335 antibody (Novus) and Millipore 17-10,085 ChIP kit were used in the ChIP assay. Immunoprecipitated DNA was used for Illumina ChIP-seq sample preparation. In brief, 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were crosslinked to chromatin with 1% formaldehyde. Reaction was stopped with 0.125 M glycine. Cells were then resuspended in cold nuclear lysis buffer and sonicated to obtain DNA with ~300–500 bp size, followed by precipitation by incubation with immunoprecipitation-grade anti-Zfp335 antibody and Magnetic Protein A/G Beads overnight. The following day, beads were sequentially washed by low-salt, high-salt, LiCl, and TE buffers. Bound complexes were eluted in 150 μl of elution buffer at 62°C for 2 hr with shaking, followed by reversal of formaldehyde crosslinking at 95°C for 10 min. DNA was eventually purified with spin columns.</p><p>The concentration of immunoprecipitated DNA was detected by the Qubit DNA broad range assay in the Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). 10 ng immunoprecipitated DNA was prepared for sequencing using the Illumina ChIP-seq sample preparation protocol. Blunt-end DNA fragments were ligated to Illumina adaptors, amplified, and sequenced using the SE150 model. Raw reads were filtered firstly to remove low-quality or adaptor sequences by SOAPnuke (version 1.5.6). Clean reads were mapped to the reference genome of GRCm39 with SOAPaligner/soap2 (version 2.21t) using default settings. The MACS2 software (Version 2.1.1) was used to process peak calling. MACS (Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq) is a commonly used computational method which is designed to identify peaks from ChIP-seq data. MACS assigns every candidate region an enrichment p value, and targeted genes are identified as final peaks passing the threshold p value &lt; 1e−5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Better characterise the functional relationship between Zfp335 and β selection.</p><p>2. Control for the possibility that overexpression of Zfp335, Bcl6 or Rorc caused the effects in a Zfp335-independent manner by expressing the genes in a similar manner in WT cells.</p><p>3. Confirm stage-specific expression of Zfp335 with antibody staining.</p><p>4. Include information on cell counts.</p><p>5. Show the effects on pTα gene expression.</p><p>6. Explain how the downstream target genes were validated and triaged, including whether Bcl6 and RORc stood out from a bioinformatics perspective, or were selected based upon their known biology.</p><p>7. Justify the rationale for a 1:4 ratio of WT:KO</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>a) Overall the figures were clear and well laid out. However, it was sometimes quite complicated to decipher why there was a difference in the trends between % cells and cell counts (e.g. DN cells Figure 1 D versus E). I presume that this is because Zfp335 deficiency caused a drop in overall cell number but it might be helpful to show the overall cell counts data to help the reader interpret the data. The cell counts data should also be included in figure 2.</p><p>b) In the paper you identified a number of processes that were impacted by this transcription factor but did not look at the interaction between them. For instance, you demonstrated that intracellular TCRβ is reduced and apoptosis is increased by Zfp335 deficiency, and that forced expression of intracellular TCRβ partially elevated the effect on development but did not examine the effect on apoptosis. This would of be particularly interesting to examine given the recent work showing that pre-TCR increases the expression of Bcl6, which in turn protects DN4 cells from apoptosis (Development 2020 Oct 7;147(19):dev192203. doi: 10.1242/dev.192203).</p><p>c) The discussion would benefit from more discussion of the literature. I appreciate that there is only a limited amount of literature on the role of Zfp335, apart from the paper that you already mentioned, however you could discuss what is known about the role of this transcription factor in other developmental systems. Furthermore, it would be interesting to discuss how Zfp335 regulatory pathways compares to other regulatory pathways already known to control T cell development and how it might interplay.</p><p>d) In the discussion you state &quot;While Zfp335-deficient DN4 cells exhibited no defects in the rearrangement of TCRβ chain genes and pTα gene expression&quot;. My apologies if I missed it but I could find the pTα data</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this manuscript starts with an interesting developmental phenotype however there are several problems with the approaches and experimental details that I indicated above. These include: (a) disregarding experimental issues like assessing DN3a versus DN3b, which would have located the initiation of the defect, (b) failing to explain approaches like the 1 to 4 ratio of WT to KO in the mixed cultures and chimeras, (c) specifically focusing on downregulated genes, (d) failing to explain how they narrow down to 97+22 genes from the original 566 downregulated and 899 upregulated genes when they compare with the genes associated with ChIP-seq peaks, (e) failing to explain how they identify the genes associated with each peak (f) failing to control how the overexpression of Rorc and Bcl6 affects the development of WT cells. In view of all these widespread issues, this reviewer has serious problems with the interpretations and mechanistic conclusions of the manuscript</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study from Wang et al. The data presented is strong, thorough, well-controlled and largely support the conclusions made. However, I do have some suggestions that the authors should attempt to address.</p><p>1. While the qPCR analysis for Zfp335 expression validates the microarray data from ImmGen, this of course is still only RNA analysis. If would be good to validate the expression of Zfp335 protein, either by intracellular staining + FACS or by Western blotting of DN, DP and SP sorted cells. Commercial antibodies are available.</p><p>2. The authors showed that there is increased apoptosis of DN3 cells. Is this occurring pre-β-selection (DN3a) or post-β-select (DN3b)? Co-staining for additional markers, e.g. intracellular TCRbeta would address this. This is relevant given that authors suggest that the block is due to impaired i.c.TCRbeta expression.</p><p>3. Initially, the authors suggest that the block in Zfp335 knockout mice is due to impaired TCRbeta expression and that this can be rescued by the OT-1 transgene. However, they then suggest that Zfp335 functions by regulating Bcl6 and Rorc. How do the authors connect these two observations? Is the TCRb impairment a result of dysregulated Bcl6 and/or Rorc expression?</p><p>4. Bcl6 is normally expressed in DN3 thymocytes and regulates survival at that stage, while Rorc is normally expressed in DP thymocytes and regulates survival at that stage. The timing of Zfp335 expression aligns with Bcl6 but not with Rorc. How do the authors reconcile this discordance given that Zfp335 is downregulated in DP thymocytes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75508.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, it was sometimes quite complicated to decipher why there was a difference in the trends between % cells and cell counts (e.g. DN cells Figure 1 D versus E). I presume that this is because Zfp335 deficiency caused a drop in overall cell number but it might be helpful to show the overall cell counts data to help the reader interpret the data. The cell counts data should also be included in figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this advice. Indeed, the difference in the trends between % cells and cell counts in Figure 1D and 1E was a result of a dramatic reduction of overall cell number in the thymus caused by Zfp335 deficiency (Figure 1B). Following the suggestion, we have added the cell counts data for separate culture and separate transfer experiments, as well as ratio analysis for co-culture and co-transfer experiment in Figure2—figure supplement 1 of the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In the paper you identified a number of processes that were impacted by this transcription factor but did not look at the interaction between them. For instance, you demonstrated that intracellular TCRβ is reduced and apoptosis is increased by Zfp335 deficiency, and that forced expression of intracellular TCRβ partially elevated the effect on development but did not examine the effect on apoptosis. This would of be particularly interesting to examine given the recent work showing that pre-TCR increases the expression of Bcl6, which in turn protects DN4 cells from apoptosis (Development 2020 Oct 7;147(19):dev192203. doi: 10.1242/dev.192203).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for this interesting point. Following the suggestion, we examined the effect of forced expression of TCRβ on thymocyte apoptosis and the results revealed that DN3 and DN4 cells from OT1<sup>Tg</sup>KO mice exhibited similarly increased apoptosis with Zfp335 deletion (Figure5—figure supplement 4), suggesting Zfp335 affects thymocyte apoptosis in a TCR-independent manner.</p><p>In T cell development, β-selection promotes the transition from DN to DP cell, a process depending on the expression of pre-TCR signalling, which further provides signals for thymocyte proliferation and differentiation. In the Development 2020 paper (Solanki et al., 2020), it was reported that pre-TCR signaling induces Bcl6 expression which in turn inhibits DN4 apoptosis and promotes DN to DP transition. Whereas, increasing evidence have shown that TCR-independent signals also contribute to the survival and proliferation of thymocytes, such as IL7, Hedgehog and Wnt signalling (Staal et al., 2001; Outram et al., 2009; Rowbotham et al., 2009; Boudil et al., 2015).</p><p>In our study, Zfp335 is indispensable for thymocyte β-selection given that T cell-specific deficiency in Zfp335 leads to impaired intracellular TCRβ expression, blockade of thymocytes at DN stage as well as a substantial DN cell apoptosis. Though enhanced expression of TCRβ restores the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition, it had little impact on the population size of DN3, DN4 and DP cells, suggesting the regulation of Zfp335 on DN cell apoptosis through mechanisms more than β-selection. Indeed, we provided the evidence that Zfp335 controlled DN cell survival through regulating Bcl6 and Rorc expression.</p><p>We have added these data in Figure5—figure supplement 4A-C and corresponding discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The discussion would benefit from more discussion of the literature. I appreciate that there is only a limited amount of literature on the role of Zfp335, apart from the paper that you already mentioned, however you could discuss what is known about the role of this transcription factor in other developmental systems. Furthermore, it would be interesting to discuss how Zfp335 regulatory pathways compares to other regulatory pathways already known to control T cell development and how it might interplay.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the good suggestions. We have added comprehensive discussion about the role of Zfp335 in other developmental systems and how it interplays with other regulatory pathways in T cell development. The new discussion is attached as below.</p><p>“Zfp335 was previously demonstrated to be crucial for early embryonic development as homozygous deletion of this gene results in neonatal death (Garapaty et al., 2009). Conditional knockout of Zfp335 in neural system led to severely reduced cortical size and impaired neurogenesis. Mechanistically, ZNF335 is required for neural progenitor cell self-renewal and proliferation, and neuronal differentiation (Yang et al., 2012) and neuronal morphogenesis (Zhao et al., 2015). Besides, deficiency of naïve T cells in mice carrying a hypomorph allele of Zfp335 (Zfp335bloto) uncovered its role in immune system (Han et al., 2014). So far, there is still very limited information about the functions of Zfp335 in other aspects of immune system. Here we found that Zfp335 is absolutely required for multiple steps of early T cell development. Of note, it will be worth investigating whether and how Zfp335 is involved in the regulation of mature T cell differentiation and functions under static and immunized conditions in future.”</p><p>“Several key factors have been shown to involve in the regulation of T cell developmental process from DN3 to DP stages. Notch signaling is required for early T cell commitment and β-selection (Radtke et al., 2010; Ciofani and Zuniga-Pflucker, 2005; Hosokawa and Rothenberg, 2018), which is subsequently weaken by Bcl6 repression for the differentiation from DN to DP stage development (Solanki et al., 2020). Consistently, our results found that Zfp335 could directly target Bcl6, and Zfp335 deficiency led to decreased expression of Bcl6 and upregulation of Notch target genes such as Dtx1 and Notch1 (data not shown), which collectively contributing to the developmental block from DN to DP stage. In addition, Tcf1 plays a vital role in T cell lineage commitment since Tcf1-/- DN3 thymocytes failed to be progressed to DN4 and subsequent DP stage through regulating Bcl11b and GATA3 expression (Garcia-Perez et al., 2020). Bcl11b and GATA3 also differentially regulate the differentiation and survival of thymocytes at DN3, DN4 and subsequent ISP stages via TCR or/and survival signals (Inoue et al., 2006; Pai et al., 2003). However, we did not detect reduced expression of Tcf1, Bcl11b or GATA3 in Zfp335-deficient DN4 cells, suggesting that Zfp335 regulates DN to DP thymocyte development independent on these molecules”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In the discussion you state &quot;While Zfp335-deficient DN4 cells exhibited no defects in the rearrangement of TCRβ chain genes and pTα gene expression&quot;. My apologies if I missed it but I could find the pTα data.</p></disp-quote><p>The pTα expression was detected by qPCR in the Figure5—figure supplement 1 as its gene name ptcra.

To address this question, we examined the effect of Zfp335 deficiency on cell development of DN3a and DN3b. The results showed that the frequencies of both DN3a and DN3b were comparable between WT and Zfp335 deficient groups. However, both cell populations showed enhanced cell apoptosis in Zfp335 deficient cells, indicating that Zfp335 regulates thymocyte apoptosis in TCR-independent manners. Those data have been added in Figure4—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Failing to explain approaches like the 1 to 4 ratio of WT to KO in the mixed cultures and chimeras,</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for pointing out this detailed question. In the initial experiment, we tried co-culture of WT and KO DN3 cells at 1:1 ratio, however KO cells were rapidly competed out and was not ideally to perform further analysis.

Given that zinc finger protein Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor to positively regulate gene expression, we primarily focused on genes downregulated after Zfp335 deficiency to explore Zfp335 target genes.

In the RNA-seq data, 566 genes were downregulated using fold change&gt;1.25 as a cutoff. We expected more genes were included for pathway enrichment analysis.

MACS assigns every candidate region an enrichment p-value, and targeted genes were identified as final peaks passing the threshold p-value&lt;1e-5 (Feng et al., 2012, Nat Protoc, Feng et al., 2011, Curr Protoc Bioinformatics).

While the qPCR analysis for Zfp335 expression validates the microarray data from ImmGen, this of course is still only RNA analysis. If would be good to validate the expression of Zfp335 protein, either by intracellular staining + FACS or by Western blotting of DN, DP and SP sorted cells. Commercial antibodies are available.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for the good suggestion. We have measured the Zfp335 protein expression among DN (DN3 and DN4), DP and SP by FACS. The results showed that consistent with mRNA data, Zfp335 has the highest expression in DN3 thymocytes. This data has been added in Figure1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors showed that there is increased apoptosis of DN3 cells. Is this occurring pre-β-selection (DN3a) or post-β-select (DN3b)? Co-staining for additional markers, e.g. intracellular TCRbeta would address this.

The results showed that the frequencies of both DN3a and DN3b were comparable between WT and Zfp335 deficient groups.

Initially, the authors suggest that the block in Zfp335 knockout mice is due to impaired TCRbeta expression and that this can be rescued by the OT-1 transgene. However, they then suggest that Zfp335 functions by regulating Bcl6 and Rorc. How do the authors connect these two observations? Is the TCRb impairment a result of dysregulated Bcl6 and/or Rorc expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the important question. We have performed overexpression of Bcl6 and Rorc in Zfp335 deficient DN3 thymocytes and the results showed that neither Bcl6 or Rorc overexpression could restore the decreased intracellular TCRβ expression in OP9-DL1 culture, suggesting Zfp335 regulates TCRβ expression independent on Bcl6 and Rorc. We have added these data in Figure 7—figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As our response to Reviewer 1, Zfp335 is indispensable for thymocyte β-selection given that T cell-specific deficiency in Zfp335 leads to impaired intracellular TCRβ expression and blockade of thymocytes at DN stage. Enhanced expression of TCRβ restored the developmental defect during DN3 to DN4 transition, but had little impact on the population size of DN3, DN4 and DP cells. These data clearly support the regulation of Zfp335 on DN cell apoptosis through mechanisms more than β-selection. Zfp335 improves DN thymocyte survival by directly regulating Bcl6 and Rorc expression. We also added discussion to elucidate the relations on Zfp335, TCRβ, Bcl6 and Rorc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Bcl6 is normally expressed in DN3 thymocytes and regulates survival at that stage, while Rorc is normally expressed in DP thymocytes and regulates survival at that stage. The timing of Zfp335 expression aligns with Bcl6 but not with Rorc. How do the authors reconcile this discordance given that Zfp335 is downregulated in DP thymocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Zfp335 has the highest expression in DN3 thymocytes both in mRNA and protein level, suggesting its potent role in DN cell development. Indeed, Rorc expression was significantly downregulated in Zfp335 KO DN4 cells, and Rorc overexpression promoted the DN to DP transition.</p><p>However, downregulated Zfp335 in DP thymocytes is still important for DP cell survival as overexpression of Zfp335 rescued DP thymocytes from enhanced apoptosis (Figure 7F). In addition, Zfp335 regulates DP thymocyte development through Rorc as Rorc overexpression could rescue DP cell apoptosis and DP cell population in Zfp335 deficient cells. Therefore, compared to DN cells, DP cells express relative low level of Zfp335, which still indispensably participate the regulation of Rorc expression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
