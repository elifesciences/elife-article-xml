foot muscles as skeletal elements elongated and digits were lost, and yet the developmental mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report the natural loss of foot muscles in the bipedal jerboa, <italic>Jaculus jaculus</italic>. Although adults have no muscles in their feet, newborn animals have muscles that rapidly disappear soon after birth. We were surprised to find no evidence of apoptotic or necrotic cell death during stages of peak myofiber loss, countering well-supported assumptions of developmental tissue remodeling. We instead see hallmarks of muscle atrophy, including an ordered disassembly of the sarcomere associated with upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic>. We propose that the natural loss of muscle, which remodeled foot anatomy during evolution and development, involves cellular mechanisms that are typically associated with disease or injury.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50645.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Intrinsic muscles are a group of muscles deep inside the hands and feet.

A mechanism called programmed cell death is often responsible for specific tissues disappearing during development, but the experiments of Tran et al. revealed that this was not the case in jerboas. Instead, their intrinsic muscles were degraded by processes triggered by genes that disassemble underused muscles.

Briefly, limb muscle progenitors are specified from mesodermal cells at the ventrolateral edge of the dermomyotome in somites aligned with the prospective limb. These cells delaminate and migrate into the limb bud as dorsal and ventral muscle masses that proliferate and initiate a myoblast specification program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chevallier et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christ et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayashi and Ozawa, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murphy and Kardon, 2011</xref>). The muscle masses are then subdivided into individual muscle groups in response to cues from the developing muscle connective tissue, which is derived from limb field lateral plate mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayashi and Ozawa, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kardon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kardon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wortham, 1948</xref>). They then initiate a differentiation program, which includes cell fusion to form aligned multinucleated myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abmayr and Pavlath, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kelly and Zacks, 1969</xref>).</p><p>Each differentiated myofiber produces an assemblage of Z-body proteins, Actin filaments, and non-muscle Myosin that form premyofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ono, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rhee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sanger and Sanger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanger et al., 2002</xref>). Desmin, α-Actinin, and the Z-body portion of Titin also begin to organize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furst et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanger et al., 2002</xref>). Subsequent uncoiling of Titin increases Z-body spacing, and integration of embryonic skeletal muscle Myosin results in formation of nascent myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ono, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanger et al., 2010</xref>). Further maturation of the nascent myofibril into a mature myofibril involves incorporation of additional proteins that are important for sarcomere structure and function, and Z-lines are aligned and properly spaced to bring sarcomeres into register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ehler and Gautel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanger et al., 2010</xref>). Failure at any point of myoblast specification, migration, myofiber differentiation, or myofibril maturation compromises muscle function and manifests as muscle degenerative disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bönnemann and Laing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laing and Nowak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morita et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Working backward in time from the adult jerboa phenotype, we found that two of the three flexor muscle groups differentiate as multinucleated myofibers that initiate sarcomere assembly, as in other species. However, almost all jerboa intrinsic foot muscle is lost within a few days shortly after birth. Despite the rapid and near complete loss of myofibers, we found no molecular or ultrastructural evidence of apoptotic or necrotic cell death, no accumulation of autophagic vesicles, and no macrophage infiltration. Instead, we observed evidence of ordered sarcomere disassembly and upregulation of muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases, <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic>. Although the ultimate fate of intrinsic foot myofibers after loss of muscle identity remains unknown, these data suggest that the mechanism of myofiber loss is similar to atrophy, which is typically considered a pathological response to injury or disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The absence of intrinsic foot muscle in the adult jerboa could be due to a failure of early myoblasts to migrate into and/or to differentiate in the distal limb. Alternatively, embryonic muscles may form but not persist through development to the adult. In transverse sections of newborn mouse feet, immunofluorescent detection of skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain reveals each intrinsic muscle group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In newborn jerboas, we observed two of the three groups of flexor muscles. While the <italic>m. lumbricales</italic> never form, the jerboa has a single <italic>m. flexor digitorum brevis</italic> and three pinnate <italic>m. interossei</italic> that are not present in adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Postnatal growth of vertebrate skeletal muscle typically involves an increase in myofiber number (hyperplasia) within the first week, followed by an increase in myofiber size (hypertrophy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chiakulas and Pauly, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gokhin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 2010</xref>). In order to understand the dynamics of muscle growth and loss, we quantified the rate of myofiber hyperplasia at 2-day intervals after birth of the mouse and jerboa, focusing on the representative interosseous muscle that is associated with the third metatarsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). As expected in the mouse, we observed a steady increase in the average number of myofibers in cross section from birth to P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the number of myofibers in the third interosseous of the jerboa foot rapidly declines beginning at approximately P4, and few myofibers remain by P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the rate of myofiber loss outpaces a typical rate of new cell addition such that muscles with the potential to grow are instead steadily diminished. Alternatively, myofiber loss may be accelerated by a compromised ability to form new myofibers and to add nuclei to growing myofibers. To distinguish these hypotheses, we analyzed cohorts of animals 2 days after intraperitoneal BrdU injection at P0, P2, or P4. Since multinucleated jerboa foot myofibers are postmitotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we reasoned that BrdU+ nuclei present within Dystroglycan+ myofiber membranes were added by myocyte fusion during the 2-day window after they were labeled as myoblasts or myocytes in S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). When normalized to the total number of myofiber nuclei, we found that myocytes fuse to form multinucleated myofibers in jerboa hand muscle at a consistent rate from P0 to P6. However, their incorporation into jerboa foot muscle decreased significantly after P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These results suggest that myofiber loss, which begins at P4, is preceded by reduced myogenesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50645.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The rate of myocyte fusion is reduced prior to myofiber loss.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Newly fused nuclei within Dystroglycan+ myofiber membranes (arrow) can be distinguished two days after labeling with BrdU.

Normalized to the total number of myofibers, we found that the number of proliferative progenitor cells in jerboa foot muscle significantly decreased from P0 to P4 compared to hand muscles that showed no change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results suggest that a reduced number of muscle progenitor cells might contribute to the reduced prevalence of myocyte fusion events.</p><p>We next tested whether compromised proliferation and differentiation of jerboa foot muscle progenitors is cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous. We isolated single cells, including myoblasts and myocytes but excluding myofibers, by mechanical trituration and enzymatic digestion of P1 jerboa and mouse lower leg and foot muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Danoviz and Yablonka-Reuveni, 2012</xref>). After 6 days and 9 days of culture, we detected Myogenin+ differentiating myocytes and Myosin+ fully differentiated myofibers in primary cell cultures isolated from each muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We did not detect a significant decline in the number of differentiated cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Jerboa foot muscle cell differentiation and survival in vitro days after cell number begins to decline in vivo suggests that loss of jerboa foot myofibers is initiated non-cell autonomously.</p><p>The rapid and almost complete loss of differentiated myofibers in vivo from P4 to P8 suggested these cells die, since individual cells or groups of cells are commonly eliminated by apoptosis during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brill et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernández-Terán et al., 2006</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we injected Evans blue dye (EBD), a fluorescent molecule that accumulates in cells with compromised plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsuda et al., 1995</xref>), into the peritoneum of P3 and P4 neonatal jerboas 24 hr before euthanasia. Although we detected EBD in mechanically injured myofibers of the gastrocnemius as a control, we saw no EBD fluorescence in jerboa foot myofibers or in surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also saw no Annexin V immunofluorescence on the surface of jerboa foot myofibers, another hallmark of dying cells that flip Annexin V to the outer plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Since we observed no direct evidence of cell death, we asked whether there was an immune response that might be an indirect proxy for undetected death. Dying muscle cells frequently recruit phagocytic macrophages that engulf cellular debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Londhe and Guttridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tidball and Wehling-Henricks, 2007</xref>). We predicted that myofibers that die by any mechanism that produces cellular debris might recruit macrophages that are detectable by expression of the F4/80 glycoprotein. However, consistent with the lack of evidence of cell death in the jerboa foot, no F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages were found among myofibers from birth to P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since immune cells other than mature macrophages might be recruited to a site of cell death, we also assessed expression of CD45 and found no evidence of T-cells, B-cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, or granulocytes near jerboa foot myofibers from P4 to P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The absence of any clear indication of muscle cell death motivated us to re-evaluate muscle maturation at greater resolution in order to capture the earliest detectable signs of muscle cell loss. We collected transmission electron micrographs of jerboa hand and foot muscle at P0, P2, and P4. We identified criteria for three categories of maturation, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borisov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Raeker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sanger et al., 2006</xref>), and two categories of degeneration. Category A cells have pre-myofibrils with thick and thin filaments and poorly resolved Z-discs, but the M-lines and I-bands are not yet apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In Category B, Z-discs of nascent myofibrils are better resolved, and M-lines and I-bands are apparent, but parallel sarcomeres are not in register (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The mature myofibrils of Category C have Z-lines that are aligned with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In Category D, early degeneration, some sarcomeres appear similar to Category A, but other areas of the cell contain disorganized filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Category E includes those in the worst condition where less than half of the cell has any recognizable sarcomeres, and much of the cytoplasm is filled with pools of disorganized filaments and Z-protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, Category D and E cells have membrane-enclosed vacuoles and large lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, consistent with a lack of evidence for cell death, none of these cells or their organelles appear swollen, nuclear morphology appears normal, plasma membranes seem to be contiguous, and we do not observe an accumulation of autophagic vesicles that typically characterize cell death associated with unregulated autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mizushima, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kroemer and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Denton and Kumar, 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50645.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Jerboa foot myofibers degenerate from a nascent state soon after birth.</title><p>(A to C) TEM of representative jerboa hand myofibers illustrating categories (<bold>A</bold>) nascent, (<bold>B</bold>) immature, and (<bold>C</bold>) mature.

Quantification of the percent of myofibers in each category after unblinding revealed the progressive maturation of jerboa hand myofibers and the progressive degeneration of jerboa foot myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Compared to later stages, there is little difference in the maturation state of hand and foot sarcomeres at birth. Loss of ultrastructural integrity is therefore initiated perinatally, prior to complete myofibril maturation in the jerboa foot.</p><p>Our analysis of transmission electron micrographs also revealed the presence of filamentous aggregates that we did not include in our quantifications because they are enucleate, lack all other recognizable organelles, and are not bounded by a plasma membrane. Although these aggregates do not appear to be cellular, they are always closely associated with cells of a fibroblast morphology, and most lie between remaining myofibers in a space we presume was also once occupied by a myofiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,H</xref>). To determine if these unusual structures contain muscle protein, we performed immunofluorescence on sections of P4 jerboa foot muscle and found similar aggregates of intensely fluorescent immunoreactivity to skeletal muscle myosin heavy chain. We also found that the surrounding cells, which correlate with the positions of fibroblasts in electron micrographs, express the intracellular pro-peptide of Collagen I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), the major component of tendon and other fibrous connective tissues and of fibrotic tissue after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mann et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Given the apparent deterioration of nascent sarcomeres, we asked whether individual sarcomere proteins are lost from myofibrils in a temporal order or if proteins disassemble simultaneously. We assessed the organization of sarcomere proteins by multicolor immunofluorescence at P0, P2, and P4. Alpha-Actinin, Desmin, Myomesin, Myosin, Titin, and Tropomyosin are each localized to an ordered series of striations in a subset of myofibers suggesting all are initially incorporated into immature sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata5">5</xref>).

In group 1, we saw myofibers with all three proteins properly localized suggesting disorganization follows an initial state of proper localization. When we compared the dRM and Drm categories, we saw loss of Desmin localization when Tropomyosin and Myosin were ‘good’ and almost no myofibers where Desmin was good and the others were bad. This suggests that Desmin is disorganized prior to Tropomyosin and Myosin. In group 2a, there were cells in the rmT category and almost none in the RMt category, suggesting Tropomyosin and Myosin are disorganized prior to Titin. Group 2b illustrates that both categories RmT and rMT appeared at similar frequency, suggesting it is unclear whether Tropomyosin or Myosin become disorganized prior to the other. In group 3, there were cells in the mtA category and none in the MTa category, suggesting Titin becomes disorganized before Alpha-actinin. Similarly, in group 4, there were cells in the mtY category but not in the MTy category suggesting Titin becomes disorganized before Myomesin.

The progressively disordered ultrastructure of the sarcomere that begins with loss of Desmin localization, the increased expression of multiple genes that are typically upregulated during atrophy, and the lack of evidence for cell death or macrophage infiltration are consistent with observations of atrophying muscle in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Volodin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaldo and Sandri, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sakuma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Haehling et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite the similarities to muscle atrophy, myofiber loss in the jerboa foot does not seem to be simply explained by an atrophic response to denervation. First, and in contrast to the rapid rate of jerboa foot myofiber loss, chronic denervation in mice (100 days after nerve transection at P14) reduced the size but not the number of individual myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moschella and Ontell, 1987</xref>). Additionally, we found that the post-synaptic Acetylcholine Receptor (AchR) exclusively coincides with the presynaptic neuronal protein, Synaptophysin, in neonatal jerboa foot muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the mouse, AchR clusters are present in a broad domain of fetal muscle prior to innervation and are refined to nerve terminals in response to chemical synapse activity before birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2001</xref>). The refinement of AchR clusters in jerboa foot muscles suggests that the muscles are not only innervated at birth but are also responsive to motor inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Beginning only with knowledge of adult jerboa foot anatomy, we reached evidence for a cellular mechanism of intrinsic muscle loss during neonatal development that is surprising in the context of what is known about muscle development and pathology in more traditional laboratory species. Although we found multinucleated myofibers in the feet of neonatal jerboas, all muscle protein expression rapidly disappears from the jerboa foot shortly after birth. We were perplexed to find no evidence of apoptotic or necrotic cell death by a variety of assays and throughout the time when muscle cells are lost, nor did we observe immune cells that are commonly recruited to clear the remains of dying cells. Instead, we saw structural and molecular similarities to muscle atrophy, although atrophy in young mice leads to reduced myofiber size rather than number as in the jerboa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruusgaard and Gundersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moschella and Ontell, 1987</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to functionally connect the atrogenes, <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic>, to a mechanism of muscle loss, we endeavored to determine whether knocking down both genes in jerboa foot muscle in vivo could be sufficient to rescue myofibers or to delay their loss. Although we developed a system to validate shRNAs targeting each jerboa gene after first inducing <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic> expression in cultured primary jerboa myofibers, shRNA delivery into rodent neonatal foot muscle was not feasible (not shown). Lentiviral injection bathes the ensheathing muscle connective tissue, and infection rarely reaches myofibers of these small muscles in either mouse or jerboa. Plasmid injection and electroporation, which is feasible in adult rodent feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiFranco et al., 2009</xref>), is not efficient in neonatal feet of either species. This is likely because the neonatal foot lacks a cavity to contain injected DNA, provided by separation of the overlying skin in mature animals, which is required for efficient plasmid uptake by electroporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krull, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Even if genetic manipulations were technically feasible, intrinsic foot muscle loss first appeared in the jerboa lineage more than 20 million years ago. For phenotypes that diverged over such long evolutionary distances, a large set of genes and mechanical acommodation of integrated tissues are likely at play, which were collectively honed by millions of years of evolution; thus, manipulation of one or two genes may not be sufficient to rescue or delay muscle loss. It is therefore important to consider that a standard of ‘molecular mechanism’ applied to the experimental manipulations of traditional laboratory species may not be appropriate in the context of understanding complex macroevolutionary processes.</p><p>As for why the phenotype is limited to the distal limb, it is possible that disuse contributes to jerboa foot muscle loss, since jerboas and ungulates each fuse metatarsals into a single cannon bone, which would be expected to physically impair lateral motion of the digit elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cunningham, 1883</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). However, the rapid and complete loss of myofibers in the neonatal jerboa foot does not appear to simply reflect a species-level difference in the animal’s generalized response to disuse atrophy, since hindlimb denervation or immobilization in adult jerboas causes gradual loss of muscle mass, primarily through a significant reduction in the diameter of individual myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AlWohaib and Alnaqeeb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aryan and Alnaqeeb, 2002</xref>). These observations are very similar to what has been shown in disuse atrophy models in mice and in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaldo and Sandri, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moschella and Ontell, 1987</xref>) and differ from what we see in the neonatal foot.</p><p>Why would an embryo expend energy to form muscles that are almost immediately lost? The formation and subsequent loss of intrinsic foot muscles in jerboas and hooved animals may simply reflect a series of chance events in each lineage with no fitness cost, or these similarities in multiple species may reveal true developmental constraints. Muscle is not required for autopod tendon formation or maintenance in mice, but the tendons that develop in a muscle-less or a paralyzed mouse are thinner and less well organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that muscle is initially required in the fetus and neonate for tendons to establish sufficient architecture from origin to insertion so that the tendon, after further growth, can withstand high locomotor forces in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lochner et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moore et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of whether these nascent muscles serve an essential purpose, we are left wondering what is the ultimate fate of jerboa foot myofibers. If these cells do indeed die, perhaps death is too rapid for detection. However, programmed cell death is thought to occur over hours or even days from the initial trigger to the final corpse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Green, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, death may result from a mechanism that does not proceed through DNA fragmentation, plasma membrane permeability, macrophage recruitment, or stereotyped ultrastructural changes, and yet this would seem to eliminate most known forms of regulated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Galluzzi et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, multinucleated myofibers may transform to another cellular identity after degrading all sarcomere proteins. Although a fate transformation would be surprising, it would not be without precedent. The electric organ of fish that can produce an electric field (e.g. knifefish and elephantfish) is thought to be derived from skeletal muscle. Electrocytes of <italic>Sternopygus macrurus</italic> express skeletal muscle Actin, Desmin, and α-Actinin, and electrocytes of <italic>Paramormyrops kingsleyae</italic> retain sarcomeres that are disarrayed and non-contractile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gallant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Unguez and Zakon, 1998</xref>). If myofibers in the jerboa foot indeed transdifferentiate, it is possible that they transform into the pro-Collagen I positive fibroblasts that are entangled with the filamentous aggregates, although these could also be phagocytic fibroblasts recruited to consume the enucleate detritus without stimulating inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heredia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schwegler et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, the lineage labeling approaches required to track the ultimate fate of jerboa myofibers are exceptionally challenging in this non-traditional animal model.</p><p>It is clear, however, that regardless of the ultimate fate of jerboa foot myofibers, their path passes through a phase marked by cell biology that is typical of atrophy, including the ordered disassembly of sarcomeres and expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic>. However, skeletal muscle atrophy is typically associated with pathology in the context of disuse, nerve injury, starvation, or disease. In this context, we were struck by a statement in the 1883 anatomical description of the fetal and adult suspensory ligament of four species of hooved mammals: ‘It is an instance of <italic>pathological</italic> change assisting a <italic>morphological</italic> process’ (emphasis his) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cunningham, 1883</xref>). Indeed, there are remarkable similarities in the histology of jerboa and horse foot muscle compared to human clinical observations of tissue remodeling that follows rotator cuff tear characterized by muscle atrophy, myofiber loss, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Souza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gibbons et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Foot muscle atrophy in the jerboa may be one of many cellular responses associated with injury or disease in humans that is utilized in the normal development and physiology of other species. These data suggest that there is less of a clear divide between natural and pathological states than typically thought. Studies of non-traditional species may not only reveal the mechanisms of evolutionary malleability, but may also advance our understanding of fundamental biological processes that are typically associated with pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent <break/>type or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Col1A1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">SP1.D8</td><td valign="top">1:20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Dystroglycan (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">11H6C4</td><td valign="top">1:10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- MyHC (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">MF20</td><td valign="top">1:20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Myomesin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">mMaC myomesin B4</td><td valign="top">1:20</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Myogenin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">F5D</td><td valign="top">1:5</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Titin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">9D10</td><td valign="top">1:10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Tropomyosin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">CH1</td><td valign="top">1:10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Desmin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">D33</td><td valign="top">1:300</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- α-actinin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">EA53</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Annexin-V (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab14196</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Desmin (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab32362</td><td valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- CD45 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab10558</td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- F4/80 (rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab6640</td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175) (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">CST</td><td valign="top">Cat#9661</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa 488 conjugated Wheat Germ Agglutinin</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">W11261</td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti- BrdU</td><td valign="top">Biorad</td><td valign="top">MCA2060</td><td valign="top">1:100</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TM-Red</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 12156792910</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Jerboas were housed and reared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jordan et al., 2011</xref>).

After permeabilization with 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min, the cells were blocked with 5% BSA/PBS for 30 min and stained with BrdU, anti-Myogenin and Myosin antibodies and secondary antibodies. At each time point of each experimental group, the total number of nuclei and nuclei within Myosin+ myofibers were counted in 10 images taken from eight wells using the Olympus compound microscope at 4x magnification. The numbers in 10 images were averaged and the difference between day 6 and day 9 were statistically analyzed with paired sample t-test in each experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Evans Blue Dye</title><p>We injected Evans Blue Dye as 1% solution by animal body weight (1 mg EBD/100 µl PBS/10 g) 24 hr prior to sample collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamer et al., 2002</xref>). As a positive control for EBD uptake, we create an injured muscle area by inserting a 21-gauge needle 2–3 times into the jerboa gastrocnemius muscle. Samples were fresh frozen in OCT and cryosection at 12 µm thickness. Slides were processed for MF20 fluorescence with primary antibody incubation for 1 hr at RT before secondary antibody incubation.

The hands and feet were removed, skinned, and fixed on ice for 2 hr. Samples were then rinsed six times for 5 min in cold 0.15M cacodylate buffer and then post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.15M cacodylate buffer on ice for 1 hr. Samples were then rinsed in cold double distilled water (DDW) six times for 5 min and placed into 1% uranyl acetate in DDW on ice overnight. Fixed tissue was then rinsed in ice cold double distilled water three times for 3 min and dehydrated in an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90% in DDW) on ice for 5 min each. Samples were further dehydrated into 100% ethanol twice for 5 min at room temperature and then transitioned to 1:1 ethanol:acetone for 5 min followed by two times 5 min in 100% acetone. Dehydrated samples were infiltrated with 1:1 acetone:Durcupan ACM resin for 1 hr at room temperature followed by 100% resin twice for 1 hr and then placed in fresh resin overnight. On the next day, samples were transferred to fresh resin, which was polymerized in a 60°C vacuum oven for 48–72 hr. Resin embedded samples were stored at room temperature until ready for sectioning. Seventy nanometer thick sections were stained in lead solution and image using Tecnai Spirit TEM scope (120 kV).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)</title><p>Foot muscles were dissected and stored in RNAlater solution (Thermo Fisher) at −80<bold>°</bold>C until ready for use.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Please do see the paragraph immediately below that offers what we hope are helpful suggestions.</p><p>The reviewers and editors thank the authors for their detailed response and again appreciate their taking on this interesting, albeit complex, research direction. While appreciating the quality of the study, we are of the view, given in the reviews, that it is important to test if a mechanism (e.g., atrophy) operates and exclude others (e.g. autophagy and apoptosis). It is also possible that in investigating possible mechanisms more intensely, the authors may discover a more complex route. The authors proposed the electroporation of shRNA constructs against <italic>Murf1</italic> and Atrogin-1, immunoEM for autophagy, and characterization of foot muscle-derived myoblasts. This could be useful directions, keeping in mind possible ambiguities of interpretation that may arise, as the authors point out. The reviewers also suggest other routes of experimentation, such as time-series western-blots. In the end, we appreciate that the authors are the experts with this system, and understand the efficacy of reagents and technologies best. The reviewers only raise concerns from the outside about what could be reasonably done to bolster the choice of one or a set of mechanisms over others. We would not like to rush the authors to finish experiments that are technically challenging and whose interpretation will need time and attention. Therefore, while turning down the manuscript at this stage, we will be happy to see a new submission that experimentally substantially addresses the concerns raised, either by the routes suggested by the reviewers or by other effective ways. Such a new submission, should the authors choose to consider <italic>eLife</italic>, will be speedily examined.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting evo-devo paper that examines the mechanisms of postnatal muscle loss in the jerboa; the central hypothesis is that this loss occurs via atrophy rather than cell death. To formally test this, they first compared myogenic progression/hypertrophy in postnatal jerboa and mouse and assay for other potential mechanisms including apoptosis or necrosis; they also compared the autopods in jerboa forelimb (which does not lose muscle) with hindlimb (which does.) Based on ultrastructural disorganization revealed in EM and fluorescence microscopy and RT-PCR for atrophy-specific genes, they conclude that an apathological form of atrophy is responsible for muscle loss in the jerboa hindlimb. They go on to speculate that muscle cells may transdifferentiate into other cell types, and note that other mammals such as horses and deer also have tendon but no muscle in the extended autopod but they do not suggest that the mechanisms in other animals are similar.</p><p>The main conclusion is based in EM showing progressive loss of structure in jerboa foot muscle and IHC for sarcomeric proteins, which the authors assemble into a timeline in which first desmin, then myosin/tropomyosin, then titin, then myomesin and a-actinin are lost from the sarcomere.</p><p>Much of the data are descriptive, which is not a huge drawback since this model has not been well described before outside of the author's own work (which has addressed changes in skeletal elements of the autopods.) However, the proposed mechanism of progressive sarcomeric deconstruction due to atrophy signalling is also supported by largely descriptive data, and this is a weakness in the paper. While the jerboa is not (yet?) a genetic system, AAV infection of muscle in neonates should be as feasible in jerboa as in mouse. It would be nice to see something like AAV-mediated knockdown of atrogin-1 (which the paper shows is normally upregulated between P1 and P3) to see if this decreases the muscle loss- an experiment like this would go a long way towards supporting the hypothesis. Without such experimental support, the manuscript falls short in significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Tran et al., characterize aspects of foot muscle loss in the bipedal jerboa. The authors use this very interesting non-model animal to anchor comparisons with new and published data from mice to gain insights into the developmental mechanisms underpinning evolutionary loss of distal appendage musculature. The basic question is what happens to distal hindlimb musculature in a jerboa after it forms.</p><p>The authors provide evidence that the number of myofibers in the foot of a newborn jerboa decreases after day four, a change that is preceded by a reduction in the rate of myocyte fusion. TUNEL assays and immunofluorescent labeling for cleaved Caspase 3 suggest foot myofibers do not undergo apoptosis, and a failure of myofibers to take up Evans blue, a marker for sarcolemma damage, argues against necrosis. Similarly, macrophages did not appear to be recruited to the site of muscle loss, as determined by F4/80 antibody labeling.</p><p>The authors characterized ultra-structural changes associated with foot muscle loss by TEM. They observed late filamentous aggregates surrounded by cells with fibroblast-like morphology in TEM section, a finding consistent with similar regions labeled for myosin and ProCol1, a fibroblast marker. The authors also examined a suite of muscle proteins (desmin, tropomyosin, myosin, titin, myomesin, and α actinin) by immunohistochemistry and evaluated staining by protein regionalization within the myofiber. Antibody labeling combinations suggested that loss of desmin organization occurred early, and changes in titin, myomesin, and actinin occurred late. Finally, they present qPCR evidence that <italic>Murf1</italic> and Atrogin-1, ubiquitin ligases that are upregulated during muscle atrophy, were upregulated in the foot compared to the forelimb.</p><p>Collectively, the authors interpret these results as consistent with changes characteristic of muscle atrophy. These data raise the intriguing question as to the long-term fate of muscle cells in the jerboa foot. However, as noted by the authors, this question remains difficult to test in the jerboa system in the absence of a method for long term genetic lineage mapping.</p><p>Overall, I found the paper to be interesting and the data of good quality. The novel finding suggested by the data is that foot muscle loss in the jerboa exhibits changes characteristic of muscle atrophy rather than apoptosis, and raises a new line of inquiry as to the molecular mechanisms that drive this lineage-specific and spatially regulated change in myogenesis and muscle maintenance. It would seem that the jerboa model provides a comparative data point that might provide fundamental insight into the regulation of muscle with further implications for insight into sarcopenia and muscle aging.</p><p>The major issue for this paper is that the mechanisms of how muscle loss might be controlled spatially is not at all explored here. Do the authors have comments on how this might occur? Is it a simple diss- use atrophy? For instance, if a model of atrophy was induced in another muscle group outside the foot does it proceed mechanistically in the same manner? This would be a relatively simple experiment to do. It may be that this is not a specific or &quot;special&quot; process for the Jerboa foot rather it is just a simple case of dis-use atrophy, although an extreme one.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors examined the progressive loss of myofibers in foot muscles of a non-traditional model jerboa at postnatal day 0 to day 8. The authors found that the postnatal loss of myofibers is concomitant with 1) reduced myogenesis/fusion starting from P2; 2) the absence of DNA fragmentation, Caspase-3 cleavage, membrane permeability, Annexin V, or F4/80+ macrophages; 3) the degeneration of pre-established myofibrils; an ordered disassembly of sarcomeres; and the increases of <italic>Murf1</italic> and Atrogin-1 mRNAs. While this study is intriguing in that the lack of signs for apoptosis, necrosis, and macrophage infiltration during the progressive loss of myofibers, several major issues/questions are also identified. To my opinion, these issues and questions should be experimentally addressed.</p><p>The major concern is the data in the manuscript is not sufficient to substantiate why myofibers disappear in jerboa food muscles. Related, I have the following issues:</p><p>1) Skeletal muscle atrophy indicates a disease condition with disturbed protein homeostasis that impacts on myofibril contents and muscle performance. As noted by the authors, atrophy does not reduce the number of myofibers. Although <italic>Murf1</italic> and Atrogin-1 mRNAs increase at P0-P3, it remains unclear whether the increases of the atrophy markers are merely a bystander or a direct cause of the loss of myofibers. It is hard to believe that the drastic changes shown in EM images (Figure 4) can be attributed to atrophy. To elucidate the contribution of atrophy, the authors may apply siRNAs specific to jerboa <italic>Murf1</italic> and Atrogin-1 in neonatal food muscle.</p><p>2) As the key conclusions of this study, the involvement of apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and atrophy should be investigated by a biochemical approach (besides immunostaining). The protein levels of <italic>Murf1</italic> and Atrogin-1 should be examined in the time course (P0-P8) by western blots together with the apoptosis marker cleaved Caspase-3, the necrosis marker Annexin V, and the autophagy markers, LC-3I/II.</p><p>3) &quot;we do not observe a large number of autophagic vesicles&quot; (Results section). There is not enough data to exclude autophagy from the process. The autophagic vesicles, with different sizes in micro and macroautophagy should be formally examined by Immuno-EM.</p><p>4) The authors had only scratched the surface and reported that the incorporation of EdU+ nuclei in myofibers starts to decrease from P2. Notably, postnatal myoblast fusion is important for the remodeling of myofibers, which may explain the loss of myofiber later (from P4). What is the reason(s) for the reduction of EdU+ nuclei? Is this a cell-autonomous effect or due to the environment? The authors should isolate primary myoblasts from neonatal jerboa food muscles and examine the proliferation, myogenic differentiation, and fusion of in vitro cultured myoblasts.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolutionary loss of foot muscle during development with characteristics of atrophy and no evidence of cell death&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This revised manuscript describing the programmed loss of hindfoot muscle in the jerboa has the same strengths and weaknesses as the original paper: it is a novel study on a potentially interesting phenomenon in a new model system, but unfortunately the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) responsible are not well identified. The authors have done appropriate experiments and made a solid effort to address the concerns identified in the prior reviews, but unfortunately, the system has not been tractable- the authors have been able to rule out multiple potential mechanisms, but not to identify a viable candidate mechanism. In spite of this, our inclination is to say that this manuscript is still a valuable addition to the literature, in the hope that this group or others might successfully follow up on these studies to move on to mechanistic conclusions. Please, therefore, make the minor revisions suggested and we can speedily move to acceptance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic> </p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors have added new data sets. In Figure 2, they present in vitro data in which isolated myoblasts and myocytes form differentiated myofibers in culture, without a significant decline in the number of differentiated cells over time. They use these data to argue that Jerboa foot myofiber loss in vivo is a non cell-autonomous process. They present antibody labeling to assess for the presence of CD-45 positive immune cells (T-cells, B-cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, monocytes) in the region of foot muscle loss, but found no labeling, suggesting cell types usually recruited to a site of necrosis are not present. Additionally, they provide qRT-PCR data showing elevated expression of <italic>NF-κB2</italic> and <italic>Relb</italic> in the jerboa foot as further evidence in support of their muscle atrophy model. While they have attempted functional experiments using shRNA, these remain technically challenging. None of this has shed much light on the mechanistic basis of the muscle loss evident in this animal.</p><p>In regards to the direct concerns raised in the original review or suggestions made to improve the manuscript, none have been adopted by the authors. They instead argue the technical limitations of their model or further argue the suggestions made are beyond the scope of the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the authors addressed the concerns raised previously by this reviewer (#3). About concern #1 – if atrophy is the main cause of foot muscle loss in jerboa, the authors explained the technical issues in the experiments suggested by the reviewers. Although the contribution of atrophy remains unclear, the authors showed convincing data to exclude several other possibilities of cell clearance. The new <italic>NF-κB/Relb</italic> data also strengthened the correlation between muscle loss and the up-regulation of atrophy markers. We suggest the authors revise the Discussion section and comment on the technical difficulties in their efforts to mechanistically delineate the contribution of atrophy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50645.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Much of the data are descriptive, which is not a huge drawback since this model has not been well described before outside of the author's own work (which has addressed changes in skeletal elements of the autopods.)

Since this is incompatible with the rapid loss of jerboa foot myofibers that begins at around 4 days after the tissues are accessible for injection at birth, we next opted for a lentiviral approach.</p><p>Although we observed strong expression of fluorescent cargo proteins from lentivirus within three days after infection, labeling was largely restricted to the surrounding connective tissues both in mouse and jerboa feet and did not appear to penetrate the muscle connective tissue to reach myofibers. We think this is likely because the needle can slip between these small muscles and instead bathe ensheathing connective tissues in virus.</p><p>At this point, we opted for an electroporation approach, which has been successfully implemented to transfect adult mouse foot muscles in vivo (DiFranco et al., 2009). Although we observed fluorescent myofibers throughout all muscles of the adult mouse foot, electroporation of the same ubituitously-driven eGFP plasmid into neonatal mouse and jerboa feet was far less efficient. The difference in efficiency could be due to the smaller size of the neonatal foot and/or the under-development of neonatal skin compared to adults that have delaminated skin. Skin delamination forms a cavity to contain injected plasmid DNA prior to electroporation, which is a known requirement for efficient DNA uptake. Despite this technical limitation, we thought that analysis of shRNA electroporation at postnatal day 8, when almost all jerboa foot muscles are naturally lost, might reveal a significant difference from controls since a small number of ‘rescued’ cells could be statistically significant.</p><p>Since the low efficiency of plasmid delivery by electroporation complicates Western or qRT-PCR quantification from bulk-dissected muscle, we established in vitrovalidation systems in primary jerboa myoblasts for four jerboa shRNAs that target <italic>Murf1</italic> and four that target <italic>Atrogin-1</italic>. We then selected the highest efficiency shRNA for each target gene for in vivo electroporation. Uptake of the <italic>Murf1</italic> shRNA plasmid was marked by eGFP expression, and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic> shRNA plasmid uptake was marked by mCherry expression. The contralateral foot of each animal was electroporated with a non-target control plasmid also expressing eGFP for comparison.</p><p>We electroporated eight individuals and counted fluorescent myofibers in each foot (three animals had no labeled cells). Since so few cells were labeled, we conducted a power analysis and determined we would need to successfully electroporate 175 animals to be 80% confident we do not inappropriately reject the null hypothesis.

Do the authors have comments on how this might occur? Is it a simple diss- use atrophy? For instance, if a model of atrophy was induced in another muscle group outside the foot does it proceed mechanistically in the same manner? This would be a relatively simple experiment to do. It may be that this is not a specific or &quot;special&quot; process for the Jerboa foot rather it is just a simple case of dis-use atrophy, although an extreme one.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include in our discussion an idea for how muscle loss might be spatially restricted to the feet. It is possible that disuse contributes to jerboa foot muscle loss, since jerboas and ungulates each fuse metatarsals into a single cannon bone, which would be expected to physically impair lateral motion of the digit elements. However, the rapid and complete loss of myofibers in the neonatal jerboa foot does not appear to simply reflect a species-level difference in the animal’s generalized response to disuse atrophy. Hindlimb denervation and immobilization of this same species of jerboa results in a prolonged process of loss of muscle mass, primarily occurring through a significant reduction in the diameter of individual myofibers (AlWohaib and Alnaqeeb, 1997; Aryan and Alnaqeeb, 2002). These observations are very similar to what has been shown in disuse atrophy models in mice and in rats (Moschella and Ontell, 1987; Bonaldo and Sandri, 2013) and differ from what we see in the foot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) Skeletal muscle atrophy indicates a disease condition with disturbed protein homeostasis that impacts on myofibril contents and muscle performance. As noted by the authors, atrophy does not reduce the number of myofibers. Although Murf1 and Atrogin-1 mRNAs increase at P0-P3, it remains unclear whether the increases of the atrophy markers are merely a bystander or a direct cause of the loss of myofibers. It is hard to believe that the drastic changes shown in EM images (Figure 4) can be attributed to atrophy. To elucidate the contribution of atrophy, the authors may apply siRNAs specific to jerboa Murf1 and Atrogin-1 in neonatal food muscle.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above in response to the first reviewer, we have electroporated shRNA constructs designed to target <italic>Murf1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic> and found this experiment cannot be satisfactorily completed.</p><p>Since we knew this experiment would be technically challenging and the outcome uncertain, we decided to simultaneously pursue another approach to seek further evidence that jerboa foot muscle loss proceeds by a cellular mechanism with characteristics of atrophy. The <italic>NF-κB</italic> pathway is an upstream mediator of skeletal muscle atrophy and is both necessary and sufficient to induce <italic>Murf1</italic> expression. We therefore performed qRT-PCR on mRNA isolated from P0 and P3 mouse and jerboa FDS and foot muscle. We found that, indeed, <italic>NF-κB</italic> and its binding partner, <italic>Relb</italic>, are upregulated to levels above control and even higher than either <italic>Murf1</italic> or <italic>Atrogin-1.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As the key conclusions of this study, the involvement of apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and atrophy should be investigated by a biochemical approach (besides immunostaining). The protein levels of Murf1 and Atrogin-1 should be examined in the time course (P0-P8) by western blots together with the apoptosis marker cleaved Caspase-3, the necrosis marker Annexin V, and the autophagy markers, LC-3I/II.</p></disp-quote><p>We did initially attempt to detect early changes in sarcomere protein expression and ubiquitin ligase expression by Western blot and encountered the problem that these begin as tiny muscles with fibrous connective tissues that change composition over time to become more and more fibrotic. Would protein expression differences over time, or a lack of, be due to ‘per muscle cell’ differences in protein expression, or due to a whole tissue remodeling from muscle to connective tissue? We instead chose qRT-PCR to detect fold change differences in <italic>Murf1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic> expression, in part because the assay is sensitive enough to detect gene expression from individual manually microdissected fragments of muscle that are no larger than about 200 microns. Additionally, dozens of studies have documented the <italic>Murf1</italic> and <italic>Atrogin-1</italic> mRNA expression dynamics in a variety of causes of atrophy [e.g. fasting, denervation, immobilization, aging and many more documented in Table 1 of the review by (Bodine and Baehr, 2014)]. This same review points out that we know almost nothing about the protein dynamics in any system due to an inavailability of quality antibodies.</p><p>With respect to muscle cell death, we had the same concerns about tissue heterogeneity combined with what might be sporadic muscle cell death occurring over multiple days. We therefore chose immunoassays and electron microscopy methods that are standard for the field because of their ability to detect a small number of individual dying cells with greater sensitivity than would be expected from bulk tissue methods like Western blotting. We included a positive control for each immuno assay of cell death, in the same tissue section when possible, to demonstrate that absence of cell death in the jerboa foot isn’t due to our failure to detect dying cells using these methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;we do not observe a large number of autophagic vesicles&quot; (Results section). There is not enough data to exclude autophagy from the process. The autophagic vesicles, with different sizes in micro and macroautophagy should be formally examined by Immuno-EM.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not observe an accumulation of autophagic vesicles, which are considered a hallmark of cell death associated with autophagy and have been identified by others by ultrastructural morphology, as we have done, and without immuno labeling (Galluzzi et al., 2007; Kroemer and Levine, 2008). We have adjusted the text to be clear that we do not observe an accumulation of autophagic vesicles that typically characterize cell death associated with unregulated autophagy, and we are not ruling out homeostatic autophagy. However, it should be noted that there is vigorous debate as to whether unregulated autophagy is a ‘mechanism’ of cell death or a sign of cellular stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors had only scratched the surface and reported that the incorporation of EdU+ nuclei in myofibers starts to decrease from P2. Notably, postnatal myoblast fusion is important for the remodeling of myofibers, which may explain the loss of myofiber later (from P4). What is the reason(s) for the reduction of EdU+ nuclei? Is this a cell-autonomous effect or due to the environment? The authors should isolate primary myoblasts from neonatal jerboa food muscles and examine the proliferation, myogenic differentiation, and fusion of in vitro cultured myoblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>Our further analysis of muscle progenitor proliferation and fusion in vivo and in vitro adds substantial value to the manuscript. We have now expanded Figure 2 to include these data. First, we counted the number of proliferative (BrdU+) progenitor cells located between the basal lamina and the myofiber membrane at P0, P2, and P4. We found that the number of proliferative progenitors as a function of the number of myofibers decreases between P0 and P4. To address the question of cell autonomy, we have also isolated and cultured myoblasts and myocytes from P1 mouse and jerboa foot and leg muscles under conditions that promote myocyte fusion and myofiber differentiation. We observed Myogenin+ myocytes and Myosin+ myofibers at day 6 in each muscle of each species and no significant reduction in the number of cells in replicate cultured wells at day 9. These data suggest that the complete loss of jerboa foot muscle in vivo may be due to non-cell autonomous attributes of the environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the authors addressed the concerns raised previously by this reviewer (#3). About concern #1 – if atrophy is the main cause of foot muscle loss in jerboa, the authors explained the technical issues in the experiments suggested by the reviewers. Although the contribution of atrophy remains unclear, the authors showed convincing data to exclude several other possibilities of cell clearance. The new NF-κB/Relb data also strengthened the correlation between muscle loss and the up-regulation of atrophy markers. We suggest the authors revise the Discussion section and comment on the technical difficulties in their efforts to mechanistically delineate the contribution of atrophy.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers’ suggestions, we have expanded the Discussion section to elaborate on the technical challenges we encountered during efforts to mechanistically test the contribution of atrophy. We also include a revised Figure 5 with p-values that compare P0 FDS to P0 foot muscle and P3 FDS to P3 foot muscle in each species.</p></body></sub-article></article>
