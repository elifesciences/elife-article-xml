(mTORC1) plays an important role in dendritic translation and in learning and memory. We previously showed that heavy alcohol use activates mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rodents (Laguesse et al., 2017a). Here, we set out to determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation in the OFC. We found that inhibition of mTORC1 activity in the OFC attenuates alcohol seeking and restores sensitivity to outcome devaluation in rats that habitually seek alcohol. In contrast, habitual responding for sucrose was unaltered by mTORC1 inhibition, suggesting that mTORC1’s role in habitual behavior is specific to alcohol. We further show that inhibition of GluN2B in the OFC attenuates alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation, alcohol seeking and habitual responding for alcohol. Together, these data suggest that the GluN2B/mTORC1 axis in the OFC drives alcohol seeking and habit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>OFC</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 AA017072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>Dorit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AA027474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>Dorit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the orbitofrontal cortex, mTORC1, a multiprotein complex centered around the kinase mTOR, contributes to the development and/or maintenance of habitual alcohol seeking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>mTORC1 is a multiprotein complex that contains the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR, the regulatory associated protein of TOR (Raptor), and other enzymes and adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>). Upon activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), which in turn phosphorylates its substrate, S6 (3). These phosphorylation events lead to the translation of a subset of mRNAs to proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lipton and Sahin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>).

Repeated cycles of voluntary binge drinking of alcohol and withdrawal also produce a robust and sustained activation of mTORC1 in the OFC of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laguesse et al., 2017a</xref>); however, the behavioral consequences of this activation are unknown.</p><p>The OFC integrates sensory and reward information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wallis, 2007</xref>) and is an essential player in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wallis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer and Bucci, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltz et al., 2018</xref>), in stimulus-outcome association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourley et al., 2013</xref>), in updating the value of predicted outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiuzat et al., 2017</xref>), in goal-directed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradfield et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>), and compulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pascoli et al., 2018</xref>).

Upon establishing a baseline of alcohol lever presses, rats received a bilateral infusion of vehicle or rapamycin (50 ng/μl) into the OFC 3 hr prior to an OSA session, and the number of lever presses and alcohol consumption were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neasta et al., 2010</xref>).

We next examined whether mTORC1 in the OFC plays a role in goal-directed or habitual alcohol seeking using a satiety outcome devaluation procedure. Rats that first underwent 7 weeks of IA-20%2BC were then trained to lever press for 20% alcohol using either a random ratio (RR) or random interval (RI) schedule of reinforcement, which biases lever responding toward goal-directed (RR) or habitual (RI) actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit et al., 2012</xref>) (Timeline. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

Rats trained to self-administer alcohol in a goal-directed manner are sensitive to outcome devaluation, while habitually-trained rats are not, i.e. animals who habitually press a lever to obtain a reward will continue to press that lever, even when the relative value of the reward is reduced due to satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rossi and Yin, 2012</xref>).

In parallel the phosphorylation of S6K and S6 were also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>, Source data Figure 4c-d).

Thus, we next tested whether GluN2B is required for alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation during alcohol deprivation.

In addition, we show that GluN2B in the OFC is required for alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation and function. Together, our data suggest that the GluN2B/mTORC1 axis acts as a molecular switch that converts the OFC from driving goal directed to habitual alcohol use.</p><p>We found that inhibition of mTORC1 in the OFC attenuates lever pressing during extinction, suggesting that mTORC1 regulates alcohol seeking. It is important to note, however, that mTORC1 inhibition does not appear to affect lever pressing in reinforced self-administration sessions. The OFC has been implicated in updating reward anticipation based on the value of an expected outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ostlund and Balleine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>), and O'Doherty et al. showed that the lateral OFC (lOFC) is activated during reward anticipation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Doherty et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that one of the roles of mTORC1 in the OFC is the strengthening of context-alcohol learning, consequently promoting alcohol seeking.</p><p>We found that blockade of mTORC1 activity in the OFC converts habitual alcohol responding to a more goal directed behavior. This finding could explain, at least in part, the decrease in alcohol seeking behavior following mTORC1 inhibition. Either extended operant training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit et al., 2012</xref>) or specific schedules of reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>) have been utilized previously to bias animals toward habitual seeking for alcohol and other substances. By first cultivating habitual alcohol seeking and then testing the effects of rapamycin, we were able to demonstrate that mTORC1 inhibtion alters rat action selection strategies; either enhancing goal-directed responding or inhibiting habitual actions. Habitual behavior is thought to rely on the strengthening of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) over the DMS, a brain region which participates in goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>). Renteria and colleagues showed that alcohol vapor exposure generates habitual behavior via the disruption of OFC to DMS circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Renteria et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that mTORC1 activation is weakening OFC to DMS projections. Furthermore, Gremel et al. showed that the endocannabinoid/CB1 receptor system in OFC to dorsal striatum cicruitry promotes a shift from goal directed behavior to habitual responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, cannabinoid signaling has been shown to activate mTORC1 in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puighermanal et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, THC-dependent impairment of novel object recognition was reversed by the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puighermanal et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it is possible that endocannabinoids and mTORC1 are part of the same signaling cascade that gates goal-directed behaviors, thereby promoting habit. In addition, Gourley and colleagues reported that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the OFC participates in goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gourley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zimmermann et al., 2017</xref>). BDNF and mTORC1 play opposing roles in AUD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ron and Barak, 2016</xref>). For example, BDNF keeps alcohol intake in moderation, and mTORC1 is associated with excessive alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ron and Barak, 2016</xref>). As breakdown of the BDNF signaling cascade results in compulsive alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Warnault et al., 2016</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the balance between BDNF and mTORC1 signaling in the OFC determines whether alcohol use is kept in moderation or becomes habitual.</p><p>We previously showed that mTORC1 activation is detected in the lOFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laguesse et al., 2017a</xref>), which was targeted in the current study. However, the structure of the OFC is complex. The medial OFC (mOFC) and lOFC are each part of anatomically and functionally distinct corticostriatal circuits in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fettes et al., 2017</xref>), and in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>). The mOFC has been reported to play a larger role in determining, updating, and storing the relative reward values of stimuli and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>). The lOFC, on the other hand, is proposed to be more involved in encoding the relationship between stimuli/actions and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>), cue-guided behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panayi and Killcross, 2018</xref>), and goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Parkes et al., 2018</xref>). Thus a careful examination of mTORC1’s role in lOFC vs. mOFC-dependent behaviors is required.</p><p>The OFC has been associated with compulsive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2013</xref>), and recently Pascoli et al. reported that OFC neurons projecting to the dorsal striatum are associated with compulsive lever pressing in response to optogenetic activation of dopaminergic ventral tegmental area neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pascoli et al., 2018</xref>). Compulsive drug use is associated with maladaptive habitual responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith and Laiks, 2018</xref>). We and others provided animal data to support the notion that alcohol consumption can become compulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Warnault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augier et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that mTORC1 signaling in the OFC is driving both habitual and compulsive alcohol seeking.</p><p>Interestingly, mTORC1 inhibition in the OFC does not alter habitual responding for sucrose, indicating that mTORC1 plays a specific role in the formation of habits in response to alcohol exposure and not natural rewards. The difference between the consequences of mTORC1 inhibition on habitual alcohol vs. sucrose seeking is striking, but it is important to note that, unlike alcohol, voluntary sucrose intake does not activate mTORC1 in the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laguesse et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Corbit et al. showed that RR-trained rats exhibit habitual alcohol self-administration after 8 weeks of training on an RR-3 schedule of reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit et al., 2012</xref>). In the current study, rats undergoing RR training demonstrated persistent goal-directed alcohol seeking behaviors. The difference between the two studies is most likely to be due to the length of RR training (long in Corbit et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbit et al., 2012</xref>) vs. short herein). It is possible that further training would drive RR-trained goal-directed rats to exhibit more habitual phenotypes, and further research would be required to compare the models more accurately.</p><p>The NMDAR is a target of alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morisot and Ron, 2017</xref>), and alcohol enhances GluN2B phosphorylation in brain regions such as the cerebellum, the DMS, and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morisot and Ron, 2017</xref>). GluN2B phosphorylation enhances the activity of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trepanier et al., 2012</xref>), and we show that alcohol increases GluN2B phosphorylation in the OFC. Thus, it is plausible that the recruitment of glutamatergic signaling by alcohol in the OFC enhances GluN2B function thereby enabling mTORC1 activation. Nimitvilai and colleagues showed that chronic exposure to alcohol vapor decreases in the expression of GluN2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nimitvilai et al., 2016</xref>), whereas we did not observe any changes in the protein levels of GluN2B following repeated cycles of alcohol binge drinking sessions and withdrawal. One important difference between our study and Nimitvilai et al. as well as additional reports discussed herein, relates to the use of contingent vs. non-contingent alcohol administration. Specifically, prior to the OSA, rats were subjected to 7 weeks of IA-20%2BC. The IA-20%2BC paradigm models ‘problem drinkers’ i.e. human subjects that suffer from AUD phenotypes such as binge drinking, compulsive drinking and craving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enoch and Goldman, 2002</xref>). In our case, rats achieve blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 80 mg/dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carnicella et al., 2014</xref>) a BAC equivalent to binge drinking humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">NIAAA, 2004</xref>). In contrast, the majority of other reports described herein involved passive exposure of alcohol vapor, in which BAC is 150–250 mg/dl, and in which physical dependence on alcohol is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Griffin, 2014</xref>). Humans who are dependent on alcohol show profoundly degraded white matter and reduced neuronal density in the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pfefferbaum and Sullivan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miguel-Hidalgo et al., 2006</xref>), possibly an indication of alcohol-induced damage to this structure. Thus, it is likely that cycles of binge drinking do not damage the OFC which may be the case in animal models of alcohol dependence. As only a small percentage of alcohol users exhibit physical dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">WHO, 2014</xref>), we believe that our findings have important implications for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying problem drinking and AUD.</p><p>Our results suggest that the glutamatergic system is recruited during alcohol withdrawal leading to mTORC1 activation in the OFC. One major glutamatergic input in the OFC is the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fresno et al., 2019</xref>). It would be therefore of interest to investigate whether thalamic nuclei inputs are recruited by alcohol to activate mTORC1 in the OFC.</p><p>We show here that GluN2B activation in the OFC may be sufficient to influence the formation and/or maintenance of alcohol seeking and habit. In line with the possibility that GluN2B activation contributes to the development of habit, DePoy et al. showed that habitual behavior, developed upon subchronic cocaine treatment during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DePoy et al., 2017</xref>), is inhibited by the treatment of animals with the GluN2B inhibitor, ifenprodil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DePoy et al., 2017</xref>). DePoy et al. further showed that cocaine exposure during adolescence produces structural changes in the OFC which were attenuated by ifenprodil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DePoy et al., 2017</xref>). While our data suggest that GluN2B in the OFC participates in behavioral inflexibility, Brigman et al. reported that GluN2B in the OFC plays a role in choice learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brigman et al., 2013</xref>). It is plausible that alcohol-dependent neuroadaptations tilt the function of GluN2B from choice learning, for example a goal-directed behavior, to habitual responding.</p><p>What could be the mechanism by which mTORC1 contributes to alcohol seeking and habit? Activation of mTORC1 triggers the translation of a subset of mRNAs to protein in the cell body and in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoon et al., 2016</xref>). We previously showed that long-term excessive alcohol intake and reinstatement of alcohol place preference initiate the translation of several synaptic proteins in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben Hamida et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laguesse et al., 2017b</xref>). We also found that reconsolidation of alcohol reward memories increases the immunoreactivity of mTORC1 targets in the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barak et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, further studies are required to identified transcripts which are translated in response to alcohol exposure and determine their role in alcohol seeking and habit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Anti-phospho-S6 (S235/236, 1:500), anti-S6 (1:1000), anti-phospho-4E-BP (T37/46, 1:500), anti-4E-BP (1:1000), anti-phospho-CaMKII (T286, 1:1000), anti-phospho-S6K (T389, 1:500), anti-S6K (1:500), anti phospho-GluN2B (Y1472, 1:500) and anti GluN2B (1:1000) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA).

An inactive lever was also extended during the operant sessions but had no programmed consequence. Following stable baseline of alcohol responding, rats underwent stereotaxic surgery for cannula placement in the OFC, as described above. After a one-week recovery period, operant self-administration procedure was resumed and handling for drug microinfusions began. Rats received infusion of either vehicle or rapamycin (50 ng/μl/side) 3 hr or R025-6981 (10 μg/μl/side) 15 min before a single 30 min extinction session. Drugs were injected with bilateral infusion needles (Plastics One) that projected 0.5 mm past the end of the guide cannula, at a rate of 0.5 μl/minute.

Self-administration training was initiated under fixed ration 1 (FR1) for three consecutive overnight sessions. Afterwards, the sessions lasted for an hour and took place during the light cycle. Only one lever was available during the operant sessions. Rats were pseudo-randomly assigned to two groups and were subjected to a random interval (RI), or a random ratio (RR) schedule of reinforcement which biases responding towards habitual or goal directed actions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>). Only rats that self-administered alcohol more than 0.3 g/kg/hour were included in the study.</p><p>RI training: During RI training, each reward was delivered following one lever press occurring after variable reward delivery time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>). Three sessions were under RI-5 (i.e. inter-reward time was 5 s on average, ranging from 1 to 10 s), followed by three RI-15 sessions (i.e. inter-reward time was 15 s on average ranging from 10 to 30 s). Reinforcement was then shifted to RI-30 (i.e. inter-reward time was 30 s on average ranging from 10 to 50 s) for at least 20 sessions (Timeline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p>RR training: During RR training, reward was delivered following a variable number of lever responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>).

Rats were given home-cage 2BC access to 1% sucrose on non-devalued (ND) days or 20% alcohol on devalued (D) days for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). On each day, immediately after home-cage pre-feeding, rats underwent a 10 min extinction test during which unrewarded lever presses were recorded. A ‘within-subject’ design was used in which ND or D sessions were in a counterbalanced order, with two standard retraining sessions between the tests. To minimize the effects of individual variance in total lever pressing, we normalized ND and D lever presses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gremel et al., 2016</xref>).

Normalizing devaluation lever presses produces a distribution of data, where 50% is equivalent to equal lever pressing between ND and D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>). At the end of the training period and upon acquiring the behavior (RR, goal directed behavior and RI, habitual behavior), rats underwent stereotaxic surgery to bilaterally implant a guide cannula in the ventrolateral OFC, as described above. One week later, RI-30 or RR-3 training was resumed for 2 weeks after which rats received microinjections of either vehicle or rapamycin (50 ng/μl/side) 3 hr or R025-6981 (5 μg/μl/side) 15 min prior an alcohol devaluation testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Habitual sucrose seeking</title><p>Habitual sucrose training followed an approach similar to that described above for habitual alcohol seeking. After 7 weeks of IA-20%2BC, high-drinking rats (alcohol intake &gt;3.5 g/kg/24 hr) were trained to self-administer 8% sucrose in an OSA paradigm. RI-30 training was similar to the procedure described for alcohol except that 8% sucrose was initially used and progressively reduced to 1% across training sessions. Only ten RI30 sessions (2 weeks) were conducted prior to the initial outcome devaluation test. Rats were then implanted with a guide cannula in the OFC as described above. After a week recovery period, sucrose self-administration was resumed for two weeks, after which rats received microinjections of vehicle or drug in a counter-balanced manner prior to the devaluation test. Sensitivity to changes in sucrose value was tested using a sucrose devaluation procedure which was similar to alcohol devaluation, except that rats had 2BC access to 20% alcohol on ND day and 1% sucrose on D day (Timeline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Histology</title><p>For verification of cannula placement, brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for one week, then rapidly frozen and sectioned into 50 μm coronal slices using a Leica CM3050 cryostat (Leica Biosystems).

for mechanistic target rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) action, potentially through GluN2B activation, in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in alcohol seeking and habitual intake. The study demonstrates that inhibition of mTORC1 activity attenuates alcohol seeking and restores sensitivity to outcome devaluation in rats that habitually seek alcohol. This effect was specific to alcohol as mTorc1 inhibition did not alter habitual responding to a natural reward. Overall, the study provides new insight into a mechanism, via GluN2B and mTORC1, in mediating a shift from goal-directed to habitual alcohol seeking.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex promotes habitual alcohol seeking&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michelle Mazei-Robison (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers find the study to be of interest, they raise concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. The reviewers agree that these revisions should not require additional experiments.</p><p>1) Please provide a compelling rationale for the exclusion criteria and provide details about numbers excluded further clarity on the exclusion criterion (did not acquire the behavior is vague) and why the exclusions do not create bias. This is in reference to the following statement: &quot;did not acquire the behavior and were pressing less than 5 lever presses per session on ND day&quot; (subsection “Habitual and goal-directed alcohol seeking and drug infusion”).</p><p>2) Please address fundamental issues with the below pattern of results, which appear to be empirically and conceptually discordant. This will aid the reader in understanding these discrepancies and clarify the overall significance of the current findings.</p><p>a) Please address how a manipulation disrupts alcohol seeking under normal conditions (without any satiety treatment, Figure 1D,E,F and Figure 4A,B,C) but not during ND tests (when rats are sated on irrelevant outcome, Figure 2E,G and Figure 5E). Could important procedural differences help to explain these differences?</p><p>b) Please address how disrupting habitual control can lead to a disruption of alcohol seeking, if the current and published (e.g., Yin et al., 2004; Corbit et al., 2014) data indicates that this does not lead to a response decrement, apparently due to compensation by the goal-directed system. While not all findings must fit tightly these issues are fundamental to judging the significance of the findings and their value to the field.</p><p>3) Please ensure that similar and appropriate details about instrumental training procedures are provided for all experiments, including differences; e.g., subsection “Alcohol seeking and drug infusion”. For instance, one difference is that rats are sated on sucrose prior to ND tests, while another difference is test duration.</p><p>4) Please provide a rationale for why phosphorylated GluN2B was not measured? The data in Figure 4C-J nicely links GluN2B function to alcohol-induced mTORC1 and the authors address alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B phosphorylation in other brain regions in the discussion. However, the activation of GluN2B is not specifically addressed in the study.</p><p>5) In Figure 2E, post-hoc comparisons are not necessary because a main effect between two conditions was found (not an interaction). Thus, the main effect can be indicated in the figure to emphasize that the groups don't differ in their preference for the valued outcome, but the direct comparisons should be eliminated.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex promotes habitual alcohol seeking&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kate Wassum (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The reviewers felt that the discussion was unfocused and speculative. While they do understand that this may reflect the goal to address the previous concerns, a more focused discussion would improve the manuscript. Below are the concerns that the reviewers felt should be addressed:</p><p>a) Discussion section, &quot;reward anticipation&quot; is invoked. This is problematic for the habit argument because habits are by nature uncoupled from reward value and an anticipation of the outcomes of one's behaviors. Thus, reward anticipation would not be a factor driving habitual behavior. If the authors want to make this argument, this should be clearly dissociated from the habit argument. Alternatively, rather than referring to action-outcome based reward anticipation, the authors may be referring to context-alcohol learning, which is likely a major source of motivation for habitual alcohol seeking. It is known that natural reward-paired cues preferentially motivate habitual reward-seeking actions (Holland, 2004; Wilgen et al., 2012) in a manner that does not depend on reward value (Rescorla, 1994; Holland, 2004).</p><p>b) Discussion section, the authors argue that mTORC1 could be strengthening OFC projections to the DLS. These projections do not exist – the OFC projects to large swaths of the striatum, but not the habit-associated DLS, referring to the dorsal-most region of the lateral striatum.</p><p>c) Discussion section remarks, &quot;it would be of interest to determine the normal role of mTORC1, and whether mTORC1 suppresses other decision-making tasks.&quot; This line was confusing given the author's investigations with sucrose reinforcers assessed this prospect.</p><p>d) Discussion section concludes with the phrase &quot;with less involvement coming from the lOFC.&quot; The cited references (Bradfield, Hart and Balleine, 2018; Gourley et al., 2016) do not investigate the lOFC, and thus, do not provide evidence for this notion. This section as a whole appears unfocused. It is suggested that this section be significantly edited down to simply make the point that the lOFC and mOFC have different functions in the context of goal-directed behavior. Currently, the arguments regarding the balance between the two are difficult to follow and very speculative, given the sole focus on lOFC here.</p><p>e) The authors' responses to comments 2 and 3 touch on important issues that help address confusion in understanding some apparent discrepancies in the data. However, the pieces are not entirely put together. The authors suggest that rapamycin and Ro25 treatments disrupt alcohol seeking late in nonreinforced tests, which explains why no deficits are found in short ND tests (also nonreinforced). However, the significance of this is not addressed. The reviewers suggest explicitly raising the possibility that habit processes may preferentially contribute to persistence of alcohol seeking in extinction. While persistence in extinction is not a critical test of habit behavior, it is certainly consistent with this account. Providing such a discussion would help link these findings to the devaluation results, which would benefit many readers.</p><p>2) There were concerns with the exclusion of subjects based on arbitrarily low performance of the nondevalued action (only) at test because this, by design, creates a bias, increasing the likelihood of detecting a difference between devalued vs. nondevalued actions. The rationale was that low nondevalued action performance at test meant that animals had &quot;generally not escalated their lever-pressing during training&quot;. Based on this it is suggested that the authors exclude based on low response rate during training, which doesn't create a systematic bias and is in line with accepted practice. Alternatively, it suggested that the authors include the two excluded subjects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51333.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers find the study to be of interest, they raise concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.

In essence, this study is focused on alcohol seeking behaviors, and we have attempted to exclude animals from the study who do not reliably seek alcohol. We set the cutoff at 5 lever presses, because animals who press at this rate have generally not escalated their lever-pressing during training, which could mean that they have not properly learned the task or may not find alcohol sufficiently rewarding to elicit seeking behavior. Including these animals can also skew the normalized lever pressing data in either direction due to very slight changes in pressing, much smaller than the standard deviation. Only two rats were excluded from the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please address fundamental issues with the below pattern of results, which appear to be empirically and conceptually discordant. This will aid the reader in understanding these discrepancies and clarify the overall significance of the current findings.</p><p>a) Please address how a manipulation disrupts alcohol seeking under normal conditions (without any satiety treatment, Figure 1D,E,F and Figure 4A,B,C) but not during ND tests (when rats are sated on irrelevant outcome, Figure 2E,G and Figure 5E). Could important procedural differences help to explain these differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this question. It is important to note that extinction does disrupt alcohol seeking in general, with or without satiety treatment. One difference between the extinction tests is that tests depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 5A last 30 minutes, while the extinction tests in Figure 2 and Figure 5E (devaluation tests) last only 10 minutes. In order to minimize any general effects of satiety treatment, none of the rats in any of the experiments were food or water restricted at any time. Although it is possible that the home cage satiety treatment on an irrelevant outcome (ND tests) could impact seeking behavior, we did not compare alcohol seeking in these animals with an additional group that underwent no satiety treatment, as this experiment is beyond the scope of the questions addressed in this manuscript. We believe that even if satiety treatment on an irrelevant outcome does impact seeking in either direction, this would not change the main conclusions drawn from the data presented here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Please address how disrupting habitual control can lead to a disruption of alcohol seeking, if the current and published (e.g., Yin et al., 2004; Corbit et al., 2014) data indicates that this does not lead to a response decrement, apparently due to compensation by the goal-directed system. While not all findings must fit tightly these issues are fundamental to judging the significance of the findings and their value to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment raises a salient point on the impact of shifting action control from a more habitual to goal-directed strategy in general. As far as translational goals are concerned, we are not preoccupied with necessarily reducing alcohol consumption in all cases, but rather with decreasing habitual, excessive, and compulsive drinking. While the overall treatment goal with other drugs of abuse may be complete abstinence, alcohol is unique in that moderate alcohol consumption under acceptable circumstances meets societal standards in many regions of the world. For this reason, more research is needed into the respective roles of habitual and goal-directed alcohol seeking in human cohorts. It is likely that there is at least some compensation from the goal-directed system when you disrupt habitual control. Indeed, we show in Figure 1 that inhibition of mTOR in the OFC does not alter alcohol consumption or self-administration except in extinction sessions, which would indicate that these animals still drink at the same level, but their action selection strategy has shifted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please ensure that similar and appropriate details about instrumental training procedures are provided for all experiments, including differences; e.g., subsection “Alcohol seeking and drug infusion”. For instance, one difference is that rats are sated on sucrose prior to ND tests, while another difference is test duration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Materials and methods section of the paper to minimize confusion between the different devaluation protocols for sucrose and alcohol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please provide a rationale for why phosphorylated GluN2B was not measured? The data in Figure 4C-J nicely links GluN2B function to alcohol-induced mTORC1 and the authors address alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B phosphorylation in other brain regions in the discussion. However, the activation of GluN2B is not specifically addressed in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Not measuring GluN2B phosphorylation was an oversight on our behalf especially since it is a true indication of GluN2B activation. We added new data to the revision showing that alcohol significantly increases GluN2B phosphorylation with no accompanying change in total GluN2B protein level. These results are now presented in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 2E, post-hoc comparisons are not necessary because a main effect between two conditions was found (not an interaction). Thus, the main effect can be indicated in the figure to emphasize that the groups don't differ in their preference for the valued outcome, but the direct comparisons should be eliminated.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewer’s request, we revised the statistics and figure legend for Figure 2E (now Figure 2D).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The reviewers felt that the discussion was unfocused and speculative. While they do understand that this may reflect the goal to address the previous concerns, a more focused discussion would improve the manuscript. Below are the concerns that the reviewers felt should be addressed:</p><p>a) Discussion section, &quot;reward anticipation&quot; is invoked. This is problematic for the habit argument because habits are by nature uncoupled from reward value and an anticipation of the outcomes of one's behaviors. Thus, reward anticipation would not be a factor driving habitual behavior. If the authors want to make this argument, this should be clearly dissociated from the habit argument. Alternatively, rather than referring to action-outcome based reward anticipation, the authors may be referring to context-alcohol learning, which is likely a major source of motivation for habitual alcohol seeking. It is known that natural reward-paired cues preferentially motivate habitual reward-seeking actions (Holland, 2004; Wilgen et al., 2012) in a manner that does not depend on reward value (Rescorla, 1994; Holland, 2004).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ point and the validity of their argument. We modified the term “action-outcome based reward anticipation” to “context-alcohol learning”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Discussion section, the authors argue that mTORC1 could be strengthening OFC projections to the DLS. These projections do not exist – the OFC projects to large swaths of the striatum, but not the habit-associated DLS, referring to the dorsal-most region of the lateral striatum.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this part of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Discussion section remarks, &quot;it would be of interest to determine the normal role of mTORC1, and whether mTORC1 suppresses other decision-making tasks.&quot; This line was confusing given the author's investigations with sucrose reinforcers assessed this prospect.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. By normal we are referring to known OFC-dependent behaviors such as decision making (Wallis, 2007; Meyer and Bucci, 2016; Baltz et al., 2018), stimulus-outcome association (Ostlund and Balleine, 2007; Gourley et al., 2013; Gremel and Costa, 2013) and updating the value of predicted outcomes (Fiuzat et al., 2017; Baltz et al., 2018). The word “normal” has been deleted from the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Discussion section concludes with the phrase &quot;with less involvement coming from the lOFC.&quot; The cited references (Bradfield, Hart and Balleine, 2018; Gourley et al., 2016) do not investigate the lOFC, and thus, do not provide evidence for this notion. This section as a whole appears unfocused. It is suggested that this section be significantly edited down to simply make the point that the lOFC and mOFC have different functions in the context of goal-directed behavior. Currently, the arguments regarding the balance between the two are difficult to follow and very speculative, given the sole focus on lOFC here.</p></disp-quote><p>This part of the Discussion section was edited according to the reviewers’ suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors' responses to comments 2 and 3 touch on important issues that help address confusion in understanding some apparent discrepancies in the data. However, the pieces are not entirely put together. The authors suggest that rapamycin and Ro25 treatments disrupt alcohol seeking late in nonreinforced tests, which explains why no deficits are found in short ND tests (also nonreinforced). However, the significance of this is not addressed. The reviewers suggest explicitly raising the possibility that habit processes may preferentially contribute to persistence of alcohol seeking in extinction. While persistence in extinction is not a critical test of habit behavior, it is certainly consistent with this account. Providing such a discussion would help link these findings to the devaluation results, which would benefit many readers.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment raises an important point. While the reviewers are correct in noting that persistent alcohol seeking during extinction may be consistent with habitual behavior, we do not have sufficient data to support this claim, as the animals in Figure 1 and Figure 5A-C did not undergo RI training or even extended FR training, which would condition untreated rats toward more habitual seeking. The differences in seeking behavior between rapamycin- or Ro25-treated animals in the 30-minute nonreinforced tests are likely to be due to, at least in part, to changes in action-selection strategy, but speculation on enhancing already goal-directed behavior might generate uncertainty in readers. We addressed this concern in the Discussion section by highlighting the possibility that a shift in action-selection strategy may already be present in the 30-minute nonreinforced sessions, but we need to use RI training and devaluation to confirm this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There were concerns with the exclusion of subjects based on arbitrarily low performance of the nondevalued action (only) at test because this, by design, creates a bias, increasing the likelihood of detecting a difference between devalued vs. nondevalued actions. The rationale was that low nondevalued action performance at test meant that animals had &quot;generally not escalated their lever-pressing during training&quot;. Based on this it is suggested that the authors exclude based on low response rate during training, which doesn't create a systematic bias and is in line with accepted practice. Alternatively, it suggested that the authors include the two excluded subjects.</p></disp-quote><p>Per the reviewers’ request, we now include in the analysis the two rats which are pressing below threshold. Inclusion of the subjects did not change the interpretations and/or conclusions, the text and figures have been updated accordingly.</p></body></sub-article></article>
