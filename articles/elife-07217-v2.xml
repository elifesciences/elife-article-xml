However, over-active osteoclasts can cause bone-degenerative disorders. Therefore, the level of NFATc1, the master transcription factor of osteoclast, must be tightly controlled. Although the activation and amplification of NFATc1 have been extensively studied, how NFATc1 signaling is eventually resolved is unclear. Here, we uncover a novel and critical role of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 in mediating an NFATc1 self-limiting regulatory loop to prevent excessive osteoclastogenesis. Nur77 deletion leads to low bone mass owing to augmented osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Mechanistically, NFATc1 induces Nur77 expression at late stage of osteoclast differentiation; in turn, Nur77 transcriptionally up-regulates E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b, which triggers NFATc1 protein degradation. These findings not only identify Nur77 as a key player in osteoprotection and a new therapeutic target for bone diseases, but also elucidate a previously unrecognized NFATc1→Nur77→Cblb—•NFATc1 feedback mechanism that confers NFATc1 signaling autoresolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07217.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07217.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07217.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bones are constantly remodeled in response to the stresses of everyday life. Cells called osteoclasts break down old or damaged bone and cells called osteoblasts make new bone. In healthy bones, the work of these two types of cells is well balanced. But in bone-weakening diseases like osteoporosis and certain bone cancers this balance is disturbed and the osteoclasts become overly active, leading to weak and thin bones.</p><p>Some drugs can help block the development of osteoclasts and help reduce bone loss in these diseases, but they may cause unwanted side effects. A better understanding of the processes that maintain a healthy balance of osteoblasts and osteoclasts could help scientists develop better treatments with fewer side effects. Scientists have already learned that a protein called NFATc1 turns on the production of osteoclasts. But no one knew how NFATc1 is turned off in healthy bone to prevent the excessive growth of osteoclasts and too much bone turnover.</p><p>Now, Li et al. have identified a protein called Nur77 as an important regulator of NFATc1 by examining genetically engineered mice that lack Nur77. These modified mice had more osteoclasts and thinner bones than normal mice. Further experiments used radiation to wipe out the bone marrow of normal mice, who then received bone marrow transplants from mice that lacked Nur77. After the transplant, the normal mice showed bone loss. When the experiment was reversed, and Nur77-lacking mice received bone marrow from normal mice, their bone loss was alleviated. This indicates that Nur77 acts in the bone marrow cells to control osteoclasts and skeletal health.</p><p>Li et al. found that Nur77 cannot control the expression of the gene that encodes NFATc1 or directly bind to the NFATc1 protein. Instead, Nur77 increases the production of an enzyme that breaks down the NFATc1 protein. Unexpectedly, the experiments also found that NFATc1 turns on the expression of Nur77. This means that NFATc1 essentially regulates itself by increasing its own breakdown when NFATc1 levels increase. This helps to explain how osteoclast production is normally kept in check, and may suggest new strategies for treating bone diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07217.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07217.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Nur77</kwd><kwd>NFATc1</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>Cbl-b</kwd><kwd>bone resorption</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK089113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Individual Investigator Award, RP130145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BCRP Idea Award W81XWH-13-1-0318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant, #6-FY13-137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant, I-1751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Yihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 protects bone by enabling a timely termination of osteoclast differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone is a dynamic organ that replaces itself every 10 years in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Office of the Surgeon General (US), 2004</xref>). It needs to maintain an optimal density to carry out important support, movement, and protective functions in organisms. The density of bone is tightly regulated by the bone-forming osteoblasts and the bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Osteoblasts come from the mesenchymal precursor cells, whereas osteoclast precursors come from monocyte–macrophage lineage cells. Upon RANKL signaling, osteoclast precursor cells fuse and become multi-nucleated giant cells that can degrade both the organic and inorganic tissues of the bone. Osteoclast dysregulation has been associated with several human skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer metastasis to the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novack and Teitelbaum, 2008</xref>). Drugs that can inhibit osteoclast differentiation, activity, or survival have been shown to be effective against these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drake et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Body et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>NFATc1 is a key transcriptional switch that activates osteoclastogenesis. Ectopic NFATc1 expression alone in osteoclast precursors is sufficient to produce mature osteoclasts, whereas NFATc1 deletion blocks the ability of the precursors to differentiate into osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Takayanagi et al., 2002</xref>). NFATc1 binds to its response elements containing a consensus sequence of GGAAA, and its target genes in osteoclasts include cathepsin K, CLC-7 chloride channel, vacuolar proton pump subunit Atp6v0d2, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuroda and Matsuo, 2012</xref>). NFATc1 has been shown to auto-amplify during osteoclast differentiation, and this auto-amplification process has been suggested to be important for osteoclast lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asagiri et al., 2005</xref>). However, so far very few studies have dealt with whether and how NFATc1 signaling is attenuated upon its initial activation. As a result, despite the crucial functions of NFATc1 in osteoclastogenesis, the mechanisms for how NFATc1 signaling is resolved to prevent excessive osteoclast differentiation are still incompletely understood.</p><p>Nur77 (encoded by <italic>Nr4a1</italic>), also known as nerve growth factor IB (NGFIB), TR3 or NAK-1, is an orphan nuclear receptor in the Nr4a family, which also includes Nurr1 (<italic>Nr4a2</italic>) and Nor-1 (<italic>Nr4a3</italic>). Unlike other nuclear receptors whose functions are mainly modulated by their ligands, Nur77 is mostly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhao and Bruemmer, 2010</xref>). Nur77 can bind to NurRE or NBRE as monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Philips et al., 1997</xref>). Nur77 has been implicated in a variety of physiological processes, including thymocyte negative selection, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, chronic inflammation, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, it is unknown whether Nur77 can directly regulate skeletal homeostasis or bone cell differentiation. In this study, we uncover a novel and important role of Nur77 in NFATc1 protein degradation during osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, thus revealing a previously unrecognized mechanism that is essential for the resolution of NFATc1 signaling in which NFATc1 exerts self-limitation via an NFATc1→Nur77→Cblb—•NFATc1 negative feedback loop.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nur77 deletion enhances osteoclast differentiation</title><p>To examine the expression pattern of Nur77 during osteoclast differentiation, we treated bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursor cells with RANKL for 4 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A time course analysis showed that <italic>Nr4a1</italic> mRNA started to rise on day 2 during osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The other two members of the NR4A family, <italic>Nr4a2</italic> and <italic>Nr4a3</italic>, were either not expressed or expressed at much lower levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine if there is any potential regulatory role of Nur77 in osteoclastogenesis, we compared osteoclast differentiation cultures from bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors of Nur77 knockout (Nur77 KO) mice and WT littermate controls. The results revealed an enhanced osteoclast differentiation in Nur77 KO cultures shown by the higher expression of osteoclast differentiation markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (<italic>Trap</italic>), cathepsin K (<italic>Ctsk</italic>), calcitonin receptor (<italic>Calcr</italic>), carbonic anhydrase 2 (<italic>Car2</italic>), as well as the master osteoclastogenic transcription factor <italic>Nfatc1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with these results, we have also observed more and larger mature osteoclasts in the differentiation cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as well as higher resorptive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes was comparable, indicating an unaffected osteoclast apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We first compared osteoblast differentiation cultures derived from Nur77 KO or WT control mice and found that there was no difference in the expression of <italic>Rankl</italic> or <italic>Opg</italic>, resulting in a comparable <italic>Rankl</italic>/<italic>Opg</italic> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Recently osteocytes, the mature long living osteoblasts embedded in the bone matrix, have been shown to provide the majority of RANKL and OPG to osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nakashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, we compared <italic>Rankl</italic> and <italic>Opg</italic> expression in femur shafts that contain mainly osteocytes. Our results showed that there was no difference in <italic>Rankl</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>); however, Nur77 KO osteocytes express a markedly higher level of <italic>Opg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), leading to a significantly lower <italic>Rankl</italic>/<italic>Opg</italic> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The lower <italic>Rankl</italic>/<italic>Opg</italic> ratio in the Nur77 KO mice is unlikely to be the cause of the augmented osteoclastogenesis, but presumably an attempt of osteocytes to suppress the osteoclast over-activation. These results, coupled with unaltered in vitro osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and in vivo bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q,S</xref>), suggest that osteoblast/osteocyte are not major contributors to the excessive osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption in Nur77 KO mice.</p><p>Inflammatory cytokines in the bone microenvironment can also promote osteoclast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zupan et al., 2013</xref>).

RANKL binding to RANK receptor on osteoclast precursor cells activates AP1 transcription factor via c-Jun phosphorylation, as well as NFκB transcription factor via IκBα degradation, which in turn induces and initiates the autoamplification of NFATc1, the master transcriptional switch of osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kuroda and Matsuo, 2012</xref>).

Nur77 deletion causes elevated bone resorption and bone loss in mice. Moreover, we have also unraveled a previously unrecognized mechanism for how Nur77 attenuates NFATc1 signaling at late stage of osteoclast differentiation. Nur77 transcriptionally up-regulates Cbl-b E3 ligase to trigger NFATc1 protein degradation, so that NFATc1 signaling can be resolved in a timely fashion to prevent excessive osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>When osteoclast differentiation is enhanced in a culture, typically all RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic genes will be elevated, including <italic>Nfatc1</italic>, because the gene expression analysis is a population-based assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to induction by RANKL-activated upstream signaling, NFATc1 also auto-amplifies itself at mRNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asagiri et al., 2005</xref>), which makes it harder to discern the origin of NFATc1 regulation in osteoclast cultures. Thus, we subsequently examined the intrinsic ability of Nur77 to regulate NFATc1 via transfection in a heterologous cell type such as HEK293 cells, in the absence of the other RANKL signaling in osteoclast cultures. We show that Nur77 can decrease NFATc1 protein levels without affecting <italic>Nfatc1</italic> mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Also, there is no Nur77 binding sequence in NFATc1 promoter, further support that Nur77 does not directly regulate NFATc1 transcription. Moreover, our co-IP experiment show that Nur77 (either endogenous or a flag-tagged) does not directly interact with NFATc1, suggesting that Nur77 does not directly modulate NFATc1 localization or activity. As a result, we conclude that Nur77 mainly regulates NFATc1 protein degradation.</p><p>In searching for the Nur77-induced NFATc1-targeting E3 ubiquitin ligase, we have considered both of the two members in the Cbl family—Cbl and Cbl-b. Findings from our study and previous studies indicate that Cbl-b, but not Cbl, is the major regulator in osteoclast due to the following reasons: (1) previous studies and our data show that Cbl-b KO mice exhibit enhanced osteoclast differentiation, higher bone resorption and lower bone mass that is similar to the phenotype we observed in Nur77 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakajima et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, adult Cbl KO mice have no obvious bone phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiusaroli et al., 2003</xref>). This supports that Cbl-b, but not Cbl, is a physiologically significant regulator of osteoclast in vivo. (2) Nur77 over-expression induces the expression of Cbl-b, but not Cbl. (3) A complete NurRE exists only in Cbl-b promoter, but not in Cbl promoter. (4) Nur77 KO osteoclast cultures show a significant lower level of Cbl-b, but not Cbl. (5) Finally, our in vivo genetic data comparing Nur77 Cblb DKO mice with Cblb KO mice show that Cbl-b deletion completely abolishes the enhanced osteoclast differentiation, elevated bone resorption, and reduced bone mass in Nur77 KO mice, demonstrating that Cbl-b is the major and essential mediator of Nur77 regulation of osteoclastogenesis, which is not compensated by Cbl.</p><p>In the process of studying the role of Nur77 in NFATc1 regulation and osteoclast differentiation, we inadvertently discovered that Nur77 is not only a regulator of NFATc1 but also a transcriptional target of NFATc1, thus revealing a negative feedback loop where NFATc1 induces its own degradation by up-regulating Nur77 and Cbl-b. This mechanism is crucial for proper cellular differentiation and function, since the resolution of signaling is just as important as its initiation and amplification. A breach in the NFATc1→Nur77→Cblb—•NFATc1 regulatory loop, exemplified by the Nur77 KO mice, will cause pathologically elevated NFATc1 levels during late stage of osteoclastogenesis and send osteoclasts into overdrive. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to propose an NFATc1 self-limiting regulatory mechanism. Therefore, NFATc1 exerts three functions to control osteoclastogenesis. In addition to the previously recognized roles in its auto-amplification and activating osteoclast genes to initiate the differentiation, NFATc1 also plays a role in its auto-resolution to cease the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Our findings will pave the road for future investigations to examine whether this NFATc1→Nur77→Cblb—•NFATc1 negative feedback loop may be widely applicable to NFATc1 regulation of other cellular processes such as T cell activation and cancer development.</p><p>Identification of novel osteoclast signaling pathways provides insights into potential new therapeutic options to treat bone-degenerative diseases by inhibiting osteoclast activity. Current clinically approved osteoclast inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab (anti-RANKL antibody), may cause severe side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Khan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boquete-Castro et al., 2015</xref>). These side effects could stem from a variety of factors including target specificity. The whole body Nur77 KO mice, however, provides an example where despite the wide spread expression of a gene, it still can be targeted due to the differential sensitivity in different tissues. Although Nur77 has been implicated in numerous physiological functions in vitro, most of these functions did not hold true in vivo based on a general lack of phenotype in Nur77 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2013</xref>). Until recently, Nur77 KO mice largely appear healthy and normal, and only exhibit clinical deficiencies under severe stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Palumbo-Zerr et al., 2015</xref>) or with the deletion of an additional NR4A gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mullican et al., 2007</xref>). This may be partially due to functional redundancy among NR4A family members so that the compensation by Nurr1 and Nor1 masks the effects of Nur77 loss. Interestingly, we found that Nur77 is the predominant NR4A member in the osteoclast lineage with little or no Nurr1 or Nor1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), explaining the critical role of Nur77 in osteoclastogenesis so that the effects on bone is evident by Nur77 deletion alone. This creates an exciting opportunity for selective drug targeting and precision medicine with minimal side effects. Most recently, Tontonoz et al. have uncovered a muscle protective role of Nur77 as mice deficient in Nur77 alone exhibit reduced muscle mass and myofiber size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tontonoz et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, Nur77 activation may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for musculoskeletal degenerative diseases with dual benefits on muscle and bone.</p><p>The crucial regulation of NFATc1 protein degradation by Nur77 and Cbl-b suggests that it may be therapeutically beneficial to accelerate RANKL signaling resolution during osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, defects in the components of ubiquitin and proteasome system have been implicated in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Popovic et al., 2014</xref>). Bortezomib, a peptide inhibitor of proteasome, has been approved for clinical usage in pathological settings such as refractory multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richardson et al., 2005</xref>). The discovery of pathway-specific ubiquitin–proteasome activators, however, is somewhat lagging behind. Nonetheless, oleuropein, a small molecule proteasome activator, has been shown to delay replicative senescence of human embryonic fibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katsiki et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, oleuropein treatment has been shown to inhibit osteoclast formation and suppress the loss of trabecular bone in ovariectomized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hagiwara et al., 2011</xref>), giving hope that small molecules that selectively activate the protein degradation pathway may be a promising future therapeutic strategy for skeletal and other diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Nur77 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 1995</xref>) in a C57BL/6 and 129SvJ hybrid background was originally generated by Jeffrey Milbrandt at Washington University School of Medicine and kindly provided by Orla Conneely at Baylor College of Medicine. Cblb KO mice in a mixed background were originally generated by Josef Penninger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmaier et al., 2000</xref>). Mice were fed with standard chow ad libitum and kept on a 12-hr light, 12-hr dark cycle. Nur77 KO mice were bred with Cblb KO mice to generate Nur77 Cblb double heterozygous mice, which were then bred to generate littermates for Nur77 KO, Cblb KO, Nur77 Cblb DKO, and WT control. All experiments were conducted using littermates. Bone marrow transplantation was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krzeszinski et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, bone marrow cells from 2-month-old male donor (WT or Nur77 KO) were intravenously transplanted via retro orbital injection into 2-month-old male recipients (WT or Nur77 KO) that were irradiated at lethal dose (1000 roentgen); the mice were analyzed 3 month post transplantation. Our established protocol for lethal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation achieves &gt;95% repopulation of donor cells in the recipient mice, as measured by the percentage of CD45.1 vs CD45.2. Sample size estimate was based on power analyses performed using SAS 9.3 TS X64_7PRO platform at the UTSW Biostatistics Core. With the observed group differences and the relatively small variation of the in vivo measurements, n = 4 and n = 3 will provide &gt;90% and &gt;80% power at type I error rate of 0.05 (two-sided test), respectively.
