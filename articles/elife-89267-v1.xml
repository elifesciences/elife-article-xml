where a previously reinforced stimulus or response is no longer reinforced, and the previously learned behaviour is no longer necessary and must be modified. Current theories suggest extinction is not the erasure of the original learning but involves new learning that acts to suppress the original behaviour. Evidence for this can be found when the original behaviour recovers following the passage of time (spontaneous recovery) or reintroduction of the reinforcement (i.e. reinstatement). Recent studies have shown that pharmacological manipulation of noradrenaline (NA) or its receptors can influence appetitive extinction; however, the role and source of endogenous NA in these effects are unknown. Here, we examined the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) in appetitive extinction. Specifically, we tested whether optogenetic stimulation of LC neurons during extinction of a food-seeking behaviour would enhance extinction evidenced by reduced spontaneous recovery in future tests. LC stimulation during extinction trials did not change the rate of extinction but did serve to reduce subsequent spontaneous recovery, suggesting that stimulation of the LC can augment reward-related extinction. Optogenetic inhibition of the LC during extinction trials reduced responding during the trials where it was applied, but no long-lasting changes in the retention of extinction were observed. Since not all LC cells expressed halorhodopsin, it is possible that more complete LC inhibition or pathway-specific targeting would be more effective at suppressing extinction learning. These results provide further insight into the neural basis of appetitive extinction, and in particular the role of the LC. A deeper understanding of the physiological bases of extinction can aid development of more effective extinction-based therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>extinction</kwd><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>prediction error</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2019-06947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lui</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Corbit</surname><given-names>Laura H</given-names></name><name><surname>Brink</surname><given-names>Ashleigh K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The long-term retention of extinction is enhanced by ontogenetic stimulation of locus coeruleus neurons applied during extinction of a reward-seeking response, further implicating noradrenaline in appetitive extinction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to detect and encode relationships between events and modify previously learned behaviours when confronted with new information is essential for adaptive, flexible control of behaviour. Extinction is a specific example where a previously reinforced stimulus or response is no longer reinforced, and the previously learned behaviour is no longer necessary. Contemporary theories of learning suggest that extinction is not simply the erasure of previous learning but rather involves new inhibitory learning, suppressing the original learned behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iordanova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouton et al., 2021</xref>). Evidence for this comes from numerous demonstrations that the original learning can be uncovered following reintroduction of the original reinforcer (i.e. reinstatement; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rescorla and Heth, 1975</xref>), testing outside the extinction context (i.e. renewal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouton and King, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">GarcÃ­a-GutiÃ©rrez and Rosas, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>), or simply by allowing the passage of time between extinction training and testing (i.e. spontaneous recovery; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rescorla, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rescorla, 2004</xref>). These phenomena mean that extinction-based therapies are not always successful in suppressing previously established behaviours, thus sparking interest in developing methods for augmenting extinction learning. A more complete understanding of the neural and pharmacological bases of extinction may improve progress in this regard.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that noradrenaline (NA) can influence extinction learning. For example, blocking NA reuptake with atomoxetine can augment extinction of reward-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janak and Corbit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furlong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung and Corbit, 2017</xref>). In contrast, the application of the Î²-receptor antagonist propranolol impairs extinction learning related to rewarding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janak and Corbit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung and Corbit, 2017</xref>) and fear-provoking events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berlau and McGaugh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Do-Monte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with a role in extinction, experiments using fast-scan voltammetry observed a surge in NA release that coincided with the omission of an expected reward implicating the endogenous noradrenergic system in detecting extinction contingencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While these studies illustrate that NA can enhance the strength or longevity of extinction learning, the source of NA mediating these effects is unknown. It is likely that projections originating in the locus coeruleus (LC) are responsible as the LC has direct anatomical connections with multiple brain regions that contribute to extinction, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the infralimbic cortex (IFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies that recorded LC activity in freely behaving rats observed that LC activity increased when rats were presented with novel stimuli, and while this response rapidly habituated, LC activity rapidly increased again when a stimulus was followed by reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sara et al., 1994</xref>), suggesting that the LC responds to novelty. However, the LC was also reported to increase activity when stimulus-reinforcer contingencies were reversed and during extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sara and Segal, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>), suggesting that the LC may not simply be responding to novelty, but also to changes in expected outcomes in order to facilitate a corresponding change in behaviour.</p><p>Looking back to earlier studies that directly tied LC manipulations to extinction learning, lesions of the LC were shown to impair extinction of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mason and Fibiger, 1978</xref>) and 6-OHDA lesions targeting the dorsal noradrenergic bundle slowed extinction in an appetitive runway task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mason and Iversen, 1975</xref>), although electrolytic lesions of the LC, which deplete forebrain NA less completely, were found to have little impact on appetitive extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koob et al., 1978</xref>). While more recent studies using either optogenetic or chemogenetic methods to activate the LC have reported somewhat conflicting results, in some cases enhancing and other cases disrupting extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giustino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giustino et al., 2020</xref>), this could be explained by the differences in levels of fear, differences in the intensity of stimulation, as strong LC stimulation can be fear promoting, or by an increasing appreciation of the modular organization of the LC and differential role of different projection targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandler et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that recent studies have largely focused on the extinction of conditioned fear and relatively less is known about whether LC stimulation can modulate extinction of reward-related behaviours. This distinction is not trivial because fear conditioning paradigms also inherently involve noxious stimulation, the impact of which can be amplified by LC stimulation, and these paradigms involve a degree of stress or anxiety, conditions tied to NA levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang and Aston-Jones, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giustino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While electrophysiological recording data show that LC neurons respond to sudden reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sara and Segal, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su and Cohen, 2022</xref>), these results have been inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>). It remains unclear whether any change in activity reflects a response to novelty or change, or contributes to learning a new extinction contingency. The goal of the following study was to examine the role of the LC in appetitive extinction. Specifically, we examined whether direct optogenetic stimulation of LC neurons during extinction of a food-seeking behaviour would enhance extinction evidenced by reduced spontaneous recovery in future tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Histological verification of LC-NA neurons across treatment groups</title><p>Rats were trained in a discriminated operant task, where lever-pressing during stimulus presentations resulted in food reward. Responding was then extinguished across three sessions and retention of extinction tested 1 and 7 d later. Schematics of training, testing, and optogenetic manipulation are provided in Figures 2A and 4D. In the first experiment, 43 male and female rats were randomly divided into three treatment groups: A channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) group, which consisted of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre rats injected with AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry, an offset group, which consisted of TH-Cre rats injected with the same virus expressing ChR2 but received stimulation during the inter-trial intervals (ITI), and controls, which consisted of TH-Cre LongâEvans (LE) rats (n = 7, receiving light pulses during the CS) and wild-type LE rats (receiving light pulses during CS presentations; n = 8, or during the ITI; n = 7) injected with the control virus (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-mCherry). Preliminary analyses demonstrated no differences between TH-Cre and wild-type controls (stimulus and offset) during training [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; F(2,19) = 1.149, p=0.338], extinction [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; F(2,19) = 1.883, p=0.179], or testing [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; test 1: F(2,19) = 0.352, p=0.708; test 2: F(2,19) = 0.250, p=0.781], and so they were collapsed for further analyses and are henceforth referred to as the control group.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Histological verification of optogenetic targeting of noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To verify viral expression, the LC was stained with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) primary antibody along with secondary antibody with Alexa Fluor 488 to identify TH-positive neurons in the region of the LC. The same tissue was counterstained with mCherry primary antibody and enhanced with Alexa Fluor 568 to determine the overlap of virally infected TH-positive cells. Cell counts and calculation of infection rates were conducted on sections of the LC positioned between â9.68 and â10.04 mm in the anteriorâposterior plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>). Each section provided ~116 Â± 25 TH-positive LC neurons as determined by DAPI and TH/Alexa Fluor 488 staining. Viral expression was identified by colocalized TH and mCherry expression. Animals that did not have viral expression in the LC were not included in the experimental groups. TH-Cre LongâEvans (LE) rats showed clear viral expression in the LC with approximately 73 Â± 2.8% of all TH+ cells in the LC expressing AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-mCherry, with an example provided in the overlay, and 97 Â± 2.5% of infected cells staining positive for TH indicating robust and selective targeting of noradrenergic LC neurons (<bold>A</bold>).

When the behaviour of multiple control groups was compared, TH-Cre and LE rats expressing control virus and receiving light delivery during stimulus presentation in extinction, as well as offset controls expressing ChR2 virus and receiving light delivery during the inter-trial intervals (ITI) of extinction sessions showed no significant differences in response rates on the final day of training (<bold>E</bold>), during extinction sessions with light delivery (<bold>F</bold>), or during tests of spontaneous recovery conducted without stimulation the next day (test 1) and again 1 wk later (test 2; <bold>G</bold>; p&gt;0.05).

We first examined the effect of stimulating noradrenergic LC neurons during extinction. Rats were trained in a discriminated operant task where lever-pressing during 20 s stimulus presentations resulted in delivery of a food reward, whereas responses in the absence of a stimulus had no programmed consequences. At the end of acquisition, TH-Cre rats expressing ChR2 were assigned to either the experimental group (ChR2), which received optogenetic stimulation (5 ms pulses at 10 Hz) for the duration of each stimulus presentation across trials in the upcoming extinction sessions, or the offset group that received equivalent stimulation during the ITI. These groups were compared to the control group that was administered a control virus (AAV5-EF1a-DIO-mCherry) and so equivalent optogenetic stimulation was expected to be without effect. On the final day of acquisition, there were no group differences in response rates (lever presses per trial) during stimulus presentations [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; F(2,40) = 2.302, p=0.113]. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lever-pressing rates decreased across days of extinction [F(2,80) = 52.686, p=0.001] and there was no main effect of group [F(2,40) = 0.934, p=0.402] or interaction between day and group [F(4,80) = 1.061, p=0.381], suggesting that optogenetic LC stimulation did not have an immediate effect on instrumental performance during extinction training. However, we hypothesized that LC stimulation may still influence retention of extinction learning. To examine this, we tested for spontaneous recovery of responding the next day, without stimulation. In this test, there was an effect of group [test 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; F(2, 40) = 4.037, p=0.025] and pairwise comparisons demonstrated that rats in the ChR2 group responded significantly less compared to control [t(35) = 2.9.04, p=0.003] or offset [t(19) = 1.735, p=0.049] groups. The control and offset groups did not differ from each other [t(26) = 0.522, p=0.303]. While the test data clearly show lower responding in the ChR2 group, responding overall was low at test and comparison of the final extinction session to the test sessions does not show clear evidence of spontaneous recovery in controls. One reason for this is that the extinction sessions were longer than the tests and relatively high responding at the beginning of the session was averaged with relatively lower responding in latter trials. To illustrate spontaneous recovery, we compared the final three trials of extinction to the first three trials of testing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Analysis of the trial data confirmed an effect of trial [F(5, 200) = 5.655, p=0.001] and while there was no main effect of group [F(2, 40) = 0.332, p=0.719], there was a trial by group interaction [F(10, 200) = 3.127, p=0.001], indicating that responding across trials differed by group. To directly test for spontaneous recovery, we compared responding during the last trial of extinction to the first test trial for each group. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the control group increased responding from the end of extinction to the beginning of the test the following day [t(21) = 3.745, p=0.001], thus demonstrating spontaneous recovery. A similar pattern was observed in the offset group, although likely due to the smaller group size, this effect was marginal [t(5) = 1.946, p=0.055]. Of note, there was no change in responding across time in the ChR2 group [t(14) = 0.445, p=0.890]. As responding remained low in this group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), this suggests that LC stimulation enhanced retention of extinction, making it less susceptible to disruption by the passage of time. To test whether this was a lasting effect, we tested the same rats again 1 wk later, where we observed a similar effect of group [test 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; F(2,40) = 3.732, p=0.033], resulting again from reduced responding in the ChR2 group compared to the control [t(35) = 2.663, p=0.006] or offset groups [t(19) = 2.117, p=0.024], which did not differ [t(26) = 0.506, p=0.309]. To demonstrate spontaneous recovery, a similar analysis was performed on trial data. A comparison of the final three trials of extinction to the three test trials 1 wk later demonstrated a significant effect of trial [F(5, 200) = 6.923, p=0.001], and while there was no main effect of group [F(2,40) = 0.109, p=0.897], there was an interaction between these factors [F(10, 200) = 13.154, p=0.001]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the control group increased responding from the end of extinction to the beginning of the test conducted 1 wk later [t(21) = 3.166, p=0.002], thus demonstrating spontaneous recovery. A similar pattern was observed in the offset group [t(5) = 2.038, p=0.049]. Of note, there was no change in responding across time in the ChR2 group [t(14) = 0.673, p=0.256]. This suggests that LC stimulation can enhance extinction learning, increasing its resilience against spontaneous recovery.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC) enhances long-term expression of extinction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the study design. All groups received identical discriminated operant training where lever-pressing during 20 s presentations of a discriminative stimulus was reinforced with a food pellet. Responding in the absence of the discriminative stimuli was not reinforced. The groups differed in the period of time in which optical manipulation of the LC took place during extinction sessions with the timing of light delivery indicated by the blue bars; for control and ChR2 groups, light was delivered during stimulus presentations (grey bars) when reward was expected based on previous training, but not delivered; the offset group received similar LC stimulation but offset from stimulus presentations (i.e. during the inter-trial intervals [ITI]). The three groups (control, ChR2, and offset groups) showed similar response rates in training (<bold>B</bold>; p&gt;0.05). Responding in all groups extinguished when reward was omitted (p&lt;0.05) and no differences were observed between groups (<bold>C</bold>; p&gt;0.05). When tested the next day for spontaneous recovery, the ChR2 group displayed significantly fewer lever presses than the control or offset groups, suggesting that LC stimulation strengthened extinction learning (<bold>D</bold>, test 1; p&lt;0.05). A similar effect was observed 1 wk later, indicating a persistent effect of LC stimulation on later retention of extinction (<bold>D</bold>, test 2; p&lt;0.05). (<bold>E, F</bold>) To directly test for spontaneous recovery, we compared responding during the last trial of extinction to the first test trial for each group. In test 1, the control group increased responding from the end of extinction to the beginning of the test the following day (<bold>E</bold>, p&lt;0.001), thus demonstrating spontaneous recovery. A similar pattern was observed in the offset group, although this effect was marginal (p=0.055). Of note, there was no change in responding across time in the ChR2 group (p=0.890) and responding remained low in this group, indicating suppressed spontaneous recovery. To test whether this was a lasting effect, we tested the same rats again 1 wk later where we observed a similar effect of group [test 2; <bold>D</bold>; F(2,40) = 3.732, p=0.033], resulting again from reduced responding in the ChR2 group compared to the control [t(35) = 2.663, p=0.006] or offset groups [t(19) = 2.117, p=0.024], which did not differ [t(26) = 0.506, p=0.309]. To demonstrate spontaneous recovery, trial data were again considered. The control group increased responding from the end of extinction to the beginning of the test conducted 1 wk later (<bold>F</bold>; p=0.002), thus demonstrating spontaneous recovery. A similar pattern was observed in the offset group (p=0.049). Of note, there was no change in responding across time in the ChR2 group (p=0.256), suggesting that LC stimulation can enhance extinction learning, increasing its resilience against spontaneous recovery.

It is therefore possible that the reduction in response rates observed in the ChR2 group could be caused by the formation of an aversive association with the discriminative stimuli or some other aspect of the task.

Our findings indicate that increasing activity in the LC can strengthen extinction learning. Specifically, we show that optical stimulation of the LC during extinction training significantly impacts the resilience of extinction, making it resistant to spontaneous recovery, while the inhibition of LC cells with the parameters tested here did not impact the long-term expression of extinction learning.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Noradrenaline influences appetitive extinction</title><p>NA and the LC have been implicated in multiple cognitive processes and types of learning. In fear conditioning paradigms, LC neurons respond to shock and stimuli that predict shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Sara, 2007</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that a weak shock paired with optogenetic stimulation of LC axons in the BLA increased a conditioned fear response, mimicking the effects of a strong shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, chemogenetic activation of LC augments fear conditioning with a weak shock as well as associated increases in BLA firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giustino et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, optogenetic inhibition of BLA projecting LC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>) or pharmacological blockade of BLA Î²-adrenergic receptors disrupts fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giustino et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that LC activity can modify the salience and/or perceived magnitude of stimuli, at least within the aversive domain. When manipulated during extinction rather than fear conditioning, optogenetic inhibition of IFC-projecting LC neurons impaired learning, whereas inhibition of BLA-projecting neurons during extinction enhanced expression of extinction learning 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that LC efferents modulate fear and extinction in a pathway-specific manner.</p><p>In comparison, considerably less is known regarding the role of the LC in appetitive extinction. Appetitive paradigms provide an opportunity to study extinction learning in a situation where basal LC activity is not affected by stress or anxiety. Early studies showed that 6-OHDA lesions of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle left animals resistant to extinction in an appetitive runway task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mason and Iversen, 1975</xref>) and electrophysiological recordings showed that LC activity increased following the omission of an expected appetitive reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sara and Segal, 1991</xref>), suggesting that the LC may be involved in appetitive extinction. In the current study, using an optogenetic approach, we were able to show that LC stimulation during extinction training led to more lasting expression of extinction evidenced by reduced spontaneous recovery 1 and 7 d after extinction learning. These findings suggest that the LC is involved in not just extinction of conditioned fear, but its role extends to appetitive extinction.</p><p>The reduction in spontaneous recovery is consistent with previous pharmacological experiments that found that atomoxetine, an NA reuptake inhibitor, also improved long-term expression of extinction despite having no obvious effect during extinction training itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janak and Corbit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furlong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung and Corbit, 2017</xref>). It is possible that the improved retention of extinction observed here could be the result of increased in arousal or attention elicited by LC stimulation, which might be expected to enhance any type of learning. It may therefore be possible that we did not enhance extinction learning by manipulating the extinction circuit, but instead activated circuitry that strengthens learning in a more general fashion (i.e. increasing attention). While we cannot rule this out entirely, it is important to note that LC stimulation specifically during stimulus presentations was important for enhancing extinction. When LC stimulation was administered for equivalent time periods during the ITI (i.e. the offset group), there was no enhancement of extinction relative to controls, suggesting that the time period in which NA exerts its effect is critical for learning. The enhanced extinction observed only when LC activation coincides with reward omission makes it less likely that the observed effects were due to general increases in attention or arousal as these might have been expected for the offset group as well. Thus, the current study builds on previous findings with the improved temporal specificity of optogenetic manipulation that could not be achieved in previous studies using lesion or pharmacological methods.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LC photoinhibition did not influence retention of extinction learning</title><p>In experiments where LC neurons were inhibited, we observed reduced responding during extinction trials when the LC was inhibited, but this did not translate to group differences in tests of short-term (i.e. the next day) or long-term (i.e. 1 wk later) spontaneous recovery.</p><p>These results may seem at odds with previous studies that have found that administration of propranolol or inhibition of LC projections, impair extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janak and Corbit, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung and Corbit, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that the degree of LC basal or stimulus-evoked activation varied across these studies; for example, the LC response may be stronger in aversive paradigms and thus, the impact of LC inhibition, greater. If LC activity was already relatively low during appetitive extinction, it is possible that inhibition did not produce a big enough change in activity to result in persistent group differences in learning. It is also possible that group differences may have been detected with extinction training of shorter duration as the greatest impact of LC inhibition appeared to be in the first extinction session when response rates were the highest. Despite the lower response rates observed in the eNpHR group, since rats continued to respond and experience reward omission, the extended extinction training (3 d) used here may have been sufficient to allow learning regarding the new extinction contingency in both groups.</p><p>Of note, previous pharmacological studies using appetitive paradigms have found that propranolol impairs extinction when two stimuli are extinguished together, or in compound, but not when a single stimulus is extinguished alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Janak and Corbit, 2011</xref>). The surprising introduction of a stimulus compound generates more responding than presentations of a single stimulus, argued to relate to enhanced prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rescorla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iordanova et al., 2021</xref>), and may better recruit LC activity, which can then be inhibited. Future studies using electrophysiological recording or fibre photometry methods should test whether this is the case.</p><p>The absence of attenuated extinction retention observed in our data could also be a result of insufficient inactivation of LC cells. While our infection rates (55 Â± 8.7%) were comparable to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Quinlan et al., 2018</xref>), remaining activity in the population of uninfected noradrenergic LC cells may have been sufficient to permit extinction to proceed in a manner similar to controls. It is also possible that a more precise approach targeting specific LC efferent pathways (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>) or cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su and Cohen, 2022</xref>) may yield different results. Due to the modular organization of the LC, it is possible that global LC manipulation impacted multiple populations of cells with different forebrain targets and opposing roles with regard to extinction. Effects on competing pathways may have contributed to the lack of effect observed with inhibition and the modest effect seen with stimulation. As noted above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref> found that targeting LC-BLA projections affected fear learning while targeting LC-IFC projections affected extinction. As another example of modular functional organization, there were no improvements to strategy set-shifting following global LC stimulation, but improvements were observed when LC terminals in the medial prefrontal cortex were targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cope et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the proposed modular organization of the LC in terms of efferent projections, a recent electrophysiological recording study has identified two types of noradrenergic neurons within the LC and implicated just one of these (so-called âtype IIâ neurons) in the detection of reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su and Cohen, 2022</xref>). In mice, these neurons have distinct action potential waveforms and anatomical organization, which may allow them to be selectively identified and manipulated. Future experiments targeting specific efferents, such as those to the BLA and IFC, or cell populations, may refine the current results and further delineate the contribution of LC output to appetitive extinction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>LC stimulation did not produce anxiety-like or aversive behaviours</title><p>Most recent studies investigating the contributions of the LC to learning have used fear conditioning paradigms. NA is involved in stress and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bari et al., 2020</xref>) and direct stimulation of the entire LC may have activated circuits involved in anxiety-like or aversive behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCall et al., 2017</xref>) in addition to, or instead of, those involved in extinction. If we inadvertently activated a fear-related circuit via LC photostimulation, this could have interfered with the expression of appetitive learning because we induced a fear state rather than directly influencing appetitive learning. Our failure to find any evidence of conditioned aversion using a conditioned place preference/aversion paradigm makes conditioned aversion an unlikely explanation for our findings, suggesting instead that LC stimulation, at least with the parameters tested here, specifically influenced extinction learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary</title><p>In summary, this series of experiments demonstrates that stimulation of the LC can augment reward-related extinction providing new insights into the neural circuitry that mediates appetitive extinction. Furthermore, our stimulation parameters did not elicit anxiety, indicated by the absence of any aversion in our place preference/aversion test, and our finding that stimulation outside of stimulus presentations had no effect on extinction. We observed no long-lasting changes in the retention of extinction following LC photoinhibition, suggesting that LC activity may not be necessary for extinction learning for nonaversive outcomes. Further investigations are needed to ensure that different results would not be obtained with inhibition of a higher percentage of LC cells during extinction training, conditions that generate more responding like extinction of a stimulus compound, or with selective targeting of specific LC efferent pathways.</p><p>The capacity to modify previous learning is at the heart of flexible decision-making, and deficits in this ability may underlie a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the neural basis of appetitive extinction and in particular the role of the LC and NA may identify new means for enhancing extinction-based therapies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 60 LE rats were included in this study.

Additional meloxicam (2 mg/kg) was administered 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. Rats were given minimum 1 wk for recovery before the commencement of any behavioural training.

LC stimulation was administered as 5 ms pulses at 10 Hz while LC inhibition was achieved through the delivery of a constant light pulse.

To aid acquisition, on the first day the lever only extended during stimulus presentations and retracted when the stimulus ended. On subsequent days, the lever was present throughout the session but only responding during the stimuli was reinforced. All rats were trained on random ratio (RR) schedules that increased across days (3 d of continuous reinforcement, 3 d RR2, 3 d RR4). The rats then proceeded to the extinction sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Extinction and spontaneous recovery</title><p>Each extinction session consisted of eight presentations of one of the auditory stimuli (noise or clicker; counterbalanced) and lever-presses were recorded, but no rewards were delivered. The ITI was the same as in acquisition sessions (variable with a mean of 90 s). For the ChR2 group, during each 20 s stimulus presentation, 5 ms, 465 nm LED light pulses (Doric Lenses) were delivered at 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glennon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Quinlan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>) via a patch cord. The patch cord was attached to the optic implant using ceramic connectors (Doric Lenses). The rats received three extinction sessions over 3 d (once per day), after which the rats were tested without stimulation for spontaneous recovery the next day and 1 wk later. Spontaneous recovery sessions consisted of three trials of the same stimulus extinguished in previous sessions. There was no LED stimulation and no reward was delivered in these tests. Animals in the control group received identical treatment but lacked ChR2 and so light was expected to have no effect. Animals in the offset group (and relevant controls) underwent identical training with the exception that stimulation in extinction sessions occurred in the middle of the variable length ITI (45 s after stimulus termination, on average). Similarly, animals in the inhibition experiment were trained with near-identical parameters, with the exception that a 625 nm wavelength light was administered continuously during CS presentations in all 3 d of extinction. Testing was identical in all groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Conditioned place preference</title><p>Increased tonic LC activity has been reported to produced anxiety-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCall et al., 2017</xref>). For that reason, we tested rats with a conditioned place preference/aversion paradigm to determine whether LC stimulation induced anxiety-like or aversive conditioning that could influence our findings. Ten TH-Cre rats expressing ChR2 were placed in an apparatus with two chambers separated by a sliding door. One chamber, labelled context A, had a green background with blue circles and the second chamber, labelled context B, had a yellow background with vertical strips. All rats were given 3 d to freely explore both chambers for 10 min per day. On the fourth day, the door was closed, and five rats were confined to context A, where they received eight 20 s bouts of LC stimulation at 10 Hz (160 s total stimulation time) within the 10 min session. The remaining five rats were given the identical protocol in context B. On alternate days, rats were confined to the opposite context where they received no stimulation. In total, rats received three exposures to one context with stimulation and three exposures to the other context without stimulation. On test day, the door was opened, and five rats were placed in the context paired with LC stimulation, and five rats placed in the context without LC stimulation. Each rat was given 10 min to freely explore both contexts, and total time spent in each context was recorded. A rat was considered to be in one chamber when both hindfeet were inside the chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Histology</title><p>At the end of each experiment, rats were killed with an overdose of isoflurane followed by transcardial perfusion. The rats were perfused with ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were then extracted and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde in PB overnight and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution in 0.1 M PB for cryoprotection. Once the brains were saturated and sunk in the sucrose solution, they were frozen and sectioned with a cryostat (CM1860; Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) at 40 Î¼m for further analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to verify (1) the expression of ChR2-mCherry in TH-positive LC neurons and (2) the location of the optic implant tip within the LC. Sections were stained for TH (mouse anti-TH, 1:1000 dilution, Cat# 77-700-100, lot# 472-3JU-19, Antibodies Inc), and mCherry (rabbit anti-mCherry, 1:1000 dilution, Cat# NBP2-251-57, Novus Biologicals). Signals were enhanced with goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500 dilution, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2534069">AB_2534069</ext-link>), goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 (1:500 dilution, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_143157">AB_143157</ext-link>). Tissue was also counterstained with DAPI in order to visualize all neurons. Sections were imaged with a confocal microscope (AxioObserver Z1; Zeiss) or under bright field (Olympus CX43). The locations of optic implant tip were plotted on plates from a rat brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell quantification</title><p>Cells that were TH and/or mCherry positive were counted with a semi-automated program using Zen Blue (Zeiss). The accuracy of the automatic counts was verified by comparing to manual counts and the two methods found to largely overlap (90% concordance). Three representative slices were taken across the rostral/caudal axis of the LC for each animal, and this sampling strategy is based on a recent study that showed that the distribution of LC projections had no specific organization across anterior/posterior or medial/lateral axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). Each image was 0.5 Ã 0.5 mm and encompassed the entire structure of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analysed with mixed-model ANOVA.

They report that optogenetic activation of global LC-NA neurons during the conditioned stimulus (CS) period of extinction enhances long-term extinction memory without affecting within-session extinction. In contrast, LC-NA activation during the intertrial interval doesn't affect extinction and long-term memory. They then show that optogenetic activation of LC-NA neurons doesn't induce conditioned place preference/avoidance. Finally, they assess the necessity of LC-NA neurons in appetitive extinction and find that optogenetic inactivation of LC-NA neurons during CS period results in enhancement of within-session extinction. The experiments are well-designed, including offset control in the optogenetic activation study. I think this study adds new insight into the LC-NA system in the context of appetitive extinction.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>ã»These studies identify the artificial activation of LC-NA neurons enhances long-term memory of appetitive extinction while this activation can't induce long-term conditioned place aversion. Thus, optogenetic activation of LC-NA neurons can inhibit spontaneous recovery of appetitive extinction without causing long-term aversive memory.</p><p>ã»Optoinhibition study demonstrates the reduction of conditioned response of within-session extinction. Therefore, LC-NA neuronal activity at the CS period of extinction could act as anti-extinction or be important for the expression of conditioned response.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>ã»It is unclear how LC-NA neurons behave during the CS period of appetitive extinction from this study. This weakens the importance of the optogenetic inactivation result.</p><p>ã»While authors manipulate global LC-NA neurons, many people find functionally heterogeneous populations in the LC.

Overall, the study is well designed, nicely conducted and the results advance our understanding of the role of the LC in extinction of conditioned behaviour.

Reviewers 2 and 3 indicated that their previous comments had been satisfactorily addressed by our revisions. Reviewer 1 raised several points and our point by point responses can be found below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Please clarify the terminology of spontaneous recovery in your study.</p><p>According to Rescorla RA 2004 ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.learnmem.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/lm.77504">http://www.learnmem.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/lm.77504</ext-link>), he defines spontaneous recovery as &quot;with the passage of time following nonreinforcement, there is some &quot;spontaneous recovery&quot; of the initially learned behavior. &quot;. So in this study, I thought Test2 is spontaneous recovery while the Test1 is extinction test as most studies do. But authors seem to define spontaneous recovery from the last trial of Extinction3 to the first trial of Test1, which is confusing to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer (and Rescorla, 2004) that spontaneous recovery is defined as the return of the initially learned behaviour after the passage of time. In our study, Test 1 is conducted 24-hours after the final extinction session (Extinction 3) and in our view, the return of responding following that 24-hour delay can be considered spontaneous recovery. Rescorla (2004 and elsewhere) also points out that the magnitude of spontaneous recovery may be greater with larger delays between extinction and testing. This in part motivated our second test 7 days following the last extinction session with optogenetic manipulation. We did not find evidence of greater spontaneous recovery in the test 7 days later, however, the additional extinction trials in Test 1 may have reduced the opportunity to detect such an effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Why are E6-8 plots of Offset group in Figure 3E and F different?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this error and have corrected it. This was an artifact of an older version of the figure before final exclusions. The E6-8 data is now the same for panels 2E and 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to 2, Please clarify what type of data they are in Figure3E,F Figure5H, and I . If it's average, please add error bars. Also, it's hard to see the statistical significance at the current figure style.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in these panels are the mean lever presses per trial as labeled on the y-axis of the figures.

We believe the reviewer is suggesting briefer manipulation only at the precise time the pellet would have been expected but omitted. If so, the implementation of that is complex because animals were trained on random ratio schedules and so when exactly the pellet(s) was earned was variable and so when precisely the animal experiences âomissionâ is difficult to know with better temporal specificity than used in the current experiments. But we agree with the reviewer that now we see that there is an effect of LC manipulation, in future studies we could alter the behavioral task so that the timing of reward is consistent (e.g., train the animals with fixed ratio schedules or continuous reinforcement, or use a Pavlovian paradigm) where a reasonable assertion about when the outcome should occur, and thus when its absence would be detected, can be made and then manipulation given at that time to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Does LC-NA optoinhibition affect the expression of the conditioned response (the lever presses at early trials of Extinction 1)?

After a successful lever-press the rat must enter the magazine to collect the food, but food is only delivered contingency upon lever-pressing and so magazine entries here are not a clear indicator of Pavlovian learning as they may be in other paradigms.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have compiled magazine entry data which although not fully independent of the lever-press response in this paradigm, still tells us something about the animalsâ expectation regarding reward delivery.</p><p>For the ChR2 experiment, largely paralleling the results seen in the lever-press data, there were no group differences in magazine responses at the end of training [F(2,40) = 2.442, p=0.100].</p><p>Responding decreased across days of extinction (when optogenetic stimulation was given) [F(2, 80) = 38.070, p&lt;0.001], but there was no effect of group [F(2,40) = 0.801, p=0.456] and no interaction between day and group [F(4,40) = 1.461, p=0.222].

It is worth noting that responding in Group ChR2 decreased from Extinction 3 to Test 1, while responding in the other two groups appears to have remained the same. This suggests that there was no spontaneous recovery of responding in the controls; and, as such, something more must be said about the basis of the between-group differences in responding at test. This is particularly important as each extinction session involved eight presentations of the to-betested stimulus, whereas the test itself consisted of just three stimulus presentations. Hence, comparing the mean levels of performance to the stimulus across its extinction and testing overestimates the true magnitude of spontaneous recovery, which is simply not clear in the results of this study. That is, it is not clear that there is any spontaneous recovery at all and, therefore, that the basis of the difference between Group ChR2 and controls at test is in terms of spontaneous recovery.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that there were a different number of trials in extinction vs. test sessions making direct comparison difficult and displaying the data as averages of the test session does not demonstrate spontaneous recovery per se.

Did the manipulations affect the coupling of lever-press and magazine entry responses? I imagine that, after training, the lever-press and magazine entry responses are coupled: rats only visit the magazine after having made a lever-press response (or some number of leverpress responses). Stimulating the LC clearly had no acute effect on the performance of the lever-press response. If it also had no effect on the total number of magazine entries performed during the stimulus, it would be interesting to know whether the coupling of lever-presses and magazine entries had been disturbed in any way. One could assess this by looking at the jointdistribution of lever-presses (or runs of lever-presses) and magazine visits in each extinction session, or across the three sessions of extinction. As a proxy for this, one could look at the average latency to enter the magazine following a lever-press response (or run of leverpresses). Any differences here between the Controls and Group ChR2 would be informative with respect to the effects of the LC manipulations: that is, the results shown in Figure indicate that stimulating the LC has no acute effects on lever-pressing but protects against something like spontaneous recovery; whereas the results shown in Figure 4 indicate that inhibiting the LC facilitates the loss of responding across extinction without protecting against spontaneous recovery. The additional data/analyses suggested here would indicate whether LC stimulation had any acute effects on responding that might explain the protection from spontaneous recovery; and whether LC inhibition specifically reduced lever-pressing across extinction or whether it had equivalent effects on rates of magazine entry.</p></disp-quote><p>Lever-press and magazine response data were collected trial by trial but not with the temporal resolution required for the analyses suggested by the reviewer. We do not have timestamps for magazine entries nor latency data. We can collect this type of data in future studies. At the session or trial level, magazine entries generally correspond to lever-pressing; being trained on ratio schedules, and from informal observation, rats will do several lever-presses and then check the magazine. Rates of each decrease across extinction (magazine data included in response to comment 2b. above).
