hippocampal long-term memory, which is thought to involve protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the direct effects of dopamine on protein synthesis, and the functional implications of newly synthesised proteins for synaptic plasticity, have not yet been investigated. We have previously reported that timing-dependent synaptic depression (t-LTD) can be converted into potentiation by dopamine application during synaptic stimulation (Brzosko et al., 2015) or postsynaptic burst activation (Fuchsberger et al., 2022). Here, we show that dopamine increases protein synthesis in mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons, enabling dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (DA-LTP), which is mediated via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) subtypes 1/8, cAMP, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We found that neuronal activity is required for the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis. Furthermore, dopamine induced a protein-synthesis-dependent increase in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1, but not GluA2. We found that DA-LTP is absent in GluA1 knock-out mice and that it requires calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that dopamine together with neuronal activity controls synthesis of plasticity-related proteins, including GluA1, which enable DA-LTP via a signalling pathway distinct from that of conventional LTP.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>CP-AMPAR</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V014641/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuchsberger</surname><given-names>Tanja</given-names></name><name><surname>Paulsen</surname><given-names>Ole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105174197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stockwell</surname><given-names>Imogen</given-names></name><name><surname>Greger</surname><given-names>Ingo H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N002113/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stockwell</surname><given-names>Imogen</given-names></name><name><surname>Greger</surname><given-names>Ingo H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/223194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stockwell</surname><given-names>Imogen</given-names></name><name><surname>Greger</surname><given-names>Ingo H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Long-term memory is thought to be encoded by synaptic plasticity, in particular long-term potentiation (LTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>) which, based on its duration, has been divided into an early phase and a protein-synthesis-dependent late phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 1988</xref>). Dopaminergic signalling has been implicated specifically in âlate-phaseâ LTP (L-LTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Kandel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthies et al., 1997</xref>). Dopamine acts on G-protein-coupled receptors which activate adenylate cyclases (AC) to generate cAMP, which in turn activates several effectors, including the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA has several downstream targets which ultimately regulate transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sassone-Corsi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kebabian and Calne, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Although the requirement of dopamine for protein-synthesis-dependent LTP has been well established, the underlying cellular mechanisms of how dopamine modulates activated synapses via protein-synthesis-dependent mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p><p>In order to selectively label newly synthesised proteins, we used a puromycin-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>), adapted for use in acute mouse hippocampal slices. We found that dopamine increases protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons. We then investigated whether protein synthesis is required for a recently described dopamine-dependent form of plasticity (dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation [DA-LTP]) which, although being rapid in onset, otherwise shares properties with L-LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brzosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchsberger et al., 2022</xref>). Whilst conventional âearlyâ LTP induced by a spike-timing-dependent plasticity protocol (t-LTP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>) was unaffected, DA-LTP was completely abolished by either of two different protein synthesis inhibitors.</p><p>A previous study in primary cultured hippocampal neurons reported that dopaminergic signalling increases the surface expression of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2005</xref>), which has been widely studied in the context of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>). Although most hippocampal AMPA receptors are heteromeric, incorporating the edited form of the GluA2 subunit, rendering the receptor calcium-impermeable, GluA1 may form homomeric calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnashev et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wenthold et al., 1996</xref>). As well as enabling calcium-permeability of the AMPAR, by lacking GluA2, the extracellular N-terminal domain of GluA1 in GluA1 homomers is highly flexible, which alters the gating of the receptor and hinders its synaptic anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stockwell et al., 2024</xref>). CP-AMPARs have been implicated in some forms of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Purkey and DellâAcqua, 2020</xref>), including a PKA-dependent form of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We found that levels of the GluA1 receptor subunit, but not GluA2, were upregulated in response to dopamine in a protein-synthesis-dependent manner. Moreover, DA-LTP was absent in a GluA1 genetic knock-out (KO) mouse model, while conventional t-LTP remained intact. These findings suggest that newly synthesised GluA1 receptor subunits mediate the expression of DA-LTP, possibly by forming GluA1 homomeric CP-AMPARs. Indeed, while blocking CP-AMPARs did not interfere with conventional t-LTP, they were required for DA-LTP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dopamine increases protein synthesis in CA1, which is required for DA-LTP</title><p>We hypothesised that the application of dopamine induces synthesis of proteins that are required for the expression of DA-LTP. To address this, we first investigated whether dopamine directly affects protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons. In order to exclusively visualise newly synthesised proteins in hippocampal slices, we used a puromycin (PMY)-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). Labelling was achieved by incubating acute hippocampal slices in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing 3 ÂµM PMY for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, slices incubated with PMY showed a significantly higher PMY intensity than those without (control, 0.39Â±0.02 a.u., n=9, vs +PMY, 0.54Â±0.03, t(16) = 4.0, p=0.001, n=9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), confirming specificity of the antibody labelling approach. Furthermore, we tested whether PMY incorporation and labelling are specific to protein synthesis by adding the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) or anisomycin (AM) to the slices. We found that 30 min preincubation with 10 ÂµM CHX significantly reduced the PMY signal, confirming the specificity of the labelling approach (PMY, 1.8Â±0.45, n=7 vs PMY + CHX, 0.4Â±0.05, n=8, t(6) = 3.1, p=0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>), as did 2 hr preincubation with 0.5 mM AM (PMY, 0.6Â±0.14, n=4 vs PMY + AM, 0.16Â±0.03, n=5, t(3.2)=3.1, p=0.048; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>).

When applied immediately after the pairing protocol, IEM1460 still prevented DA-LTP and left a synaptic depression instead (DA-LTP +IEM after, 68% Â± 12% vs 100%, t(8) = 2.68, p=0.028, n=9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that DA-LTP, but not conventional t-LTP, requires CP-AMPARs for the expression of synaptic potentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In summary, we investigated the effect of dopamine on protein synthesis in hippocampal neurons and how protein synthesis enables DA-LTP. We report four main findings: (1) Dopamine increases protein synthesis in an activity-dependent manner through the activation of PKA. (2) Dopamine enables a rapid onset protein-synthesis-dependent form of synaptic potentiation (DA-LTP). (3) Dopamine increases the level of GluA1 but not GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors. (4) The expression of DA-LTP requires GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable (CP)-AMPARs, whereas t-LTP does not, suggesting the existence of two distinct forms of LTP.</p><p>Recent developments of protein synthesis labelling techniques enabled us to directly monitor protein synthesis in neurons in response to dopamine. We validated our PMY-based approach for labelling protein synthesis using protein synthesis inhibitors AM and CHX in acute hippocampal slices. We report that dopamine increases protein synthesis in pyramidal neurons in CA1 of acute hippocampal slices within minutes. This is consistent with previous reports from hippocampal and cortical neuronal cell culture systems, which showed that dopamine receptor agonist SKF-38393 enhances protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the dopamine-induced increase in protein synthesis is mediated by dopamine receptors via the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mayr and Montminy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sassone-Corsi, 1995</xref>), which is also consistent with previously reported hippocampal cell culture results which showed that the application of Sp-cAMPS, an activator of PKA, was sufficient to induce an increase in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway induced by dopamine may affect several downstream targets and interact with other signalling pathways that could enhance protein synthesis. It has been reported in cortical primary neuronal cultures that D1 receptors, but not D2 receptors, increase protein synthesis via the mTOR-ERK pathway, resulting in dephosphorylation of eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">David et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our previous results that burst-induced potentiation in the presence of dopamine requires postsynaptic PKA and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchsberger et al., 2022</xref>), we found here that synaptic potentiation induced by low frequency synaptic stimulation in the presence of dopamine following a priming protocol, which would otherwise induce synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brzosko et al., 2015</xref>), also requires postsynaptic PKA and new protein synthesis. While conventional t-LTP remained intact, blocking protein synthesis in the postsynaptic neurons completely prevented DA-LTP, suggesting that dopamine induces the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins required for converting synaptic depression into potentiation.</p><p>DA-LTP shares properties with L-LTP, which also requires dopamine signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frey et al., 1990</xref>), PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frey et al., 1993</xref>), and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 1988</xref>), and it was reported that protein synthesis was required hours after LTP induction for the maintenance of synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frey et al., 1988</xref>). In contrast, for the form of dopamine-dependent LTP studied here, protein synthesis was required ahead of or within the first few minutes of the induction protocol. Moreover, while previous studies have used extracellular application of protein synthesis inhibitors, here we loaded the protein synthesis inhibitors into the postsynaptic neuron via the patch pipette, suggesting that it is specifically postsynaptic protein synthesis that is required for DA-LTP.</p><p>We found that neuronal activity was also required for dopamine to increase protein synthesis. Moreover, we identified the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent AC subtypes AC1/AC8 to be involved in the induction of DA-LTP. This coincidence detector is stimulated by Gs-coupled dopamine D1/D5 receptor activation together with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wayman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson and Storm, 2004</xref>). Our results show that the AC1/AC8 subtypes and PKA are required for DA-LTP. These results suggest that dopamine application during neuronal activity induces the synthesis of plasticity-related proteins that enable synaptic potentiation.</p><p>Western blots showed that dopamine increased the levels of the GluA1 AMPA receptor subunit in a protein-synthesis-dependent manner, but that the GluA2 subunit remained unchanged. This is consistent with a previous study in hippocampal primary cultured neurons which reported that dopaminergic signalling increases the surface expression of AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2005</xref>). The selective increase in the GluA1 over GluA2 subunit is interesting because of the important role ascribed to the GluA1 subunit in LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Diering and Huganir, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We report here that although conventional t-LTP could still be induced in a GluA1 KO mouse model, GluA1 was required for DA-LTP. These observations revealed a possible mechanism through which dopamine can modulate synaptic strength. Furthermore, the findings indicated another intriguing possibility, namely that GluA1 homomeric AMPA receptors, which are calcium-permeable, mediate the expression of DA-LTP. CP-AMPA receptors appear to play a role in some forms of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wakazono et al., 2024</xref>), while other studies found no involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik and Nicoll, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gray et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The role of CP-AMPARs in synaptic plasticity remains controversial. We report here that they are required for DA-LTP, but not for conventional t-LTP. Importantly, even blocking CP-AMPARs after the pairing paradigm reversed DA-LTP, which supports the possibility that they are required for expression of DA-LTP. Whether they also contribute to the induction of the dopamine-dependent potentiation induced by low-frequency afferent stimulation following a t-LTD priming protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brzosko et al., 2015</xref>) remains unresolved. Furthermore, it should be noted that using western blotting, we observed an increase in total GluA1 levels, but we cannot conclude whether DA increases surface GluA1 or CP-AMPA receptors from our experiments. While we show a requirement for CP-AMPA receptors for DA-LTP, it remains to be confirmed whether the pairing protocol together with dopamine indeed induces an increase in CP-AMPA receptors at the synapse. There are currently no suitable imaging techniques available to unambiguously quantify specific AMPA receptor subunit compositions at the synapse in acute slices.</p><p>Interestingly, previous studies have reported two forms of NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP, induced by spaced and compressed theta burst stimuli (TBS), that can be distinguished at hippocampal CA1 synapses based on their dependence on PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, it was shown that the PKA-dependent form of LTP triggered by spaced stimulation leads to a transient increase in single-channel conductance, probably mediated by the insertion of calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2021</xref>). The signalling pathway identified in our study overlaps with this pathway and, together, these findings suggest that two mechanistically distinct forms of LTP coexist at these synapses. It is possible that plasticity protocols that use extracellular electrodes also trigger the release of dopamine, and it would be of interest to investigate whether LTP induced by spaced TBS requires dopamine receptor activation and protein synthesis. In summary, our findings suggest a possible mechanism for how the reward-related neuromodulator dopamine may contribute to protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity facilitating hippocampal long-term memory. Signalling mechanisms underlying dopaminergic control of protein synthesis and synaptic weights may also be important for pathophysiological processes. Dysregulation in dopamine systems has long been implicated in drug addiction (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dalley and Everitt, 2009</xref>), schizophrenia (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahn et al., 2015</xref>), and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsonâs disease (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poewe et al., 2017</xref>), and, more recently, also Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nobili et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding signalling pathways underlying dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity may help guide future research into additional treatment options.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice used for this study were housed at the Combined Animal Facility, Cambridge University.

Neurons were visualised with an infrared differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope using a Ã40 water-immersion objective. Hippocampal subfields were identified and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on CA1 pyramidal neurons. Monopolar stimulation electrodes were placed in stratum radiatum for stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Electrodes for test and control pathways were placed at the same distance (&gt;100 Âµm) from either side of the recorded neuron. Patch pipettes (pipette resistance 4â7 MÎ©) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries (0.68 mm inner diameter, 1.2 mm outer diameter) using a P-97 Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, California, USA).

Briefly, EPSPs were evoked alternately in two input pathways (test and control) by direct current pulses at 0.2 Hz (stimulus duration 50 Î¼s) through metal stimulation electrodes. The stimulation intensity was adjusted (100 Î¼A â 500 ÂµA) to evoke an EPSP with peak amplitude between 3 and 8 mV. After a stable EPSP baseline period of at least 10 min, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) was induced in the test pathway by repeated pairings (100 times at 0.2 Hz) of single evoked EPSPs and single postsynaptic action potentials elicited with the minimum somatic current pulse (1â1.8 nA, 3ms) via the recording electrode. Spike-timing intervals (Ît in ms) were measured between the onset of the EPSP and the onset of the action potential. Alternate stimulation of test and control EPSPs was resumed immediately after the pairing protocol and monitored for at least 40 min, except when the burst stimulation protocol was used for plasticity induction. In that case, stimulation of EPSPs was not resumed for an additional 10 min in the test pathway, and at the end of that period, five bursts, each of five action potentials at 50 Hz, were elicited with an inter-burst interval of 0.1 Hz by somatic current pulses (1.8 nA, 10ms) via the recording electrode. Immediately after the bursts, stimulation of EPSPs was resumed and monitored for at least 30 min. Presynaptic stimulation frequency to evoke EPSPs remained constant throughout the experiment.

The authors conducted a series of experiments to measure the effect of dopamine on the protein synthesis rate in hippocampal neurons and its role in enabling DA-LTP.

The authors further identify adenylate cyclase 1/8, cAMP, and PKA as the crucial mitigators of these actions. While some comments have been identified below, the experiments presented are thorough and address the aims of the manuscript, figures are presented clearly (with minor comments), and experimental sample sizes and statistical analyses are suitable. Suitable controls have been utilized to confirm the role of Ca2+ permeable AMPAR. This work provides a valuable step forward built on convincing data toward understanding the underlying mechanisms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity and dopamine.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Appropriate controls were used.</p><p>The flow of data presented is logical and easy to follow.</p><p>The quality of the data, except for a few minor issues, is solid.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The drug treatment duration of anisomycin is longer than the standard 30-45 minute duration (as is the 500uM vs 40uM concentration) typically used in the field. Given the toxicity of these kinds of drugs long term it's unclear why the authors used such a long and intense drug treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>In an initial set of control experiments (Figure S 1C-D) we wanted to ensure that protein synthesis was definitely blocked and therefore used a relatively high concentration of anisomycin and a relatively long pre-incubation period. We agree with the Reviewer that we cannot exclude the possibility that this treatment could compromise cell health in addition to the protein synthesis block. Therefore, we carried out an additional experiment with an alternative protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at a lower standard concentration (10 ÂµM) which confirmed a significant reduction in the puromycin signal (Figure S 1A-B). Together these results support the conclusion that puromycin signal is specific to protein synthesis in our labelling assay.</p><p>Furthermore, in the electrophysiology experiments, we used 500 Î¼M anisomycin in the patch pipette solution. Under these conditions, we recorded a stable EPSP baseline for 60 minutes, indicating that the treatment did not cause toxic effects to the cell (Figure S1F). This high concentration would ensure an effective block of local translation at dendritic sites. Nevertheless, we also carried out this experiment with cycloheximide at a lower standard concentration (10 ÂµM) and observed a similar result with both protein synthesis inhibitors (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With some of the normalizations (such as those in S1) there are dramatic differences in the baseline &quot;untreated&quot; puromycin intensities - raising some questions about the overall health of slices used in the experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that there is a large variability in the normalised puromycin signal which might be due to variability in the health of slices.

The authors conducted a series of experiments to measure the effect of dopamine on the protein synthesis rate in hippocampal neurons and its role in enabling DA-LTP. The key results indicate that protein synthesis is increased in response to dopamine and neuronal activity in the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 hippocampal area, mediated via the activation of adenylate cyclases subtypes 1 and 8 (AC1/8) and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway. Additionally, the authors show that postsynaptic DA-induced increases in protein synthesis are required to express DA-LTP, while not required for conventional t-LTP.</p><p>The increased expression of the newly synthesized GluA1 receptor subunit in response to DA supports the formation of homomeric calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). This evidence aligns well with data showing that DA-LTP expression requires the GluA1 AMPA subunit and CP-AMPARs, as DA-LTP is absent in the hippocampus of a GluA1 genetic knock-out mouse model. Overall, the study is solid, and the evidence provided is compelling. The authors clearly and concisely explain the research objectives, methodologies, and findings. The study is scientifically robust, and the writing is engaging. The authors' conclusions and interpretation of the results are insightful and align well with the literature. The discussion effectively places the findings in a meaningful context, highlighting a possible mechanism for dopamine's role in the modulation of protein-synthesis-dependent hippocampal synaptic plasticity and its implications for the field. Although the study expands on previous works from the same laboratory, the findings are novel and provide valuable insights into the dynamics governing hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</p><p>The claim that GluA1 homomeric CP-AMPA receptors mediate the expression of DA-LTP is fascinating, and although the electrophysiology data on GluA1 knock-out mice are convincing, more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis. Western blotting provides useful information on the expression level of GluA1, which is not necessarily associated with cell surface expression of GluA1 and therefore CP-AMPARs. Validating this hypothesis by localizing the protein using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy detection could strengthen the claim. The authors should briefly discuss the limitations of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Although it would be possible to quantify the surface expression of GluA1 using immunofluorescence, it would not be possible to distinguish between GluA1 homomers and GluA1-containing heteromers. It would therefore not be informative as to whether these are indeed CP-AMPARs. This is an interesting problem, which we have briefly discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments to address:</p><p>(1) In Figure 2A, the representative image with PMY alone shows a very weak PMY signal. Consequently, the image with TTX alone seems to potentiate the PMY signal, suggesting a counterintuitive increase in protein synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the original image was not representative and have replaced it with a more representative image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figures 3A-B, the Western blotting representative images have poor quality, especially regarding GluA1 and Î±-actin in Figure 3A. The quantification graph (Figure 3B) raises some concerns about a potential outlier in both the DA alone and DA+CHX groups. The authors should consider running a statistical test to detect outlier data. Full blot images, including ladder lines, should be added to the supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the western blot image in Figure 3A and have also presented full blot images including ladder lines in supplementary Figure S3.</p><p>Using the ROUT method (Q=1%) we identified one outlier in the DA+CHX group of the western blot quantification. The quantification for this blot was then removed from the dataset and the experiment was repeated to ensure a sufficient number of repeats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) How the authors perform these experiments with puromycin, these are puromycilation experiments - not SuNSET. The SuNSET protocol (surface sensing of translation) specifically refers to the detection of newly synthesized proteins externally at the plasma membrane. I'd advise to update the terminology used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. We have updated this to âpuromycin-based labelling assayâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The legend presented in Figure 2F suggests WT is green and ACKO is orange, however, in Figure 2G the WT LTP trace is orange, consider changing this to green for consistency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and agree that a matching colour scheme makes the Figure clearer. This has been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the results section, it is recommended to include units for the values presented at the first instance and only again when the units change thereafter.</p></disp-quote><p>The units of the electrophysiology data were [%], this is included in the Results section. Results of western blots and IHC images were presented as [a.u.]. While we included this in the Figures, we have not specifically added this to the text of individual results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Two hours pre-treatment with anisomycin vs 30 minutes pretreatment with cycloheximide seems hard to directly compare - as the pharmokinetics of translational inhibition should be similar for both drugs. What was the rationale for the extremely long anisomycin pretreatment? What controls were taken to assess slice health either prior to or following fixation? This is relevant to the below point (5).</p></disp-quote><p>In an initial set of control experiments (Figure S 1C-D) we wanted to ensure that protein synthesis was definitely blocked and therefore used a relatively high concentration of anisomycin and a relatively long pre-incubation period. We agree with the Reviewer that we cannot exclude the possibility that this treatment could compromise cell health in addition to the protein synthesis block.

The large set of electrophysiology experiments carried out in our study (all recorded cells were evaluated for healthy resting membrane potential, action potential firing, and synaptic responses) also confirmed that, generally, the vast majority of our slices were indeed healthy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Supplementary Figure 1, there is a dramatic difference in the a.u. intensities across CHX (B) and AM (D), please explain the reason for this. It is understood these are normalised values to nuclear staining, please clarify if this is a nuclear area.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that there is a large variability in normalised puromycin signal which may be due to variability in the health of the slices. However, we assume that the same variability would be present in the treated slices, which showed, despite the variability, a significant effect of protein synthesis inhibition. To prevent introducing bias by excluding slices with low puromycin signal in the control condition, we present the full dataset.</p><p>The CA1 region of the hippocampus contains of a dense layer of neuronal somata (pyramidal cell layer). We normalized against the nuclear area as it provides a reliable estimate of the number of neurons present in the image. This approach minimizes bias by accounting for variation in the number of neurons within the visual field, ensuring consistency and accuracy in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Please clarify the decision to average both the last 5 minutes of baseline recordings and the last 5 minutes of the recording for the normalisation of EPSP slopes.</p></disp-quote><p>The baseline usually stabilises after a few minutes of recording, thus the last 5 minutes were used for baseline measurement, which are the most relevant datapoints to compare synaptic weight change to. After induction of STDP, potentiation or depression of synaptic weights develops gradually. Based on previous results, evaluating the EPSP slopes at 30-40 minutes after the induction protocol gives a reliable estimate of the amount of plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The concentration of anisomycin used (0.5 mM) is very high.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, in an initial set of control experiments (Figure S 1C-D) we wanted to ensure that protein synthesis was definitely blocked and therefore used a relatively high concentration of anisomycin and a relatively long pre-incubation period. We agree with the Reviewer that this is higher than the standard concentration used for this drug and we cannot exclude the possibility that this treatment could compromise cell health in addition to the protein synthesis block. Therefore, we carried out an additional experiment with an alternative protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at a lower standard concentration (10 ÂµM) which confirmed a significant reduction in the puromycin signal (Figure S1A-B). Together these results support the conclusion that puromycin signal is specific to protein synthesis in our labelling assay.</p><p>Furthermore, in the electrophysiology experiments, we also used 500 ÂµM anisomycin in the patch pipette solution. Under these conditions, we recorded a stable EPSP baseline for 60 minutes, indicating that the treatment did not cause toxic effects to the cell (Figure S1F). This high concentration would ensure an effective block of local translation at dendritic sites. Nevertheless, we also carried out this experiment with cycloheximide at a lower standard concentration (10 ÂµM) and observed a similar result with both protein synthesis inhibitors (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude that the effect of DA is mediated via D1/5 receptors, which based on previous work seems likely. But they cannot conclude this from their current study which used a combination of a D1/D5 and a D2 antagonist.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. We agree and have updated this in the Discussion section to âdopamine receptorsâ, without specifying subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no mention that I can see that the KO experiments were conducted in a blinded manner (which I believe should be standard practice). Did they verify the KOs using Westerns?</p></disp-quote><p>Only a subset of the experiments was conducted in a blinded manner. However, the results were collected by two independent experimenters, who both observed significant effects in KO mice compared to WTs (TF and ZB).</p><p>We received the DKO mice from a former collaborator, who verified expression levels of the KO mice (Wang et al., 2003). We verified DKO upon arrival in our facility using genotyping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding but it appears to me that in Figure 1F there is LTP prior to the addition of DA. (The first point after pairing is already elevated). I think the control of pairing without DA should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. Based on previous results (Brzosko et al., 2015) we would expect potentiation to develop over time once DA is added after pairing, however, it indeed appears in the Figure here as if there was an immediate increase in synaptic weights after pairing. It should be noted, however, that when comparing the first 5 minutes after pairing to the baseline, this increase was not significant (t(9)=1.810, p = 0.1037). Nevertheless, we rechecked our data and noticed that this initial potentiation was biased by one cell with an increasing baseline, which had both the test and control pathway strongly elevated. We had mistakenly included this cell in the dataset, despite the unstable conditions (as stated in the Methods section, the unpaired control pathway served as a stability control). We apologise for the error and this has now been corrected (Figure 1F). In addition, we present the control pathway in Figure S1G and I.</p><p>We have also now included the control for post-before-pre pairing (Ît = -20 ms) without dopamine in a supplemental figure (Figure S1E and F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Westerns (Figure 3A) are fairly messy. Also, it is better to quantify with total protein. Surface biotinylation of GluA1 and GluA2 would be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out more repeats of Western blots and have exchanged blots in Figure 3A.</p><p>We observed that DA increases protein synthesis, we therefore cannot exclude the possibility that application of DA could also affect total protein levels. Thus quantifying with total protein may not be the best choice here. Quantification with actin is standard practice.</p><p>While we agree with the Reviewer that surface biotinylation of GluA1 and GluA2 could in principle be more informative, we do not think it would work well in our experimental setup using acute slice preparation, as it strictly requires intact cells. Slicing generates damaged cells, which would take up the surface biotin reagents. This would cause unspecific biotinylation of the damaged cells, leading to a strong background signal in the assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4 panels D and E the baselines are increasing substantially prior to induction. I appreciate that long stable baselines with timing-dependent plasticity may not be possible but it's hard to conclude what happened tens of minutes later when the baseline only appears stable for a minute or two. Panels A and B show that relatively stable baselines are achievable.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the baselines are increasing, however, when looking at the baseline for 5 minutes prior to induction (5 last datapoints of the baseline), which is what we used for quantification, the baselines appeared stable. Unfortunately, longer baselines are not suitable for timing-dependent plasticity. In addition, all experiments were carried out with a control pathway which showed stable conditions throughout the recording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the discussion could be better integrated with the current literature. Their experiments are in line with a substantial body of literature that has identified two forms of LTP, based on these signalling cascades, using more conventional induction patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this suggestion and have added more discussion of the two forms of LTP in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to include the drug concentrations when first described in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Drug concentration have now been included in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is now more common to include absolute t values (not just &lt;0.05 etc).</p></disp-quote><p>While we indicate significance in Figures using asterisks when p values are below the indicated significance levels, we report absolute values of p and t values in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly full blots should be added to an appendix / made available.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included full blot images in Supplementary Figure S3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A 30% tolerance for series resistance seems generous to me. (10-20% would be more typical).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their suggestion, and will keep this in mind for future studies. However, the error introduced by the higher tolerance level is likely to be small and would not influence any of the qualitative conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>Whereas series resistance is of course extremely important in voltage-clamp experiments, changes in series resistance would be less of a concern in current-clamp recordings of synaptic events. We use the amplifier as a voltage follower, and there are two problems with changes in the electrode, or access, resistance. First, there is the voltage drop across the electrode resistance. Clearly this error is zero if no current is injected and is also negligible for the currents we use in our experiments to maintain the membrane voltage at -70 mV. For example, the voltage drop would be 0.2 mV for 20 pA current through a typical 10 MOhm electrode resistance, and a change in resistance of 30% would give less than 0.1 mV voltage change even if the resistance were not compensated. The second problem is distortion of the EPSP shape due to the low-pass filtering properties of the electrode set up by the pipette capacitance and series resistance (RC). This can be a significant problem for fast events, such as action potentials, but less of a problem for the relatively slow EPSPs recorded in pyramidal cells. Nevertheless, we take on board the advice provided by the Reviewer and will use the conventional tolerance of 20% in future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In the references, the entry for Burnashev N et al. has a different font size.
