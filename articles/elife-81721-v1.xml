brain. We established simultaneous dual color two-photon microscopy to visualize the trafficking of Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in thalamocortical axons imaged in mouse cortex in vivo. This revealed that LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged organelles move significantly faster than NPY-tagged organelles in both anterograde and retrograde direction. NPY traveled more selectively in anterograde direction than LAMP1 and RAB7. By using a synapse marker and a calcium sensor, we further investigated the transport dynamics of NPY-tagged organelles. We found that these organelles slow down and pause at synapses. In contrast to previous in vitro studies, a significant increase of transport speed was observed after spontaneous activity and elevated calcium levels in vivo as well as electrically stimulated activity in acute brain slices. Together, we show a remarkable diversity in speeds and properties of three axonal organelle marker in vivo that differ from properties previously observed in vitro.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organelle trafficking</kwd><kwd>dense core vesicles</kwd><kwd>in vivo imaging</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced grant (322966)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verhage</surname><given-names>Matthijs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gravitation program BRAINSCAPES (NWO: 024.004.012)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verhage</surname><given-names>Matthijs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>013-17-002 Neuron Cofund ERA-Net SNAREopathy</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toonen</surname><given-names>Ruud F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008358</institution-id><institution>Hersenstichting</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>013-17-002 Neuron Cofund ERA-Net SNAREopathy</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Toonen</surname><given-names>Ruud F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo live imaging reveals the trafficking dynamics of three cellular organelles in neocortical axons with single vesicle resolution and demonstrates activity-dependent changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are highly compartmentalized cells which can span over large distances. Intracellular transport provides compartments with a variety of cargo necessary for cell homeostasis, growth, and inter-neuron signaling. Intracellular transport requires cytoskeletal microtubules and molecular motors, which move organelles along the microtubules. Many motors for different cargo have been identified which produce a complex picture of diverse transport dynamics, described by a variety of previous in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Macaskill et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silverman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Neurons and more specifically axons contain a variety of mobile organelles which move bidirectionally along microtubules and include: (1) mitochondria, which provide energy in the form of ATP, control calcium homeostasis, and serve as a contact hub for many other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brookes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schon and Przedborski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Mitochondria are distributed from the soma into axons and dendrites. They undergo fission and fusion events, and their transport at synapses is activity dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Macaskill et al., 2009</xref>). (2) Dense core vesicles (DCVs) contain a variety of neuropeptides which have modulatory effects ranging from excitability changes of local circuits to shifts in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Melzer et al., 2021</xref>). They are produced at the cell soma, are delivered into the axons, and released mainly at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van de Bospoort et al., 2012</xref>). We showed previously that axonal DCV transport in vivo is highly dynamic and that DCVs slow down in axonal boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knabbe et al., 2018</xref>). (3) Lysosomes are acidic organelles primarily engaged in degradative processes, but also involved in different signaling pathways and cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballabio and Bonifacino, 2020</xref>). Lysosomal proteins are delivered into the axon by endo-lysosomal organelles. These can fuse with autophagosomes to form autolysosomes. Consequently, lysosomes mature and acidify while being transported back to the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferguson, 2018</xref>). (4) Endosome function involves the transport of activated receptors, recycling of signaling and sorting factors, and the control of membrane homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuijpers et al., 2021</xref>). The different endosome stages are dynamically transported throughout the axon.</p><p>Mitochondria are the most extensively studied organelles regarding transport patterns in vitro, where they exhibit highly dynamic transport patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Misgeld and Schwarz, 2017</xref>). However, recently it was shown that mitochondria in cortical axons in vivo are mainly stationary and are located close to synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva et al., 2021</xref>). This highlights the importance of studies in vivo. For the other axonal organelles described above, detailed motility data in adult functional circuits are largely missing.</p><p>In this study, we utilized dual color two-photon imaging to analyze the trafficking dynamics of three organelle markers: the DCV marker Neuropeptide Y (NPY), and the endo-lysosomal markers LAMP1 and RAB7 in thalamocortical axons in intact living brain. In addition, to gain insight into local DCV slow down at synapses, we combined DCV imaging with an axonal-targeted calcium sensor and a synapse marker. Our data reveal that the lysosomal/endosomal markers LAMP1 and RAB7 have higher velocities than the DCV vesicle marker NPY. We also show that transport of DCVs slows down in and close to synapses. Furthermore, we show that increased calcium levels lead to an increase of the transport speed of NPY-tagged organelles. Together, we provide an overview and comparison of trafficking characteristics of axonal organelles tagged with NPY, Lamp1, and RAB7 in vivo which differ from properties previously observed in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two-photon imaging of organelle trafficking in thalamocortical axons in vivo</title><p>To analyze the trafficking dynamics of three organelle markers in intact living brain, we expressed the fluorescently tagged organelle markers NPY, LAMP1, and RAB7 in the thalamus of adult mice via viral injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). NPY tagged with fluorophores is efficiently sorted into DCVs in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ramamoorthy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bharat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knabbe et al., 2018</xref>). LAMP1 is classically used as a lysosomal marker but is much more heterogeneously distributed over endo-lysosomal and autophagic compartments. These include endosomes, lysosomes, amphysomes, and autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saftig and Klumperman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). However, roughly 50% of mobile axonal LAMP1 positive organelles contain active cathepsin D and are therefore most likely lysosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farfel-Becker et al., 2019</xref>). RAB7 is classically described as a late endosome marker but is similarly to LAMP1 also found in early endosomes, lysosomes, and multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vanlandingham and Ceresa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shearer and Petersen, 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vivo two-photon imaging of organelle dynamics in thalamocortical axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections into the thalamus lead to the expression of fluorescent organelle markers in thalamocortical projections.(<bold>B</bold>) Implantation of a chronic cranial window enables two-photon imaging of thalamocortical axons in cortical layers 1 and 2.

So far, organelle motility has mostly been studied in in vitro models. This study provides trafficking characteristics of NPY-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in single thalamocortical axons in vivo. We show that NPY-tagged secretory organelles are transported significantly slower than LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged endo-lysosomal organelles in both directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). NPY-tagged organelles are transported more selectively in anterograde direction, while endo-lysosomal organelles travel in both directions equally. NPY-tagged organelles slow down and pause at axonal locations that accumulate Synapsin-mScarlet. Significant change of their transport speed was observed during spontaneous activity and elevated calcium levels in vivo as well as during electrically stimulated activity in acute brain slices.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The velocity of three different organelle markers in vivo speed from Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, LAMP1-, and RAB7-tagged organelles in anterograde and retrograde direction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All markers traveled significantly faster in anterograde than in retrograde direction.

However, overexpression of such markers might influence organelle identity, abundance, and localization. Our in vivo approach and thalamic injection site promote the selective analysis of those organelles that travel into the distal axon. Furthermore, the organelle marker proteins used in this study are among the best validated tools. NPY-GFP/pHluorin was previously shown to be sorted exclusively into DCVs, also in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Persoon et al., 2018</xref>), to travel with the characteristics of DCVs in vitro, and to be in low pH compartments of DCV size. LAMP1-GFP labels a multitude of endo-lysosomal organelles. Recent studies report that most axonal LAMP1-tagged organelles are not acidic enough to be classified as lysosomes. These studies concluded that mature lysosomes do not typically enter the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lie et al., 2021</xref>), while other studies demonstrated transport of degradative and LAMP1-positive lysosomes into axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farfel-Becker et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, it is still unclear whether degradative cargo is delivered by mature lysosomes or by other organelles throughout the axon, especially in vivo. Therefore, only some of the LAMP1-tagged organelles observed in the current study may be degradative lysosomes. RAB7 and LAMP1 might partially overlap in the organelles they label. However, the difference in some trafficking properties observed here suggests these markers label at least partially different subpopulations of organelles. Furthermore, no overlap between overexpressed NPY and LAMP1 as well as NPY and RAB7 was found in moving organelles, indicating that these markers label distinct classes of organelles: DCVs and two classes of endo-lysosomal organelles.</p><p>Previous studies have quantified organelle transport velocities in vitro with the same or similar markers this study utilizes. For DCVs labeled with NPY or other neuropeptides (BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), tPA, Sem3A, Ilp-2, and ANF (atrial naturietic factor)), anterograde velocities range from 0.78 Âµm/s, at 32 Â°C to 1.23 Âµm/s at 37Â° to 1.37 Âµm/s and from 0.43 Âµm/s to 1.42 Âµm/s in retrograde direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bittins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavolo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Wit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwinter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sung and Lloyd, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The velocities shown here are slightly faster at least in anterograde direction, in line with what we previously reported in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knabbe et al., 2018</xref>). For axonal organelles labeled with LAMP1 in vitro, values from 0.9 Âµm/s to 2 Âµm/s in anterograde and from 0.8 Âµm/s to 1.5 Âµm/s in retrograde direction were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boecker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Pace et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snouwaert et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The LAMP1 velocities reported here are similar to the highest of the reported in vitro velocities. Reports about fluorescently tagged axonal RAB7 velocity in cultured cells and non-mammalian model systems range from 0.31 Âµm/s to 1 Âµm/s in anterograde and retrograde direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boecker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Notably, signaling endosomes travel in retrograde direction in the mouse sciatic nerve in vivo significantly faster than our reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sleigh et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, while trafficking speeds for DCVs and LAMP1-tagged endo-lysosomal organelles are consistent between studies in different model systems, substantial differences exist for RAB7-tagged

the anterograde motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stucchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hummel and Hoogenraad, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bentley et al., 2015</xref>). Retrograde transport is supported by the motor dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). DCVs and the endo-lysosomal organelles showed substantial differences in trafficking speeds. Microtubule-based transport can be modulated in different ways, which might provide an explanation for the observed speed differences: On the levels of the motors (activation, inactivation, combination, and regulation) and each organelle has unique proteins coating its surface, meaning that interactions with adapter proteins and/or motor proteins may have different affinities and dynamics. Together, this could explain the complex trafficking characteristics described here.</p><p>We provide evidence that DCVs slow down at synapses, especially for retrograde transported organelles. Previous studies in rat neurons in vitro showed that synaptic microtubule organization and a lower affinity of KIF1A to microtubule plus-ends lead to the delivery of anterograde transported cargo to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies in fruit fly neuromuscular junction report low, inefficient bidirectional capture of DCV in all but the most distal boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). The differences to our in vivo data could be explained by differences in model systems as well as the integration of multiple mechanisms on different trafficking directions.</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence for delayed, activity-dependent slow down of DCVs. The changing trend of retrograde transported DCVs from slowing down during immediate activity to speeding up in the 30 s after activity could explain the overall significant increase of velocity during activity. This would mean that there is a relatively slow mechanism which gets activated by activity affecting retrograde transported DCVs. The slice experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> support the argument of a different effect of activity on retrograde and anterograde DCV transport. Previously described activity-dependent changes in DCV motility in vitro have been explained by different pathways. One proposed mechanism is the activity-dependent phosphorylation of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) which in turn phosphorylates Synaptotagmin-4 and thereby destabilizes the interaction with KIF1 leading to DCV capture at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bharat et al., 2017</xref>). A different activity-dependent recruitment for DCV at synapses was proposed in dendrites. The KIF1 binding partner Calmodulin senses calcium and leads to binding and increased mobility of DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stucchi et al., 2018</xref>). Multiple proposed mechanisms for organelle speed increase and decrease could operate in parallel and/or act on different subpopulations of DCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cason and Holzbaur, 2022</xref>). This could obscure a more significant detection of a faster or more direct effect of activity on DCV transport. Recently, activity-dependent slow down was shown for mitochondria in vivo. The study also reported in cultured slices that the arrest of mitochondria in excitatory neurons is not fully dependent on glutamate-activated calcium influx, as previously proposed. Therefore, another unknown factor co-released with neurotransmitter was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva et al., 2021</xref>). This could also be the case for DCVs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57Bl/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57Bl/6 J Strain code:632</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MAP2 (chicken, monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab5392</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chromogranin B (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SySy 259103</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chromogranin A (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synaptic Systems</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SySy 259003</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:500</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software and algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ/Fiji</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR">SCR</ext-link> 002285</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software and algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prism</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Graphpad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR">SCR</ext-link> 002798</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software and algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R/RStudio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The R Foundation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_0019057">SCR_0019057</ext-link> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the local animal research committee of the VU University, Amsterdam and were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (010/63/EU).

Cells were permeabilized for 5 min with 0.5% Triton-X-100 (Fisher Chemical - Thermo Fisher, T/3751/08, Waltham, MA, USA), followed by 30 min incubation with 2% normal goat serum (NGS; Gibco - Thermo Fisher, 16210â072) and 0.1% Triton-X-100 to block aspecific binding. All antibodies were diluted in 2% NGS. The following antibodies were used: chicken anti-MAP2 (1:500, Abcam ab5392, Cambridge, United Kingdom), rabbit anti-Chromogranin B (1:500, SySy 259103, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany), and rabbit anti-Chromogranin A (1:500, SySy 259003). After three washes with PBS, neurons were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen) for 1 hr. After three washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted on microscopic slides with Mowiol-DABCO (Sigma, 81381). Coverslips were imaged using a confocal A1R microscope (Nikon) with LU4A laser unit using a 40Ã oil immersion objective (NA = 1.3). Images were acquired at 1024Ã1024 pixels as z-stacks (five steps of 0.25 Î¼m). Maximum projection images were used for analysis. Confocal settings were kept constant for all images within the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Processing and analysis of imaging data</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>In vivo and slice data</title><p>The acquired time-lapse datasets were registered for slight image movement in the <italic>xây</italic> plane between consecutive images with the Fiji (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR">SCR</ext-link> 002285) Plugin âDescriptor based series registrationâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preibisch et al., 2010</xref>). After registration, the datasets were background subtracted and median filtered. Axons with moving puncta were identified by making a SD z-projection of the stack which highlights moving puncta as lines. Moving puncta were analyzed using kymographs. Lines fitted over tracks in the kymographs were analyzed with an ImageJ macro written by Fabrice P. CordeliÃ¨res (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zala et al., 2013</xref>). For the analysis of axons infected with two markers, only axon stretches with at least three moving puncta and 1 per direction of each marker were analyzed. Relative flux was calculated as percentage of the main vector of movement of all tracks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>In vitro data</title><p>For co-localization analysis, morphological masks were drawn using SynD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>) and imported in ImageJ to remove background fluorescence. Co-localization between pHluorin signal and ChgA/B was measured using the JACoP plugin in ImageJ. Thresholds were set manually per cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>Basic statistics were calculated using Prism (GraphPad, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR">SCR</ext-link> 002798). Most analyzed data did not show a Gaussian distribution. Hence, distributions of the datasets were compared with non-parametric two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine the influence of the location (synapse/shaft) and activity state on to organelle trafficking, a linear mixed effect model was applied using R (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>; RStudio, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link>). The influence of mouse number, dataset number, and track number was included as random effects, while the fit of the models with and without location/activity state as fixed effect was compared to each other using ANOVA. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were approved by the national committee for animal research in the Netherlands (Centrale Commissie Dierenproven; AVD112002017824), the local animal research committee of the VU University Amsterdam (Dierexperimentencommissie) and the animal welfare body of the VU/VUmc Amsterdam (Instantie voor Dierenwelzijn) and were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (010/63/EU).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81721-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Analysis files as well as original imaging datasets have been made publicly available via the DataverseNL project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dataverse.nl">https://dataverse.nl</ext-link>) under the DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.34894/9QYXZS">https://doi.org/10.34894/9QYXZS</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nassal</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>FH</given-names></name><name><surname>Toonen</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><name><surname>Verhage</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Replication Data for: Differential axonal trafficking of Neuropeptide Y-, LAMP1- and RAB7-tagged organelles in vivo</data-title><source>DataverseNL</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.34894/9QYXZS</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Joke Wortel and Robbert Zalm for the extensive help with animal experiments and production of viral particles.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thierry Galli (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>During a discussion of the manuscript, it has become apparent that the manuscript could be substantially strengthened by placing the new work more clearly in the context of what has been done previously, particularly in other central and peripheral nervous system preparations in other model organisms. Beyond that, the comments of reviewer #3 could primarily be addressed through text clarification, additional data analysis, or the inclusion of additional data that may already have been acquired, or which might be straightforward to acquire in a short time frame. Very few of these comments and criticisms specifically request the addition of new data. As is readily apparent, reviewers #1 and #2 were generally quite positive about the study. Addressing the questions of reviewer #3 could elevate the work even further. It was generally agreed upon that no new &quot;mechanistic&quot; data are being requested. A focus should remain on context, clarifications, and additional analyses when possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My only criticism is that the simultaneous multi-photon approach is not applied in a manner that is absolutely crucial for the final quantifications.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In order to establish this article as a reference for future studies in the most straightforward way, this reviewer would like to suggest adding a table with the velocities indicated in the discussion and a comparison with previous studies carried out in cultured neurons.</p><p>Experiments in mutant mice and more markers would definitively strengthen this article but this reviewer also understands the delay that such a request would induce.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comments:</p><p>(1) As outlined in sections 1 and 2 of the public review, I feel this work mostly is incremental and corroborative in nature. In their previous collaborative work with the Kuner lab (Knabbe et al. J Physiol 2018) the authors have already described the in vivo trafficking of DCVs, using very similar experiments to show a predominance of anterograde transport and a delay at presynaptic sites. Thus, in this work, novelty is mostly related to the comparison of DCVs with late endosomes and lysosomes â but this part is relatively limited and weak. First, the markers used are not undisputed (see recent Lie et al. paper by the Nixon lab that the authors cite, but do not really discuss) and not further characterized here. The experiment of differentially tagging the two markers and actually measuring overlap is omitted â so I cannot decide, whether DCVs are compared here to one or two other organelle classes (if that descriptor even holds for the LE/L continuum). The results on the plus tip trackers and the presynaptic labels are as expected, and again overlap with prior work â the possibility of corroborating the synapse finding with a LE/L marker was not pursued. Similarly, the calcium imaging experiments were only performed with DCVs, and not with LE/Ls. This â and the low temporal resolution, which makes a detailed trafficking analysis difficult â does not allow concluding, whether the observed effects are cargo-specific (and therefore more likely to be due to organelle or motor characteristics), as opposed to general effects (that could be ascribed more to cytoskeletal effects or organelle crowding given the similar sizes of the two cargoes). A detailed correlation analysis of trafficking of two cargo classes across the same axon stretch and the same activity patterns could have been quite informative, in my view, but would not necessarily lift the work to general interest.</p><p>(2) Regarding the effects of activity, which are potentially interesting. One would have to be really sure that all the statistical corrections needed were applied for the multiple conditions; in several instances, there are effects in similar directions and sizes across time points, but these fail to reach the significance criterion, suggesting to me that the study might in part be underpowered to fully reveal what is going on â but in any case, the effect size is probably not drastic. There is an additional caveat here: As the DVC is an organelle that is 'consumed' in an activity-dependent manner, the 'effects' of activity could be entirely on the level of which organelles make it to the site of observation, rather than any local effect. So for example, slower moving organelles could be more likely to be captured at more proximal synapses, and this could create these weak effects â the complex patterns in which DCVs could potentially traffic through axons have been well described in flies. Observations on LE/Ls could have been illuminating here, as this caveat of activity-dependent consumption perhaps would not apply in the same way and effects that are organelle-specific could have been revealed.</p><p>(3) The fact that 'resting' organelles could not be included in the analysis (P13, L5: &quot;Only moving fluorescent puncta were analyzed to prevent the inclusion of released fluorophore, organelles from other axons, and auto-fluorescent background&quot;) makes an interpretation of the overall motility difficult. It has been pointed out (including by the authors) that for mitochondria, only a small fraction actually moves in mature axons in vivo (they cite this as a motivation for in vivo studies of organelle dynamics). The data do not really allow a judgement, whether this is also true for the organelles investigated here, as the size of the non-moving population of organelles is not determined. I also wonder how representative the measured trafficking behavior is, given that in most experiments, no separate structural marker was used to identify axons. I assume the organelle density and trafficking might have played a role in selecting included axon stretches, which might potentially have biased the sites of observation.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>(4) Related to Point 1 above: I do not see a firm experimental basis for the following statements â P27, L10: &quot;RAB7 and LAMP1 might partially overlap in the organelles they label. However, the different trafficking properties observed here suggest these markers label different subpopulations of organelles.&quot;; P28, L7 &quot;The three classes of organelles showed substantial differences in trafficking speeds.&quot; â but: Figure 8</p><p>(5) P1, L14: &quot;Different organelles traveling through neurons exhibit distinct properties in vitro, but this has not been investigated in the intact brain.&quot; This suggests that the trafficking of different organelles has not been looked at in vivo â while one can probably argue, whether 'in the brain' is the key qualifier here if one sticks with CNS, there have been studies that have tracked different organelles (e.g. in the mouse spinal cord). Also, the discussion perhaps undervalues the amount of in vivo or ex vivo work done in zebrafish and invertebrates. These studies mostly did not have the explicit purpose to compare movement behaviors, but the fact that such behavior is highly distinct for different organelles can be deduced from the existing literature. So perhaps it would be fair to tone down the novelty claim a bit here.</p><p>(6) P2, L25: &quot;Lysosomal proteins are delivered into the axon by endosomal organelles and fuse with autophagosomes to form lysosomes.&quot; This sentence suggests that a fusion event with an autophagosome is a necessary step in lysosome biogenesis; this does not match with how I understand this process. The authors might want to check this statement, and in this process also position themselves a bit more clearly regarding the ongoing debate on the presence of lysosomes in axons.</p><p>(7) P3, L11: &quot;We also show that transport of DCVs slows down in and close to synapses. Furthermore, we show that increased calcium levels lead to a delayed increase of the transport speed of NPY-tagged organelles.&quot; â What does &quot;delayed increase&quot; mean here?</p><p>(8) 16, L9: &quot;D: Mean speed of Lamp1-tagged organelles in MacF18 co-expressing axons (8 different axons, 78 tracks).&quot; â Relabel axis and indicate as paired analysis to support P15, L12 &quot;In every axon the direction of the average faster-trafficking Lamp1 puncta was the same as the anterograde (towards plus-end) direction of the MacF18-GFP puncta (Figure 3B).&quot;</p><p>(9) P21, L23: Why is the overexpression of an active NPY not a general problem also for the comparison with LAMP1 and Rab7, but only in the experiments where the NPYsd variant was used? P21, L23: &quot;The NPYsd variant was used to ensure that the released NPY had no effect on local circuits.&quot;</p><p>(10) P21, L28: What does the &quot;active state&quot; represent in electrophysiological terms? The Ca signals are not very sharp (Figure 6B). P21, L28: &quot;An active state of an axoGCaMP-expressing axon was defined as time in which the axoGCaMP signal was above half-maximal DF/F (Figure 6B).&quot; The activity effects on trafficking do not seem very clear to me. They could be due to many changes unrelated to the discussed signalling affecting the transport machinery itself (see above point 2, but also general cytoskeletal changes), but are probably also confounded by the vague definition of 'active state'. Perhaps there is a more convincing dose-response if one tried to more precisely measure and define activity, at least in the slice preparation (which I otherwise do not find very illuminating in the context of a paper that stresses the need for work in an intact brain)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81721.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My only criticism is that the simultaneous multi-photon approach is not applied in a manner that is absolutely crucial for the final quantifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for the time dedicated to our manuscript. We are very thankful for the positive comments regarding our work and agree that the approach used has the potential to benefit the field in transferring in vitro insight to in vivo cell biology. The multi-photon approach in our mind is necessary to provide real comparability between different organelles within a single axon. In these in vivo experiments, we inevitably have a long distance between the lens and the axon, and, in addition, there is a lot of out-of-focus fluorescence. For these two reasons we think the multi-photon approach is the best option.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In order to establish this article as a reference for future studies in the most straightforward way, this reviewer would like to suggest adding a table with the velocities indicated in the discussion and a comparison with previous studies carried out in cultured neurons.</p><p>Experiments in mutant mice and more markers would definitively strengthen this article but this reviewer also understands the delay that such a request would induce.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for the time dedicated to our manuscript. We are very thankful for the complements regarding our work and definitely agree that future experiments should include many more markers. We also agree that this type of approach would be great to study mouse mutants specifically mouse lines with trafficking deficits.</p><p>We agree with the suggestion of reviewer 2 and we added a supplemental table including our velocities and comparing them with multiple studies in different model systems (new Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General comments:</p><p>(1) As outlined in sections 1 and 2 of the public review, I feel this work mostly is incremental and corroborative in nature. In their previous collaborative work with the Kuner lab (Knabbe et al. J Physiol 2018) the authors have already described the in vivo trafficking of DCVs, using very similar experiments to show a predominance of anterograde transport and a delay at presynaptic sites. Thus, in this work, novelty is mostly related to the comparison of DCVs with late endosomes and lysosomes â but this part is relatively limited and weak. First, the markers used are not undisputed (see recent Lie et al. paper by the Nixon lab that the authors cite, but do not really discuss) and not further characterized here. The experiment of differentially tagging the two markers and actually measuring overlap is omitted â so I cannot decide, whether DCVs are compared here to one or two other organelle classes (if that descriptor even holds for the LE/L continuum). The results on the plus tip trackers and the presynaptic labels are as expected, and again overlap with prior work â the possibility of corroborating the synapse finding with a LE/L marker was not pursued. Similarly, the calcium imaging experiments were only performed with DCVs, and not with LE/Ls. This â and the low temporal resolution, which makes a detailed trafficking analysis difficult â does not allow concluding, whether the observed effects are cargo-specific (and therefore more likely to be due to organelle or motor characteristics), as opposed to general effects (that could be ascribed more to cytoskeletal effects or organelle crowding given the similar sizes of the two cargoes). A detailed correlation analysis of trafficking of two cargo classes across the same axon stretch and the same activity patterns could have been quite informative, in my view, but would not necessarily lift the work to general interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that our work provides substantially new insights compared to our previous work. We not only imaged for the first time two organelle markers, but also two functional markers and corroborated findings in invertebrate model systems.</p><p>We agree that âthe markers used are not undisputedâ. Exactly for this reason, we have not interpreted our marker imaging data and we refer throughout the manuscript to NPY-tagged organelles, Rab7-tagged organelles etc. We now address the dispute about the LE/L markers regarding the Lie et al. paper in more detail in the discussion (p 28, line 5).</p><p>We are not so sure that higher temporal resolution would yield new insights. None of our conclusions requires higher sampling rates. Furthermore, by observing trafficking characteristics in each channel, quantitatively comparing these and performing the appropriate statistical tests, we are convinced we can conclude âwhether the observed effects are cargo-specific [or not]â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Regarding the effects of activity, which are potentially interesting. One would have to be really sure that all the statistical corrections needed were applied for the multiple conditions; in several instances, there are effects in similar directions and sizes across time points, but these fail to reach the significance criterion, suggesting to me that the study might in part be underpowered to fully reveal what is going on â but in any case, the effect size is probably not drastic. There is an additional caveat here: As the DVC is an organelle that is 'consumed' in an activity-dependent manner, the 'effects' of activity could be entirely on the level of which organelles make it to the site of observation, rather than any local effect. So for example, slower moving organelles could be more likely to be captured at more proximal synapses, and this could create these weak effects â the complex patterns in which DCVs could potentially traffic through axons have been well described in flies. Observations on LE/Ls could have been illuminating here, as this caveat of activity-dependent consumption perhaps would not apply in the same way and effects that are organelle-specific could have been revealed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that by choosing a mixed linear effect model analysis, we have adequately included other possible factors for variation and we âall the statistical corrections [â¦] were applied for the multiple conditions [to make solid conclusions]â.</p><p>With regard to the activity effect on DCV possibly being explained by subpopulations of vesicles being captured in proximal synaptic sites: We randomly imaged axon stretches and therefore studied different axon parts. Furthermore, we control for speed/activity within the same axon stretches (speed during activity and during rest) and therefore exclude this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The fact that 'resting' organelles could not be included in the analysis (P13, L5: &quot;Only moving fluorescent puncta were analyzed to prevent the inclusion of released fluorophore, organelles from other axons, and auto-fluorescent background&quot;) makes an interpretation of the overall motility difficult. It has been pointed out (including by the authors) that for mitochondria, only a small fraction actually moves in mature axons in vivo (they cite this as a motivation for in vivo studies of organelle dynamics). The data do not really allow a judgement, whether this is also true for the organelles investigated here, as the size of the non-moving population of organelles is not determined. I also wonder how representative the measured trafficking behavior is, given that in most experiments, no separate structural marker was used to identify axons. I assume the organelle density and trafficking might have played a role in selecting included axon stretches, which might potentially have biased the sites of observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that an analysis of the non-moving DCV fraction (stable for multiple minutes) would be informative. However, several crucial arguments, also cited by the reviewer, preclude this.</p><p>With regard to the measured trafficking behaviour being representative: We randomly choose axon stretches in the datasets purely with the prerequisite that they contained multiple moving organelles of both markers. There are large variations in organelle density and trafficking characteristics between single analysed axon. We believe to have sampled data in an unbiased manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments</p><p>(4) Related to Point 1 above: I do not see a firm experimental basis for the following statements â P27, L10: &quot;RAB7 and LAMP1 might partially overlap in the organelles they label. However, the different trafficking properties observed here suggest these markers label different subpopulations of organelles.&quot;; P28, L7 &quot;The three classes of organelles showed substantial differences in trafficking speeds.&quot; â but: Figure 8</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these statements are probably too strong and adjusted them (p 28, line 13; p 30, line 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) P1, L14: &quot;Different organelles traveling through neurons exhibit distinct properties in vitro, but this has not been investigated in the intact brain.&quot; This suggests that the trafficking of different organelles has not been looked at in vivo â while one can probably argue, whether 'in the brain' is the key qualifier here if one sticks with CNS, there have been studies that have tracked different organelles (e.g. in the mouse spinal cord). Also, the discussion perhaps undervalues the amount of in vivo or ex vivo work done in zebrafish and invertebrates. These studies mostly did not have the explicit purpose to compare movement behaviors, but the fact that such behavior is highly distinct for different organelles can be deduced from the existing literature. So perhaps it would be fair to tone down the novelty claim a bit here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have specified the statement to âintact mammalian brainâ (p 1, line 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) P2, L25: &quot;Lysosomal proteins are delivered into the axon by endosomal organelles and fuse with autophagosomes to form lysosomes.&quot; This sentence suggests that a fusion event with an autophagosome is a necessary step in lysosome biogenesis; this does not match with how I understand this process. The authors might want to check this statement, and in this process also position themselves a bit more clearly regarding the ongoing debate on the presence of lysosomes in axons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the sentence might be misleading. This process is only necessary to degrade autophagosome cargo within autolysosomes (Cheng XT, Zhou B, Lin MY, Cai Q, Sheng ZH. Axonal autophagosomes recruit dynein for retrograde transport through fusion with late endosomes. J Cell Biol. 2015 May 11;209(3):377-86. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201412046. Epub 2015 May 4). We therefore changed the sentence (p 2, line 24). We cannot add new evidence to the debate about degradative lysosomes in axons and therefore refrain from commenting on it. However, we emphasize that we observe classical lysosome markers in organelle trafficking in thalamo-cortical axons in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) P3, L11: &quot;We also show that transport of DCVs slows down in and close to synapses. Furthermore, we show that increased calcium levels lead to a delayed increase of the transport speed of NPY-tagged organelles.&quot; â What does &quot;delayed increase&quot; mean here?</p></disp-quote><p>&quot;delayed increase&quot; was meant to indicate delayed in time. We agree that is not directly obvious and removed `delayedÂ´, which is not necessary in the short summary. We have adjusted this statement (p 3, line 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) 16, L9: &quot;D: Mean speed of Lamp1-tagged organelles in MacF18 co-expressing axons (8 different axons, 78 tracks).&quot; â Relabel axis and indicate as paired analysis to support P15, L12 &quot;In every axon the direction of the average faster-trafficking Lamp1 puncta was the same as the anterograde (towards plus-end) direction of the MacF18-GFP puncta (Figure 3B).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We added a panel C to figure 3 showing a paired analysis per axon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) P21, L23: Why is the overexpression of an active NPY not a general problem also for the comparison with LAMP1 and Rab7, but only in the experiments where the NPYsd variant was used? P21, L23: &quot;The NPYsd variant was used to ensure that the released NPY had no effect on local circuits.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the overexpression of normal NPY could theoretically affect the co-trafficking data. We choose this construct because we wanted comparability to previous trafficking studies using the same overexpression constructs. The possible change of activity state would affect both labelled organelles and therefore still allow these comparisons. We switched to the signal-dead construct, when specifically assessing effects on trafficking. We hypothesized these to be due to activity changes and therefore specifically wanted to exclude possible effects of release overexpressed NPY.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) P21, L28: What does the &quot;active state&quot; represent in electrophysiological terms? The Ca signals are not very sharp (Figure 6B). P21, L28: &quot;An active state of an axoGCaMP-expressing axon was defined as time in which the axoGCaMP signal was above half-maximal DF/F (Figure 6B).&quot; The activity effects on trafficking do not seem very clear to me. They could be due to many changes unrelated to the discussed signalling affecting the transport machinery itself (see above point 2, but also general cytoskeletal changes), but are probably also confounded by the vague definition of 'active state'. Perhaps there is a more convincing dose-response if one tried to more precisely measure and define activity, at least in the slice preparation (which I otherwise do not find very illuminating in the context of a paper that stresses the need for work in an intact brain)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be great to study more precise activity traces and that this might lead to a better understanding of the effects we found. However, to be able to image these small organelles the imaging frequency has a limit. The small amount of fluorophore per organelle, the desired imaging area size and the desired total imaging time led to those limits. We therefore were limited to a comparatively slow imaging frequency for calcium imaging. This led us to the decision for a binary activity threshold which is quite often used in the field. The decision to do a similar analysis in slices was made to be able to easily compare those results with the in vivo results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
