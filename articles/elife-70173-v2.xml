hyperpolarizations following brief depolarizing voltage steps, which has been shown to contribute to regulating the firing properties of numerous neuronal cell types throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although mediated by the same voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels that underlie the transient and persistent Nav current components, the gating mechanisms that contribute to the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub> remain unclear. Here, we characterized Nav currents in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, and used tailored voltage-clamp protocols to define how the voltage and the duration of the initial membrane depolarization affect the amplitudes and kinetics of I<sub>NaR</sub>. Using the acquired voltage-clamp data, we developed a novel Markov kinetic state model with parallel (fast and slow) inactivation pathways and, we show that this model reproduces the properties of the resurgent, as well as the transient and persistent, Nav currents recorded in (mouse) cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Based on the acquired experimental data and the simulations, we propose that resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> influx occurs as a result of fast inactivating Nav channels transitioning into an open/conducting state on membrane hyperpolarization, and that the decay of I<sub>NaR</sub> reflects the slow accumulation of recovered/opened Nav channels into a second, alternative and more slowly populated, inactivated state. Additional simulations reveal that extrinsic factors that affect the kinetics of fast or slow Nav channel inactivation and/or impact the relative distribution of Nav channels in the fast- and slow-inactivated states, such as the accessory Navβ4 channel subunit, can modulate the amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Nav channel gating</kwd><kwd>sodium channel gating</kwd><kwd>markov modeling</kwd><kwd>INaR</kwd><kwd>cerebellar Purkinje neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS065761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nerbonne</surname><given-names>Jeanne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL136553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>Jonathan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS090765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ransdell</surname><given-names>Joseph L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental and modeling results reveal that the activation of resurgent sodium currents relies on the recovery of inactivated channels into a conducting state, and that the decay of resurgent currents reflects the accumulation of these channels into a slow-inactivated state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels open rapidly on membrane depolarization and underlie the generation of action potentials in many excitable cells, including skeletal and cardiac muscle, as well as central and peripheral neurons. The pore-forming (α) subunits of Nav channels, Nav1.1 to Nav1.9, belong to the ‘S4’ superfamily of voltage-gated ion channel genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catterall, 2010</xref>). Each Nav α subunit comprises four homologous domains (DI–DIV) with six transmembrane spanning segments (S1–S6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noda et al., 1984</xref>). The S1–S4 segments in each domain form the four voltage sensing domains (VSDs) that activate on membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guy and Seetharamulu, 1986</xref>), resulting in channel opening and Na<sup>+</sup> influx. Nav channels conduct Na<sup>+</sup> when the VSDs of domains I, II, and III move outwardly to an activated conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bezanilla, 2000</xref>). Following opening, fast inactivation occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bezanilla and Armstrong, 1977</xref>), mediated by a hydrophobic (IFM) motif in the cytosolic DIII–DIV linker that binds to a site near the pore that is revealed on activation of the DIII and DIV VSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosmans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cha et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, fast inactivation of open Nav channels occurs when all four VSDs are in the outward/activated position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capes et al., 2013</xref>). If domains I, II, and III are activated and DIV is in the deactivated position, however, the IFM motif does not bind, which results in the generation of a non-inactivating or persistent Nav current (I<sub>NaP</sub>) component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chanda and Bezanilla, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horn et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>An additional Nav current component, that is observed on membrane <italic>hyperpolarizations</italic> following brief depolarizing voltage steps and referred to as the resurgent component of Nav current (I<sub>NaR</sub>), was first described in isolated, postnatal day 8–14 rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>). Although linked to the regulation of the spontaneous firing of action potentials in cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raman and Bean, 1999</xref>), I<sub>NaR</sub> was subsequently identified in more than 20 types of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems, only some of which are spontaneously active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>) suggesting that I<sub>NaR</sub> likely plays diverse functional roles in regulating neuronal excitability. Although flowing through the same Nav channels as the transient (I<sub>NaT</sub>) and persistent (I<sub>NaP</sub>) sodium current components, the time- and voltage-dependent properties of I<sub>NaR</sub> are distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>). In addition to being revealed on membrane <italic>hyperpolarizations</italic> presented after brief (~5 ms) depolarizing voltage steps that evoke I<sub>NaT</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khaliq et al., 2003</xref>), for example, the time courses of I<sub>NaR</sub> activation and decay are much slower than I<sub>NaT</sub>. These experimental observations were interpreted as suggesting a Nav channel gating model with two distinct mechanisms contributing to inactivation: a conventional, fast inactivation mechanism in which channels recover from inactivation without passing through an open conducting state; and, a second mechanism, favored by brief depolarizations, in which channels recover from inactivation by passing through an open, conducting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). It was further suggested that the second mechanism was consistent with a voltage-dependent process whereby Nav channels, opened on depolarization, are blocked by an endogenous ‘blocking’ particle that occludes the pore, driving channels into an ‘open-blocked’ (OB) state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). On subsequent membrane hyperpolarization, the blocking particle is displaced, and Na<sup>+</sup> flows through unblocked/open Nav channels, generating the resurgent Nav current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). Importantly, in this gating scheme, blocked Nav channels do not inactivate and inactivated channels are not blocked, that is, a Nav channel cannot be blocked and inactivated simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Studies focused on defining the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub> revealed that proteases (e.g., trypsin/chymotrypsin) that act at positively charged and aromatic/hydrophobic amino acid residues eliminate I<sub>NaR</sub>, while increasing I<sub>NaT</sub>, observations interpreted as supporting the blocking particle model and suggesting that the putative blocker was a protein within the Nav channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grieco et al., 2002</xref>). Attention focused quickly on the transmembrane accessory Navβ4 subunit, which has a short cytosolic tail with several positive charges and multiple aromatic/hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>). Clear support for a role for Navβ4 was provided in experiments in which intracellular application of a synthetic Navβ4 peptide containing the tail sequence (β4154–167), following elimination of the resurgent Nav current by trypsin or chymotrypsin, rescued I<sub>NaR</sub> in isolated cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, experiments on CA3 pyramidal neurons, which lack I<sub>NaR</sub> and Navβ4, demonstrated that the application of the β4154–167 peptide generated resurgent Nav currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>). Further support for a critical role for Navβ4 was provided with the demonstration that treatment of mouse cerebellar granule neurons with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting <italic>Scn4b</italic> (Navβ4) resulted in the loss of I<sub>NaR</sub> and that the subsequent exposure of <italic>Scn4b</italic>-siRNA-treated cells to the β4154–167 peptide rescued I<sub>NaR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grieco et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bant and Raman, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In experiments designed to test directly the hypothesis that Navβ4 is <italic>required</italic> for the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub>, however, we found that I<sub>NaR</sub> was reduced (by ~50%), but <italic>not</italic> eliminated, and that the time- and voltage-dependent properties of the currents were unaffected in cerebellar Purkinje neurons in (<italic>Scn4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mice lacking Navβ4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ransdell et al., 2017</xref>). It was subsequently reported that I<sub>NaR</sub> densities in cerebellar Purkinje neurons isolated from another <italic>Scn4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse line were not significantly different from the currents measured in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that I<sub>NaR</sub> is readily measured in <italic>Scn4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyazaki et al., 2014</xref>). These observations clearly suggest that additional mechanisms contribute to the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub>. One possibility is that there are other open channel blocking molecules expressed in Purkinje (and other) neurons. Support for this hypothesis was provided in studies showing that I<sub>NaR</sub> is decreased in neonatal mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons isolated from animals harboring a targeted disruption in the <italic>Fgf14</italic> (which encodes intracellular fibroblast growth factor 14 [iFGF14]) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2019</xref>), as well as in wild type neonatal Purkinje cells following exposure to an interfering RNA targeting the <italic>Fgf14b</italic> variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, however, it was also reported that I<sub>NaR</sub> was readily detected in Purkinje neurons isolated from neonatal animals lacking both <italic>Scn4b</italic> and <italic>Fgf14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2019</xref>). It is certainly possible and that there are additional, yet to be discovered, endogenous open channel blockers that contribute to the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub>. Alternatively, it seemed possible to us that there is an intrinsic gating mechanism(s) by which Nav channels can produce resurgent current. Here, we present the results of experimental and modeling efforts designed to explore the latter hypothesis directly, and we provide evidence for a ‘blocking-particle independent’ mechanism in the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub> in cerebellar Purkinje neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> depends on the duration, but not the voltage, of the prior membrane depolarization</title><p>In isolated neonatal (P12–P16) mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, the fast transient (I<sub>NaT</sub>), persistent (I<sub>NaP</sub>), and resurgent (I<sub>NaR</sub>) Nav current components can be distinguished using voltage-clamp protocols that take advantage of the unique time- and voltage-dependent properties of the three current components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In addition, the time courses of I<sub>NaR</sub> activation and decay are much slower than I<sub>NaT</sub> activation and decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In initial experiments, the external and internal Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations were 151 and 8 mM, respectively, resulting in a Na<sup>+</sup> reversal potential of +75 mV. These experiments revealed that prolonging the duration of the +20 mV depolarizing voltage step resulted in the marked attenuation of the peak amplitudes of I<sub>NaR</sub> measured during hyperpolarizing voltage steps to –45 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The time course of the attenuation of I<sub>NaR</sub> was well described by a single exponential characterized by a mean ± SEM (n = 12) time constant of 15.5 ± 0.5 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The amplitude of resurgent voltage-gated sodium current (I<sub>NaR</sub>) is determined by the duration of the prior membrane depolarization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In a neonatal mouse cerebellar Purkinje neuron, I<sub>NaR</sub> was revealed on membrane hyperpolarizations following depolarizing voltage steps to +20 mV of varying durations; the voltage-clamp paradigm is shown below the current records.

The attenuation of peak I<sub>NaR</sub> as a function of the duration of the depolarizing voltage step was well described by a single exponential with a mean ± SEM time constant of 15.5 ± 0.5 ms (n = 12). (<bold>C</bold>) The dependence of I<sub>NaR</sub> on the duration of the depolarizing voltage step was also measured with reduced (50 mM) extracellular and increased intracellular (15 mM) sodium, resulting in a Na<sup>+</sup> reversal potential of +30 mV. Under these conditions, depolarizing voltage steps to +46 mV evoked outward I<sub>NaT</sub>. Peak I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes, revealed during hyperpolarizing voltage steps to –45 mV, however, were also found to vary as a function of the duration of the depolarizing voltage step, revealing that I<sub>NaR</sub> and the time-dependent attenuation of I<sub>NaR</sub> are not affected by the direction (inward versus outward) of Na<sup>+</sup> flux during the depolarizing voltage step. The peak amplitudes of I<sub>NaR</sub>, evoked at –45 mV following each depolarizing voltage step, were measured in each cell and normalized to the maximal I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitude (in the same cell). As is evident from the representative records and the plot of normalized peak I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes (on the right), the attenuation of I<sub>NaR</sub> as a function of the duration of the depolarizing voltage steps to +46 mV is also well described by a single exponential with a mean ± SEM time constant of 13.8 ± 1.1 ms (n = 6), a value similar to that observed when I<sub>NaT</sub> was inward (<bold>B</bold>).

Under these recording conditions, depolarizations to +46 mV resulted in outward I<sub>NaT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar to the results obtained with inward I<sub>NaT</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), prolonging the depolarizing (+46 mV) voltage step when I<sub>NaT</sub> is outward results in the rapid attenuation of the amplitudes of I<sub>NaR</sub> evoked during the subsequent hyperpolarizations to –45 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Under these conditions (outward I<sub>NaT</sub>), the time course of the attenuation of I<sub>NaR</sub> was also well described by a single exponential with a mean ± SEM (n = 6) time constant of 13.8 ± 1.1 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a value that is very similar to that observed when I<sub>NaT</sub> is inward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

To explore this hypothesis, we developed a Markov kinetic state model that, after numerical optimization (see Materials and methods), recapitulates the range of time- and voltage-dependent properties observed experimentally for the Nav currents in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons.

The model was constrained to fit the experimental data derived from multiple voltage-clamp protocols designed to detail the properties of I<sub>NaT</sub>, including those to determine the voltage dependence of I<sub>NaT</sub> activation and steady-state inactivation, the time course of I<sub>NaT</sub> recovery from inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), and the time constant (tau) of decay of the peak I<sub>NaT</sub>.

To test this hypothesis directly, we measured peak I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes, recorded at 0 and –45 mV, respectively, during sequential voltage-clamp protocols separated by a brief (20 ms) interval at –90 mV; the paradigm is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> below the current records.

However, if the channels that underlie I<sub>NaR</sub> have accumulated in the second, slow-inactivated (IS) state during the first –45 mV voltage step and recovery from this state is also slow, one would expect to see differential effects on peak I<sub>NaT</sub> and peak I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes when the time interval at –90 mV is sufficient to allow complete recovery of I<sub>NaT</sub>, but too short to allow the complete recovery of I<sub>NaR</sub>.

Recordings from five additional Purkinje neurons using this voltage-clamp paradigm yielded similar results.

To determine the relationship between I<sub>NaR</sub> and the channels that give rise to the persistent component of the sodium current, I<sub>NaP</sub>, we used two voltage-clamp protocols, designed to allow direct measurements of I<sub>NaP</sub> alone or I<sub>NaP</sub> plus I<sub>NaR</sub>. In the first protocol, a slow (dV/dt = 0.12 mV/ms) depolarizing voltage ramp (from –100 to 0 mV) was presented and inward currents, reflecting only I<sub>NaP</sub>, were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>blue</italic>).

It should be noted that I<sub>NaR</sub> decays (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) during the hyperpolarizing voltage-ramp and that the relative amplitudes of I<sub>NaR</sub> and I<sub>NaP</sub> to the measured currents vary as function of time during the ramp. In addition, we recorded the currents evoked during depolarizing voltage steps to various test potentials between –75 and +10 mV from a holding potential of –100 mV, and we measured the amplitudes of I<sub>NaP</sub> directly, at 25 ms after the onset of each depolarizing voltage step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, green).

Importantly, the model reliably recapitulates the detailed time- and voltage-dependent properties of I<sub>NaR</sub> determined experimentally in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons. The model, for example, accounts for the experimental finding that the peak amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> (recorded on membrane hyperpolarizations following brief depolarizations that evoke I<sub>NaT</sub>) is sensitive to the duration of the preceding depolarizing voltage step, with longer depolarizations resulting in lower I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes. Importantly, the dependence of I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes on the duration of the depolarizing voltage step was also observed when the inward driving force of Na<sup>+</sup> was reduced or eliminated. In addition, the model reproduces the experimental finding that I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes are not dependent on the voltage of the initial depolarizing voltage step (that evokes I<sub>NaT</sub>). Finally, and also consistent with the experimental data, the voltage dependence of I<sub>NaR</sub> (revealed on membrane hyperpolarizations) mirrors the voltage dependence of I<sub>NaP</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, this last observation, that is, that the voltage dependence of I<sub>NaP</sub> is identical to the voltage dependence of I<sub>NaR</sub>, was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kay et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The model developed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is distinct from a previously proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) of Nav channel gating in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>) that involves two competing pathways out of the open state, that is, channels transitioning into either an OB state or an inactivated state. In this earlier model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) of I<sub>NaR</sub> gating, a blocking particle occludes the Nav channel pore that is opened on membrane depolarization, functionally competing with conventional, fast inactivation, and, in addition, the OB state is isolated off the open/conducting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). In this model, entry into the OB state is promoted by membrane depolarizations to positive potentials and, on subsequent membrane hyperpolarization, the blocking particle is expelled by the Na<sup>+</sup> driven through the unblocked Nav channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aman and Raman, 2010</xref>). In addition, the larger the driving force on Na<sup>+</sup>, the more rapidly the blocker is displaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aman and Raman, 2010</xref>). This process, while intrinsically voltage-independent, therefore, is tied to the driving force on Na<sup>+</sup>, consistent with the experimental observation that the peak amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> is observed at relatively hyperpolarized (−45 to –30 mV) membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aman and Raman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>). At more negative membrane potentials, closed state inactivation begins to dominate, and I<sub>NaR</sub> is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>). The experimental results presented here, however, reveal that the peak amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> is not affected by the voltage of the initial membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), but rather <italic>is affected by the duration</italic> of the prior depolarizing voltage step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The finding that the magnitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> is substantially reduced when the initial depolarizing voltage step is increased in duration was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). In addition, experimental results presented here demonstrate that the time-dependent accumulation of Nav channels into the slow-inactivated state occurs independent of the direction of the movement of permeating Na<sup>+</sup> ions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Recovery from conventional Nav channel inactivation into an open/conducting state</title><p>The experiments and the simulations presented here suggest that I<sub>NaR</sub> reflects the transitioning of Nav channels that have undergone conventional fast inactivation, into an open/conducting state on membrane hyperpolarizations. Consistent with the slow decay of I<sub>NaR</sub>, the model includes two parallel, but distinct, inactivation pathways: the fast (i.e., IF1 and IF2) inactivation pathway and the slow (i.e., IS) inactivation pathway, which satisfies the key experimental finding that the amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> is insensitive to the voltage of the initial depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although it was previously reported that the slower component of the biexponential decay of I<sub>NaT</sub> (measured at –30 mV) in Purkinje neurons is identical to the decay rate of I<sub>NaR</sub> (also measured at –30 mV), this observation was interpreted as suggesting that all Nav channels initially undergo open channel block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>). The results of the experiments here involving prolonged depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>), however, are not consistent with this model. In the experiments here, we found that there is still a time-dependent attenuation of I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes on membrane hyperpolarizations following depolarizations to positive membrane potentials, with little or no inward driving force on Na<sup>+</sup>. These findings are inconsistent with the open-channel block hypothesis, in which positive membrane potentials are thought to promote and stabilize open-channel block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman and Bean, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aman and Raman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>).</p><p>One assumption usually made when considering the gating of Nav channels is that deactivation must occur prior to recovery from inactivation. Or, to state another way, Nav channels cannot exit the conventional inactivated state directly into an open or conducting state. This idea is based on voltage-clamp experiments conducted on CA1 hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuo and Bean, 1994</xref>) and the squid giant axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong, 2006</xref>), which revealed that recovery from inactivation occurs with a delay and is voltage-dependent. Indeed, if recovery from inactivation requires all four of the VSDs of domains I–IV to move into the deactivated position, the model presented here is not possible because channels that have undergone conventional, fast inactivation would not be able to move directly into an open/conducting state without first transiting through an intermediate closed state. However, if deactivation of VSD IV is sufficient to release the cytosolic DIII–DIV linker peptide from the channel pore, while VSD I, II, and III remain in the activated conformation, Nav channels could transit from an inactivated state directly into an open/conducting state. There are several reports suggesting that this is possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schiavon et al., 2012</xref>, for example, demonstrated that scorpion beta toxins induce I<sub>NaR</sub> in heterologously (in HEK-293 cells) expressed Nav channels. These toxins were previously shown to cause a negative shift in the voltage dependence of DI-VSD, DII-VSD, and DIII-VSD activation by trapping the DII-VSD in the activated position after depolarizing prepulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cestèle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schiavon et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, on repolarization, the channel recovers from inactivation, allowing resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> influx.</p><p>Resurgent Nav currents have also been induced in heterologously expressed (in HEK-293 cells) Nav1.5-encoded channels following application of the classical type II pyrethroid, deltamethrin. Similar to our model for the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub>, the deltamethrin-modified Nav1.5 channels were found to recover from inactivation prior to deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thull et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, it has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cummins et al., 2004</xref>) that heterologously expressed (in HEK-293 cells) mutant Nav1.7-encoded channels have prolonged deactivation time constants at the hyperpolarized membrane potentials associated with the activation of I<sub>NaR</sub>. These mutant Nav1.7 channels were also reported to display an increase in the relative amplitude of the non-inactivating Nav current (i.e., I<sub>NaP</sub>). These two observations are clearly consistent with the I<sub>NaR</sub> gating model proposed here in which Nav channels can recover from conventional, fast inactivation directly into an open/conducting state. It is, however, worth noting that in this report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cummins et al., 2004</xref>), I<sub>NaR</sub> was never measured directly, instead the membrane was repolarized prior to the completion of I<sub>NaT</sub> inactivation. As a result, it is not possible to conclude, with certainty, that the mutant Nav1.7 channels were recovering from inactivation into an open/conducting state, or simply displaying prolonged deactivation at hyperpolarized membrane potentials.</p><p>In developing the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we found that two fast-inactivated states, that is, IF1 and IF2, were required to recapitulate the experimental data. It is certainly possible, however, that IF1 and IF2 are substrates of the same channel state. We also note here that, initially, the model was developed with two slow-inactivated states (IS, IS2) for symmetry. The simulations revealed, however, that the two slow-inactivated states were redundant and that we were able to fit the experimental data reliably with only one of these slow-inactivated states.</p><p>It is important to note that we appreciate that our model topology and rate constants, while reliably recapitulating the time- and voltage-dependent properties of the currents determined experimentally, are not necessarily ‘unique’ or potentially the ‘most simple’. Indeed, in using Markov kinetic state modeling, it is not possible to tell the uniqueness or the ambiguity of the model (both with regard to the parameters and the model topology). Following the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menon et al., 2009</xref>, using a state mutating genetic algorithm to vary topologies in a Markov model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mangold et al., 2021</xref>, recently reported the development of an algorithm to enumerate all possible model structures distinctly using rooted graph theory (e.g., all possible combinations of models, rooted around a single open state). These efforts revealed that there are many model structures and parameter sets that can adequately fit some experimental datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular determinants of I<sub>NaR</sub></title><p>Soon after the discovery of I<sub>NaR</sub>, it was reported that the targeted deletion of <italic>Scn8a</italic> (which encodes the Nav1.6 α subunit) in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons resulted in a 90% reduction in the amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub>, suggesting that, of the α subunits (Nav1.1 and Nav1.6) expressed in Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vega-Saenz de Miera et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>), Nav channels formed by Nav1.6 are the major contributors to I<sub>NaR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raman et al., 1997</xref>). However, it was later reported that the targeted deletion of <italic>Scn1a</italic> (which encodes the Nav1.1 α subunit) also results in ~65% reduction in I<sub>NaR</sub>, suggesting that multiple Nav α subunits contribute to I<sub>NaR</sub> in cerebellar Purkinje neurons and, in addition, that the contributions are non-linear. To date, all but one (Nav1.3) of the nine Nav channel α subunits have been shown to mediate, or can be induced to mediate, I<sub>NaR</sub> in native or heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarecki et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Do and Bean, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). It is unclear whether Nav1.3-encoded Nav channels also generate I<sub>NaR</sub>, as it appears that voltage-clamp studies focused on exploring this possibility have not been conducted to date.</p><p>In the model proposed here, the amplitude of I<sub>NaR</sub> is dependent on, and ultimately regulated by, two factors: the proportion of Nav channels that are non-inactivating at hyperpolarized voltages, that is, the number of channels that recover from inactivation into an open state on repolarization; and, the proportion of these non-inactivating channels that accumulate into a slow-inactivated state. In the simulations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, we show that by promoting the occupancy of the IS (slow-inactivated) state, we can recapitulate the experimental observation that I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes are reduced in <italic>Scn4b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, compared with wild type, cerebellar Purkinje neurons, suggesting the possibility that Navβ4 expression regulates I<sub>NaR</sub> by influencing slow inactivation. The hypothesis that I<sub>NaR</sub> is directly affected by Nav channel slow inactivation is also consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hampl et al., 2016</xref>), showing that mutations in the Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 α subunits that enhance or inhibit slow inactivation also result in reduced or increased, respectively, I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes. Interestingly, it has also been reported that mutation of the IFM motif (to QQQ) in Nav1.4, in addition to completely eliminating fast inactivation, increases the proportion of channels that enter the slow inactivated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Featherstone et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that the model developed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in which the fast and slow components of inactivation are exclusive, may be applicable to diverse Nav channels in different cell types and encoded by different α subunits.</p><p>There are a number of additional factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, to Nav α subunits, as well as additional pre- and post-translational mechanisms, that regulate persistent Nav currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammarstrom and Gage, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paul et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Baines, 2015</xref>) and slow inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Silva, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr et al., 2003</xref>). In the model developed and presented here, the combined effects of these factors/mechanisms will regulate/modulate the amplitudes and the time- and voltage-dependent properties of I<sub>NaR</sub>. In this context, it is interesting to note that the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> indicate that the Nav channels underlying I<sub>NaR</sub>, compared to the sum of the Nav channels underlying I<sub>NaT</sub>, are differentially sensitive to slow inactivation. This observation clearly suggests that there is functional (and perhaps molecular) heterogeneity in the population of Nav channels underlying the Nav currents in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, with channels underlying I<sub>NaR</sub> having properties distinct from at least a portion of the Nav channels that participate in the generation of I<sub>NaT</sub>, but that do not produce I<sub>NaR</sub>. This possibility is consistent with results presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 2019</xref>, in which I<sub>NaR</sub> was found to have a greater sensitivity to tetrodotoxin block than I<sub>NaT</sub> in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons. It should also be noted that the Markov model developed here was created to reflect a single channel population, that is, Nav channels capable of generating both I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaR</sub>. As such, the developed Markov model does not reproduce the differential recovery from inactivation presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Functional implications</title><p>Based on the experimental data and the computational modeling presented here, we propose a novel, blocking particle-independent, gating mechanism for the generation of I<sub>NaR</sub> that involves two, kinetically distinct inactivation pathways. The modeling results suggest that two parameters are critical in determining the magnitude and the time- and voltage-dependent properties of I<sub>NaR</sub>: (1) the relative amplitude of the persistent Nav current, I<sub>NaP</sub>, component; and, (2) the proportion of the persistent Nav channels (channels that fail to undergo fast inactivation) that undergo slow inactivation. Interestingly, I<sub>NaR</sub> has now been identified in over 20 types of neurons, many of which do not display the high rates of repetitive firing that are characteristics of cerebellar Purkinje neurons, suggesting that the role(s) of I<sub>NaR</sub> in the regulation of membrane excitability are diverse, and likely distinct, in different neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>). Recent studies conducted on serotonergic raphe neurons, for example, suggest that the accumulation of Nav channels in a slow-inactivated state functions as a homeostatic brake on repetitive firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Navarro et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, I<sub>NaR</sub> has been implicated in several inherited and acquired neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>), including paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, paramyotonia congenita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jarecki et al., 2010</xref>), and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lewis and Raman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sittl et al., 2012</xref>), as well as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hargus et al., 2013</xref>). Given the implications of these findings, it will be of considerable interest to detail the properties of I<sub>NaR</sub> in different types of neurons and to explore directly the hypothesis that the rate of decay of I<sub>NaR</sub> on membrane repolarization plays a role in determining how much persistent sodium current is available to contribute to repetitive firing, as well as to define the molecular mechanisms that control I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes, kinetics, and functioning in diverse neuronal cell types.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines published in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

In all recordings, tip potentials were zeroed prior to forming a giga-ohm membrane–pipette seal. Pipette capacitances were compensated using the pCLAMP software.

Whole-cell membrane capacitances (C<sub>m</sub>) were calculated for each cell by dividing the integrated capacitive transients by the voltage. Consistent with the short time in culture and lack of extensive processes, the capacitive transients of recorded cells had single-exponential decay phases. Input resistances were calculated from the steady-state currents elicited by the same ±10 mV steps (from the holding potential). For each cell, the series resistance was calculated by dividing the time constant of the decay of the capacitive transient (fit by a single exponential) by the C<sub>m</sub>. Series resistances were routinely compensated ≥80%. Voltage errors resulting from the uncompensated series resistance were always ≤4 mV and were not corrected.

A modified Nelder-Mead simplex method that allows for constrained optimization (only positive rate constants) was used for simultaneous optimization of the protocols listed below. A cost function for each protocol was defined as the sum of squared differences between the experiments and the simulations. The total cost function (sum of the individual protocol errors) was then minimized and converged when a tolerance of 0.01 for the change of the cost function and 0.01 for the change in parameters was achieved.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Teresa Giraldez as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that these results are interesting and compelling, offering a fresh and stimulating perspective and including some significant new experimental data. However, reviewers also raised several concerns about the interpretation of the data and some other aspects related to implementation of the model that should be addressed by the authors. Essential revisions should include:</p><p>1) Address the possible limitations of the new model according to the comments of the reviewers.</p><p>2) Discussion of whether the model can predict the different kinetics of recovery from inactivation of INaT and INaR.</p><p>3) Some discussion of whether the different inactivated states can be related to the molecular machinery of the channel as it is currently known.</p><p>4) Reconcile discrepancies and apparent inconsistencies in the experimental data. The authors should at least address the apparent inconsistency between their data and: a) previous experimental results for the size of the resurgent current relative to transient current, and b) discuss how their experimental data with native resurgent current are similar or different from previous results using free charged peptide pieces from the beta4 subunit (where an open channel block mechanism seems likely).</p><p>5) Discussion about interpretation of Figure 6.</p><p>Because the individual reviews include several important points they are included here for you reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>According to the open block model (Raman and Bean, 2001), the INaP current component represents the dynamic distribution of sodium channels between open blocked, open and normal inactivated states. How could the new Markov model describe the possible gating transitions involved in the generation of INaP? Related to this, the statement in lines 506 may confuse some readers, is it specifically shown in this manuscript that the amplitude and voltage-dependence of INaR mirrors that of INaP?</p><p>In Figure 2A, INaP is not clearly seen as in e.g. Figure 1A, and even appears to be slightly outwards, which would not be consistent with a Na<sup>+</sup> current if ENa is +75 mV (as stated in the text). Please explain. Was there a high variability in INaP between cells? This may be relevant, considering that the relative amplitude of INaP is critical in determining the magnitude of INaR (as the authors state in the discussion).</p><p>What is the prediction of the open block model on INaR gating at different membrane depolarizations? Adding this Figure (as supplementary) would compare and contrast all of your experimental findings with both models.</p><p>The experimental data in Figure 8 reveals that the INaR channels are populated separately with slow inactivated state and the novel gating model recapitulates the data credibly. Conversely the open channel block model fails to simulate these results (Supp Figure 2A). Can the OB model simulate any of the experimental data from Scn4b-/- neurons? It would be interesting to see the relative occupancy plots with this model.</p><p>The simulation data in Figure 3H Vs. Figure 4B is different. In Figure 4B (bottom panel), when the depolarization at 0 mV is longer, the activation time of INaR is slower and the decay time of both INaT and INaR are slower. This seems not consistent with Figure 3H. Please explain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Generally the results reported for the Raman-Bean model seemed correct. However, one did not: the plot of decay time constants in Figure 7H. The Raman-Bean paper shows a decay time constant of 25 msec at -30 mV (their Figure 8B), while this plot gives its value as about 45 ms. And the discrepancy seems even greater at -60 mV, where the modeled results in Figure 8A of the Raman-Bean seem to have a time constant of maybe 5 ms, while in Figure 7 H the values in this region are far higher. The authors should check this point.</p><p>2) A major experimental difference between the results here and previous reports is the magnitude of resurgent current relative to transient current. For example, the Raman- Bean gave average values of 6.8 nA for transient current and 193 pA for maximal resurgent current, so resurgent current was ~3% of transient current. Similar values are evident in most of the previous papers from the Raman lab, e.g. the most recent paper by White et al., (2019) gave a mean value of 2.7% for Purkinje neurons from wild-type mice. In contrast, here the authors give experimental values of ~27% (Figure 7F). This seems very surprising and is obviously an important point because it is one of the biggest differences in the predictions of the two models. The authors should at least comment on this difference in the experimental data.</p><p>3) The data in Figure 6 is interpreted as showing that the voltage-dependence of persistent and resurgent sodium current are identical. It is not obvious to me that the current during the “reverse” voltage ramp is primarily resurgent current rather than persistent current. In principle, from the authors’ earlier results it would be expected that resurgent current would be substantially inactivated by the relatively long time spent at depolarized voltages before the ramp down reaches ~-30 mV where the current is biggest. In contrast, persistent sodium current would not be expected to inactivate. What is the argument that the current during the reverse ramp is mostly resurgent current and not simply mostly persistent current? It is not obvious to me that this experiment would look much different in a cell type that did not have resurgent sodium current.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Dependency of InaR on depolarizing potential and time</p><p>In previous experiments, InaR was slightly dependent on the magnitude of the depolarization step, especially at higher potentials (here it was only tested up to +10mV) (Biophys J. 2001 Feb;80(2):729-37., also own results with β 4 petide). Also if the depolarization step is prolonged, InaR becomes strongly dependent on voltage (Biophys J. 2007 Mar 15;92(6):1938-51, Figure 5B, J Neurosci. 2010 Apr 21;30(16):5629-34.) Therefore, the claims of the authors need more experimental backup.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Intrinsic Mechanisms in the Gating of Resurgent Na<sup>+</sup> Currents” for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and the original reviewers.</p><p>After the consultation session, all reviewers agree that the authors’ main finding that the resurgent current can be modelled by a mechanism independent of open-channel block is very relevant and would certainly encourage the field with fresh ideas. The manuscript has been improved after revision. However, two reviewers still found remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Some ambiguity exists about how “InaT”, “InaR”, and “InaP” are defined and measured in both the data and the results of the models. The authors should include a section in the Methods to clearly state how the components of current termed “InaT”, InaR”, and “InaP” were defined for both experimental measurements and modelling, and specifically whether quantification of the size of the “InaR” current seen upon hyperpolarization following depolarizations was only the decaying current or included the steady-state current that could be considered “InaP”.</p><p>2) Optionally, the authors could consider revising the manuscript according to the second reviews listed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed all the concerns. I have no further comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded at length in the “Response to Reviews” document, although in many cases, the actual changes in the manuscript are fairly minimal. In my opinion, several of the points that were raised in the initial review remain unclear or confusing in the presentation of the manuscript, as discussed below. It seems that several of these reflect an ambiguity about how (or even whether) measurements of “InaR” distinguish between resurgent sodium current and persistent sodium current.</p><p>1) A point that was raised in in the previous reviews by both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 is the interpretation of the experiment in Figure 6 (similar voltage-dependence of currents evoked by slow ramps either in the depolarizing or hyperpolarizing direction) as evidence that the voltage-dependence of “InaR” and “InaP” are the same. In response to the point raised by Reviewer 2 that the hyperpolarizing ramps may be almost all persistent sodium current because the resurgent current may be mostly inactivated before or during the hyperpolarizing ramp, the authors acknowledge this “excellent” point, but this isn’t reflected in the actual manuscript. They have simply added lines 242-242 giving the original interpretation (that depolarizing ramps evoke only InaP and hyperpolarizing ramps InaP plus InaR), with no discussion of the size of the “extra” InaR relative to “InaP or the fact that “InaR” might be mostly inactivated. In fact, the current evoked by the hyperpolarizing ramp is the same magnitude as the depolarizing ramp, which seems most consistent with the idea that resurgent current has been totally inactivated before the hyperpolarizing ramps begins. In that case, ramps in both directions simply measure steady-state persistent current, and there is no justification for using this experimental result as evidence that the voltage-dependence of the resurgent current is the same as persistent current.</p><p>2) A point that may be related: in both the original manuscript and the revised manuscript, it seems that often in referring to measurements of “InaR” – both for experiments and models – the authors are not distinguishing between components of resurgent current and persistent current, and the measurement of “InaR” refers to the combination of both. This is never really made clear in the manuscript, either in Methods or Results. The fact that they may consider “InaR” to refer both to decaying and steady-state components of current is suggested by the author’s response to the issue of the time constant for decay of resurgent current predicted by the Raman-Bean 2001 model. The authors argue that their value of a time constant of 45 ms for the decay of resurgent current at -30 mV predicted by this model was not a mistake, but rather some sort of error in the 2001 paper in reporting a value of 25 ms for the Raman-Bean model (“We are not certain how the value of 25.4 ms reported in Raman and Bean, 2001 was determined.”). In fact, it seems very clear that the difference is that the exponential fit in the Raman-Bean paper is only the decaying part of the current, i.e. decay of the resurgent current to a non-zero steady-state value that reflects InaP. This is clearly stated in that paper, and is clearly illustrated in the fits shown for both the experimental data (Figure 1B) and the results of the model (Figure 8B). To check if the authors’ value of 45 ms could reflect some discrepancy in the actual odelled here and in the 20021 Raman-Bean paper, I digitized the trace the authors include in the Response to Reviews showing their calculation for resurgent current at -30 mV predicted by Raman-Bean model. With crude digitization of the trace, the trace is fit by a time constant is 27 ms, not 45 ms – if the fit allows for the steady-state value of non-decaying current. The authors do not show a fit to their trace, and the trace is truncated before the steady-state is clearly shown, but there is no way the trace is well-fit by an exponential with a time constant of 45 ms. The only way I can see of coming up with a time-constant of 45 msec would be to force a fit that decays to zero, which is clearly inappropriate for a current that decays to a steady-state.</p><p>These are details that do not detract from the main point of the manuscript that resurgent current can be interpreted without invoking an open-channel blocking mechanism. However, readers will benefit by a clear statement about whether and how components of NaR and InaP are distinguished in the various measurements that are reported, both for the experimental data and for both models that are discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors addressed all the questions raised by the reviewers in considerable detail. However, they did not touch the model nor did they revise their interpretation of the model. Therefore, my issues previously raised remain at the core. Below I have tried to clarify my concerns. Taken together the new model is not so different from the Raman and Bean (RandB) model. While it fares better in some aspects, it introduces new issues, especially with InaT inactivation and persistent current. Furthermore, it might be that the RandB model could approximate the new data far better than anticipated here, if only optimized (and maybe tested with a second IF =OB state). Finally, I do not agree with the interpretation that InaT and InaR are two completely distinct identities in their model as outlined below.</p><p>InaT and InaR decay:</p><p>The authors did not follow the implications of my comment. Because of the single open state InaT and InaR must! Decay with the same kinetics. Apparently, they do as shown in Figure 2D at -45mV. The different decay is only due to using different voltages for comparison and of course different behavior of the IF/IS states at different voltages. Therefore InaT and InaR mechanisms are only distinct because of membrane potential (or its history) and not per se. The wording throughout the results part is still not reflecting this matter.</p><p>In addition, in Figure 4B during bulk InaT IS, IF1 and IF2 become all populated quiet fast indicating IS is not a slow inactivated state, just a bit slower at depolarized potentials compared to IF. If stated this way, the new model is not very different from the RandB model. My interpretation of the new model is that at high potentials IF states adsorb fast and dissipate slowly (Figure 4B) while at lower potentials the equilibrium changes and they dissipate fast and do not adsorb (Figure 4B). Note, this is not different from the OB state in the RandB model (despite two IF states here). Second, the IS state is always absorbing and becomes dominant at more negative potentials. Therefore the IS state is not qualitatively different from the inactivated states in the Raman and Bean model. Note how similar the occupancies are in Figure 4A+B (-&gt;IS) vs. Figure 7B (-&gt;I). However, the new model differs in two important aspects, a second IF state and a shortcut from IF to C. Are these additions required? See my comment below.</p><p>Fast inactivation:</p><p>The many inactivation time constants result in a strange looking slow decay component, not compatible with real data. This is becoming obvious in Figure 3H,I green traces. That is a kink in InaT and a slow decrease of InaP presumably due to slow accumulation in IS. Pointing out that three time constants of inactivation (+ transition to C) are likely too much.</p><p>The fit of real data shown for reference in the response of the authors is not convincing, also because all components would not be covered with a single-exponential fit.</p><p>Kinetic scheme:</p><p>I do not agree with the authors here on one point important for the proposed model. In the Raman-Bean model, the blocked state could principally slowly dissipate through an increased persistent current, which is indeed visible in Fig, 7H. If the new data (with or without adding a second IF state to OB) is fitted to the RandB model, is the modified model then capable of fitting the decreased InaR and the data from Figure 8 and therefore not inferior to the proposed model here?</p><p>Differential recovery of InaT and InaR:</p><p>I absolutely agree that two populations of sodium channels could be the cause as pointed out in the discussion. Given that, the arguments brought forward (line 214-233) are becoming void.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70173.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that these results are interesting and compelling, offering a fresh and stimulating perspective and including some significant new experimental data.

Similar to the Raman and Bean (2001) model, the novel model presented produces a persistent sodium current component, reflecting the portion of channels that are not accumulated in the fast-inactivated state during membrane depolarizations.

In general, I<sub>NaP</sub> is very small, compared with I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaR</sub> and, therefore, difficult to measure at depolarized potentials. It is also correct, as this Reviewer suggests, that I<sub>NaP</sub> is variable across cells. It is certainly also possible there is a small contaminating outward current in the recording illustrated in Figure 2A. In our experience, reliable measurement of I<sub>NaP</sub> requires the use of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to isolate the TTX-sensitive currents, which was not done here. It will be interesting to quantify cell-cell variability in the magnitude of I<sub>NaP</sub> and the relative I<sub>NaP</sub> to I<sub>NaR</sub> amplitudes across cells; these analyses, however, will need to be conducted on TTX-subtracted currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the prediction of the open block model on InaR gating at different membrane depolarizations? Adding this Figure (as supplementary) would compare and contrast all of your experimental findings with both models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this interesting question. To respond, we have performed simulated voltage-clamp experiments using the open block model and present the resulting traces below. As is evident, the open block model produced I<sub>NaR</sub> records that are not critically dependent on the voltage of the initial depolarization. Although these findings were initially surprising, further analysis revealed that this is due to the rate constants (used in the open block model) of the O -&gt; OB transition are voltage independent, while the rate constants of the OB -&gt; O transition are voltage dependent. This aspect of the model is surprising given that one important premise of the open-channel block hypothesis is that Nav channels are favored to enter into the open-blocked state at more positive depolarizations and favored to enter into the conventional inactivated state at moderate depolarizations.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Simulations of I<sub>NaR</sub> following membrane depolarizations to different voltages using the open-blocked model.</title><p><italic>Left:</italic> voltage protocol indicating a 0 mV (black), -15 mV (blue), -30 mV (red), -45 mV (green) depolarization for 5 ms from a membrane potential of -90 mV. <italic>Middle</italic>: Simulated Nav current traces. <italic>Right:</italic> A zoomed in view of the simulated Nav currents reveals that the open-blocked model produces resurgent currents quite different from those observed experimentally (Figure 2A); compare with the results of the novel model generated here (Figure 3I).

However, one did not: the plot of decay time constants in Figure 7H. The Raman-Bean paper shows a decay time constant of 25 msec at -30 mV (their Figure 8B), while this plot gives its value as about 45 ms. And the discrepancy seems even greater at -60 mV, where the odelled results in Figure 8A of the Raman-Bean seem to have a time constant of maybe 5 ms, while in Figure 7 H the values in this region are far higher. The authors should check this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this confusing point. Please allow us to clarify. The plots in 7H (Raman-Bean model) and 3F (our model) are not the decay times of the resurgent currents. Rather, these are plots of the normalized peak resurgent currents as a function of the duration of the depolarizing step (prepulse) to +20mV. Thus, as one maintains the depolarizing prepulse to +20 mV for 40 ms, our experimental data (plotted as points in Figures 3F and 7H) reveal that the peak resurgent current, when normalized to the current observed after a 2 ms depolarizing step (to +20mV), decays to ~50% of its maximal value and, in addition, that this result is reproduced in our model (solid line in Figure 3F). In contrast, the Raman-Bean model predicts that there is very little decay of the resurgent current as a function of duration of the depolarizing prepulse (solid line in Figure 7H).</p><p>We also considered that this Reviewer might be referring to Figure 7I in which the I<sub>NaR</sub> decay time constants are plotted as a function of voltage. We double checked the accuracy of this plot and confirmed that the Raman-Bean model is as published in Raman and Bean, 2001. We have replotted Figures 8A and B from that paper, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. As shown in the inserts on the right sides of both panels, we have reproduced the results shown in the original Figures 8A and 8B of Raman and Bean, 2001. The tau of I<sub>NaR</sub> decay (at -30 mV), determined from a single exponential fit to the decay phase of the simulated current, was ~45 ms, in agreement with the results presented in Figure 7I. We are not certain how the value of 25.4 ms reported in Raman and Bean, 2001 was determined.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70173-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major experimental difference between the results here and previous reports is the magnitude of resurgent current relative to transient current. For example, the Raman- Bean gave average values of 6.8 nA for transient current and 193 pA for maximal resurgent current, so resurgent current was ~3% of transient current. Similar values are evident in most of the previous papers from the Raman lab, e.g. the most recent paper by White et al., (2019) gave a mean value of 2.7% for Purkinje neurons from wild-type mice. In contrast, here the authors give experimental values of ~27% (Figure 7F). This seems very surprising and is obviously an important point because it is one of the biggest differences in the predictions of the two models. The authors should at least comment on this difference in the experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this important difference. In the White et al., 2019, as well as in the 1997 and 2001 Raman and Bean manuscripts, the extracellular ACSF used had a 50 mM Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. In our studies, however, we routinely recorded I<sub>NaR</sub> using ACSF with physiological (151 mM) Na<sup>+.</sup> The higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentration results in larger I<sub>NaR</sub>. In addition, there may be space-clamp issues that limit the ability to reliably measure the peak amplitudes of I<sub>NaT</sub> evoked with physiological extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>; both of these technical issues could increase I<sub>NaR</sub>/I<sub>NaT</sub> ratios. Consistent with this hypothesis, Levin and colleagues (2006) reported a I<sub>NaR</sub>/I<sub>NaT</sub> ratio of 15 ± 2 %, i.e., a value substantially higher than the value of 3% reported previously by Raman and Bean (2001). We have now revised the text to highlight that we used a 151 mM external Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (lines 526-527) in most experiments and to note that the Raman Bean model was developed from data derived from experiments using 50 mM NaCl (lines 278-282).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data in Figure 6 is interpreted as showing that the voltage-dependence of persistent and resurgent sodium current are identical. It is not obvious to me that the current during the &quot;reverse&quot; voltage ramp is primarily resurgent current rather than persistent current. In principle, from the authors' earlier results it would be expected that resurgent current would be substantially inactivated by the relatively long time spent at depolarized voltages before the ramp down reaches ~-30 mV where the current is biggest. In contrast, persistent sodium current would not be expected to inactivate. What is the argument that the current during the reverse ramp is mostly resurgent current and not simply mostly persistent current? It is not obvious to me that this experiment would look much different in a cell type that did not have resurgent sodium current.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We agree the long duration of the ”reverse” voltage-ramp is likely to have resulted in inactivation of a substantial portion of I<sub>NaR</sub> prior to the peak I<sub>NaR</sub>. Measuring the non-inactivating portion of the Nav current using ascending and descending voltage ramps, however, was difficult, and ramp protocols with higher dV/dt rates were not successful. We would also point out that the current amplitudes plotted in Figure 6B are similar throughout the voltage range. This is important because the membrane voltage is -10 mV very soon after the onset of the descending voltage ramp (when less inactivation would have taken place) and very late after the onset of the ascending voltage ramp. Additionally, this experiment shows that the non-inactivating Nav current can be evoked from a depolarized potential, consistent with recovery from inactivation into an open/conducting state. We have revised the manuscript (lines 242-244) to highlight these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Dependency of INaR on depolarizing potential and time</p><p>In previous experiments, INaR was slightly dependent on the magnitude of the depolarization step, especially at higher potentials (here it was only tested up to +10mV) (Biophys J. 2001 Feb;80(2):729-37., also own results with β 4 petide). Also if the depolarization step is prolonged, INaR becomes strongly dependent on voltage (Biophys J. 2007 Mar 15;92(6):1938-51, Figure 5B, J Neurosci. 2010 Apr 21;30(16):5629-34.) Therefore, the claims of the authors need more experimental backup.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a more systematic analysis of voltage- and time-dependence of I<sub>NaR</sub> may be useful in further developing/improving the accuracy of the model. However, we do not think that these types of studies will help to determine if I<sub>NaR</sub> is reflective of channels recovering from conventional (fast) inactivation or if the decay of I<sub>NaR</sub> is reflective of Nav channels accumulating into a slow-inactivated state. Our plan is to proceed with experimental studies to directly test the hypothesis put forth in this study, and to use modeling to further refine our predictions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After the consultation session, all reviewers agree that the authors' main finding that the resurgent current can be modeled by a mechanism independent of open-channel block is very relevant and would certainly encourage the field with fresh ideas.

In my opinion, several of the points that were raised in the initial review remain unclear or confusing in the presentation of the manuscript, as discussed below. It seems that several of these reflect an ambiguity about how (or even whether) measurements of &quot;INaR&quot; distinguish between resurgent sodium current and persistent sodium current.</p><p>1) A point that was raised in in the previous reviews by both Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 is the interpretation of the experiment in Figure 6 (similar voltage-dependence of currents evoked by slow ramps either in the depolarizing or hyperpolarizing direction) as evidence that the voltage-dependence of &quot;INaR&quot; and &quot;InaP&quot; are the same. In response to the point raised by Reviewer 2 that the hyperpolarizing ramps may be almost all persistent sodium current because the resurgent current may be mostly inactivated before or during the hyperpolarizing ramp, the authors acknowledge this &quot;excellent&quot; point, but this isn't reflected in the actual manuscript. They have simply added lines 242-242 giving the original interpretation (that depolarizing ramps evoke only INaP and hyperpolarizing ramps INaP plus INaR), with no discussion of the size of the &quot;extra&quot; INaR relative to &quot;INaP or the fact that &quot;INaR&quot; might be mostly inactivated. In fact, the current evoked by the hyperpolarizing ramp is the same magnitude as the depolarizing ramp, which seems most consistent with the idea that resurgent current has been totally inactivated before the hyperpolarizing ramps begins. In that case, ramps in both directions simply measure steady-state persistent current, and there is no justification for using this experimental result as evidence that the voltage-dependence of the resurgent current is the same as persistent current.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have added a section to the Methods section titled “Measurement of I<sub>NaT</sub>, I<sub>NaR</sub>, and I<sub>NaP</sub>” (lines 548-582). We have also added a statement to the Results section (where the experiment illustrated in Figure 6 is described) noting that I<sub>NaR</sub> is inactivating during the hyperpolarizing ramp (lines 245-247).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A point that may be related: in both the original manuscript and the revised manuscript, it seems that often in referring to measurements of &quot;INaR&quot; – both for experiments and models – the authors are not distinguishing between components of resurgent current and persistent current, and the measurement of &quot;INaR&quot; refers to the combination of both. This is never really made clear in the manuscript, either in Methods or Results. The fact that they may consider &quot;INaR&quot; to refer both to decaying and steady-state components of current is suggested by the author's response to the issue of the time constant for decay of resurgent current predicted by the Raman-Bean 2001 model. The authors argue that their value of a time constant of 45 ms for the decay of resurgent current at -30 mV predicted by this model was not a mistake, but rather some sort of error in the 2001 paper in reporting a value of 25 ms for the Raman-Bean model (&quot;We are not certain how the value of 25.4 ms reported in Raman and Bean, 2001 was determined.&quot;). In fact, it seems very clear that the difference is that the exponential fit in the Raman-Bean paper is only the decaying part of the current, i.e. decay of the resurgent current to a non-zero steady-state value that reflects INaP. This is clearly stated in that paper, and is clearly illustrated in the fits shown for both the experimental data (Figure 1B) and the results of the model (Figure 8B). To check if the authors' value of 45 ms could reflect some discrepancy in the actual modeling here and in the 20021 Raman-Bean paper, I digitized the trace the authors include in the Response to Reviews showing their calculation for resurgent current at -30 mV predicted by Raman-Bean model. With crude digitization of the trace, the trace is fit by a time constant is 27 ms, not 45 ms – if the fit allows for the steady-state value of non-decaying current. The authors do not show a fit to their trace, and the trace is truncated before the steady-state is clearly shown, but there is no way the trace is well-fit by an exponential with a time constant of 45 ms. The only way I can see of coming up with a time-constant of 45 msec would be to force a fit that decays to zero, which is clearly inappropriate for a current that decays to a steady-state.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point again. After reading your comments, we reexamined the data plotted in Figure 7I, and determined that we had made an error by neglecting to subtract I<sub>NaP</sub>, affecting our measurements of rate of I<sub>NaR</sub> decay. We have corrected this error, subtracting I<sub>NaP</sub> prior to calculating the decay taus. We have revised Figure 7I to reflect the corrected analyses. Thank you again.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These are details that do not detract from the main point of the manuscript that resurgent current can be interpreted without invoking an open-channel blocking mechanism.

As noted above, we have now added a section to the Methods (lines 548-582) to clarify how we measured I<sub>NaR</sub> and I<sub>NaP</sub> in the experimental and modeling studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors addressed all the questions raised by the reviewers in considerable detail. However, they did not touch the model nor did they revise their interpretation of the model. Therefore, my issues previously raised remain at the core. Below I have tried to clarify my concerns. Taken together the new model is not so different from the Raman and Bean (RandB) model. While it fares better in some aspects, it introduces new issues, especially with INaT inactivation and persistent current. Furthermore, it might be that the RandB model could approximate the new data far better than anticipated here, if only optimized (and maybe tested with a second IF =OB state). Finally, I do not agree with the interpretation that INaT and INaR are two completely distinct identities in their model as outlined below.</p><p>INaT and INaR decay:</p><p>The authors did not follow the implications of my comment. Because of the single open state INaT and INaR must! decay with the same kinetics. Apparently, they do as shown in Figure 2D at -45mV. The different decay is only due to using different voltages for comparison and of course different behavior of the IF/IS states at different voltages. Therefore INaT and INaR mechanisms are only distinct because of membrane potential (or its history) and not per se. The wording throughout the results part is still not reflecting this matter.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that adherence to a single time constant of decay would only be relevant if there were only a single conducting state and a single non-conducting state (two kinetic states total). With more than one non-conducting state, such as in our model and the Raman-Bean model, multiple components of decay from a single open state are possible and often observed. In Raman and Bean, 2001, for example, bi-exponential decay of the Nav currents in Purkinje neurons was shown experimentally (see Figure 4), observations that are consistent with our experimental and modeling results here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, in Figure 4B during bulk INaT IS, IF1 and IF2 become all populated quiet fast indicating IS is not a slow inactivated state, just a bit slower at depolarized potentials compared to IF. If stated this way, the new model is not very different from the RandB model. My interpretation of the new model is that at high potentials IF states adsorb fast and dissipate slowly (Figure 4B) while at lower potentials the equilibrium changes and they dissipate fast and do not adsorb (Figure 4B). Note, this is not different from the OB state in the RandB model (despite two IF states here). Second, the IS state is always absorbing and becomes dominant at more negative potentials. Therefore the IS state is not qualitatively different from the inactivated states in the Raman and Bean model. Note how similar the occupancies are in Figure 4A+B (-&gt;IS) vs. Figure 7B (-&gt;I). However, the new model differs in two important aspects, a second IF state and a shortcut from IF to C. Are these additions required? See my comment below.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to re-iterate that our goal was not to identify inadequacies in the Raman-Bean model. Also, as indicated in the manuscript, we did not construct our model using the Raman-Bean model as a template. Rather, we constructed our model using our experimental data as constraints, and we developed a Markov model with parallel inactivation pathways that fit our experimental data well. We are presenting these experimental and modeling results to show that it is possible to generate I<sub>NaR</sub> in the absence of an open-channel blocking step/mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fast inactivation:</p><p>The many inactivation time constants result in a strange looking slow decay component, not compatible with real data. This is becoming obvious in Figure 3H,I green traces. That is a kink in INaT and a slow decrease of INaP presumably due to slow accumulation in IS.

In the Raman-Bean model, the blocked state could principally slowly dissipate through an increased persistent current, which is indeed visible in Fig, 7H. If the new data (with or without adding a second IF state to OB) is fitted to the RandB model, is the modified model then capable of fitting the decreased INaR and the data from Figure 8 and therefore not inferior to the proposed model here?</p></disp-quote><p>It is certainly possible (indeed likely) that adding states to the Raman-Bean model would allow us to better fit the model to our experimental data. Also, as you mention, it is possible that Nav channels may dissipate from the OB state into a slow-inactivated state. As indicated previously, however, our intention was not to revise or correct the Raman-Bean model. Rather, our objective was to explore the possibility that another mechanism could account for the gating of I<sub>NaR</sub>. We think these efforts are highly relevant and will be of considerable interest given that the targeted deletion of key candidate blocking particles does not abolish I<sub>NaR</sub> (see Ransdell et al., 2017, White et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Differential recovery of INaT and INaR:</p><p>I absolutely agree that two populations of sodium channels could be the cause as pointed out in the discussion.
