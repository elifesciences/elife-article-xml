Acrosome biogenesis requires the dynamic cytoskeletal shuttling of vesicles toward nascent acrosome which is regulated by a series of accessory proteins. However, much remains unknown about the molecular basis underlying this process. Here, we generated <italic>Ssh2</italic> knockout (KO) mice and HA-tagged <italic>Ssh2</italic> knock-in (KI) mice to define the functions of Slingshot phosphatase 2 (SSH2) in spermatogenesis and demonstrated that as a regulator of actin remodeling, SSH2 is essential for acrosome biogenesis and male fertility. In <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO males, spermatogenesis was arrested at the early spermatid stage with increased apoptotic index and the impaired acrosome biogenesis was characterized by defective transport/fusion of proacrosomal vesicles. Moreover, disorganized F-actin structures accompanied by excessive phosphorylation of COFILIN were observed in the testes of <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO mice. Collectively, our data reveal a modulatory role for SSH2 in acrosome biogenesis through COFILIN-mediated actin remodeling and the indispensability of this phosphatase in male fertility in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>Ssh2</kwd><kwd>actin remodeling</kwd><kwd>acrosome biogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

cause of non-obstructive azoospermia is impaired spermatogenesis (i.e., the production of mature spermatozoa), which is behind about 15% of infertility cases in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2021</xref>). In basic studies of mice, spermatogenesis—a continuous course to generate spermatozoa within the seminiferous epithelia incorporating the mitosis of undifferentiated spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocytes, and eventually spermatid cytodifferentiation—is routinely subdivided into 12 stages of developmental progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meistrich and Hess, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oakberg, 1956</xref>). Note that the sub-process through which post-meiotic spermatids develop into mature spermatozoa is termed ‘spermiogenesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao and Bedford, 2016</xref>), which is marked by a series of cellular remodeling events that include chromatin condensation, flagellum formation, elimination of redundant cytoplasm, and biogenesis of the acrosome—an acidic, membranous organelle positioned over the anterior part of the sperm nucleus that functions in fertilization of the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moreno and Alvarado, 2006</xref>). The transformation of round spermatids involves the cytoskeletal system, especially microfilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soda et al., 2020</xref>), which shuttles protein and vesicles to the nascent acrosome via dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling orchestrated by various accessory proteins such as the actin-binding protein PROFILIN-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Umer et al., 2021</xref>). Notwithstanding some advancements in acrosome biogenesis have been achieved, much of the molecular basis underlying the engagement of actin organization orchestration in this process still need to be investigated.</p><p>Typically, the formation of the acrosome, which is characterized by the generation, trafficking, and fusion of vesicles that harbor the essential acrosomal components such as hydrolytic enzymes and proteases involved in the acrosome reaction, occurs simultaneously with the process of 16-step spermatid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teves et al., 2020</xref>) that has been well documented morphologically. According to the classical descriptions of acrosome biogenesis that follows four sequential phases (the Golgi phase, cap phase, acrosome phase, and maturation phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clermont and Leblond, 1955</xref>), the nascent acrosome is sequentially assembled from the so-called proacrosomal vesicles that originate from the Golgi apparatus through the biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khawar et al., 2019</xref>). However, recent experimental findings have implicated some other cellular components (e.g., the endocytic machinery) in vesicular trafficking toward the growing acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berruti and Paiardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2006</xref>), supporting the existence of an extra-Golgi supply of proacrosomal vesicles. Notably, the role of filamentous actin (F-actin) as a cytoskeletal transport platform for proacrosomal vesicles has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kierszenbaum et al., 2003b</xref>). In addition, several Golgi-associated proteins are known to function in the transport/fusion of proacrosomal vesicles, including Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing protein (GOPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yao et al., 2002</xref>), protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>), and Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM130) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, the contribution of the autophagic machinery in Golgi-derived proacrosomal vesicle trafficking has been identified by germ cell-specific <italic>Atg7</italic>-KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>) and <italic>Sirt1</italic>-KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) mouse models, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms through which the acrosome develops.</p><p>As an actin-binding protein, COFILIN is widely known for its cutting and depolymerizing functions that promote the subsequent remodeling of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wioland et al., 2017</xref>), which is required for many actin-driven events such as mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 2002</xref>) and organelle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cichon et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, COFILIN was also found to stimulate actin nucleation at a high COFILIN/actin concentration ratio, which in turn favors actin filament assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>). It follows that the complex modulation of COFILIN activity, consisting of post-translational modifications, protein binding, and redox reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Namme et al., 2021</xref>), enables the proper rearrangement of F-actin organization in response to various extracellular stimuli. Among these regulatory mechanisms, the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at the Ser-3 residue stands out as the most crucial. Phosphorylation-mediated inactivation by LIM domain kinases (LIMKs) prevents COFILIN’s actin remodeling functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arber et al., 1998</xref>), whereas activating dephosphorylation of COFILIN is catalyzed by phosphatases such as chronophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gohla et al., 2005</xref>) and the Slingshot (SSH) family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niwa et al., 2002</xref>). Several studies have reported the cofilin phospho-regulation of diverse cellular processes including cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishita et al., 2005</xref>), cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaji et al., 2003</xref>), and germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The ssh gene was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants with the bifurcation phenotype of bristles and hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niwa et al., 2002</xref>), and the mammalian homologs encode a set of COFILIN phosphatases, namely the SSH phosphatases. Some biological relevance of SSHs has been revealed, especially the most well-characterized isoform SSH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bielig et al., 2014</xref>), while much less is known about SSH2 other than its role as a regulator of actin remodeling during neutrophil chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). According to a gene-expression study focusing on the SSHs, relatively higher expression of SSH2 was observed in testes compared to other organs in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohta et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, in the light of a recent proteomic study which is aiming at the prediction of meiosis-essential genes, SSH2 exhibited increasing protein abundance changes with the proceeding of murine spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2021</xref>), illustrating its potential role in male germ cell development. By generating mice carrying targeted knockout (KO) of <italic>Ssh2</italic> and knock-in (KI) mice expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SSH2, we found that SSH2 is an activator of COFILIN-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling and is essential for proper acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis and thus required for male fertility.

Another line of evidence linking COFILIN to apoptosis comes from the investigations performed in cell context. Treating A549 cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, also induces apoptosis through the inhibition of COFILIN-mediated F-actin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>). Elevated COFILIN phosphorylation after SSH2 knockdown was previously demonstrated to induce the activation of Caspase-3/7 in a human renal cell carcinoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), and activation of Caspase-3/7 is known to trigger apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saller et al., 2010</xref>).

Notably, defective acroplaxome structures with impaired acrosome biogenesis were observed in mutant spermatids lacking homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crapster et al., 2020</xref>), which is responsible for the regulation of F-actin remodeling during spermiogenesis. We infer from these findings that acrosome biogenesis in <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO mice might also be affected by the acroplaxome defects that result from disordered F-actin remodeling, and further experiments should be performed to confirm this.</p><p>Given the diverse physiological roles reported for Slingshot family proteins, the possibility of an alternative mechanism underlying the involvement of SSH2 in cellular events beyond the COFILIN-mediated actin remodeling should be noted. According to some publicly accessible databases as the indicators of potential protein-protein interactions such as BioGRID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oughtred et al., 2019</xref>) and IntAct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Del Toro et al., 2022</xref>), SSH2 might interact with a set of actin-based molecular motors covering MYH9, MYO19, and MYO18A, which have been implicated in the maintenance of Golgi morphology and Golgi anterograde vesicular trafficking via the PI4P/GOLPH3/MYO18A/F-actin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rahajeng et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it is intriguing to note that the phenotypes of <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO mice share a lot of similarities with that of <italic>Pick1</italic> KO model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2009</xref>) such as acrosome fragmentation and enhanced germ cell apoptosis, suggesting the possibility that SSH2 and PICK1 work together in the same trafficking machinery functioning in acrosome biogenesis which needs to be clarified further.</p><p>In conclusion, our study confirms the requirement for SSH2 during mammalian spermatogenesis, specifically in acrosomal biogenesis. The Slingshot family is evolutionarily conserved in mammals, therefore we believe that some mutations in the <italic>SSH2</italic> gene should exist in non-obstructive azoospermia, although no report was published yet that highlighting such mutation. The abnormal phenotype <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO in the mouse model may be valuable to understand the pathological factors causing azoospermia in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals used in this study were housed under controlled environmental conditions with 12 hr light cycles and free access to pathogen-free water and food.

We indicated the actin cytoskeleton which is the rhodamine phalloidin in the panels of Figure 5B in the originally submitted manuscript, namely “the representative images of Phalloidin staining performed on tubule squashes”. To clarify, we have now highlighted the mark of Phalloidin and added some indicators regarding the structures of disorganized F-actin in the images of a new Figure 5B in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, we have replaced the images of Phalloidin staining on tubule squashes with more representative ones in Figure 5B in the revised manuscript which demonstrated clearly that actin filament remodeling is disrupted in the round spermatids of <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO mice and solidified the conclusion that the actin remodeling was disordered in <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO spermatids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide EM analyses of the round spermatids to detect the cytoplasmic distribution of actin filaments in the wild type and disrupted actin filament remodeling in KO mice, if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Previously we already have conducted a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis on the testes samples to discover the distribution and ultrastructural organization of F-actin in WT and <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO round spermatids. Unfortunately, even at high magnification (30,000x, right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) by TEM of the testicular section no diminutive actin filament was observed in the cytoplasm of round spermatids except for the acroplaxome-an actin-rich specialized structure anchors the acrosome-in WT spermatids as well as some thick bundle-like structures located at the acrosomal region of <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). According to their unique characteristic of appearance, we interpreted these electron-dense bundles as the aberrantly aggregated actin filaments whose lengths are in accordance with the lengths of COFILIN-saturated F-actin fragments (Bamburg, Minamide, Wiggan, Tahtamouni, and Kuhn, 2021), suggesting the disrupted actin filament remodeling during acrosome biogenesis resulted from <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO. However, due to the technological limitations of TEM and the complexity of the intracellular environment of round spermatids, we only recognized a few aggregated actin bundles with the loss of filamentous appearance in <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO spermatids and no typical diminutive actin filament was detected which had been imaged under high-resolution cryo-TEM (Haviv, Gov, Ideses, and Bernheim-Groswasser, 2008) or live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (Johnson et al., 2015) on the purified actin bundles and cultured cells. Given the lack of effective approaches to culture murine round spermatids in vitro, confocal microscopy of flourescence-labelled F-actin (<italic>e.g.</italic>, IF staining by FITC-phalloidin) is a more accessible method for visualizing the disruption of actin remodeling than EM in murine spermatids as the actin-related findings that several other studies demonstrated (Djuzenova et al., 2015).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representative images of ultrastructural analysis of actin organization in WT and <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO spermatids.</title><p>No intact F-actin structure was observed in WT round spermatids with few aggregated actin bundles (as red arrowheads indicated) detected in <italic>Ssh2</italic> KO spermatids under TEM.
