The asymmetry defects of oocytes will lead to the failure of fertilization and embryo implantation. In present study, we reported that an actin nucleating factor Formin-like 2 (FMNL2) played critical roles in the regulation of spindle migration and organelle distribution in mouse and porcine oocytes. Our results showed that FMNL2 mainly localized at the oocyte cortex and periphery of spindle. Depletion of FMNL2 led to the failure of polar body extrusion and large polar bodies in oocytes. Live-cell imaging revealed that the spindle failed to migrate to the oocyte cortex, which caused polar body formation defects, and this might be due to the decreased polymerization of cytoplasmic actin by FMNL2 depletion in the oocytes of both mice and pigs. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that FMNL2 was associated with mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins, and FMNL2 depletion disrupted the function and distribution of mitochondria and ER, showing with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and the occurrence of ER stress. Microinjecting <italic>Fmnl2-EGFP</italic> mRNA into FMNL2-depleted oocytes significantly rescued these defects. Thus, our results indicate that FMNL2 is essential for the actin assembly, which further involves into meiotic spindle migration and ER/mitochondria functions in mammalian oocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>formin</kwd><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Pig</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023YFD1300502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Shao-Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Shao-Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023YFD1300502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Shao-Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KYT2023002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Shao-Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Shao-Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>FMNL2 associates with Formin2 and Arp2/3 complex for actin assembly, which further regulates spindle migration and INF2/Cofilin-related organelle dynamics during mammalian oocyte maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian oocyte maturation is an asymmetric division process that generates a large egg and a small polar body. This asymmetry is critical for the following fertilization and early embryo development. After germinal vesicle breakdown, the meiotic spindle is organized at the center of the oocyte, and then it migrates to the oocyte cortex at the late metaphase I (MI). The oocytes are arrested at metaphase II (MII) after the extrusion of first polar body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan and Li, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yi et al., 2013a</xref>). Actin filaments, as the most widely distributed cytoskeleton in cells, regulate various dynamic events during oocyte meiotic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sun and Schatten, 2006</xref>), and two key events are the spindle migration and cortical reorganization in mammalian oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duan and Sun, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sun and Kim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yi et al., 2013a</xref>). Small GTPases and actin nucleation factors are shown to promote the assembly and function of actin. The actin nucleation factors are the molecules that directly promote the actin assembly: Arp2/3 complex control the assembly of branched actin, and formin family member Formin2 (FMN2) and Spire1/2 control the assembly of linear actin. These proteins are all proposed to play a role in actin-related spindle migration and cytokinesis during mammalian oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yi et al., 2013b</xref>). The cortex protein Arp2/3 complex nucleates the actin to produce a hydrodynamic force to move the spindle toward the cortex, and regulates cytokinesis during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yi et al., 2013a</xref>). FMN2 and Spire1/2 nucleates actin around the spindle in the cytoplasm to give the meiotic spindle an initial power for migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pfender et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Besides Formin2, the DRFs (diaphanous-related formins) subfamily in the formin family has been extensively studied. The DRFs family consists of mDia, Daam, FHOD, and FMNLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">KÃ¼hn and Geyer, 2014</xref>). The âFormin-likeâ proteins (FMNLs) subfamily includes FMNL1 (FRL1), FMNL2 (FRL3), and FMNL3 (FRL2). Like other Formin family proteins, FMNLs play important roles in cell migration, cell division, and cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Katoh and Katoh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">KÃ¼hn and Geyer, 2014</xref>). While FMNL2 is widely expressed in multiple human tissues, especially in the gastrointestinal and mammary epithelia, lymphatic tissues, placenta, and reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gardberg et al., 2010</xref>). As an important actin assembly factor, FMNL2 accelerates the elongation of actin filaments branched by Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kage et al., 2017</xref>). In invasive cells, FMNL2 is mainly localized in the leading edge of the cell, lamellipodia and filopodia tips, to improve cell migration ability by actin-based manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Block et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>). FMNL2 is also involved in the maintenance of epithelialâmesenchymal transition in human colorectal carcinoma cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Besides its roles on the actin assembly, emerging evidences indicate that FMNL2 may interact with organelle dynamics. It is shown that FMNL2 is related with the Golgi apparatus, since the absence of FMNL2/3 can cause the Golgi fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kage et al., 2019</xref>). However, till now the roles of FMNLs especially FMNL2 on oocyte meiosis are still largely unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we disturbed the FMNL2 expression and explored the roles of FMNL2 during mouse and porcine oocyte meiosis. Our results showed that FMNL2 was essential for the polar body size control and successful extrusion; and these abnormal phenotypes might be due to aberrant actin-based meiotic spindle migration. Meanwhile, we also found that FMNL2 was essential for the functions and distribution of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, this study provided the evidence for the critical roles of FMNL2-mediated actin on spindle movement and organelle dynamics in mammalian oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression and subcellular localization of FMNL2 during oocyte maturation</title><p>To examine FMNL2 expression and localization in mouse oocytes at different stages, western blotting, mRNA microinjection, and immunofluorescence staining were performed on freshly isolated germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes and oocytes cultured for 4, 8, and 12 hr, corresponding to germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), MI, and MII stages, respectively. The results indicated that FMNL2 all expressed in GV, MI, and MII stages during mouse oocyte maturation (GV, 1; MI, 0.82 Â± 0.07; MII, 0.61 Â± 0.10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>Fmnl2-EGFP</italic> mRNA microinjection showed that FMNL2 accumulated at the oocyte cortex during the GV, GVBD MI, and MII stages. Besides, FMNL2 also localized at the spindle periphery during MI stages. The FMNL2 antibody staining results also confirmed this localization pattern. In addition, we co-stained FMNL2 antibody with F-actin, and the results revealed that both FMNL2 and F-actin are localized in the cortex region of oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar localization was also found in porcine oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

A significant decrease of FMNL2 protein level was shown in FMNL2-KD oocytes compared to control group by western blot (1 vs. 0.48 Â± 0.08, p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then cultured the oocytes in vitro for 12 hr and examined the maturation of oocytes, and the results indicated that knockdown of FMNL2 had an impact on the extrusion of the first polar body. Moreover, a significant proportion of oocytes exhibited larger polar bodies upon extrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on the size of the extruded polar bodies, those with a diameter exceeding one-third of the oocyteâs diameter were categorized as large polar bodies. Consequently, we proceeded to calculate the rates of polar body extrusion and the generation of large polar bodies in the oocytes. The quantitative results also confirmed this phenotype (rate of polar body extrusion: 74.26 Â± 1.44%, <italic>n</italic> = 439 vs. 59.5 Â± 2.82%, <italic>n</italic> = 398, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; rate of large polar bodies: 19.05 Â± 1.97%, <italic>n</italic> = 311 vs. 37.16 Â± 1.87%, <italic>n</italic> = 257, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, live-cell imaging was used to determine the dynamic changes that occurred during oocyte maturation, and the results showed that the oocytes either failed to undergo cytokinesis or divided from the central axis of the oocytes and formed big polar bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To further confirm the phenotype, we performed FMNL2 rescue experiments by expressing exogenous <italic>Fmnl2</italic> mRNA in FMNL2-depleted oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), we found that exogenous <italic>Fmnl2</italic> mRNA expression rescued first polar body extrusion and large polar body defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The quantitative results also confirmed this phenotype (rate of polar body extrusion: 48.34 Â± 4.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 355 vs. 62.62 Â± 3.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 377, p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; rate of large polar bodies: 30.93 Â± 2%, <italic>n</italic> = 193 vs. 9.58 Â± 2.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 203, p &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). It is known that knockdown of FMNL3 leads to inhibition of oocyte maturation. To investigate whether FMNL2 exhibits an additive effect with FMNL3 in terms of functionality, we simultaneously knocked down both FMNL2 and FMNL3. The results demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of the two FMNL proteins, compared to the control group, resulted in a decrease in oocyte maturation rate. However, when compared to the single knockdown of <italic>Fmnl2</italic>, the double knockdown of FMNL2 and FMNL3 did not cause more severe defects in polar body extrusion (polar body extrusion, Control: 70.97 Â± 1.23%, <italic>n</italic> = 261 vs. FMNL2 + 3-KD: 60.42 Â± 2.99%, <italic>n</italic> = 198, p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>; large polar body, Control: 10.85 Â± 0.97%, <italic>n</italic> = 172 vs. FMNL2 + 3-KD: 32.90 Â± 1.88%, <italic>n</italic> = 118, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). These results suggested that FMNL2 played critical roles for the polar body extrusion and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte maturation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of FMNL2 affects first polar body extrusion and asymmetric division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis for FMNL2 expression in the FMNL2-KD group and control group.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, in the control oocyte, the meiotic spindle formed in the center of the oocyte after culture 8 hr and moved to the oocyte cortex at 9.5 hr; and the polar body was extruded at 11â12 hr, with a spindle formed near the cortex at MII stage. However, in FMNL2-KD oocytes, two phenotypes were observed: (1) the meiotic spindle remained in the center of the oocyte until 10 hr, and then the oocytes initiated the cytokinesis at 10.5 hr but failed to extrude the polar body; (2) some oocytes with arrested spindles initiated the cytokinesis but extruded a big polar body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This indicated the failure of spindle migration after FMNL2 depletion. We analyzed the rate of cortex-localized spindle in oocytes by cultured for 9.5 hr, and the result showed that the rate of migrated spindles in control oocytes was significantly higher than that in FMNL2-KD oocytes (59.94 Â± 3.42%, <italic>n</italic> = 78 vs. 38.97 Â± 6.34%, <italic>n</italic> = 64, p &lt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Based on the localization pattern of FMNL2, we speculated that the functions of FMNL2 might be also involved in actin-related process during mouse oocyte meiosis.</p><p>To confirm our hypothesis, we depleted FMNL2 protein expression and we found that absence of FMNL2 caused the aberrant first polar body extrusion. The oocytes either failed to form the polar body or extruded large polar bodies. These phenotypes caused by FMNL2 depletion are similar to the other actin-related proteins during oocyte maturation such as Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yi et al., 2011</xref>) and FMN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dumont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leader et al., 2002</xref>). We next examined the actin distribution in oocytes since it is reported that FMNL2 promotes actin filament assembly in many models. FMNL2 is required for cellâcell adhesion formation by regulating the actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grikscheit et al., 2015</xref>), and FMNL2 could directly drives actin elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Block et al., 2012</xref>). In CRC cells, cortactin bind to FMNL2 to active the actin polymerization, and FMNL2 is important for invadopodia formation and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ren et al., 2018</xref>). Our results showed that the FMNL2 depletion caused significantly decrease in cytoplasmic actin, indicating the conserved roles of FMNL2 on actin assembly in mammalian oocyte model. Other Formin family proteins such as Daam1, FHOD1, and Formin-homology family protein mDia1 are also reported to affect oocyte meiosis by regulating actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We then tried to explore how FMNL2 involves into the actin assembly in oocytes. Mass spectrometry analysis data indicated that FMNL2 associated with several actin-related proteins, and we found that a potential association between FMNL2 and Arp2/Formin2. This could be confirmed by the altered expression of these two molecules after FMNL2 depletion. Therefore, we speculated FMNL2 could regulate cytoplasmic actin assembly in oocytes through the association with Formin2 since it is reported to be an important protein for cytoplasmic actin assembly in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dumont et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, our results showed that unlike the reduction of cytoplasmic actin, cortex actin was not affected by the absence of FMNL2. We speculate that FMNL2 and Arp2/3 both contribute to the cortex actin dynamics, when FMNL2 decreases, ARP2 increases to compensate for this, which maintains the cortex actin level. As an actin nucleator Arp2/3 complex localizes at the cortex and is essential for actin polymerization during oocyte meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). These results suggested that FMNL2 might be involved in cytokinesis and asymmetric division by regulating actin assembly during mouse oocyte maturation.</p><p>The spindle migration is a key step in ensuring the asymmetric division for oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunet and Maro, 2005</xref>). In mitosis, spindle position is decided by cortical actin and astral microtubules; in contrast, spindle migration is mainly mediated by actin filaments during oocyte meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunet and Maro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reinsch and GÃ¶nczy, 1998</xref>). Due to the effects of FMNL2 on asymmetric division and cytoplasmic actin, we analyzed the spindle positioning at late MI, we found that the spindle migration was disturbed after FMNL2 depletion, no matter the cytokinesis occurred or not. Several formin proteins are shown to regulate spindle migration during oocytes meiosis. For example, FMN2 nucleates actin surrounding the spindle, pushing force generated by actin to trigger the spindle migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dumont et al., 2007</xref>), and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) induces cytoplasmic Formin-mediated F-actin polymerization to propel the spindle into the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous studies also showed that absence of the formin family member FMNL1 or FHOD1 could lead to the decrease of cytoplasmic actin to prevent the spindle migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). We speculated that FMNL2 together with other Formin proteins, conservatively regulate actin-mediated spindle migration during oocyte meiosis.</p><p>Another important finding is that through the mass spectrometry analysis we found many candidate proteins which were related with ER, and our results indicated that FMNL2 was essential for the maintenance of ER distribution in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the loss of FMNL2-induced ER stress, showing with altered expression of GRP78 and CHOP. Proper distribution of ER is important for the oocyte quality. ER displays a homogeneous distribution pattern throughout the entire ooplasm during development of oocytes and embryos from diabetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). During the transition of mouse oocytes from MI to MII phase, actin regulates cortical ER aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">FitzHarris et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, Formin2 is shown to colocalize with the ER during oocyte meiosis and the ER-associated Formin2 at the spindle periphery is required for MI chromosome migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yi et al., 2013b</xref>). In our results, we showed that FMNL2 associated with INF2 protein in oocytes. INF2 is an ER-associated protein, and the expression of GFP-INF2 which containing DAD/WH2 mutations causes the ER to collapse around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chhabra et al., 2009</xref>). We concluded that FMNL2 might regulate INF2 for the distribution of ER in cytoplasm of oocytes.</p><p>Besides its roles of ER distribution, it is shown that INF2 also affects mitochondrial length and ERâmitochondrial interaction in an actin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chhabra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>). It is shown that INF2 regulates Drp1 for mitochondrial fission, and INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows Drp1-driven secondary constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ji et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we also found many candidate proteins which were related with mitochondria from mass spectrometry analysis. During oocyte meiosis, mitochondria gradually accumulated around the spindle after GVBD, and the spindle-peripheral FMN2 and its actin nucleation activity are important for the accumulation of mitochondria in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duan et al., 2020</xref>). Our results found that FMNL2 depletion caused agglutination of mitochondria and altered MMP level in the cytoplasm, indicating its roles on the mitochondria distribution and functions. Another formin protein mDia1 is shown to be necessary to induce the anchoring of mitochondria along the cytoskeletal in mammalian CV-1 cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> BG2-C2 neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Minin et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the formin interaction protein Spire1C binds INF2 to promote actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces, and Spire1C disruption could reduce mitochondrial constriction and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manor et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, our result indicated that cofilin expression decreased in FMNL2-depletion oocytes. Cofilin is an actin-depolymerizing factor and its localization at the mitochondrial fission site is crucial for inducing mitochondrial fission and mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Depleting of cofilin resulted in abnormal interconnection and elongation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Together with its roles on ER, these data indicated that FMNL2 might associate with INF2 and cofilin for the actin-based organelle distribution during oocyte meiosis.</p><p>Collectively, we provide a body of evidence showing that FMNL2 associates with Formin2 and Arp2/3 complex for actin assembly, which further regulates spindle migration and INF2/Cofilin-related organelle dynamics during mammalian oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and chemicals</title><p>Rabbit monoclonal anti-FMNL2 antibody, rabbit monoclonal anti-Arp2 antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-profilin1 antibody were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

However, some comments were not addressed convincingly.</p><p>My concern is still valid. The authors used only one approach to knockdown FMNL2 which is &quot;siRNA-mediated knockdown&quot;. Using an additional approach to inhibit FMNL2 (Trim-Away or morpholino,..) would be beneficial to confirm that the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of FMNL2 is specific.</p><p>Response 1: In the author's response, they mentioned that successful migration was quantified based on the contact between the spindle pole and the oocyte cortex.</p><p>After spindle migration, it is very common for the spindle to be close to (but not in contact with) the cortex for a considerable time. The spindle pole comes in contact with the cortex later (just before anaphase onset and polar body extrusion). Fig. 3A shows an example where at 9 h, the spindle is already migrated but did not come in contact with the cortex until 9:30 h. Based on Fig. 3B,C, the authors assessed spindle migration in fixed oocytes, making it impossible to fix all oocytes at the time of spindle contact with the cortex. Also,</p><p>the representative images in Fig. 3C do not show spindle staining to assess the contact between the spindle and the cortex.</p><p>Overall, I still believe that the distance between the spindle and the cortex is more accurate for quantifying spindle migration.</p><p>Response 2: The authors mentioned, &quot;we made appropriate modifications to the relevant descriptions of immunoprecipitation experiments&quot;. I can't find these modifications in the manuscript. The authors need to state clearly that the immunoprecipitation results do not necessarily reflect meiotic oocytes specifically because these experiments were done using the whole ovary which contains both somatic cells and oocytes.</p><p>Response 5: The authors mentioned that &quot;Based on our observations, during the extrusion of the first polar body in oocytes, there is a temporary occurrence of cellular morphological fragmentation due to cortical reorganization&quot;. Unfortunately, this means that the live imaging system in the authors' laboratory is not ideal for oocyte maturation. Several publications show normal oocyte morphology during cytokinesis.

We regret the oversight of omitting critical information in the manuscript.

Please find our details responses in the âRecommendations for the authorsâ part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This research involves conducting experiments to determine the role of Fmnl2 during oocyte meiosis I.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Identifying the role of Fmnl2 during oocyte meiosis I is significant.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The quantitative analysis and the used approach to perturb FMNL2 function are currently incomplete and would benefit from more confirmatory approaches and rigorous analysis.</p><p>(1) Most of the results are expected. The new finding here is that FMNL2 regulates cytoplasmic F-actin in mouse oocytes, which is also expected given the role of FMNL2 in other cell types. Given that FMNL2 regulates cytoplasmic F-actin, it is very expected to see all the observed phenotypes. It is already established that F-actin is required for spindle migration to the oocyte cortex, extruding a small polar body and normal organelle distribution and functions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. In the recent decade, Arp2/3 complex (Nat Cell Biol 2011), Formin2 (Nat Cell Biol 2002, Nat Commun 2020), and Spire (Curr Biol 2011) were reported to be 3 key factors to involve into this process. These factors regulate actin filaments in different ways. However, how they cross with each other for the subcellular events were still fully clear. Our current study identified that FMNL2 played a critical role in coordinating these molecules for actin assembly in oocytes. Our findings demonstrate that FMNL2 interacts with both the Arp2/3 complex and Formin2 to facilitate actin-based meiotic spindle migration. Additionally, we discovered a novel role for FMNL2 in determining the distribution and function of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, which may in turn influence meiotic spindle migration in oocytes. Our results not only uncover the novel functions of FMNL2-mediated actin for organelle distribution, but also extend our understanding of the molecular basis for the unique meiotic spindle migration in oocyte meiosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors used Fmnl2 cRNA to rescue the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Fmnl2. It is not clear how this works. It is expected that the siRNA will also target the exogenous cRNA construct (which should have the same sequence as endogenous Fmnl2) especially when both of them were injected at the same time. Is this construct mutated to be resistant to the siRNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. We regret any misunderstanding that may have been caused by the inappropriate description in our manuscript. In the rescue experiments, we initially injected FMNL2 siRNA into oocytes, followed by the microinjection of FMNL2 mRNA 18-20 hours later. After conducting our previous experiments, we have verified through Western blotting that endogenous FMNL2 is effectively suppressed 18-20 hours following the microinjection of FMNL2 siRNA. Additionally, we observed a significant increase in exogenous FMNL2 protein expression 2 hours after the injection of FMNL2 mRNA. We believe that the exogenous FMNL2 could compensate the decrease by FMNL2 knockdown, and this approach was adopted in many oocyte studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors used only one approach to knockdown FMNL2 which is by siRNA. Using an additional approach to inhibit FMNL2 would be beneficial to confirm that the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of FMNL2 is specific.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. Yes, the specificity is always the concern for siRNA or morpholino microinjection due to the off-target issue. Due to the limitation we could not generate the knock out model, and there are no known inhibitors with specific targeting capabilities for FMNL2. To solve this, we performed the rescue study with exogenous mRNA to confirm the effective knock down of FMNL2. These measures provide reassurance regarding the credibility of the experimental outcomes, and this is also the general way to avoid the off-target of siRNA or morpholino.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors focus on the role of formin-like protein 2 in the mouse oocyte, which could play an important role in actin filament dynamics. The cytoskeleton is known to influence a number of cellular processes from transcription to cytokinesis. The results show that downregulation of FMNL2 affects spindle migration with resulting abnormalities in cytokinesis in oocyte meiosis I.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The overall description of methods and figures is overall dismissively poor. The description of the sample types and number of replicate experiments is impossible to interpret throughout, and the quantitative analysis methods are not adequately described. The number of data points presented is unconvincing and unlikely to support the conclusions. On the basis of the data presented, the conclusions appear to be preliminary, overstated, and therefore unconvincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment.

In order to assess the size of the polar body, we conducted a comparison between the diameter of the polar body and that of the oocyte. If the diameter of the polar body was found to be less than 1/3 of the oocyte's diameter, we categorized it as normal-sized polar body. Conversely, if the polar body's diameter exceeded 1/3 of the oocyte's diameter, we categorized it as a large polar body. We have included these details in the Results section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 2F: Can the authors comment on what can be the second band in the rescue group?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. In the rescue experiment, we microinjected exogenous FMNL2-EGFP mRNA into the oocytes. As a result, compared to endogenous FMNL2, the protein size increased due to the addition of the EGFP tag, approximately 27 kDa. Hence, in the Western blot bands of the rescue group, the upper band represents the expression of exogenous FMNL2-EGFP, while the lower band corresponds to the expression of endogenous FMNL2. We have provided annotations in the revised Figure 2F to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Can the authors comment on the variability of PBE between 2C and 2H in the FMNL2-KD groups? In panel C, the PBE in the KD group was 59.5 {plus minus} 2.82%; in panel H, the PBE in the KD group was 48.34 {plus minus} 4.2%, and in the rescue group, the PBE was 62.62 {plus minus} 3.6%. The rescue group has a similar PBE rate as the KD group in panel C. How consistent was the FMNL2 knockdown across individual replicates? Can the authors provide more details on how the rescue experiment was performed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. We believe that the difference in PBE observed in Figure 2C and 2H of the FMNL2-KD group was due to the microinjection times and the duration of in vitro arrest. The results shown in Figure 2C depict the outcome of a single injection of FMNL2 siRNA into GV stage oocytes, followed by 18 hours of in vitro arrest; the results shown in Figure 2H contain a subsequent additional injection of FMNL2-EGFP mRNA with another 2 hours of arrest. The two rounds of microinjection and the extended period of in vitro arrest both affect oocyte maturation rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9). Figure 2J and K: What groups were compared together? The used statistic needs to be properly described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. The FMNL2-KD, FMNL3-KD, and FMNL2+3-KD groups were all compared to the Control group, therefore, t-test was used for analysis. We have provided explanations in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 4B and C: Can the authors provide representative images without oversaturated actine signal?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. For the analysis of oocyte F-actin, the F-actin are divided into cortex actin and cytoplasmic actin. Due to the contrast during imaging, the strong cortex actin signals affected the detection of cytoplasmic actin, therefore, it is necessary to increase the scanning index, which will cause the overexpose the cortex actin signal. This is for the better observation of the cytoplasmic signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 4G + 5H: Can the authors comment on why they used as a housekeeping gene actin instead of tubulin, which was used in the rest of the WB experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. In most of the western blot experiments conducted in this study, we used tubulin as a housekeeping gene. However, due to the supply of antibodies by delivery period, we had GAPDH and actin as well for some experiments. These housekeeping genes were all valid for the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Based on what parameters was ER considered normally or abnormally distributed, and what stages of oocytes were assessed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. In this study, we employed oocytes at the MI stage for the analysis of ER localization. In the MI stage, the ER localized around the spindle, which is regarded as the typical localization pattern. The ER displayed a dispersed distribution throughout the cytoplasm or clustered were categorized as aberrant positioning.

In the revised manuscript, we made appropriate modifications to the relevant descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) 351-365: The conclusion that Arp2/3 compensates for the decreased formin 2 in FMNL2 knockdown oocytes is a bit unconvincing. 1- In mouse oocytes, it is already known that Arp2/3 and formin 2 regulate different pools of F-actin nucleation. 2- The authors found an increase in Arp2/3 in FMNL2 knockdown oocytes compared to control oocytes without any change in cortical F-actin. Given that Arp2/3 is primarily promoting cortical F-actin, it is expected to see an increase in cortical F-actin in FMNL2 knockdown oocytes, which was not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. Yes, previous studies showed that formin2 localizes to the cytoplasm of oocytes and accumulates around the spindle, which facilitate cytoplasmic actin assembly. While Arp2/3 is primarily responsible for actin assembly at the cortex region of oocytes. In invasive cells, FMNL2 is mainly localized in the leading edge of the cell, lamellipodia and filopodia tips, to improve cell migration ability by actin-based manner (Curr Biol 2012). We showed that FMNL2 localized both at spindle periphery and cortex, but depletion of FMNL2 did not affect cortex actin intensity. We think that FMNL2 and Arp2/3 both contribute to the cortex actin dynamics, when FMNL2 decreased, ARP2 increased to compensate for this, which maintained the cortex actin level. In the revised manuscript, we have made modifications to avoid excessive extrapolation from our results, ensuring that our conclusions are presented in a more objective manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lines 195-197: The spindle is initially formed soon after the GVBD, so there is no spindle during GVBD.

Please replace or delete it since this information is already included in Fig. 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Based on our observations, during the extrusion of the first polar body in oocytes, there is a temporary occurrence of cellular morphological fragmentation due to cortical reorganization (11h in control oocyte from Fig 2E). However, after the extrusion of the first polar body, the oocyte morphology returns to normal. Figure 2E illustrates the meiotic division process of oocytes, while Figure 3A primarily focuses on the process of oocyte spindle migration. We think that it is better to retain both to present our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>In the case of the observed phenotype, the stage of GV is important. The phenotypes presented also occur in meiotic or developmentally incompetent oocytes. In addition, the images of GV oocytes appear as NSN, which also show the KD phenotype in Figs. 2 and 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your concern. As the oocyte grows, the proportion of SN-type oocytes gradually increases. When the oocyte diameter reaches 70-80 Î¼m, the proportion of SN oocytes is approximately 52.7% (Mol Reprod Dev. 1995). In our study, both the control and knockdown groups collected oocytes with a diameter of around 80 Î¼m, which is considered as fully-grown oocytes, predominantly in the SN phase. Since the collection period and size of the oocytes were consistent, we can sure that the observed differences between the control and knockdown groups in phenotype analysis could be solid and reliable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MII is absent in Fig. 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we added immunostaining images of FMNL2 in MII stage oocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The result of KD is not convincing.

In our investigation, limited to the setup of knock out model, we employed siRNA to knockdown FMNL2 expression, to avoid the risk of off-target, we performed rescue experiment with exogenous mRNA, which we believe that it could solve this issue. When designing siRNA sequences, we ensured their specificity for binding to FMNL2 mRNA only, and we assessed the levels of FMNL2 and FMNL3 mRNA in oocytes after injection of FMNL2 siRNA. The results showed that, compared to the control group, the expression of FMNL2 mRNA decreased by approximately 70% after 18 hours of FMNL2 siRNA injection, while the level of FMNL3 mRNA was not decreased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 2F rescue experiment with double bands. What bands are seen here? Did the authors inject tagged or untagged FMNL2? Or does endogenous FMNL2 appear higher in the sample after KD?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. In the rescue experiment, we microinjected exogenous FMNL2-EGFP mRNA into the oocytes. As a result, compared to endogenous FMNL2, the protein size increased due to the addition of the EGFP tag, approximately 27 kDa.

Yes, mitochondria and ER show dynamic localization in different stage of oocyte maturation. However, in this study we employed oocyte MI stage for the analysis of ER and mitochondria localization, and in MI stage, both the ER and mitochondria localize around the spindle. This pattern is considered as the normal localization. Several studies showed that dispersed or clustered localization contributed to maturation defects. We included relevant descriptions in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What exactly is meant by input in the IP experiments? Why is the target missing in the input sample?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. We subjected the input samples to electrophoresis on a single channel, all the analyzed proteins demonstrated normal expression, thereby confirming the viability of the input sample. However, upon simultaneous exposure with the IP samples, we observed a lack of clear signal for certain proteins in the input group. This phenomenon is due to the excessive signal intensity resulting from protein enrichment in the IP group, which caused the low exposure of proteins in input group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explain the rationale for using, actin or tubulin as loading or normalization controls in the study focusing on the cytoskeleton.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. Actin and tubulin are both widely used as the control due to their stable expression. For actin, there are Î±-actin and Î²-actin isoforms. Formins and Arp2/3 complex regulate the polymerization of Î±-actin and Î²-actin to form F-actin, not isoform expression. In our study F-actin (the functional type) was examined. While Î±-tubulin and Î²-tubulin are two subtypes of tubulin, and they interact with each other to form stable Î±/Î²-tubulin heterodimers. The changes of cytoskeleton dynamics could not change the expression of Î±/Î²-tubulin. Therefore, Î²-actin and Î±-tubulin could be used as normalization controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 6E shows only *, but the legend says **.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the error.
