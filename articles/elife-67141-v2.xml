deficiency in cholesterol and accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). Here, we show that loss of <italic>DHCR7</italic> causes accumulation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterol metabolites, premature neurogenesis from murine or human cortical neural precursors, and depletion of the cortical precursor pool, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that a major oxysterol, 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), mediates these effects by initiating crosstalk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and neurotrophin receptor kinase TrkB. Either loss of <italic>DHCR7</italic> or direct exposure to DHCEO causes hyperactivation of GR and TrkB and their downstream MEK-ERK-C/EBP signaling pathway in cortical neural precursors. Moreover, direct inhibition of GR activation with an antagonist or inhibition of DHCEO accumulation with antioxidants rescues the premature neurogenesis phenotype caused by the loss of <italic>DHCR7</italic>. These results suggest that GR could be a new therapeutic target against the neurological defects observed in SLOS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>smith-lemli-opitz syndrome</kwd><kwd>7-dehydrocholesterol</kwd><kwd>oxysterol</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>cortical development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD092659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Libin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 ES007032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herron</surname><given-names>Josi M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TL1 TR002318</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Smith-Lemli-Opitz/RSH Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Libin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A 7-dehydrocholesterol-derived oxysterol in SLOS was found to profoundly impact neurogenesis during cortical development by interacting with glucocorticoid receptor, which points to new therapeutic approaches for SLOS by targeting the activities of this oxysterol.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain is rich in cholesterol, contributing to 25% of total cholesterol in the human body, and nearly all cholesterol in the brain is synthesized locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietschy and Turley, 2004</xref>). Therefore, dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism in CNS can potentially cause significant defects in CNS development and functions. Indeed, enzymatic deficiencies in cholesterol biosynthesis cause a number of inherited diseases with severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Porter and Herman, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Smith-Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive, neurological and developmental disorder characterized by multiple developmental defects, such as distinctive facial features, cleft palate, microcephaly and holoprosencephaly, as well as severe intellectual impairment and behavioral problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Porter and Herman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thurm et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, SLOS patients display a high incidence (&gt;50%) of autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bukelis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sikora et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tierney et al., 2006</xref>). SLOS is caused by mutations in the 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ<sup>7</sup> -reductase gene (<italic>DHCR7</italic>), which encodes the enzyme that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol in the final step of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fitzky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tint et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wassif et al., 1998</xref>). Defective DHCR7 resulting from the mutations leads to deficiency in cholesterol and accumulation of 7-DHC in tissues and fluids of affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tint et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tint et al., 1995</xref>). 7-DHC was found to be highly reactive toward free radical oxidation, leading to the formation of its oxidative metabolites, that is oxysterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). 7-DHC-derived oxysterols can exert cytotoxicity in neuronal cells, induce gene expression changes, and increase formation of dendritic arborization from cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korade et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, increased dendrite and axon formation has also been observed in neurons isolated from <italic>Dhcr7</italic>-KO (<italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). These studies suggest that 7-DHC-derived oxysterols may be underlying the alterations in neuronal processes in SLOS.</p><p>Cholesterol, 7-DHC, and oxysterols derived from both have been found to play important roles in modulating signaling pathways in developing tissues and organs, such as Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corcoran and Scott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Myers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Porter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raleigh et al., 2018</xref>). Related to SLOS, ring-B oxysterols derived from 7-DHC oxidation inhibit Smo in the Hh pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sever et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, cholesterol was recently found to selectively activate canonical Wnt signaling over non-canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sheng et al., 2014</xref>). However, in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from SLOS patient fibroblasts, accumulation of 7-DHC was found to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which contributes to the precocious neuronal specification in SLOS neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis et al., 2016</xref>). Depending on the position of the oxidation, oxysterols have also been shown to bind and activate other signaling molecules and nuclear receptors, including estrogen receptors, liver X receptors, and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thus, play important roles in neurodevelopment and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DuSell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Theofilopoulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voisin et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unknown how alteration of sterol composition influences neural stem cell/progenitor behaviors during cortical development, and it remains elusive whether neural defects of SLOS are due to deficiency in cholesterol or accumulation of 7-DHC or its oxysterols.</p><p>Here, we examine the effects of <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutations in developing neural precursors, focusing on the cerebral cortex. We demonstrate that 7-DHC-derived oxysterols start to accumulate at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and continue to increase at E14.5 and E16.5, and that loss of <italic>DHCR7</italic> causes decreased proliferation and self-renewal of mouse cortical neural precursors and aberrant premature neurogenesis in both mouse and human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We then provide evidence that a 7-DHC-derived oxysterol, 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), activates GR and the downstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)-mediated neurogenic signaling through TrkB, and in doing so, promotes premature NPC differentiation and perturbs neuronal positioning. Either inhibition of GR activation with an antagonist or inhibition of DHCEO accumulation with antioxidants rescues the premature neurogenesis defect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dhcr7 is expressed in embryonic cortical precursors and neurons of developing murine cortex</title><p>To understand the role of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> in neural development, we studied murine developing cortical precursors during embryonic neurogenesis. We first analyzed the expression of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mRNA during mouse cortical development. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> in embryonic day 11 (E11) through postnatal day 0 (P0) cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) also suggested the stable expression of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> from E11 to E18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Immunostaining of cortical sections of <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse brain at E12 with this particular Dhcr7 antibody confirmed the antibody specificity against Dhcr7. To further establish the expression of Dhcr7 in neural lineage cells, we analyzed cortical precursor cultures from E12.5, which consists of proliferating radial glial cells that generate neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In the E12.5 cortical precursor cultures, Dhcr7 + cells were co-labeled with the precursor markers, Sox2 and Pax6. Dhcr7 was also co-labeled with the neuronal marker, βIII-tubulin, and the neural lineage marker, Nestin. The results suggested that Dhcr7 was consistently expressed in neural lineage cells, which is consistent with our in vivo analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>Dhcr7</italic> alleles causes decreased proliferation and increased neurogenesis in murine and human neural progenitor cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RT-PCR for <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mRNA in the E11.5 to P0 cortex. <italic>β-actin</italic> mRNA was used as the loading control.

Immunoreactivity of DHCR7 was detected in almost all Control hNPCs in these cultures with Sox2 + and Nestin + cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). To examine neural differentiation, the SLOS and Control NPCs were differentiated in cultures and immunostained 4 days later for Ki67 and βIII-tubulin for proliferating precursors and newborn neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, the proportion of Ki67 + precursors was significantly decreased whereas the proportion of βIII-tubulin+neurons were increased in SLOS NPC cultures, similar to the phenotype seen in murine cortical precursors from <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> embryos.

To assess the potential effect of these 7-DHC-derived oxysterols on cortical precursor behaviors, cortical precursors from E12.5 <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> embryos were cultured and treated with different concentrations of individual oxysterols for 3 days, followed by immunostaining for Ki67, βIII-tubulin, and CC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Notably, DHCEO-treated cortical precursors showed a significant increase in the proportion of βIII-tubulin+newborn neurons and a significant decrease in the proportion of Ki67 + precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). This effect of DHCEO was observed in a dose-dependent manner up to 3.5 µM, which is roughly the concentration of DHCEO in the brains of P0 <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2011</xref>).

Note that the level of 7k-DHC is the lowest among the oxysterols, only reaching 0.9 ng/mg of tissue (equivalent to 2.3 µM), so we do not expect the highest concentration examined, 5 µM, for this oxysterol is relevant to the neurogenic phenotype. Interestingly, 4α-OH-7DHC treatment at a concentration of 2 µM also displayed significant increases in βIII-tubulin+neurons and decreases in Ki67 + precursors without significant changes in cell death/survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>).

To test this possibility, pregnant dams were pulsed with Edu for 2 hr to label all cells in S-phase and the fraction of cortical precursors in the S-phase, a proliferating index from E13.5 to E15.5 in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cortices, was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). The proliferating index was determined by the percentage of Edu + and Ki67 + cells out of total Ki67 + cells, which provides an estimate of cell cycle length because the length of the S phase remains relatively constant in mammalian cells, whereas the length of the G1 phase regulates proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiSalvo et al., 1995</xref>).

Molecular docking is an effective computational approach to understand protein-ligand interaction between small molecules and receptor proteins both energetically and geometrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferreira et al., 2015</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, DHCEO docks in the binding pocket of human GR favorably with a docking score of –9 (a negative value suggests favorable interactions), comparable to the docking score of OCDO at –9.5. Additional docking positions show that many of the predicted positions for OCDO can be recapitulated with DHCEO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We further examined whether DHCEO could initiate GR and TrkB activation in Control hNPCs in vitro. Cultured hNPCs were exposed to DHCEO (3.5 μM), a physiologically relevant concentration, harvested at the different time points (3, 6, 10, and 24 hr), and evaluated for GR and TrkB activation by western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), which revealed that DHCEO-treated hNPCs showed a gradual increase of phosphorylated GR starting at 3 hr and peaking at 10 hr of exposure. As GR phosphorylation increased, DHCEO-treated hNPCs also showed the phosphorylation of TrkB from 6 hrs to 10 hr exposure, which dissipated at 24 hr exposure. As no exogenous GR ligands and neurotrophins were added in these experiments, these results indicated that DHCEO caused the increased phosphorylation of GR, which led to the activation of TrkB phosphorylation in human NPCs in vitro.</p><p>To confirm that GR activation could cause aberrant premature neurogenesis, we cultured human cortical precursors and transfected them with <italic>hDHCR7</italic> shRNA-EGFP and control shRNA-EGFP. Twelve hr post-transfection, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU38486, or vehicle control was added and cultured for 3 days. Cultures were immunostained for EGFP and βIII-tubulin to evaluate the effects on neurogenesis. The analysis showed that inhibition of GR by RU38486 rescued the <italic>DHCR7</italic>-KD-mediated increase in neurogenesis down to the level observed in the control shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that premature cortical neurogenesis is promoted by GR activation by DHCEO and subsequent increased activation of the RTK-mediated MEK-ERK pathway. To directly evaluate this hypothesis, we inhibited MEK in cultured NPCs using two well-characterized MEK inhibitors, PD98059 and trametinib. The efficiency of these compounds in murine NPCs has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnabé-Heider and Miller, 2003</xref>). Indeed, western blots demonstrated that both PD98059 and trametinib efficiently inhibited MEK activation in hNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8M</xref>). Having confirmed the efficacy of these two compounds, we cultured SLOS hNPCs (SLOS 3044 and 5844) and wildtype hNPCs as well as murine <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NPCs and wildtype NPCs, and treated them with either PD58059 or trametinib. The cultures were immunostained for βIII-tubulin 3 days later to evaluate the effect of the inhibitors on neurogenesis. As expected, both SLOS hNPCs and murine <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> NPCs increased the proportion of βIII<sup>+</sup> newborn neurons, and the MEK inhibition by either PD98058 or trametinib reversed increased neurogenesis with <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutations back to the level seen in the wildtype NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C, F</xref>).</p><p>Chemical inhibitors may have off-target effects. Therefore, we performed rescue experiments by genetically knockdown either TrkB or MEK. We evaluated the efficiency of shRNA targeting TrkB and MEK by transfecting them independently into 293T cells and performed western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O</xref>). These analyses showed that TrkB or MEK shRNA decreased TrkB or MEK protein whereas control shRNA did not. Either TrkB or MEK shRNA was transfected to cultured human neural progenitors with EGFP-<italic>DHCR7</italic> shRNA. Quantification of EGFP<sup>+</sup>, βIII-tubulin + cells 3 days later demonstrated that coincident TrkB knockdown rescued the increased neurogenesis phenotype observed following shRNA-mediated <italic>DHCR7</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>). Similarly, MEK knockdown also reversed the premature neurogenesis with <italic>DHCR7</italic> shRNA knockdown in human NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). Thus, <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutations disrupt the normal cortical neurogenesis by hyperactivating RTKs, such as TrkB, through GR activation and thus activating the downstream MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.</p><p>Finally, we assessed whether aberrant premature neurogenesis was due to DHCEO, as it is a major oxysterol derived from free radical (non-enzymatic) oxidation of 7-DHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Antioxidants can prevent or slow down the formation of oxysterols via the free radical mechanism and protect cells from the deleterious effects of oxysterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2011</xref>). In particular, vitamin E (V<sub>E</sub>), but not vitamin C (V<sub>C</sub>), has been shown to effectively inhibit the formation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols in SLOS patient-derived fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korade et al., 2014</xref>). Combination with V<sub>C</sub>, which recycle oxidized V<sub>E</sub>, enhances the antioxidant activity of V<sub>E</sub> against lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doba et al., 1985</xref>). Furthermore, glutathione (GSH) is an important detoxifying molecule that is abundant (in mM) in cells and can potentially inhibit the formation of DHCEO by reacting with its electrophilic precursor, 7-DHC 5α,6α-epoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Porter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). To test this possibility, we treated <italic>hDHCR7</italic> KD human NPCs with antioxidants (V<sub>E</sub>, V<sub>C</sub>, V<sub>E</sub>/V<sub>C</sub>, or GSH) and then immunostained for EGFP and βIII-tubulin to evaluate the effects on neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). The analysis indicated that V<sub>E</sub>, V<sub>E</sub>/V<sub>C</sub>, or GSH, but not V<sub>C</sub> alone, effectively reversed increased neurogenesis caused by <italic>hDHCR7</italic> KD to the level observed in the control. Potential detoxifying effects of these antioxidants were further tested in human SLOS patient-derived NPCs as well as cortical precursors from <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryos in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A, B, D, E</xref>). Treatments with V<sub>E</sub>, V<sub>E</sub>/ V<sub>C</sub> and GSH were again found to effectively reduce the increased neurogenesis in both human and murine NPCs with <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mutations down to the level observed in WT or Control samples. LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed that V<sub>E</sub>, V<sub>E</sub>/V<sub>C</sub>, or GSH indeed inhibited the levels of DHCEO in SLOS hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). These results suggest that free radical chain-breaking antioxidants, such as V<sub>E</sub>, and nucleophilic antioxidants, such as GSH, can effectively rescue the neurogenesis phenotype observed in SLOS NPCs by inhibiting the free radical oxidation of 7-DHC at different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p><p>In addition to antioxidant treatment, we evaluated whether cholesterol plays significant roles in normal neurogenesis in human and murine NPCs. We tested whether cholesterol depletion could phenocopy the premature neurogenesis observed in both human and murine DHCR7 mutations. Human and murine NPCs were treated with of β-cyclodextrin, a cholesterol-depleting agent, and the changes in the proportion of βIII-tubulin+neurons were quantified 3 days after plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B</xref>). LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated that β-cyclodextrin treatment reduced cellular cholesterol by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>); however, it did not change the proportion of βIII-tubulin+neurons and Ki67 + progenitors either in human NPCs or murine NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3C, D</xref>). Furthermore, we tested whether restoration of cholesterol could potentially rescue aberrant premature neurogenesis observed in both human and murine SLOS NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B, E</xref>). Low-density lipoprotein was added to cultures to examine the effects of cholesterol on neurogenesis.

Because DHCEO has been shown to inhibit Smo in the Hh signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sever et al., 2016</xref>), we also tested whether supplementation of SAG (a Smo agonist) can rescue the phenotype with or without cholesterol supplementation in <italic>DHCR7</italic>-KD hNPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).

First, LC-MS/MS analyses indicate that <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutations promote a significant accumulation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols in murine and human embryonic cortical NPCs during cortical development. Second, our studies with KD or KO of <italic>DHCR7</italic> indicate that <italic>DHCR7</italic> is necessary for the normal proliferation of embryonic NPCs and genesis of newborn neurons in culture and within the environment of the embryonic cortex. KD or KO of <italic>DHCR7</italic> leads to premature differentiation of cortical precursors to neurons and ultimately a reduction in the thickness of cortical layers. This occurs through the activation of the neurogenic TrkB-MEK-C/EBP pathway. Third, we show that 7-DHC-derived oxysterols, especially DHCEO, display detrimental effects on normal neural development, and that DHCEO can activate GR, which is responsible for abnormal cortical precursor differentiation, since <italic>DHCR7</italic> KD/KO phenotype can be rescued by concurrent inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor. Fourth, we show that premature differentiation of cortical precursors with <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutations is cholesterol-independent since inhibition of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols via antioxidant treatment can rescue <italic>DHCR7</italic> KD/KO phenotype, whereas cholesterol supplementation cannot.</p><p>Based on these data, we propose a model where DHCEO binds and activates GR, and in doing so, controls the RTK-mediated neurogenic pathway, TrkB-MEK-C/EBP, and thus fate-decision of developing precursors and neurons. Although docking studies only approximate enthalpic energies and are an incomplete approximation of affinity, they provide a structural rationale for this activity. This model is consistent with previous studies showing that an oxysterol structurally similar to DHCEO, OCDO, can bind and regulate GR and its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Voisin et al., 2017</xref>) and ligand-bound GR promoted TrkB phosphorylation, leading to activation of its downstream effectors, MEK and ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeanneteau et al., 2008</xref>). Our model of DHCEO exerting its effect on neurogenesis through GR does not contradict the previous finding by Francis et al., which suggests that Wnt/β-catenin inhibition contributes to precocious neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis et al., 2016</xref>), because activation of GR has been shown to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olkku and Mahonen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This work represents the first comprehensive characterization of the neurogenic phenotype in the SLOS mouse model and SLOS patient-derived NPCs. We demonstrate that the aberrant neural development observed in mice and human NPCs with <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutations occurs in a cholesterol-independent and 7-DHC-derived oxysterol-dependent manner. Successful rescue of the neurogenic phenotype by inhibiting GR or inhibiting the formation of oxysterols with antioxidants pave the wave for potential therapies for the neurological defects observed in SLOS patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guideline ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. <italic>Dhcr7</italic> mice (B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>tm1Gst</sup>/J) were maintained as heterozygous and were genotyped as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fitzky et al., 2001</xref>).

The mometasone furoate molecule present in that crystal structure was used to establish the center of the search area defining the binding pocket, and ligand docking calculations were performed within that search area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In general, three biological replicates were used for each experiment based on the strong phenotype observed in the <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> SLOS model and our previous publication showing the large differences in oxysterols and sterol levels in WT and KO brains at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2011</xref>). For culturing of mouse cortical precursors or neurospheres from single embryos, one litter is considered a biological replicate. For hNPC culture, each separate preparation of hNPC from hiPSC is considered a biological replicate. For in vivo study, one litter is considered a biological replicate. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test assuming unequal variance when comparing two different groups unless otherwise indicated in the text. For immunostaining of cell culture or tissue sections, at least three technical replicates per biological replicate were performed. To analyze the multi-group neuroanatomical studies, we used one-way ANOVA unless otherwise indicated in the text. Significant interactions or main effects were further analyzed using Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests. All statistical tests were performed using Microsoft Excel or Prism 8 (GraphPad). In all cases, error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Anita Bhattacharyya as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewers agree that the study is of high interest in that it provides a causal link between the DHCR7 depletion in SLOS and neurogenesis defects and thus could have a critical impact on SLOS therapy. The foundational data that show that LOF of DHCR7 leads to premature differentiation of cortical progenitors is convincing and the ability to phenocopy with exogeneous oxysterols lends strength to the study and links to the human disorder SLOS. The use of mouse models and validation in human cells is a strength.</p><p>However, the manuscript in its current form does not meet the standards for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Reviewers identified specific areas that require improvement to support the claims of the paper and to offer new mechanistic insight.</p><p>1. The authors have not convincingly distinguished proliferation from enhanced differentiation. Showing the number of Ki67 positive cells is a relatively weak way of demonstrating reduced neurogenesis. BrdU labelling or similar approach with quantification should be used. In addition, the description of the effects altered neurogenesis is somewhat imprecise. &quot;Altered cytoarchitecture&quot; and &quot;proper localization&quot; suggest that an alternative hypothesis may be that cells do not migrate properly, which is not tested in this manuscript. In cortical neurogenesis, it seems logical that if progenitors prematurely differentiate, then they will not populate the more superficial layers. This is not explicitly stated.</p><p>2. Protein analysis is weak. The western blots have no molecular weight markers, no control proteins, and no quantification that is needed to support claims of over or under expression (Figures 1C, 3A and 3M, 5J, 7A and 7C). Quantification of Western blots is needed to support the claims of altered expression throughout the manuscript.</p><p>3. The RNAseq experiments give interesting gene expression results and reveal possible signaling pathways involved. However, further data is needed to support the central role of TrkB, as the rationale for the focus on TrkB is weak (many growth factors signal through MapK) and the data in Figure 5J are not convincing. Many signaling pathways could account for the phenotype and those regulated by the cholesterol pathway would be stronger candidates. Further, the RNA seq and results in Figure 7 are difficult to follow as they alternate between human and mouse. Do the RNA seq results in human agree with mouse models?</p><p>4. The use of both mouse and human models is a major strength of the work to confirm that phenotypes in mouse models are relevant to patients with SLOS. However, the human data is relegated to supplementary data, thus limiting its impact. The data should be included in the main manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67141.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewers agree that the study is of high interest in that it provides a causal link between the DHCR7 depletion in SLOS and neurogenesis defects and thus could have a critical impact on SLOS therapy.

We have now carried out EdU labeling experiments in cortical precursors (Figure 3F), which showed that <italic>Dhcr7</italic>-knock down leads to reduced proliferation of the cortical precursors. We also want to point out that in vivo EdU labelling experiments with quantification were performed in our initial submission, which showed increased cell cycle exit and decreased proliferation index of cortical precursors in <italic>DHCR7</italic> mutants (Figure 6).</p><p>We have also modified the wording “altered cytoarchitecture” to “reduced thickness of cortical layers” to more accurately reflect our observations in Figure 5. We tracked the formation of neurons from E12.5 to E15.5 using EdU, which confirmed the premature neurogenesis phenotype in vivo (Figure 5H-I). However, E15.5 is not the end of the cortical neurogenesis, so we do not expect to see reduced neurons in the superficial layers at this time point yet. Our data in Figure 3 and 6A-D suggests that <italic>Dhcr7</italic> knockdown or KO leads to depletion of the cortical precursor pools, which ultimately leads to reduced thickness of VZ/SVZ at E14.5 and E15.5 (Figure 6E-F) and reduced thickness of cortical layers at E18.5 (Figure 5A-C). On the other hand, no obvious migration defect in <italic>Dhcr7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons was observed in Figure 5H and 6A as EdU-labelled cells appear in layers similar to those in wild-type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Protein analysis is weak. The western blots have no molecular weight markers, no control proteins, and no quantification that is needed to support claims of over or under expression (Figures 1C, 3A and 3M, 5J, 7A and 7C). Quantification of Western blots is needed to support the claims of altered expression throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have included control proteins in all the western blot analysis: Erk1/2 for Figures 1C, Erk1/2 for Figures 3A, 3N, and 8C (note the numbering change; previous Figure 7 is now Figure 8), GAPDH for Figure 5J, and 8A, 8M, and 8O. The western blots in Figures 1C, 3A, 3N, 8C, 8M, and 8O showed the targeting proteins either presence or nearly invisible, so we do not feel the needs for absolute quantitation. However, to demonstrate the changes in phosphorylation levels of the neurogenesis signaling pathway, we have quantified the phosphorylated forms of various proteins in Figure 5J and 8A and added the quantitation plots (Figure 5K and 8A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Do the RNA seq results in human agree with mouse models?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the critical suggestion. Our main finding for the disease mechanism is that one of the 7-DHCderived oxysterols, DHCEO can activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and GR can hyperactivate TrkB, which is the main regulator of embryonic neurogenesis. Our RNAseq experiments were intended to show the activation of GR-TrkB further hyper-activates downstream effectors of the neurogenic signaling pathway such as MapK, which was indeed found to be a major affected pathway (new Figure 7; Table S5). The RNAseq experiments did not find any neurogenic candidate that are regulated by the cholesterol pathway.</p><p>To strength our rationale for the involvement of GR-TrkB activation to the premature neurogenesis phenotypes of SLOS, we have performed a new series of <italic>DHCR7</italic> knockdown experiments with TrkB or MEK knockdown or MEK inhibitors (new Figures 8K-O), which showed that the premature neurogenesis was reversed when either TrkB or its downstream effector MEK were blocked. This supports the involvement of this particular neurogenic pathway in the observed premature neurogenesis phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The use of both mouse and human models is a major strength of the work to confirm that phenotypes in mouse models are relevant to patients with SLOS. However, the human data is relegated to supplementary data, thus limiting its impact. The data should be included in the main manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-organized our manuscript so that the date on human SLOS model is a part of the main manuscript (see new Figure 1 – Panels P-S).</p></body></sub-article></article>
