Nonexpert adults routinely infer the causes of illness in themselves and others (e.g. <italic>how did my friend get COVID?</italic>). Even young children think about illness in systematic ways, reflecting their burgeoning commonsense understanding of the biological world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Wellman and Gelman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Keil, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Inagaki and Hatano, 2006</xref>).

Thinking about living things (animates) as opposed to nonliving things (inanimate objects/places) recruits partially distinct neural systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Warrington and Shallice, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Hillis and Caramazza, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caramazza and Shelton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Farah and Rabinowitz, 2003</xref>). The precuneus (PC) is part of the ‘animacy semantic network’ and responds preferentially to living things (i.e. people and animals), whether presented as images or words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Devlin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fairhall and Caramazza, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fairhall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Peer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Silson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Rabini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deen and Freiwald, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aglinskas and Fairhall, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hauptman et al., 2025</xref>). By contrast, parts of the visual system (e.g. fusiform face area [FFA]) that respond preferentially to animates do so primarily for images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kanwisher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Grill-Spector et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Noppeney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Mahon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Konkle and Caramazza, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Connolly et al., 2016</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bi et al., 2016</xref>, for a review). We hypothesized that the PC represents causal knowledge relevant to animates and tested the prediction that it would be activated during causal inferences about illness, which rely on such knowledge (preregistration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/6pnqg">https://osf.io/6pnqg</ext-link>).</p><p>We also compared neural responses to causal inferences about the body (i.e. illness) and inferences about the mind (i.e. mental states). Both types of inferences are about animate entities, and some developmental work suggests that children use the same set of causal principles to think about bodies and minds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carey, 1988</xref>). Other evidence suggests that by early childhood, young children have distinct causal knowledge about the body and the mind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Springer and Keil, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Callanan and Oakes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">Wellman and Gelman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Inagaki and Hatano, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Inagaki and Hatano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Keil, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Hickling and Wellman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Medin et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, preschoolers are more likely to view illness as a consequence of biological causes, such as contagion, rather than psychological causes, such as malicious intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Springer and Ruckel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Raman and Winer, 2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Legare and Gelman, 2008</xref>). The neural relationship between inferences about bodies and minds has not been fully described. The ‘mentalizing network’, including the PC, is engaged when people reason about agents’ beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Saxe and Kanwisher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Saxe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Saxe and Powell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dodell-Feder et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dufour et al., 2013</xref>). We localized this network in individual participants and measured its neuroanatomical relationship to the network activated by illness inferences.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that domain-general neural mechanisms, separate from semantic networks, support causal inferences across domains. Children and adults make causal inferences across a wide range of domains and use similar cognitive principles (e.g. ‘screening off’) when doing so (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Saxe and Carey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Tenenbaum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cheng and Novick, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Waldmann and Holyoak, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Pearl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gopnik et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Steyvers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Gopnik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Schulz and Gopnik, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Rehder and Burnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lagnado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Rottman and Hastie, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Davis and Rehder, 2020</xref>). Prior neuroscience work has hypothesized that the frontotemporal language network may support a broad range of causal inferences during comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kuperberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Mason and Just, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Prat et al., 2011</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Spelke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Spelke, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Pinker, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, causal inference could depend on frontoparietal mechanisms that also support other types of reasoning, such as logical deduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Goldvarg and Johnson‐Laird, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbey and Patterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Khemlani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Operskalski and Barbey, 2017</xref>). Finally, it has been suggested that causal inferences are supported by a dedicated ‘causal engine’ in prefrontal cortex that supports all and only causal inferences across domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Pramod et al., 2023</xref>). We tested these alternative hypotheses in the specific case of implicit causal inferences that unfold naturally during language comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Black and Bern, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Keenan et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Trabasso and Sperry, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Myers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Duffy et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>Most prior studies investigating causal inference used explicit causality judgment tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ferstl and von Cramon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Satpute et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Fugelsang and Dunbar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kuperberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fenker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Kranjec et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Pramod et al., 2023</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Kuperberg et al., 2006</xref> asked participants to rate the causal relatedness of three-sentence stories and observed higher responses to causally related stories in left frontotemporal cortex. Studies of implicit causal inference report frontotemporal and frontoparietal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Mason and Just, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Prat et al., 2011</xref>). Across these prior studies, no consistent neural signature of causal inference has emerged. Importantly, in many studies, causal trials were more difficult, and/or linguistic variables were not matched across causal and noncausal conditions. As a result, some of the observed effects may reflect linguistic or executive load. In addition, almost no prior studies localized language or logical reasoning networks in individual participants, making it difficult to assess the involvement of these systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fedorenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Monti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Pramod et al., 2023</xref>). Most prior work also did not distinguish between causal inferences about different semantic domains known to depend on partially distinct neural networks, e.g., biological, mechanical, or mental state inferences (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Mason and Just, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Pramod et al., 2023</xref>). If such inferences recruit partially distinct neural systems, their neural signatures might have been missed.</p><p>In the current experiment, participants read two-sentence vignettes (e.g. ‘Hugh sat by sneezing passengers on the subway. Now he has a case of COVID.’). The first sentence described a potential cause and the second sentence a potential effect. Such causally connected sentences arise frequently in naturalistic discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Singer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Graesser et al., 1994</xref>). Participants performed a covert task of detecting ‘magical’ catch trial vignettes that encouraged them to attend to the meaning of the critical vignettes while reading as naturally as possible. We chose an orthogonal foil detection task rather than an explicit causal judgment task to investigate automatic causal inferences during reading and to unconfound such processing as much as possible from explicit decision-making processes. Analogous foil detection paradigms have been used to study sentence processing and word recognition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Pallier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Causal inferences about illness were compared to two control conditions: (i) causal inferences about mechanical breakdown (e.g. ‘Jake dropped all of his things on the subway. Now he has a shattered phone.’) and (ii) illness-related language that was not causally connected (e.g. ‘Lynn dropped all of her things on the subway. Now she has a case of COVID.’). This combination of control conditions allowed us to test jointly for sensitivity to content domain and causality. In other words, this design enabled us to test the hypothesis that causal inferences about illness recruit the animacy semantic network. Critically, all vignettes, including mechanical ones, described events involving people, such that responses to causal inferences about illness in the animacy semantic network could not be explained by the presence of animate agents. As a further control, we included the number of people in each vignette as a covariate of no interest in our fMRI analysis. Noncausal vignettes were constructed by shuffling causes/effects across conditions and were therefore matched to the causal vignettes in linguistic content. A separate group of participants rated the causal relatedness of all vignettes prior to the experiment. In addition to the main causal inference experiment, we also localized language, logical reasoning, and mentalizing networks in each participant. Following prior work, we predicted that the neural systems that support causal inference would exhibit increased activity during such inferences. Thus, our primary neural prediction was that animacy-responsive PC would respond more to causal inferences about illness compared to all other control conditions. We also used multivariate methods to investigate differences between conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral results</title><p>Accuracy on the magic detection task was at ceiling (<italic>M</italic>=97.9% ± 2.2 SD), and there were no significant differences across the four main experimental conditions (<italic>Illness-Causal</italic>, <italic>Mechanical-Causal</italic>, <italic>Noncausal-Illness First, Noncausal-Mechanical First</italic>), <italic>F</italic><sub>(3,57)</sub> = 2.39, p=0.08.

In the current study, neither the language nor the logic network exhibited elevated neural responses during causal inferences relative to linguistically matched sentence pairs that were not causally connected. Language regions in frontotemporal cortex responded more to noncausal than causal vignettes (frontal search space: repeated-measures ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,19)</sub> = 23.91, p&lt;0.001; temporal search space: repeated-measures ANOVA, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,19)</sub> = 4.31, p=0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Here, we show that the PC exhibits sensitivity to causal inferences about biological processes specific to animates, such as illness. These findings are consistent with our preregistered hypotheses and suggest that causal knowledge about animate and inanimate entities is distributed across multiple distinct semantic networks. Further, our results suggest that the animacy semantic network supports biological causal knowledge. Future work should test whether the animacy network is sensitive to causal information beyond illness, including about growth, nourishment, and death. We hypothesize that changes in biological causal knowledge during development, as well as cultural expertise in causal reasoning about illness (e.g. medical expertise), influence activity in the animacy network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Legare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Norman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our findings are consistent with prior evidence from naturalistic paradigms showing that the PC is sensitive to discourse-level processes across sentences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hasson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Lee and Chen, 2022</xref>).

By contrast, we failed to find sensitivity to causal inference in portions of the ventral stream previously associated with the perception of animate agents (see Appendix 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s13">Figure 1—figure supplement 13</xref> for details). Sensitivity to causal information may be a distinguishing characteristic of high-level, amodal semantic networks, as opposed to perceptual regions that are activated during semantic tasks (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Martin and Chao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Thompson-Schill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barsalou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Binder and Desai, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bi, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>No evidence for domain-general neural responses during implicit causal inference</title><p>In the current study, participants read two sentence vignettes that either elicited causal inferences or were not causally connected. No brain regions responded more to causal inferences across domains compared to noncausal vignettes in this task. The language network responded more to noncausal than causal vignettes, possibly due to greater difficulty associated with processing the meaning of a sentence that does not follow from the prior context. Prior studies find that the language network is specialized primarily for sentence-internal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fedorenko and Varley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Jacoby and Fedorenko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blank and Fedorenko, 2020</xref>) and patients with agrammatic aphasia can make causal inferences about pictorial stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Varley and Siegal, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Varley, 2014</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the language system itself is unlikely to support causal inference. Rather, during language comprehension, the language system interacts with semantic networks to enable causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Simony et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Yeshurun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, in the current study, responses to causal inference in semantic networks were stronger in the left hemisphere. The left lateralization of such responses may enable efficient interfacing with the language system during comprehension.</p><p>We also failed to find evidence for the claim that the frontoparietal logical reasoning network, a domain-general executive system, supports implicit causal inferences. By contrast, the frontoparietal network responded more to noncausal than causal vignettes. Finally, we failed to observe elevated responses to causal inference across domains anywhere in the brain in whole-cortex analysis. A large swath of prefrontal cortex responded more to one noncausal condition (<italic>Noncausal-Mechanical First</italic>) compared to both causal conditions. The same prefrontal regions also exhibited increased activity when participants were slower to respond to the task. Thus, this ‘reverse causality effect’ likely reflects processing demands rather than causal inference per se. An alternative interpretation of the elevated prefrontal activity observed for one of the noncausal conditions is that it reflects the effortful search for a causal connection between sentences when such a connection is difficult to find. This interpretation would suggest that domain-general executive mechanisms become engaged when causal inferences are effortful and explicit. By contrast, semantic systems are engaged when we implicitly infer a known causal relationship.</p><p>Causal inferences are a highly varied class, and domain-general systems likely play an important role in many causal inferences not tested in the current study. The vignettes used in the current study stipulate illness causes, allowing participants to reason from causes to effects. By contrast, illness reasoning performed by medical experts proceeds from effects to causes and can involve searching for potential causes within highly complicated and interconnected causal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Schmidt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Norman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Meder and Mayrhofer, 2017</xref>). The discovery of novel causal relationships (e.g. ‘blicket detectors’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Gopnik et al., 2001</xref>) and the identification of complex causes, even in the case of illness, may depend in part on domain-general neural mechanisms. The present results suggest, however, that causal knowledge is embedded within high-level semantic systems, and that biological causal knowledge is embedded with a semantic system relevant to animacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Open science practices</title><p>The methods and analysis of this experiment were preregistered prior to data collection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/6pnqg">https://osf.io/6pnqg</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty adults (7 women, 13 men, 25–37 years of age, <italic>M</italic>=28.7 years±3.2 SD) participated in the study.

Each online participant read all vignettes from the causal inference experiment (152 vignettes) in addition to 12 filler vignettes that were designed to be either maximally causally related or unrelated (164 vignettes total), one vignette at a time. Their task was to judge the extent to which it was possible that the event described in the first sentence of each vignette caused the event described in the second sentence on a four-point scale (1=not possible; 4=very possible). Four participants were excluded on the basis of inaccurate responses on the filler trials (i.e. difference between average ratings for maximally causally related and maximally causally unrelated vignettes &lt;2). Among the 26 remaining participants, 12 read vignettes from Version A and 14 read vignettes from Version B of the experiment. To eliminate erroneous responses, we first excluded trials with RTs 2.5 SD outside their respective condition means within participants and then excluded trials with outlier RTs (more than 1.5 IQR below Q1 or more than 1.5 IQR above Q3) across participants (approximately 5% of all trials excluded in total). We found that both causal conditions (<italic>Illness-Causal</italic>, <italic>Mechanical-Causal</italic>) were more causally connected than both noncausal conditions, <italic>t</italic>(25) = 36.97, p&lt;0.001 (causal: <italic>M</italic>=3.51 ± 0.78 SD, noncausal: <italic>M</italic>=1.10 ± 0.45 SD).

Sentences that were incorrectly parsed by the automatic syntactic parser (i.e. past participle adjectives parsed as verbs) were corrected by hand. Word frequency was calculated as the negative log of a word’s occurrence rate in the Google corpus between the years 2017 the 2019. Bigram surprisal was calculated as the negative log of the frequency of a given two-word phrase in the Google corpus divided by the frequency of the first word of the phrase.</p><p>This calculation uses a log base of 2 in order to express surprisal in terms of ‘bits’ that the first word provides in the context of the phrase.

They do so tanks to an fMRI task, by comparing brain activity elicited by participants' exposure to written situations suggesting a plausible cause of illness with brain activity in linguistically equivalent situations suggesting a plausible cause of mechanical failure or damage and non-causal situations. These contrasts confirm the PC as the main &quot;culprit&quot; in whole-brain and fROIs univariate analyses. In turn, inferring causes of mechanical failure engages mostly the PPA. The authors further test whether the content-specificity has to do with inferences about animates in general, or if there are some distinctions between reasoning about people's bodies versus mental states. To answer this question, the authors localize the mentalizing network and study the relation between brain activity elicited by Illness-Causal &gt; Mech-Causal and Mentalizing &gt; Physical stories. They conclude that inferring about the causes of illness partially differentiates from reasoning about people's states of mind. The authors finally test the alternative yet non-mutually exclusive hypothesis that both types of implicit causal inferences (illness and mechanical) depend on shared neural machinery.

For instance, in the searchlight MVPA analysis, an interesting decoding analysis is conducted to identify brain regions that represent illness-causal and mechanical-causal conditions differently, yielding results consistent with the univariate analyses. However, to test for the presence of a shared network, the authors only perform the Causal vs. Non-causal analysis. This analysis is not very informative because it includes all conditions mixed together and does not clarify whether both the illness-causal and mechanical-causal conditions contribute to these results.</p><p>(2) To address this limitation, a useful additional step would be to use as ROIs the different regions that emerged in the Causal vs. Non-causal decoding analysis and to conduct four separate decoding analyses within these specific clusters:</p><p>(a) Illness-Causal vs. Non-causal - Illness First;</p><p>(b) Illness-Causal vs. Non-causal - Mechanical First;</p><p>(c) Mechanical-Causal vs. Non-causal - Illness First;</p><p>(d) Mechanical-Causal vs. Non-causal - Mechanical First.</p><p>This approach would allow the authors to determine whether any of these ROIs can decode both the illness-causal and mechanical-causal conditions against at least one non-causal condition.</p><p>(3) Another possible analysis to investigate the existence of a shared network would be to run the searchlight analysis for the mechanical-causal condition versus the two non-causal conditions, as was done for the illness-causal versus non-causal conditions, and then examine the conjunction between the two. Specifically, the goal would be to identify ROIs that show significant decoding accuracy in both analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The hypothesis that a neural mechanism supports causal inference across domains predicts higher univariate responses when causal inferences occur than when they do not. This prediction was not generated by us ad hoc but rather has been made by almost all previous cognitive neuroscience papers on this topic (Ferstl &amp; von Cramon, 2001; Satpute et al., 2005; Fugelsang &amp; Dunbar, 2005; Kuperberg et al., 2006; Fenker et al., 2010; Kranjec et al., 2012; Pramod, Chomik-Morales, et al., 2023; Chow et al., 2008; Mason &amp; Just, 2011; Prat et al., 2011). Contrary to this hypothesis, we find that the precuneus (PC) is most activated for illness inferences and most deactivated for mechanical inferences relative to rest, suggesting that the PC does not support domain-general causal inference. To further probe the selectivity of the PC for illness inferences, we created group overlap maps that compare PC responses to illness inferences and mechanical inferences across participants. The PC shows a strong preference for illness inferences and is therefore unlikely to support causal inferences irrespective of their content (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). We also note that, in whole-cortex analysis, no shared regions responded more to causal inference than noncausal vignettes across domains. Therefore, the prediction made by the ‘domain-general causal engine’ proposal as it has been articulated in the literature is not supported in our data.</p><p>Taking a multivariate approach, the hypothesis that a neural mechanism supports causal inference across domains also predicts that relevant regions can decode between all possible pairs of causal vs. noncausal conditions (e.g., Illness-Causal vs. Noncausal-Illness First, Mechanical-Causal vs. Noncausal-Illness First, etc.). The analysis described by the reviewer in (2), in which the regions that distinguish between causal vs. noncausal conditions in searchlight MVPA are used as ROIs to test various causal vs. noncausal contrasts, is non-independent. Therefore, we cannot perform this analysis. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestions in (3), now include searchlight MVPA results for the mechanical inference condition compared to the two noncausal conditions (Supplementary Figure 9). No regions are shared across the searchlight analyses comparing all possible pairs of causal and noncausal conditions, providing further evidence that there are no shared neural responses to causal inference in our dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Along the same lines, for the ROI MVPA analysis, it would be useful not only to include the illness-causal vs. mechanical-causal decoding but also to examine the illness-causal vs. non-causal conditions and the mechanical-causal vs. non-causal conditions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to report these data not just in a table (where only the mean accuracy is shown) but also using dot plots, allowing the readers to see not only the mean values but also the accuracy for each individual subject.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed these analyses and now include a table of the results as well as figures displaying the dispersion across participants (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, Supplementary Figures 10 and 11). In the left PC, the illness inference condition was decoded from one of the noncausal conditions, and the mechanical inference condition was decoded from the same noncausal condition. The language network did not decode between any causal/noncausal pairs. In the logic network, the illness inference condition was decoded from one of the noncausal conditions, and the mechanical inference condition was decoded from the other noncausal condition. Thus, no regions showed the predicted ‘domain-general’ pattern, i.e., significant decoding between all causal/noncausal pairs.</p><p>Importantly, the decoding results must be interpreted in light of significant univariate differences across conditions (e.g., greater responses to illness inferences compared to noncausal vignettes in the PC). Linear classifiers are highly sensitive to univariate differences (Coutanche, 2013; Kragel et al., 2012; Hebart &amp; Baker, 2018; Woolgar et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2014; Pakravan et al., 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The selection of Regions of Interest (ROIs) is not entirely straightforward:</p><p>In the introduction, the authors mention that recent literature identifies the precuneus (PC) as a region that responds preferentially to images and words related to living things across various tasks. While this may be accurate, we can all agree that other regions within the ventral occipital-temporal cortex also exhibit such preferences, particularly areas like the fusiform face area, the occipital face area, and the extrastriate body area. I believe that at least some parts of this network (e.g., the fusiform gyrus) should be included as ROIs in this study. This inclusion would make sense, especially because a complementary portion of the ventral stream known to prefer non-living items (i.e., anterior medial VOTC) has been selected as a control ROI to process information about the mechanical-causal condition. Given the main hypothesis of the study - that causal inferences about illness might depend on content-specific semantic representations in the 'animacy network' - it would be worthwhile to investigate these ROIs alongside the precuneus, as they may also yield interesting results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion to test the FFA region. We think this provides an interesting comparison to the PC and hypothesized that, in contrast to the PC, the FFA does not encode abstract causal information about animacy-specific processes (i.e., illness). As we mention in the Introduction, although the fusiform face area (FFA) also exhibits a preference for animates, it does so primarily for images in sighted people (Kanwisher et al., 1997; Kanwisher et al., 1997; Grill-Spector et al., 2004; Noppeney et al., 2006; Konkle &amp; Caramazza, 2013; Connolly et al., 2016; Bi et al., 2016).</p><p>We did not select the FFA as a region of interest when preregistering the current study because we did not predict it would show sensitivity to causal knowledge. In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestions, we now include the FFA as an ROI in individual-subject univariate analysis (Supplementary Figure 8, Appendix 4). Because we did not run a separate FFA localizer task when collecting the data, we used FFA search spaces from a previous study investigating responses to face images (Julian et al., 2012). We followed the same analysis procedure that was used to investigate responses to illness inferences in the PC. Neither left nor right FFA exhibited a preference for illness inferences compared to mechanical inferences or to the noncausal conditions. This result is interesting and is now briefly discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Visual representation of results:</p><p>In all the figures related to ROI analyses, only mean group values are reported (e.g., Figure 1A, Figure 3, Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8). To better capture the complexity of fMRI data and provide readers with a more comprehensive view of the results, it would be beneficial to include a dot plot for a specific time point in each graph. This could be a fixed time point (e.g., a certain number of seconds after stimulus presentation) or the time point showing the maximum difference between the conditions of interest. Adding this would allow for a clearer understanding of how the effect is distributed across the full sample, such as whether it is consistently present in every subject or if there is greater variability across individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

It would be beneficial to provide an explanation for this decision.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose an orthogonal foil detection task, rather than an explicit causal judgment task, to investigate automatic causal inferences during reading and to unconfound such processing as much as possible from explicit decision-making processes (see Kuperberg et al., 2006 for discussion). Analogous foil detection paradigms have been used to study sentence processing and word recognition (Pallier et al., 2011; Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018). We now clarify this in the Introduction. The “magical” element occurred both within and across sentences so that participants could not use coherence as a cue to complete the task. Approximately 1/5 (19%) of the trials were magical catch trials to ensure that participants remained attentive throughout the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors hypothesize that &quot;causal inferences about illness depend on content-specific semantic representations in the animacy network&quot;.

Then the question arises of whether the content-specificity has to do with inferences about animates in general, or if there are some distinctions between reasoning about people's bodies versus mental states. To answer this question, the authors localize the mentalizing network and study the relation between brain activity elicited by Illness-Causal &gt; Mech-Causal and Mentalizing &gt; Physical stories. They conclude that inferring about the causes of illness partially differentiates from reasoning about people's states of mind. The authors finally test the alternative yet non-mutually exclusive hypothesis that both types of causal inferences (illness and mechanical) depend on shared neural machinery. Good candidates are language and logic, which justifies the use of a language/logic localizer. No evidence of commonalities across causal inferences versus non-causal situations is found.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This study introduces a useful paradigm and well-designed set of stimuli to test for implicit causal inferences.</p><p>(2) Another important methodological advance is the addition of physical stories to the original mentalizing protocol.</p><p>(3) With these tools, or a variant of these tools, this study has the potential to pave the way for further investigation of naïve biology and causal inference.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) This study is missing a big-picture question. It is not clear whether the authors investigate the neural correlates of causal reasoning or of naïve biology. If the former, the choice of an orthogonal task, making causal reasoning implicit, is questionable. If the latter, the choice of mechanical and physical controls can be seen as reductive and problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Introduction to clarify that the primary goal of the current study is to test the claim that semantic networks encode causal knowledge – in this case, causal intuitive theories of biology. Most conceptions of intuitive biology, intuitive psychology, and intuitive physics describe them as causal frameworks (e.g., Wellman &amp; Gelman, 1992; Simons &amp; Keil, 1995; Keil et al., 1999; Tenenbaum, Griffiths, &amp; Niyogi, 2007; Gopnik &amp; Wellman, 2012; Gerstenberg &amp; Tenenbaum, 2017). As noted above, we chose an implicit task to investigate automatic causal inferences during reading and to unconfound such processing as much as possible from explicit decision-making processes. We are not sure what the reviewer means when they say that mechanical and physical controls are reductive. This is the standard control condition in neural and behavioral paradigms that investigate intuitive psychology and intuitive biology (e.g., Saxe &amp; Kanwisher, 2003; Gelman &amp; Wellman, 1991).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The rationale for focusing mostly on the precuneus is not clear and this choice could almost be seen as a post-hoc hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This study is preregistered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/6pnqg">https://osf.io/6pnqg</ext-link>). The preregistration states that the precuneus is a hypothesized area of interest, so this is not a post-hoc hypothesis. Our hypothesis was informed by multiple prior studies implicating the precuneus in the semantic representation of animates (e.g., people, animals) (Fairhall &amp; Caramazza, 2013a, 2013b; Fairhall et al., 2014; Peer et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Silson et al., 2019; Rabini, Ubaldi, &amp; Fairhall, 2021; Deen &amp; Freiwald, 2022; Aglinskas &amp; Fairhall, 2023; Hauptman, Elli, et al., 2025). We also conducted a pilot experiment with separate participants prior to pre-registering the study. We now clarify our rationale for focusing on the precuneus in the Introduction:</p><p>“Illness affects living things (e.g., people and animals) rather than inanimate objects (e.g., rocks, machines, houses). Thinking about living things (animates) as opposed to non-living things (inanimate objects/places) recruits partially distinct neural systems (e.g., Warrington &amp; Shallice, 1984; Hillis &amp; Caramazza, 1991; Caramazza &amp; Shelton, 1998; Farah &amp; Rabinowitz, 2003). The precuneus (PC) is part of the ‘animacy’ semantic network and responds preferentially to living things (i.e., people and animals), whether presented as images or words (Devlin et al., 2002; Fairhall &amp; Caramazza, 2013a, 2013b; Fairhall et al., 2014; Peer et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Silson et al., 2019; Rabini, Ubaldi, &amp; Fairhall, 2021; Deen &amp; Freiwald, 2022; Aglinskas &amp; Fairhall, 2023; Hauptman, Elli, et al., 2025). By contrast, parts of the visual system (e.g., fusiform face area) that respond preferentially to animates do so primarily for images (Kanwisher et al., 1997; Grill-Spector et al., 2004; Noppeney et al., 2006; Mahon et al., 2009; Konkle &amp; Caramazza, 2013; Connolly et al., 2016; see Bi et al., 2016 for a review). We hypothesized that the PC represents causal knowledge relevant to animates and tested the prediction that it would be activated during implicit causal inferences about illness, which rely on such knowledge (preregistration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/6pnqg">https://osf.io/6pnqg</ext-link>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The choice of an orthogonal 'magic detection' task has three problematic consequences in this study:</p><p>(a) It differs in nature from the 'mentalizing' task that consists of evaluating a character's beliefs explicitly from the corresponding story, which complicates the study of the relation between both tasks. While the authors do not compare both tasks directly, it is unclear to what extent this intrinsic difference between implicit versus explicit judgments of people's body versus mental states could influence the results.</p><p>(b) The extent to which the failure to find shared neural machinery between both types of inferences (illness and mechanical) can be attributed to the implicit character of the task is not clear.</p><p>(c) The introduction of a category of non-interest that contains only 36 trials compared to 38 trials for all four categories of interest creates a design imbalance.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer’s argument that our use of an implicit “magic detection” task is problematic. Indeed, we think it is one of the advances of the current study over prior work.</p><p>a) Prior work has shown that implicit mentalizing tasks (e.g., naturalistic movie watching) engages the theory of mind network, suggesting that the implicit/explicit nature of the task does not drive the activation of this network (Jacoby et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2018). With these data in mind, it is unlikely that the implicit/explicit nature of the causal inference and theory of mind tasks in the present experiment can explain observed differences between them.</p><p>b) Explicit causal inferences introduce a collection of executive processes that potentially confound the results and make it difficult to know whether neural signatures are related to causal inference per se. The current study focuses on the neural basis of implicit causal inference, a type of inference that is made routinely during language comprehension. We do not claim to find neural signatures of all causal inferences, we do not think any study could claim to do so because causal inferences are a highly varied class.</p><p>c) Our findings do not exclude the possibility that content-invariant responses are elicited during explicit causality judgments. We clarify this point in the Results (e.g., “These results leave open the possibility that domain-general systems support the explicit search for causal connections”) and Discussion (e.g., “The discovery of novel causal relationships (e.g., ‘blicket detectors’; Gopnik et al., 2001) and the identification of complex causes, even in the case of illness, may depend in part on domain-general neural mechanisms”).</p><p>d) Because the magic trials are excluded from our analyses, it is unclear how the imbalance in the number of magic trials could influence the results and our interpretation of them. We note that the number of catch trials in standard target detection paradigms are sometimes much lower than the number of target trials in each condition (e.g., Pallier et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Another imbalance is present in the design of this study: the number of trials per category is not the same in each run of the main task. This imbalance does not seem to be accounted for in the 1st-level GLM and renders a bit problematic the subsequent use of MVPA.</p></disp-quote><p>Each condition is shown either 6 or 7 times per run (maximum difference of 1 trial between conditions), and the number of trials per condition is equal across the whole experiment: each condition is shown 7 times in two of the runs and 6 times four of the runs. This minor design imbalance is typical of fMRI experiments and should not impact our interpretations of the data, particularly because we average responses from each condition within a run before submitting them to MVPA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The main claim of the authors, encapsulated by the title of the present manuscript, is not tested directly. While the authors included in their protocol independent localizers for mentalizing, language, and logic, they did not include an independent localizer for &quot;animacy&quot;. As such, they cannot provide a within-subject evaluation of their claim, which is entirely based on the presence of a partial overlap in PC (which is also involved in a wide range of tasks) with previous results on animacy.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this assertion. Our primary analysis uses a within-subject leave-one-run-out approach. This approach allows us to use part of the data itself to localize animacy-relevant causal responses in the PC without engaging in ‘double-dipping’ or statistical non-independence (Vul &amp; Kanwisher, 2011). We also use the mentalizing network localizer as a partial localizer for animacy. This is because the control condition (physical reasoning) does not include references to people or any animate agents (Supplementary Figures 1 and 15). We now clarify this point in Methods section of the paper (see below).</p><p>From the Methods: “To test the relationship between neural responses to inferences about the body and the mind, and to localize animacy regions, we used a localizer task to identify the mentalizing network in each participant (Saxe &amp; Kanwisher, 2003; Dodell-Feder et al., 2011; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://saxelab.mit.edu/use-our-efficient-false-belief-localizer)...Our">http://saxelab.mit.edu/use-our-efficient-false-belief-localizer)...Our</ext-link> physical stories incorporated more vivid descriptions of physical interactions and did not make any references to human agents, enabling us to use the mentalizing localizer as a localizer for animacy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study employed an implicit task, showing vignettes to participants while a bold signal was acquired. The aim was to capture automatic causal inferences that emerge during language processing and comprehension. In particular, the authors compared causal inferences about illness with two control conditions, causal inferences about mechanical failures and non-causal phrases related to illnesses. All phrases that were employed described contexts with people, to avoid animacy/inanimate confound in the results. The authors had a specific hypothesis concerning the role of the precuneus (PC) in being sensitive to causal inferences about illnesses.</p><p>These findings indicate that implicit causal inferences are facilitated by semantic networks specialized for encoding causal knowledge.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of the study is the clever design of the stimuli (which are nicely matched for a number of features) which can tease apart the role of the type of causal inference (illness-causal or mechanical-causal) and the use of two localizers (logic/language and mentalizing) to investigate the hypothesis that the language and/or logical reasoning networks preferentially respond to causal inference regardless of the content domain being tested (illnesses or mechanical).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I have identified the following main weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Precuneus (PC) and Temporo-Parietal junction (TPJ) show very similar patterns of results, and the manuscript is mostly focused on PC (also the abstract). To what extent does the fact that PC and TPJ show similar trends affect the inferences we can derive from the results of the paper? I wonder whether additional analyses (connectivity?) would help provide information about this network.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. While the PC shows the most robust univariate preference for illness inferences compared to both mechanical inferences and noncausal vignettes, the TPJ also shows a preference for illness inferences compared to mechanical inferences in individual-subject fROI analysis. However, as we mention in the Results section, the TPJ does not show a preference for illness inferences compared to noncausal vignettes, suggesting that the TPJ is selective for animacy but may not be as sensitive to causal knowledge about animacy-specific processes. When describing our results, we refer to the ‘animacy network’ (i.e., PC and TPJ) but also highlight that the PC exhibited the most robust responses to illness inferences (from the Results: “Inferring illness causes preferentially recruited the animacy semantic network, particularly the PC”; from the Discussion: “We find that a semantic network previously implicated in thinking about animates, particularly the precuneus (PC), is preferentially engaged when people infer causes of illness…”). We did not collect resting state data that would enable a connectivity analysis, as the reviewer suggests. This is an interesting direction for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Results are mainly supported by an univariate ROI approach, and the MVPA ROI approach is performed on a subregion of one of the ROI regions (left precuneus). Results could then have a limited impact on our understanding of brain functioning.</p></disp-quote><p>The original and current versions of the paper include results from multiple multivariate analyses, including whole-cortex searchlight MVPA and individual-subject fROI MVPA performed in multiple search spaces (see Supplementary Figures 10 and 11, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).</p><p>We note that our preregistered predictions focused primarily on univariate differences. This is because the current study investigates neural responses to inferences, and univariate increases in activity is thought to reflect the processing of such inferences. We use multivariate analyses to complement our primary univariate analyses. However, given that we observe significant univariate effects and that multivariate analyses are heavily influenced by significant univariate effects (Coutanche, 2013; Kragel et al., 2012; Hebart &amp; Baker, 2018; Woolgar et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2014; Pakravan et al., 2022), our univariate results constitute the main findings of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In all figures: there are no measures of dispersion of the data across participants.

Only in Figure 2, we see the data of 6 selected participants out of 20.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We now include graphs depicting the dispersion of the data across participants in the following figures: Figures 1, 3, and 4, and Supplementary Figures 8, 12, and 14. We have also created 2 figures that display the overlap of univariate responses across participants (Supplementary Figures 6 and 7). These figures show that there is high overlap across participants in PC responses to illness inferences but not mechanical inferences.

Without breaks, the scan would be approximately 1.5 hours. This is a standard length for MRI experiments. The main experiment (causal inference task) was always conducted first and lasted approximately 1 hour.

As I previously pointed out, the MVPA searchlight analysis is not very informative and is difficult to interpret. However, as previously suggested, there are additional steps that could be taken to better understand and interpret these results. It is incorrect to conclude that because the brain regions identified in the MVPA analyses show a preference for non-causal vignettes in univariate analyses, the multivariate results lack value. While univariate analyses may show a preference for a specific condition, multivariate analyses can reveal more fine-grained representations of multiple conditions. For a notable example, consider the fusiform face area (FFA) that shows a clear preference for faces at the univariate level but can significantly decode other categories at the multivariate level, even when faces are not included in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The decoding analysis that the reviewer is suggesting for the current study would be analogous to identifying univariate differences between faces and places in the FFA and then decoding between faces and places and claiming that the FFA represents places because the decoding is significant. The decoding analyses enabled by our design are not equivalent to decoding within a condition (e.g., among face identities, among types of illness inferences), as the reviewer suggests above. It is not that such multivariate analyses “lack value” but that they recapitulate established univariate differences. Multivariate analyses are useful for revealing more fine-grained representations when (i) significant univariate differences are not observed, or (ii) when it is possible to decode among categories within a condition (e.g., among face identities, among types of illness inferences). We are currently collecting data that will enable us to perform within-condition decoding analyses in future work, but the design of the current study does not allow for such a comparison.</p><p>We note that the original quotation from the manuscript has been removed because it is no longer accurate. When including participant response time as a covariate of no interest in the GLM, no regions are shared across the 4 searchlight analyses comparing causal and noncausal conditions, suggesting that there are no shared neural responses to causal inference in our dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Moderating the strength of some claims made to justify the main hypothesis (e.g., &quot;people but not machines transmit diseases to each other through physical contact&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this wording so that it now reads: “Illness affects living things (e.g., people and animals) rather than inanimate objects (e.g., rocks, machines, houses).” (Introduction)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Expanding the paragraph introducing the sub-question about inferring people's &quot;body states&quot; vs &quot;mental states&quot;.

In accordance their suggestions, we have expanded the paragraph Introduction that introduces the “body states” vs. “mental states” question (see below). We have also switched the order of the localizer descriptions in the Methods section and added a sentence at the start of each section describing the relevant hypotheses (see below).</p><p>From the Introduction: “We also compared neural responses to causal inferences about the body (i.e., illness) and inferences about the mind (i.e., mental states). Both types of inferences are about animate entities, and some developmental work suggests that children use the same set of causal principles to think about bodies and minds (Carey, 1985, 1988). Other evidence suggests that by early childhood, young children have distinct causal knowledge about the body and the mind (Springer &amp; Keil, 1991; Callanan &amp; Oakes, 1992; Wellman &amp; Gelman, 1992; Inagaki &amp; Hatano, 1993; 2004; Keil, 1994; Hickling &amp; Wellman, 2001; Medin et al., 2010). For instance, preschoolers are more likely to view illness as a consequence of biological causes, such as contagion, rather than psychological causes, such as malicious intent (Springer &amp; Ruckel, 1992; Raman &amp; Winer, 2004; see also Legare &amp; Gelman, 2008). The neural relationship between inferences about bodies and minds has not been fully described. The ‘mentalizing network’, including the PC, is engaged when people reason about agents’ beliefs (Saxe &amp; Kanwisher, 2003; Saxe et al., 2006; Saxe &amp; Powell, 2006; Dodell-Feder et al., 2011; Dufour et al., 2013). We localized this network in individual participants and measured its neuroanatomical relationship to the network activated by illness inferences.”</p><p>From the Methods, localizer descriptions: “To test the relationship between neural responses to inferences about the body and the mind, and to localize animacy regions, we used a localizer task to identify the mentalizing network in each participant… To test for the presence of domain-general responses to causal inference in the language and logic networks (e.g., Kuperberg et al., 2006; Operskalski &amp; Barbey, 2017), we used an additional localizer task to identify both networks in each participant.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Adding a quick analysis of lateralization to support the corresponding claim of left lateralization of responses to causal inferences.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we now include hemisphere as a factor in all ANOVAs comparing univariate responses across conditions.</p><p>From the Results: “In individual-subject fROI analysis (leave-one-run-out), we similarly found that inferring illness causes activated the PC more than inferring causes of mechanical breakdown (repeated measures ANOVA, condition (<italic>Illness-Causal</italic>, <italic>Mechanical-Causal</italic>) x hemisphere (left, right): main effect of condition, <italic>F(1,19)</italic> = 19.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, main effect of hemisphere, <italic>F(1,19)</italic> = 0.3, <italic>p</italic> = .59, condition x hemisphere interaction, <italic>F(1,19)</italic> = 27.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; Figure 1A).
