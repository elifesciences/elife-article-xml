composition. Artificially increasing CpG/UpA dinucleotides attenuates viruses through an entirely unknown mechanism. Using the echovirus 7 (E7) model in several cell types, we show that the restriction in E7 replication in mutants with increased CpG/UpA dinucleotides occurred immediately after viral entry, with incoming virions failing to form replication complexes. Sequences of CpG/UpA-high virus stocks showed no evidence of increased mutational errors that would render them replication defective, these viral RNAs were not differentially sequestered in cytoplasmic stress granules nor did they induce a systemic antiviral state. Importantly, restriction was not mediated through effects on translation efficiency since replicons with high CpG/UpA sequences inserted into a non-coding region were similarly replication defective. Host-cells thus possess intrinsic defence pathways that prevent replication of viruses with increased CpG/UpA frequencies independently of codon usage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29112.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living things store their genetic material as molecules of DNA or a related chemical called RNA. Both DNA and RNA contain building blocks known as bases. There are several different types of bases and the specific order they appear in a DNA or RNA molecule encodes the genetic information. In RNA these bases are known as cytosine, guanine, adenine and uracil (or C, G, A and U for short). The order that bases appear in DNA and RNA can be highly biased. For example, in RNAs from animals with backbones (also known as vertebrates), cytosine followed by guanine and uracil followed by adenine occur less often than mathematics would predict.</p><p>Viruses are particles that contain DNA or RNA surrounded by a coat made of proteins. They are unable to multiply by themselves and must therefore invade the cells of host organisms. Viruses that infect vertebrates mimic the base biases found in their host, a strategy that likely helps the virus’ genetic material to hide within host cells. Previous experiments have shown that viruses engineered to have more cytosines followed by guanines and uracils followed by adenines were easier to eliminate. However, it is not clear how this worked.</p><p>Fros et al. investigated the ability of a virus called echovirus 7 to multiply inside the cells of humans and several other vertebrates. The experiments show that artificially increasing the number of cytosines followed by guanines and uracils followed by adenines in this virus reduced the ability of the virus to multiply immediately after the virus had entered the host cell. The location of the changes did not have any effect on how strongly the virus was inhibited. Furthermore, Fros et al. confirmed that these changes did not affect the ability of the virus’ genetic material to make the proteins it needs to multiply and make its coat. This suggests that the host specifically prevents the virus genetic material from being copied, solely based on the order of the bases in the viral genetic material.</p><p>These findings provide evidence that human and other vertebrate cells contain factors that recognize and rapidly respond to foreign genetic material with biases in their genetic code that do not match their own. In the future, artificially increasing the frequency of specific orders of bases in viral genomes could be used to design more effective vaccines against diseases caused by viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CpG</kwd><kwd>UpA</kwd><kwd>dinucleotides</kwd><kwd>codon bias</kwd><kwd>enterovirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT103767MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simmonds</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA virus replication is attenuated by an intrinsic restriction mechanism after introducing CpG/UpA dinucleotides into both non-translated and coding regions of viral genomes, which may be exploited in the design of attenuated virus vaccines.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A primary function of the genomes of RNA viruses is to code for viral genes that replicate and package genomic RNA for new rounds of infection. It is increasingly recognised, however, that RNA virus genomes possess a range of other organisational features, such as formation of RNA secondary and tertiary structures that interact with host cell elements, such as ribosomal proteins in viral internal ribosomal entry sites and in the encoding of replication structures such as the <italic>cis-</italic> active replication element of picornaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martínez-Salas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodfellow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steil and Barton, 2009</xref>). The genomes of RNA viruses are also subject to a range of poorly understood mutational and compositional constraints, with substantial variability in G + C content and the apparent avoidance of certain dinucleotides (the use of two adjacent nucleotides in a linear sequence), such as CpG and UpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simmonds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karlin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rima and McFerran, 1997</xref>). At least in part, this pattern of under-representation may be shared by the hosts they infect where suppression of CpG and UpA is widespread.</p><p>In coding sequences of most organisms, TpA (UpA in RNA) is under-represented while vertebrate and plant genomes additionally show strong suppression of CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Josse et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Russell et al., 1976</xref>). UpA dinucleotides in cytoplasmic mRNA and likely also viral RNA are under direct selection as the dinucleotide is recognised by RNA-degrading enzymes in the cytoplasm. The degree of UpA dinucleotides in a RNA molecule has therefore been hypothesized to control cellular RNA turn-over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan and Antezana, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beutler et al., 1989</xref>). A different, enzymatic mechanism underlies the suppression of CpG in host genomes; the cytosine in a CpG dinucleotide can be methylated, making it more likely to deaminate into a thymine. This selectively reduces CpG dinucleotide frequencies in both plant and vertebrate genomes where DNA methylation is extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coulondre et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird, 1980</xref>). Most small DNA viruses and viruses with single stranded RNA genomes appear to mimic host-cell mRNA dinucleotide frequencies, with a strong bias in both UpA and CpG dinucleotide frequencies in viruses of plants and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simmonds et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karlin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rima and McFerran, 1997</xref>). In contrast, the genome of many invertebrates lack methylation and consequently show little if any suppression of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. Consistent with the hypothesis for virus mimicry, the genomes of viruses that infect invertebrates show little suppression of CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lobo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simmonds et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There is abundant evidence that modifying dinucleotide frequencies has a direct functional effect on virus replication. For example, increasing CpG or UpA dinucleotides in coding regions of echovirus7 (E7, <italic>enterovirus</italic>, <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>) while keeping protein coding identical strongly attenuated E7 independently of classical antiviral signalling pathways, whereas removing CpG and UpA dinucleotides increased viral replication rates in vitro beyond those of WT virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Witteveldt et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, infections with influenza virus (<italic>Influenzavirus A</italic>, <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>) with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies were entirely non-pathogenic and viral loads were markedly reduced. Such infections did however elicit inflammatory cytokine production and T-cell and antibody responses equal to or exceeding that of wild type virus and conferred complete protection from a lethal challenge dose of wild type influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaunt et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Because of the compact nature of RNA virus genomes, alteration of CpG and UpA frequencies in viruses in these previous studies inevitably involved extensive modification of coding regions. Such changes may have the secondary effect of introducing normally unfavoured codons or codon pairs in viral genomes, reducing translation rates that may cause further virus attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martínez et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible, however, to modify sequences in such a way that limited changes in CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies can be introduced while keeping codon pair bias (as measured by the summary metric, codon pair bias) constant, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. When done in the E7 picornavirus model, we found it was dinucleotide frequency changes that were the primary factor behind attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>), although this conclusion has been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Futcher et al., 2015</xref>). To resolve this issue, in the current study we have developed a new replicon for E7 which allows additional sequence of varied dinucleotide composition to be placed in a non-translated context; any changes in the replication ability of mutants with different dinucleotide compositions therefore cannot be attributed to effects on translational efficiency that have been advocated by other groups.</p><p>The replication cycle of E7, a typical enterovirus, is relatively well understood and allows functional dissection of the various replication steps in which attenuation of high CpG and UpA mutants of the virus may occur. Upon entry into the host cell the viral genomic RNA is quickly released into the cytoplasm. Through a cap-independent mechanism viral RNA is translated into a single polyprotein that is further processed. Changes in dinucleotides frequencies may influence the stability of RNA post entry or the efficiency of translation initiation or processivity. RNA replication occurs in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) associated vesicles, where from a negative-sense RNA intermediate progeny positive-sense RNA genomes are transcribed. The dsRNA replication intermediate is a known activator of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peisley et al., 2011</xref>). The consequent induction and secretion of interferon induces expression of a large number of cellular genes whose expression leads to the induction of an antiviral state within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Randall and Goodbourn, 2008</xref>). Viral RNAs with modified dinucleotide frequencies may be differentially susceptible to the effects of the interferon response. Finally, the generation and packaging of viral RNAs may be influenced by post-transcriptional modifications of viral RNA, such as deamination by the interferon-inducible ADAR and APOBEC proteins and lead to progeny virus that is intrinsically replication defective. Using a wide range of pathway knockouts and inhibitors and direct observation of the fate of viral RNA post-entry, we were able to determine where in the viral replication cycle attenuation by unfavoured dinucleotides occurred and what components of the cellular antiviral response were responsible for virus attenuation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viral attenuation by CpG and UpA dinucleotides in different cell lines</title><p>We previously demonstrated the marked inhibition in replication of E7 mutants in which CpG and UpA frequencies were artificially increased in one or two regions of the genome (R1, R2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These regions were selected for the absence of secondary RNA structures or specific RNA sequences important for enterovirus replication. This was supported by a high synonymous site variability and low mean folding energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>). In these experiments a permutated mutant of E7, with the native sequences of R1 or R2 scrambled but retaining coding and native dinucleotide frequencies, showed WT levels of replication, indicative that these genome region can be safely modified without consequences for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>). Attenuation of viruses containing UpA-high and CpG-high sequences was evident in RD and A549 cell lines, but whether the restriction in replication extended to cell lines of different tissue origins was not determined, nor whether the restriction was related to host-cell susceptibility to E7 infection. To investigate this, we infected a range of different cells at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) with wild type (WT) E7 and mutants with modified R2 sequences with elevated CpG (C) or UpA (U) frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). R2 mutants were used in preference to the R1/R2 double mutants to ensure that replication kinetics for increasingly attenuated mutants could still be measured to an acceptable accuracy in some of the less permissive cell lines.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29112.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>E7 virus replication is restricted by increased UpA and CpG dinucleotide frequencies independent of replication efficiency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome organisation of E7 virus with the two regions (R1 and R2) that have been mutated for this study.

Across the different cell types, the viral titres of E7 with R2_U or R2_C were consistently lower compared to WT E7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.01,). The relative replication rates (RRRs; ratio of TCID<sub>50</sub>s of mutant/WT virus) of E7 mutants differed between cell types. In RD cells (human muscle) and A549 cells (human lung epithelium) R2_U E7 displayed an RRR of 0.1 and 0.4 respectively. The RRR of R2_C was further suppressed to 0.01 in these cells.

Synonymous removal of all possible CpG and UpA dinucleotides from firefly luciferase (luc_cu, ratio CpG 0.013 and UpA 0.154 O/E) strongly increased the replication rate of the E7luc replicon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similar replication was observed in the replicon with the R1 permuted control (P) that retained identical CpG and UpA frequencies to the WT control.

However, RNA replication rates of E7 replicons with a high UpA ncR1 tail (ncR1_U) in RD and A549 cells showed mildly reduced relative replication rates (to 0.5), whereas the high CpG sequence, ncR1_C, reduced replication rates by approximately 10-fold at 6 and 9 hr post RNA transfection (hpt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar degrees of attenuation were observed in replicons where CpG and UpA frequencies were increased through mutation of the coding region in R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

RD cells were either transfected with replicon RNA of E7 ncR1 variants or infected with infectious E7 virus with mutated R2, both in the presence or absence of C16. The relative luciferase expression of E7 replicons with increased UpA or CpG dinucleotides in their ncR1 were increased by 1.8 and 6 fold respectively in the presence of C16 while the replication of WT and CDLR was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, p-values 0.069 and 0.01, T-test). The observed reversal of attenuation of the E7 ncR1 variants closely resembled that of viruses with modifications in the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and provides evidence that the mechanisms of attenuation in the two systems were similar.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that relative replication rates of infectious viruses with increased CpG- and UpA dinucleotide frequencies in R2 varied between cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

These included mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF and 3T3), a B lymphoblast cell line (A9) and two neuronal cell types, neuroblasts and microglia cells (dN2a and BV2, respectively). At six hpt, samples were lysed and assayed for luciferase expression.

At four hours post infection, WT and R2_U mutants developed clear pockets of replication in a large percentage of cells, whereas detection of E7 RNA with increased CpG dinucleotides became less frequent. Those cells that did display E7 with R2_C emitted a more variable fluorescent intensity ranging from small RNA foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) to areas of RNA replication similar to the other viruses. At six hours, RNA replication of E7 R2_C had progressed to display similar fluorescent intensities compared to the other E7 variants, but only in 3.5% of cells, compared to 49% and 36% of cells infected with R2_WT or R2_U viruses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7BC</xref>).</p><p>The striking observation that dinucleotide frequency changes influenced the frequency of infected cells, but not necessarily their subsequent replication ability was verified by flow cytometry of a further set of E7 replicon constructs in which the luciferase gene was replaced by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). A series of mutants were created with altered nucleotide compositions in their coding R2 region and/or ncR1 tails. In vitro transcribed RNA was subsequently transfected into either RD or BHK cells and scored for fluorescent intensity. Similar to the above RNA FISH experiments, FACS analysis showed that the percentage of EGFP expressing cells at 6 hpt differed dramatically between WT and CpG-high mutant replicons while the mean fluorescent intensities of the cells that were fluorescent was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AB</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

SGs are cytoplasmic foci containing RNA binding proteins, RNAs and translation initiation factors. SGs are rapidly formed in response to translation attenuation and environmental stress including that induced by viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchan and Parker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kedersha and Anderson, 2002</xref>).

Further evidence that such cytoplasmic response pathways are not involved directly in the control of E7 replication was provided by measurement of phosphorylation on serine 51 of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α.

However, the suppression of CpG dinucleotides is composition dependent. Higher G + C content generally allows for a higher frequency of CpG dinucleotides in naturally occurring sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fryxell and Moon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simmonds et al., 2013</xref>), including isolates of the enterovirus genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). To investigate whether this striking correlation is the result of functional constraints that also shapes the direct context surrounding a CpG dinucleotide, synthetic sequences were designed to have an identical G + C content and equal amounts of CpG and UpA dinucleotides as WT R1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), but with variable positioning of A and U bases that may create more potent motifs restricting replication than CpG alone. Specifically, sequences were generated in which A and U bases were positioned in either AACGAA or UUCGUU contexts. These novel sequences were cloned into the non-coding region of the E7 luciferase replicon system creating E7 ncR1_AACGAA and ncR1_UUCGUU. Despite these mutants possessing the WT number of CpG dinucleotides, their replication was profoundly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>); the ncR1_AACGAA showed an RRR comparable to that of the CpG-high sequence (containing 181 CpG dinucleotides). Remarkably, the replication of the ncR1_UUCGUU was further impaired with an RRR 30-fold lower than the WT control of identical CpG content. The context of the bases surrounding the CpG dinucleotide has a potent effect on replication attenuation. A further range of sequences require to be tested in this experimental paradigm to better characterise the minimal motif associated with CpG recognition.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29112.025</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>CpG dinucleotide mediated restriction of E7 replicon RNA replication is dependent on the context of CpG dinucleotides.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Full length enterovirus sequences analysed for their O/E CpG ratio and G + C content.

Here we characterise mechanistically how the viral replication cycle is affected by increased genomic CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies in viral genomes and narrow down the possible cellular processes involved. Importantly we show that the functional constraints act directly on RNA with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides to inhibit viral RNA replication. This occurs independent of whether these nucleotides are in coding or non-coding RNA and without induction of a systemic, cell-wide antiviral state.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Relative replication rates, dinucleotide frequencies, codon usage and translational efficiency</title><p>The RRRs of both viruses and replicons with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotides were lower than WT E7 in all cell types tested. The similarity in pattern of RRR observed in different cell lines between E7 virus and replicons, and their shared responsiveness to C16 corroborates the use of this replicon system with non-coding sequence variants. For both replication systems, cells originating from the kidney and especially BHK cells displayed a smaller restrictive phenotype to CpG-high E7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">10</xref>), although increasing CpG or UpA dinucleotides in multiple regions further reduced the RRR in BHK cells, indicating that these cells do share the ability to inhibit E7 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These findings are consistent with the reduced attenuation in BHK cells of dengue virus mutants with an increased frequency of unfavoured codon pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 2015</xref>), a process that increases frequencies of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Simmonds et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>). More broadly, the numerous studies that used codon pair bias to attenuate viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martrus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le Nouën et al., 2014</xref>) consistently report the same type of restricted replication phenotypes that we have observed in high CpG and UpA mutants of E7. We and others have proposed on bioinformatic and experimental grounds that attenuation associated with unfavoured codon pairs originates from unintentional increase in CpG and UpA dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The data reported in the current study reinforces this conclusion, at least for the echovirus seven model we used, by demonstrating that replication rates were similarly affected by addition of CpG and UpA dinucleotides in the 3’ non-coding region as they were in the coding part of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). CpG- and UpA-induced attenuation therefore must be mainly mediated in a manner that is independent of codon usage or codon pair bias. Furthermore, transfection of non-replicating RNAs showed no influence of CpG or UpA addition on translation of luciferase or RNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These observations were however restricted to the echovirus model, and while they may also underlie the observed attenuation of other viruses with codon or codon pair de-optimised coding regions, translation efficiency is very clearly a potential additional factor that may influence virus replication rates, and does not exclude the existence of additional mechanisms that may attenuate viruses based on codon or codon pair choice, particularly for viruses that have different replication mechanisms to E7. For example, the expression of viral proteins from conventionally processed mRNAs by most DNA viruses, nuclear replicating RNA viruses such as influenza A virus and retroviruses clearly places their replication kinetics at the mercy of how effectively these are translated and how well this is coordinated for virus assembly and release. These factors are less relevant for positive sense RNA viruses, such as E7 that replicate in the cytoplasm. The findings do suggest, however, that the apparent necessity for under-representation of UpA and CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA is one element that has contributed to biases in nucleotide composition and as a result the choice of codons and codon pairs in native viral sequences. The importance of the current study is that we can at least for the E7 model, entirely disentangle the effects of dinucleotide frequency modification from translation efficiency and produce experimental findings that complement conclusions reached previously using other viruses and other experimental approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burns et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burns et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tulloch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kunec and Osterrieder, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Biology</title><p>Since the attenuation of replication of E7 with elevated CpG and UpA frequencies cannot be the result of changes in translation efficiency, we investigated the cellular basis of the observed restriction by following the outcome of infection of cells with E7. Shortly after entry, mutants with increased CpG dinucleotide frequencies showed a substantial delay and reduced formation of replication complexes. However, this difference was not the result of reduced infectivity of CpG-high virions, as equal RNA copies were detected by PCR and RNA-FISH revealed similar frequencies of RNA genomes post-entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The marked phenotypic effect arose because the initial replication entities of CpG-high viruses failed to progress to form the larger replication complexes observed in WT and also most UpA-high infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Once formed, replication complexes from CpG-high viruses showed comparable levels of viral RNA by RNA-FISH. Infection outcomes with a parallel set of replicons in which the <italic>luc</italic> reporter gene was replaced by <italic>EGFP</italic> conformed these observations; FACS analysis provided quantitative evidence for a reduced frequency but equivalent fluorescent intensity of productively infected cells by the CpG-high mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>This reduction in replication competent particles could be the result of post-transcriptional RNA-editing of the viral genome that rendered them replication defective. It is possible, for example, that ADAR-2 or APOBEC may be differentially upregulated in cells infected with compositionally altered mutants and create progeny viruses with high frequencies of hypermutated, replicative-defective genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powell et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rueter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tomaselli et al., 2015</xref>). In RNA these proteins create specific A-G and C-U transitions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 1997</xref>). APOBEC editing substantially limits the replication ability of HIV-1 and other retroviruses; so powerfully indeed that many retroviruses have developed specific antagonism pathways, such as Vif in HIV-1 that limits APOBEC’s effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hultquist et al., 2011</xref>). However, frequencies of mutations, both non-synonymous (and potentially inactivating) and synonymous, were comparable in E7 viral stocks of all compositions, and indeed were similar to those reported previously in WT E7 and poliovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sanjuán, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>). There was also no evidence of a specific RNA editing signature among the identified mutations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The observed failure of CpG-high viruses to initiate replication is therefore not the result of genomic sequences being defective.</p><p>Viral replication may be directly inhibited in some other way by increased UpA and CpG dinucleotides. UpA and CpG dinucleotides are self-complementary and may increase the likelihood of intramolecular base pairing, which could impact the efficiency of the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lai, 2005</xref>). However, the reversal of the restricted replication phenotypes of CpG- and UpA-high mutants by the kinase inhibitor C16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and the reduction in their attenuation in BHK and other kidney cells lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) argues strongly against the existence of an intrinsic replication defect in the mutant viruses. This conclusion is reinforced by the observation that CpG- or UpA- elevation in a non-functional genome region (the 3’ ncR1 or ncS) led to a similar attenuation as observed in coding region mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Antiviral responses</title><p>As there was no evidence that CpG- and UpA-high viruses were translationally or otherwise compromised in their replication abilities, we therefore sought evidence that their attenuation provoked a qualitatively or quantitatively different innate cellular response. Perhaps it was their greater visibility to cell defences or susceptibility to antiviral pathways that limited their replication. It is known that the structure and configuration of viral genomic RNA may serve as PAMPs for interferon pathway-coupled PRRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoneyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oshiumi et al., 2016</xref>). UpA and UpU dinucleotides in viral RNAs can be cleaved by RNase L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2014</xref>) and produce 5’ phosphorylated RNA termini that activate RIG-I mediated IFN-β expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Malathi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malathi et al., 2010</xref>). This may potentially account for the suppression of UpA dinucleotide frequencies in viral RNA sequences. However, this does not explain why viruses have not evolved to under-represent UpU dinucleotides as well as UpA - for E7 the UpU O/E ratio is 1.04.</p><p>We have previously shown that inhibition of IRF3, a pathway intermediate that couples PRR recognition to interferon production, had no effect on the attenuation of CpG- or UpA-high mutants of E7, nor was their replication any more affected by the addition of exogenous IFN than WT virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>). Several findings in the current study reinforce the conclusion that the IFN pathway is not involved, directly or indirectly in the attenuation of CpG-/UpA-high viruses. These include the reduced replication rates of UpA and CpG high viruses in Vero cells and the absence of any effect on MAVS inhibition (mediated by expression of the HCV protease NS3/4A; Suppl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).Similarly, viral RNA was not sequestered in stress granules and eIF2α phosphorylation was not upregulated in cells infected with CpG- or UpA-high mutants of E7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>None of the currently described PRRs are known to recognise CpGs in RNA sequences, although CpG dinucleotides in oligodeoxynucleotides or other DNA sequences can activate antiviral gene expression through TLR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hemmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorn and Kippenberger, 2008</xref>). In addition, removing CpGs from a transgene drastically improved its expression in vivo while at the same time reducing cytokine expression and increasing the persistence of the transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yew et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hodges et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyde et al., 2008</xref>). Although also in this system, TLR9 was shown to be indispensable as persistent transgene expression in TLR9 knock out mice still required complete removal of CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazzani et al., 2016</xref>). Together this indicates the existence of a TLR9 independent mechanism that detects CpG dinucleotides in transcripts.</p><p>Alternatively, ssRNA sequences may be recognised in endosomes by TLR7 and TLR8. GU-rich and AU-rich sequences have been identified as preferential TLR7/8 activator, enhancing cytokine expression of IFN-α and TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lund et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diebold et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, an additional CpG dinucleotide in an AU-rich context enhances TLR7 mediated cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jimenez-Baranda et al., 2011</xref>). However, the cell types used in this study are not known to express detectable levels of TLR7/8, nor do increased CpG dinucleotide frequencies in either E7 or influenza viruses upregulate TLR7/8 specific cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaunt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that TLR7/8 signalling is at the heart of the observed restriction. The TLR protein family contains a number of additional molecules, however for some their function in pathogen recognition and especially subsequent induction of protein expression remain unknown (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Satoh and Akira, 2016</xref>]) Furthermore, the absence of any differences in ISG expression between WT and mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaunt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>) together with the complete lack of any inducible antiviral response to UpA and CpG containing RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) makes a controlling role for interferon-coupled responses to such mutants highly unlikely.</p><p>Picornaviruses furthermore are particularly well armoured against IFN-mediated cellular responses that reduces the likelihood of any role in attenuating CpG- or UpA-high mutants. The enterovirus-encoded 2C protease cleaves a variety of host factors (i.e. MAVS, MDA5, RIG-I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barral et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2009</xref>) and renders this PRR-linked pathway non-functional during virus replication. E7 replication was relatively insensitive to effects of pre-treating cells with high concentrations of exogenous IFN-α, nor were CpG- or UpA-high mutant differentially inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Several other aspects of the attenuation phenomenon similarly argue against a role of standard RNA virus recognition pathways in mediating the attenuation of CpG- or UpA-high viruses. Firstly, inhibition of replication was observed immediately after infection of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) before significant induction of ISGs, and the restriction mechanism appeared to prevent the establishment of replication complexes rather than inhibit virus expression once formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Furthermore, using several experimental formats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), the absence of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting effect of high CpG- or UpA- co-expressed RNAs or co-transfected replicons on the replication of a compositionally normal reporter replicon demonstrates that these compositionally altered RNAs do not induce a cellular antiviral state that makes cells generally non-permissive for virus replication. Such cellular responses would be expected if inhibition was mediated through ISGs or stress-induced translational arrest.</p><p>Remarkably, it additionally appears that CpG is not the necessary and sufficient requirement for virus attenuation since bases upstream and downstream appear critical for attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The 3’ extension provided complete freedom to insert RNA sequences of any composition into the replicon, freed from coding constraint. Our initial experiments placing U or A residues either side of CpG while keeping total CpGs the same as WT and overall base composition constant provides an example of the utility of this construct in the future dissection of recognition motifs. In these initial experiments, simply placing A/U on either side of CpG produced levels of attenuation of replicons that approached that of the CpG-high R1 mutant, despite possessing identical numbers of CpG residues to WT sequence. This context dependence is consistent with previous observation of suppression of CpG in an AU context in genome sequences of influenza A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jimenez-Baranda et al., 2011</xref>), reflecting perhaps the avoidance of more potent recognition motifs than CpG alone.</p><p>Finally, the observation that plant viruses suppress CpG (and UpA) dinucleotide frequencies as much or even more intensively than vertebrate viruses leads to the tantalising possibility that the attenuation mechanism might be fundamental to eukaryotic virus defence and evolutionarily conserved and constantly active over the many hundreds of millions of years of eukaryote evolution. Animal and plant cells however differ almost entirely in their use and mechanism of action of PRRs, the latter depending more on siRNA-mediated silencing of viruses and some elements of the stress response observed in vertebrate cells. Enterovirus 71 protein 3A was recently shown to be a viral suppressor of RNA interference (VSR) in vertebrate cells. Without a functional VSR Echovirus 71 replication was reduced through activation of the RNA interference pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). However, if such pathways were indeed shared between animals and plants, we obtained little evidence for stress response pathways nor siRNA-induced viral silencing being involved as mediators of E7 attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Concerning the latter pathway, there is nothing in the mode of action of siRNAs in either recognition or effector pathways that would seem capable of causing the dinucleotide composition related differences in replication efficacy. Extension of the experimental approach used in the current study to plant viruses and other virus/host interactions may contribute to the identification of what may ultimately represent a novel and undocumented mechanism of eukaryotic virus control.</p><p>In summary, the recognition and restriction mechanisms that attenuate the replication of CpG- and UpA-high mutant appear to lie outside the conventional paradigm of virus control by innate cellular immune pathways. Although mechanistically unclear, the restriction mechanism exerts a powerful evolutionary constraint on vertebrate RNA viruses to judge from the widespread suppression of CpG and UpA frequencies in viruses with major differences in replication strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Design, construction and recovery of E7 viruses with various nucleotide compositions in R2 were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>).

In short; both R1 and R2 sequences included a wild type (WT), permutated control (P), CpG and UpA low (cu), UpA high (U) and CpG high (C) variant. Using the restriction sites <italic>SalI</italic> and <italic>HpaI</italic> for R1 and <italic>EcoRI</italic> and <italic>BglII</italic> for R2 the various R1 sequences were introduced into the 3’ non-coding region of E7, creating E7 with 3’-ncR1 variants and the R2 sequences into the original coding sequence of E7 with 3’-ncR1_WT.</p><p>The R1 sequence was further altered such that it contained an equal amount of CpG (51) and UpA (62) dinucleotides to WT R1, but that the context of all CpG dinucleotides was altered, surrounding CpG dinucleotides either with two adenines or two thymines on either side of the dinucleotide, resulting in 51 AACGAA or UUCGUU motifs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These sequences were then cloned into the 3’ noncoding region of E7 via the described <italic>SalI</italic> and <italic>HpaI</italic> restriction sites, creating E7 with ncR1_AACGAA or ncR1_UUCGUU. Replication defective mutants of the E7 replicons with ncR1 of WT and CpG high composition were created by site-directed mutagenesis of a highly conserved motif within the viral polymerase GDD into GND. The mutation was introduced using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit from Agilent with E7-GND F and E7-GND R primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>The 800 nucleotides 3201–4000 from the E7 genome were selected for being of average E7 nucleotide composition. The nucleotide order was non-synonymously scrambled with the NOR function in SSE. Subsequently the CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies were restored to wild type ratios (O/E 0.546 and 0.649, respectively), creating a normalised synthetic sequence (S_Norm). Variants of S_Norm were created by removing all CpG and UpA dinucleotides (S_cu), or increasing UpA (S_U) or CpG (S_C) dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Sequences were synthesised (Geneart) with 5’ <italic>HpaI - AscI</italic> and 3’ <italic>MluI –SalI</italic> restriction sites and ligated into the above described pRiboE7luc vector via the introduced <italic>SalI</italic> and <italic>HpaI</italic> restriction sites, creating E7 with 3’-non-coding (ncS) variants. Next the newly introduced regions were digested with <italic>AscI</italic> and <italic>SalI</italic> and ligated into the <italic>MluI</italic> and <italic>SalI</italic> sites of the E7 with 3’ ncS variants to generate single (800 nt) and double (1600 nt) linear repeats of the ncS variants in the noncoding region of the E7 replicon.</p><p>The E7 EGFP replicon was constructed by replacing the firefly luciferase from the luciferase expressing E7 replicon with 3’-ncR1 of WT composition for EGFP using <italic>KasI</italic> and <italic>KflI</italic> restriction sites. Subsequently the ncR1 of WT composition was replaced by ncR1 of P, cu, U and C composition as described above.</p><p>R2 sequences of various nucleotide compositions were amplified by PCR while adding 5’ -<italic>EcoRI</italic> and 3’-<italic>ApaI</italic> restriction sites and additional nucleotides that enabled transcription of the R2 sequences but prevented their translation (R2_EcoRI Fwd and R2_ApaI Rev primers for each R2 mutant sequence, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The same restriction sites were used to clone the sequences into a previously published pcDNA/DEST40 backbone downstream of the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fros et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Virus replication</title><p>RD cells were seeded at 1 × 10<sup>∧</sup>5 cells per well in 24-well plates and subsequently infected with the wild-type (WT) E7 or E7 R2 mutants at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 1000 E7 RNA copies per cell.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CpG and UpA dinucleotides in both coding and non-coding regions of echovirus 7 inhibit replication initiation post-entry&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, one of whom, Steve Goodbourn is a Guest Editor and the evaluation has been overseen by Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bert Rima (reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript of Fros et al. contributes to an ongoing debate about the nature of restriction/attenuation associated with certain types of synthetic viruses. The group of Wimmer generates attenuated viruses based on de-optimising the codon usage of these viruses; one particular feature that enhances attenuation is the use of atypical pairs of adjacent codons (the so-called codon pair bias), a feature that manifests itself by alterations in viral protein synthesis, presumably due to direct effects on viral translation. Simmonds' group (the submitting authors here) have previously challenged this interpretation by suggesting that unknown cellular restriction factors inhibit virus replication by acting on RNA sequences that are CpG-rich or UpA-rich and that this is not simply a feature of codon pair bias. A high-profile exchange between these two groups has effectively left the issue unresolved. The manuscript submitted here offers convincing proof that restriction can act in a manner that is independent of the translational process (it does not exclude the latter from also being a possibility under some circumstances). By generating a replicon system for the echovirus E7 in which sequences can be added in the untranslated region the authors have unambiguously shown that CpG- and UpA-rich sequences are as effective at restricting replication, as are equivalent changes made in the viral open reading frames; all that appears to be needed is that these sequence features are somewhere in the RNA.</p><p>The most disappointing aspect of the paper is the lack of mechanism. Although the authors have undertaken a reasonable amount of work to look at what may underlie the restriction they have so far drawn a blank. However, in their attempts to show us just how hard they've looked the authors present a considerable body of negative data. This is wholly unnecessary and indeed gets in the way of the core message. Additionally, there are points in the text where the description is rather cryptic, again making it possible to miss the point.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript describes a wide-ranging series of experiments that, for the most part, are well-executed and rigorous, and offers an advance on our current understanding of this RNA composition-based restriction that should allow this problem to be opened up to further research. However, there are some conclusions reached by the authors that either need modification or additional experimental evidence to support.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1). Apart from the data which show that the IFN system is not involved, all of the information about what genes are not involved should be removed. There seems little point in looking at cell lines with defects in individual components in the IFN system.</p><p>2). If the target for the C16 compound is not known (and it is unlikely to be PKR) then it adds little if anything to the text and so should be removed.</p><p>3). The text is often tortuous and occasionally misleading. Based on the early part of the paper readers may conclude that the CpG/UpA effects are mediated by things such as changes to the secondary structure of the UTR altering translation rate, or perhaps altering mRNA stability. In fact, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show that this is not so, as it appears that all of the mRNAs are equally effective at directing luciferase synthesis. It would be helpful if this was clearly spelt out.</p><p>4). Since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> provides key evidence that the mechanism of action is downstream from simple RNA stability or primary translation it is disappointing that the experimental support for this is limited. The use of guanidine hydrochloride as a blocker of replication seems rather non-specific to readers who are not experts in picornavirus biology; the authors either need to provide considerably more convincing literature support for the idea that this is the norm in this field, or they need to compare their data with a replication-defective control. They might also provide more direct evidence of the RNA integrity or translatability (e.g. RNA mapping, in-vitro translation).</p><p>5). Again, regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, a time-course is needed to compare translation (in the presence of GuHCl) and translation/RNA replication (in the absence of GuHCl). A single six hour time point is not sufficient to fully explore the complexities of what happens to the RNA over time with these different replicons, especially since the transfections are carried out in both human and rodent cell lines. There is probably a wide variation in overall luciferase signals, but this is not made clear because the authors have normalized the data without showing us the raw values; the authors should show the raw values of luciferase, not just the relative values. That way, the reader can assess the signal to noise ratio in the absence of RNA replication.</p><p>6). The manuscript routinely reports the use of three biological replicates. These are said to be independent, and not technical, but this is not further defined. Were they conducted at the same time, or at different times (with the same batch of cells or differing by days or weeks)? If these are strong biological replicates, why is not more use made of statistical analysis?</p><p>7). Generally, the dinucleotide effect is stronger for CpG than UpA. In Vero cells, however, the two were much closer for the coding region variants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). This seems to be dismissed (&quot;similarly restricted mutated E7 viruses comparable to that of other cultured kidney cells tested in this study&quot;). This should not be relegated to a supplemental figure. Why were Vero cells not assayed for the NCR variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)? Given their discrimination between CpG and UpA it would have been useful to see them used for localisation studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p>8). The paper sometimes has a &quot;gladiatorial&quot; feel to it (e.g. subsection “Relative replication rates, dinucleotide frequencies, codon usage and translational efficiency “). While accepting that this work clearly indicates that there is a restriction point caused by changes to RNA composition that is not operating at the level of simple translation, the reviewers feel that the differences between the Simmonds and Wimmer labs are not necessarily resolved, or that they may be looking at effects that are either different or only partly overlapping. A revised paper should be less confrontational.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29112.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1).

However, in Atkinson et al., 2014 it was shown that C16 allows viruses attenuated by UpA/CpG high regions to regain most of their replication ability. As this is the first time we use the replicon with such RNA sequences in non-coding regions it was important to demonstrate mechanistically that such replicons were subject to the same biological constraints as infectious viruses, even if the mechanism for the reversal of the attenuated phenotype by C16 remains undetermined. We have changed the text to emphasize this and moved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, as the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplements also serve to characterise and validate the E7 replicons with extended non-coding regions. In accordance, the paragraph describing these experiments has also been moved (Now in subsection “Restriction of viral RNA replication with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies is independent of coding sequence “).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3). The text is often tortuous and occasionally misleading. Based on the early part of the paper readers may conclude that the CpG/UpA effects are mediated by things such as changes to the secondary structure of the UTR altering translation rate, or perhaps altering mRNA stability. In fact, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> show that this is not so, as it appears that all of the mRNAs are equally effective at directing luciferase synthesis. It would be helpful if this was clearly spelt out.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to subsection “Restriction of viral RNA replication with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies is independent of coding sequence”“Similar replication was observed in the replicon with the R1 permuted control (P) that retained identical CpG and UpA frequencies to the WT control. This indicates that the replication structures in the 3’-UTR are not affected by the addition of 1242 nucleotides to the 5’-end of the 3’-UTR.” to the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and changed the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to make clear the observed effects are not caused by differences in translation due to altered RNA structures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4). Since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> provides key evidence that the mechanism of action is downstream from simple RNA stability or primary translation it is disappointing that the experimental support for this is limited. The use of guanidine hydrochloride as a blocker of replication seems rather non-specific to readers who are not experts in picornavirus biology; the authors either need to provide considerably more convincing literature support for the idea that this is the norm in this field, or they need to compare their data with a replication-defective control. They might also provide more direct evidence of the RNA integrity or translatability (e.g. RNA mapping, in-vitro translation).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and to independently investigate luciferase expression from a non-replicating RNA, we have created replication defective mutants through site-directed mutagenesis in the polymerase gene of the E7 replicons with WT and CpG-high non-coding R1 extension. Luciferase expression was investigated in the same format as the experiment using GuHCl, A time-course experiment (see point 5) was performed for both these and replicons treated with GuHCl and the results have been added as panel A and B to the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in the revised manuscript). In addition, we have provided references that describe the specific inhibition of enterovirus replication by GuHCl to subsection “Restriction of viral RNA replication with increased CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies is independent of coding sequence”: “It is well established that GuHCl effectively inhibits picornavirus RNA replication through inhibiting initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis and RNA strand elongation (Barton and Flanegan, 1997; Pfister and Wimmer, 1999)” to make the effects of GuHCl on picornavirus replication more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5). Again, regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5, a</xref> time-course is needed to compare translation (in the presence of GuHCl) and translation/RNA replication (in the absence of GuHCl). A single six hour time point is not sufficient to fully explore the complexities of what happens to the RNA over time with these different replicons, especially since the transfections are carried out in both human and rodent cell lines. There is probably a wide variation in overall luciferase signals, but this is not made clear because the authors have normalized the data without showing us the raw values; the authors should show the raw values of luciferase, not just the relative values. That way, the reader can assess the signal to noise ratio in the absence of RNA replication.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the experiment could be conducted in a more informative way and that it would be important to show actual luciferase expression levels instead of values normalised to untreated cells. In the revised manuscript, we now present the results of a time-course experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref> in replicons treated and untreated with GuHCl in standard RD cells. In response to comment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barton and Flanegan, 1997</xref>) we have performed a similar time-course experiment in parallel with replication-defective replicons with ncR1 of WT and CpG-high composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To more broadly demonstrate effects of nucleotide frequency modification in replicating and non-replicating constructs in different cell lines, we have re-organised the presentation of data from the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in a more informative format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) that shows reductions in luciferase expression of CpG mutants relative to WT in replicating and non-replicating contexts. In addition, we show the luciferase expression of UpA mutants relative to WT and the raw luciferase values from these experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This shows that in a range of cell lines, the presence of a high CpG / UpA extension to the replicon confers no systematic difference in expression in gene expression in a non-replicating system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6). The manuscript routinely reports the use of three biological replicates. These are said to be independent, and not technical, but this is not further defined. Were they conducted at the same time, or at different times (with the same batch of cells or differing by days or weeks)? If these are strong biological replicates, why is not more use made of statistical analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the Materials and methods section “statistical analyses” that explains our definition of biological replicates and also what software packages were used for the statistical analyses. As indicated, biological replicates were performed at different times with different batches of cells and independently diluted stocks of replicon RNA or virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7). Generally, the dinucleotide effect is stronger for CpG than UpA. In Vero cells, however, the two were much closer for the coding region variants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). This seems to be dismissed (&quot;similarly restricted mutated E7 viruses comparable to that of other cultured kidney cells tested in this study&quot;). This should not be relegated to a supplemental figure. Why were Vero cells not assayed for the NCR variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)? Given their discrimination between CpG and UpA it would have been useful to see them used for localisation studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that some of the information in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is done more justice when not relegated to the supplementary figures. For this reason we have merged <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 into a single <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and changed the text accordingly.</p><p>With regards to Vero cells, all tested cells originating from the kidney displayed a smaller attenuating phenotype for CpG high viruses in comparison to other cell types. This is stated in lines 130-133. Although Vero cells do show the smallest attenuating phenotype for CpG high virus, this is still relatively similar to the other kidney cell types Hek293, 293T and nb324k (with respective RRRs of: 0.07, 0.07, 0.08 compared to 0.15 for Vero cells). We have changed the text to provide a more accurate description of E7 replication in Vero cells (Results section in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Finally, Vero cells were assayed with non-coding Region 1 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In these experiments the relative replication rates of the compositionally different replicons was almost identical to that other cells. This indicates that UpA and CpG high viral RNA replication is subjected to the same constraints in Vero cells in comparison to the other cell types tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8). The paper sometimes has a &quot;gladiatorial&quot; feel to it (e.g. subsection “Relative replication rates, dinucleotide frequencies, codon usage and translational efficiency“). While accepting that this work clearly indicates that there is a restriction point caused by changes to RNA composition that is not operating at the level of simple translation, the reviewers feel that the differences between the Simmonds and Wimmer labs are not necessarily resolved, or that they may be looking at effects that are either different or only partly overlapping. A revised paper should be less confrontational.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very sorry that the paper had a confrontational “feel” and we have modified the region of the discussion where we may have contributed most to this impression. Very clearly, translation efficiency is a factor that may also govern the replication of viruses and have now fully acknowledged this in the revised paragraph. We have furthermore highlighted that differences in replication mechanism between RNA viruses (including the E7 model used in the current study) and DNA / retroviruses may influence to extent to which the influences of dinucleotide and codon/codon pair usage may differ. As mentioned above, we agree that there is room for additional (perhaps partly overlapping) mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article></article>
