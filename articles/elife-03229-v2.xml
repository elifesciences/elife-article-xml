associations encompass widespread biological interactions. To dissect the chemical signals and the genes mediating this association, we investigated the effect of an oriental beetle sex pheromone on the development and behavior of the nematode <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic>. We found that while the beetle pheromone is attractive to <italic>P. pacificus</italic> adults, the pheromone arrests embryo development, paralyzes J2 larva, and inhibits exit of dauer larvae. To uncover the mechanism that regulates insect pheromone sensitivity, a newly identified mutant, <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>, is used to reveal the molecular links between altered attraction towards the beetle pheromone, as well as hypersensitivity to its paralyzing effects. <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> encodes lipid-binding domains and reaches its highest expression in various cell types, including the amphid neuron sheath and excretory cells.

This ecologically important interaction is called necromeny. <italic>P. pacificus</italic> is attracted to a new host by a sex pheromone produced by the beetle, but the genes and biological mechanisms that enable this interaction to occur are not understood in much detail.</p><p>To identify the genetic basis of this interaction, Cinkornpumin et al. identified and examined a mutant form of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> that cannot sense the beetle sex pheromone. This revealed that although this pheromone attracts the adult nematodes, it stops <italic>P. pacificus</italic> embryos developing and can paralyze larvae. Cinkornpumin et al. suggest that the pheromone has likely evolved this ability in order to counteract the spread of the nematodes. This result implies that being invaded by <italic>P. pacificus</italic> makes life more difficult for the beetles than was previously thought.</p><p>Further investigation of the gene damaged in the <italic>P. pacificus</italic> mutants revealed that it encodes a protein that may bind to molecules called lipids, which are needed to form cell membranes and are used in cell signaling. As well as helping the nematodes to detect the sex pheromone, the lipid-binding protein also appears to help protect the worms from the pheromone's detrimental effects.</p><p>Cinkornpumin et al. observed that the gene for the lipid-binding protein is activated in several tissues, including the cells that form a sheath around some of the nerves that detect chemical signals. Whether this tissue is responsible for the chemical-sensing abilities of the lipid-binding protein, and whether these same tissues are responsible for protecting the nematodes from the damaging effects of the pheromone, remains to be discovered.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03229.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03229.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic></kwd><kwd>necromeny</kwd><kwd>insect pheromones</kwd><kwd>lipid-binding protein</kwd><kwd>chemosensation</kwd><kwd>nematode</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SC2GM089602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Ray L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005546</institution-id><institution>Center for California Studies, California State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research and Scholarship Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Ray L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000888</institution-id><institution>W.M.

For example, the genes responsible for fruit and bacterial odor preferences in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are most informative when considering the natural ecologies in rotting fruits and vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hallem and Carlson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kiontke and Sudhaus, 2006</xref>). In <italic>Pristionchus pacificus</italic>, an emerging model organism for the study of development and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong and Sommer, 2006b</xref>), a systematic effort to identify the natural ecology of <italic>Pristionchus</italic> nematodes revealed that <italic>P. pacificus</italic> host preferences include the oriental beetle (<italic>Exomala orientalis</italic>) found in Japan and northeastern United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrmann et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike several fructivorous <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, <italic>Pristionchus</italic> species are considered to be necromenic nematodes that have species-specific beetle host preferences and feed on the microorganisms that emerge from the beetle carcass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herrmann et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Pristionchus</italic> species are members of the Diplogasteridae family of nematodes whose common ancestor with the Rhabditidae family (<italic>e.g., C. elegans</italic>) diverged ∼300 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dieterich et al., 2008</xref>). Given that beetles (Coleoptera) represent a group with the most described species, the possibility that most beetle species can harbor specific entomophilic nematode associations underscores the vast number of nematode species remaining to be described. Although biologists have been aware of such species-specific insect–nematode associations for some time, the genetic basis for such interactions remains largely unknown.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that the beetle host specificity of <italic>Pristionchus</italic> species is in part due to nematode attraction to various plant volatile compounds released during beetle feeding, as well as to beetle aggregation and sex pheromones during mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong and Sommer, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hong et al., 2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2008a</xref>). For example, <italic>Pristionchus maupasi</italic> associates primarily with the European May beetle <italic>Melolontha</italic> spp. and is attracted to the blend of the green leaf alcohol from plants and the phenol pheromone from beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hong et al., 2008b</xref>). Thus, insect and plant odors can synergize to provide nematodes with information on host presence, sex, and maturity. By contrast, <italic>C. elegans</italic> attractants such as 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl), 2,3-pentanedione, and isoamyl alcohol are significantly less attractive to <italic>P. pacificus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong and Sommer, 2006a</xref>). This piggybacking of intra-species communication for inter-species interactions between <italic>Pristionchus</italic> and beetles can also evolve rapidly at the population level, as exhibited by the natural variation of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> odor preference for insect pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGaughran et al., 2013b</xref>). In particular, <italic>P. pacificus</italic> Washington strain (PS1843) is attracted to the lepidopteran sex pheromone <italic>E</italic>-11-tetradecenyl acetate (ETDA) and the oriental beetle sex pheromone <italic>z</italic>-7-tetradece-2-one (ZTDO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrmann et al., 2007</xref>), but the wild-type reference strain from California (PS312) requires exogenous cGMP treatment to become attracted to these insect pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2008a</xref>). These natural variations in insect pheromone attraction, combined with regional-specific <italic>P. pacificus</italic> host preferences, may offer support for the geographic mosaic theory of co-evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although the distinct chemosensory profiles of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> populations suggest insect pheromone attraction to be an important and rapidly evolving trait, other studies on insect–nematode interactions show that there are other potential roles host chemicals can play in coordinating host–parasite development and nematode dispersal behavior. For example, the pinewood nematode <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic> is intimately associated with its <italic>Monochamus</italic> beetle vector, and fatty acid ethyl esters exuded during beetle eclosion promote the formation of the dispersal fourth larval stage <italic>B. xylophilus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the species-specific phoretic association between the burrower bug <italic>Parastrachia japonensis</italic> and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis japonica</italic> may be mediated by the beetle cuticular compounds that not only attract <italic>C. japonica</italic> but also assist infestation by inhibiting <italic>C. japonica</italic> dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okumura et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>P. pacificus</italic> populations have been found on various beetle hosts worldwide, but the association with the oriental beetle was the first to be identified and the only one whose sex pheromone is a strong attractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McGaughran et al., 2013b</xref>). Therefore, the oriental beetle sex pheromone represents the single most ecologically relevant semiochemical by which we could repeatedly interrogate the <italic>P. pacificus</italic> genes involved for host sensing and other unexplored developmental roles.</p><p>In this study, we show that although the beetle pheromone, ZTDO, is attractive to <italic>P. pacificus</italic> adults, the beetle host pheromone may moderate nematode infection by arresting embryonic development, inducing larval paralysis, and inhibiting dauer exit. We leveraged the ability to use exogenous cGMP to potentiate the California reference strain for ZTDO attraction to find additional genes important for ZTDO sensitivity by performing an unbiased forward genetic screen for mutants with altered responses to ZTDO. We found that a putative lipid-binding protein <italic>Ppa-</italic>OBI-1 mediates both beetle pheromone attraction as well as a previously unknown role of the beetle pheromone to regulate <italic>P. pacificus</italic> development. Our results suggest that the host pheromone may play a complex role in reducing infection or coordinating development for the dispersal cycle of the necromenic lifestyle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> mutants show altered ZTDO attraction</title><p><italic>P. pacificus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> have diametrically opposed odor preference profiles. <italic>Pristionchus</italic> species are generally attracted to plant volatiles, insect pheromones, and cuticular hydrocarbons, but each <italic>Pristionchus</italic> species can have its own chemosensory profile reflective of its preferred beetle hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong and Sommer, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGaughran et al., 2013a</xref>). <italic>P. pacificus</italic> populations found on the oriental beetle <italic>E. orientalis</italic> in Japan and northeastern United States are attracted to the sex pheromone of the beetle, z-7-tetradecen-2-one (ZTDO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrmann et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the compost-dwelling <italic>C. elegans</italic> is less attracted to or even repelled by plant and insect odors, including ZTDO, but is strongly attracted to small compounds released by microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong and Sommer, 2006a</xref>).</p><p>To identify genes required to mediate ZTDO attraction in a pheromone-insensitive reference strain, California PS312, we performed a behavior-based genetic screen for mutants that are insensitive toward ZTDO following a brief 1-hr treatment with the cell-permeable 8-br-cGMP.

The chemosensory phenotype of <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> and <italic>Ppa-obi-3</italic> is strongly specific for ZTDO and does not affect the chemoattraction towards other insect pheromones ETDA and myristate nor plant volatiles β-caryophyllene and nicotine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Odor avoidance in <italic>obi</italic> mutants towards 1-octanol, a repellant common between <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans,</italic> also resembles wild type.

Interestingly, the Washington strain that has natural cGMP-independent attraction to ZTDO was more resistant to 0.25–0.50% ZTDO than the ZTDO-insensitive California strain. Although ZTDO exposure had no noticeable effect on egg laying output by adult hermaphrodites, eggs continuously exposed to ZTDO for 2 days at an early stage remain arrested at the pre-comma globular embryonic stage, before gastrulation. The embryocidal effect of ZTDO was concentration-dependent and species-specific, since wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> eggs were completely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> hypersensitivity to the developmental and paralyzing effects of ZTDO also continued into the subsequent J2 and J4 larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Both wild-type PS312 and <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> J2 larvae exhibited ZTDO-induced paralysis, while the Washington strain was significantly more resistant to paralysis. However, by the J4 larval stage, only <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> was sensitive to ZTDO compared to both wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> J4 larvae exposed to ZTDO displayed initial agitation, followed by full body paralysis between 90 and 120 min. In contrast, wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> J4 larvae displayed only minute sensitivity to ZTDO. To determine if the <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> mutation renders it susceptible to paralysis from other insect pheromones, we also tested the moth pheromone ETDA and found that the J4 larvae of <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> and the wild-type strains were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). All strains, including <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404),</italic> were insensitive to ZTDO-induced paralysis when they reach adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), the dominant stage used in our chemotaxis assays. Taken together, our findings show that ZTDO is capable of arresting wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> embryogenesis and severely paralyzing J2 larvae, indicating that ZTDO is a potential host-specific developmental regulator. We speculate that wild-type <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 may serve to protect <italic>P. pacificus</italic> embryos and reproductive larvae against the volatile anesthetic-like effects of ZTDO from the adult beetle host.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ZTDO inhibits dauer larva exit in <italic>P. pacificus</italic></title><p>The dauer larva (DL) is an alternative, non-reproductive, long-lasting stage in nematodes capable of withstanding starvation, as well as the infective stage in parasitic nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee, 2002</xref>). To explore the possibility that ZTDO also acts to restrain the dispersive stage of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> development after hatching, we asked if ZTDO can also regulate DL exit in the presence of food using culturing plates containing 0.001–0.01% ZTDO and bacteria. Nearly all untreated wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> DL developed into J4 larvae after 2 days on food, whereas ∼40% of the wild-type worms remained as active DL on 0.01% ZTDO with OP50 food that would have otherwise promoted reproductive development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However for <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> DL, this dauer exit defect is exacerbated by ZTDO due to paralysis. Approximately 80% of the developmentally blocked <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> DL show immobility on 0.001% ZTDO, and nearly 95% of the <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> DL became paralyzed on 0.01% ZTDO. Although DL is the primary infective stage in many entomophilic nematodes found on live beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weller et al., 2010</xref>), we were unable to assess DL's chemotaxis response to ZTDO because of its immobilizing effect on DL. The negative regulation of DL exit by ZTDO is specific to <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and barely affected <italic>C. elegans</italic> even at 0.01% ZTDO. These results show that 0.01% ZTDO can block active wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> DL from progressing to the reproductive stage without causing paralysis, but 0.001–0.01% ZTDO significantly reduced dauer exit in <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> DL by primarily inducing paralysis and death.</p><p>Since <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> has a defect in DL exit that is further enhanced by exposure to ZTDO, we asked if DL arrest in <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> by ZTDO is similarly dependent on <italic>Ppa</italic>-EGL-4 function. <italic>Egl-4</italic> mutants are defective in a cGMP-dependent protein kinase in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> which affect dauer formation as well as chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daniels et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">L'Etoile et al., 2002</xref>). We found that while the <italic>Ppa-egl-4(tu374)</italic> loss-of-function mutation did not significantly affect the ability to exit the dauer stage, the <italic>Ppa-egl-4(tu374)</italic> mutation in the <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> background did partially suppress the inhibitory effect of ZTDO, such that <italic>Ppa-egl-4;Ppa-obi-1</italic> post-dauer development on 0.001% ZTDO is higher than <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The <italic>Ppa-egl-4(tu374)</italic> mutation did not, however, reduce the ZTDO inhibition of DL exit in the presence of a higher amount of 0.01% ZTDO. This outcome suggests that the susceptibility of <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> DL to ZTDO is partially dependent on <italic>Ppa-egl-4</italic>. While the loss of <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> alone can cause reduced rate of DL exit on food independent of ZTDO, the aggravated DL arrest by ZTDO in <italic>Ppa-obi-1(tu404)</italic> is partially mediated by Ppa-<italic>egl-4.</italic></p><p>Although wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> adult animals are attracted to ZTDO, the host beetle sex pheromone regulates <italic>P. pacificus</italic> development by inhibiting embryogenesis, restricting DL exit, and inducing paralysis in larval stages.

By contrast, the PS1843 Washington strain that is naturally attracted to ZTDO is more resistant to ZTDO in non-dauer stages compared to the PS312 California wild type.

While small changes in sequence can lead to large changes in protein function, the absence of expression of the <italic>C. elegans obi-1</italic> ortholog in amphid sheath cells suggests that changes in gene expression pattern may also play a role in determining ZTDO sensitivity. We therefore sought to determine if the <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> ortholog <italic>C06G1.1</italic> have shared tissue expression with <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>. We examined endogenous <italic>C06G1.1p::gfp</italic> expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in five independent transgenic lines with extrachromosomal arrays and found strong mid-L4 larvae expression in the seam cells, two tail hypodermal cells, four cells in the excretory duct system (duct, excretory, gland cells), vulval muscles, and possible IL or OLQ sheath or socket neuronal support cells similar to the expression pattern observed for <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–H</xref>). In contrast to the earliest <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> expression in pre-comma stage, <italic>C06G1.1</italic> expression is detectable during late embryogenesis in putative seam cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This seam cell expression is earlier than <italic>Ppa-obi-1p::gfp</italic> in the L1 stage, and is maintained until the young adult stage. A reason for this earlier seam cell expression could be that the equivalent <italic>P. pacificus</italic> J1 larvae remain inside the egg while <italic>C. elegans</italic> eggs hatch as L1 larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fürst von Lieven, 2005</xref>). Like <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>, <italic>C06G1.1</italic> expression is largely absent in all tissue types when the transgenic animals become 1-day old adult hermaphrodites, coinciding with the fusion of seam cells into a syncytium. This observation indicates that <italic>C06G1.1</italic> expression in the excretory and epithelial system may be coordinated and involved in seam cell development.</p><p>Our expression analysis of <italic>obi-1</italic> orthologs in the their respective nematode species revealed that the most striking difference is the lack of expression in the amphid sheath cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that unlike <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>, <italic>C06G1.1</italic> is not likely to function directly with chemosensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

To explore yet another possibility that changes in both protein function and expression may lead to differences in ZTDO sensitivity, we expressed the <italic>Ppa-obi-1:cDNA</italic> under the <italic>C. elegans</italic> amphid sheath cell-specific promoters <italic>T02B11.3</italic> and <italic>F16F9.3</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kramer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oikonomou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Procko et al., 2011</xref>).

While the targeted misexpression of <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> did not alter the strong avoidance behavior towards either 2% or 10% ZTDO, <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> did reduce the paralytic effects of ZTDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 is not susceptible to ZTDO-induced paralysis at 0.5% ZTDO that <italic>P. pacificus</italic> is, we increased the stringency of the assay by using 10% ZTDO, incubating for 16 hr, and exposing the animals in the absence of OP50 food.

Because we could not detect apparent differences in GFP expression patterns between the two amphid promoters, the ability of <italic>F16F9.3p::Ppa-obi-1:gfp</italic> to reduce ZTDO paralysis may be due to subtle transient expression differences. These results suggest that while the expression of the <italic>Ppa-</italic>OBI-1 protein in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> amphid sheath cells is not sufficient to reduce avoidance to ZTDO, it can contribute to the <italic>obi-1</italic>-dependent protection from ZTDO-induced paralysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Every organismal interaction is a legacy of its evolutionary arms race. We have identified an important and likely co-evolving trait in the interaction between <italic>P. pacifcus</italic> nematodes and its beetle hosts. Although not symbiotic, necromenic associations between nematodes and insects have been considered commensalistic or mutualistic, but our results suggest antagonistic interactions between the larval stages of <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and the adult oriental beetle hosts that produce the ZTDO sex pheromone. Attraction and resistance to ZTDO in adult <italic>P. pacificus</italic> further points to a refined attenuated antagonism in their co-evolutionary relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson, 2005</xref>). Our data support the model that <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 is required to protect <italic>P. pacificus</italic> larvae against a host beetle pheromone ZTDO as well as to enable <italic>P. pacificus</italic> attraction to ZTDO. Furthermore, two different geographical isolates and developmental stages have varied responses to the oriental beetle pheromone. ZTDO may be a species-specific volatile synomone that acts through a lipid-binding protein to moderate nematode infection by arresting embryonic development, inducing larval paralysis, and inhibiting dauer exit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first genetically defined reception to a species-specific compound mediating the interaction between a nematode and its insect host.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 in ZTDO sensitivity</title><p>Sensitivity to ZTDO-induced paralysis/arrest is <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>-dependent predominantly during the J4 larval stage and, to a lesser degree, in the embryos and dauers.

Based on this species-specific expression pattern, we are tempted to speculate that these chemosensory glial cells, the IL and amphid sheath cells, play a dominant role in mediating ZTDO sensitivity. However, additional experiments will be needed to test the possibility that epidermal cells such as the vulva, hypodermis, and seam cells, or cells in the excretory system may also mediate ZTDO sensing.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03229.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Summary and model of the oriental beetle pheromone ZTDO on <italic>P</italic>. <italic>pacificus</italic> development and lifecycle.</title><p>(Top) Peak <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> expression in the wild-type J4 larvae coincides with the least sensitive developmental stage to the paralytic effects of the beetle pheromone ZTDO (at 0.5%). <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> mutants are most sensitive to ZTDO-induced paralysis in the J4 stage.

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, many proteins have enriched expression in the amphid sheath, such as DAF-6 and the secreted venom allergen-like VAP-1, and these secretions are corroborated by dense populations of vesicles in amphid sheath cells under electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacaj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doroquez et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not yet known which amphid proteins, if any, are required in processing odors using behavioral assays. Interestingly, DAF-6 is a Patched-related protein with expression pattern that overlaps with <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> expression (amphid lumen, excretory canal, vulva lumen) and is required for chemotaxis and dauer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perens and Shaham, 2005</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> expression in the putative sheath or socket cells of the inner labial neurons may also be involved in ZTDO sensing, as recent ultrastructural electron micrograph reconstructions indicate that BAG (gas sensing) and FLP (nociceptive) neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> associate closely with the socket cells of the inner labial sensillae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doroquez et al., 2014</xref>). One possible mode of action for ZTDO may be its ability to change cell membrane permeability, thereby indirectly affecting the functions of the glia-associated neurons. Hence, <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 may function to counter the cell membrane permeability changes brought about by ZTDO by interacting with cell membrane lipids. Alternatively, <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 could mediate pheromone binding directly. In lepidopterans such as the wild silk moth <italic>Antheraea polyphemus</italic> and the cotton leafworm <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic>, pheromone-degrading and odorant-degrading enzymes (PDEs and ODEs) are esterases specifically expressed in the male antennal sensillar lymph analogous to the amphid lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishida and Leal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durand et al., 2011</xref>). The termination of the signal by removing odors that have already triggered a response is an important process for preventing odor adaptation and increasing odor sensitivity. Thus, it is possible that <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 acts as a solubilizing factor for the lipid pheromones in the excretion-filled amphid sheath lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The weak ability of amphid sheath-specific expression of <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 to confer ZTDO protection in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that both expression pattern and protein function could be important factors in ZTDO sensing in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. Future work will be necessary to determine if <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> expression restricted to the amphid sheath is sufficient to rescue the ZTDO attraction defect in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> and if the amphid sheath cells are required to mediate ZTDO sensing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 in neutralizing a host nematocide</title><p>Given that <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic>-independent susceptibility to ZTDO occurs during the J2 larval stage when <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> is expressed in the seam and hypodermal cells rather than in the amphid sheath that is only active in the J4 larvae, ZTDO-induced paralysis likely acts through the extracellular matrix of the nematode cuticle. <italic>P. pacificus</italic> adults, whose cuticle may be compositionally different from the larval cuticle, are not susceptible to ZTDO. However in <italic>P. pacificus</italic> embryos, the susceptibility of ZTDO may be due to ZTDO limiting gas or ion exchange with the environment rather than direct interaction between ZTDO and cellular components, given that nematode egg shells are considered to have very limited permeability accessible only to small molecular weight solutes and gas molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chitwood and Chitwood, 1974</xref>). Since ZTDO exposure does not lead to embryonic arrest and paralysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, ZTDO must also interact with other non-conserved <italic>P. pacificus</italic>-specific molecules that have yet to be identified. There are very few known nematocides from natural compounds. One rare example comes from the oyster mushroom <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus,</italic> which secretes droplets that can immobilize rhabditid nematodes in an hour, though its effects on embryos have not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barron and Thorn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stadler et al., 1994</xref>). Future work on the different susceptibility to ZTDO may help to answer if there is a wider pattern of negative correlation between ZTDO attraction and ZTDO-induced paralysis in other natural isolates, as observed in the California and Washington strains. Such antagonistic traits may reveal possible co-evolution between host finding and host tolerance in necromenic associations.</p><p>We further speculate that in the natural ecology of <italic>P. pacificus,</italic> ZTDO may enable the beetle host to limit the nematode number and to thus synchronize the developmental stage of infective <italic>P. pacificus</italic> by arresting embryogenesis and lethally paralyzing J2 larvae. The unexpected role of a <italic>P. pacificus</italic> attractant to act as a developmental regulator against the younger larval stages, particularly the dauer larvae (DL), suggests that the ZTDO-resistant adult stage is a potential dispersal stage. This attenuated antagonistic interaction also revealed that nematode larvae and adults may be susceptible to distinct selective pressures. <italic>P. pacificus</italic> DL does not disperse readily, likely due to the secretion of the wax ester nematoil that enables <italic>P. pacificus</italic> to form dauer towers when potential hosts are nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Penkov et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore under natural conditions, lower concentrations of ZTDO than the concentrations we have tested may serve as a close-range host dwelling strategy by inhibiting DL dispersal to form dauer aggregates. The developmental role of ZTDO may be part of a mechanism to limit nematode dispersal until the beetles mature. In these respects, the promotion of a non-DL dispersal stage and inhibition of DL dispersal by ZTDO resemble other known host-derived compounds found in the entomophilic nematode <italic>B. xylophilus</italic> and the phoretic nematode <italic>C. japonica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okumura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Attraction and paralysis by ZTDO may have co-evolved in the necromenic association to allow successive populations of founder <italic>P. pacificus</italic> DL and adults to infect beetles, culminating in arrested DL remaining on sexually mature beetles during the dispersal cycle. The pheromone arrested DL state may also help to account the observation that <italic>Pristionchus</italic> nematodes emerge several days later than rhabditids from the same species of host beetles. Our findings that a lipid-binding protein has a role in coordinating chemosensation, body proportions, and protection from a host pheromone encourages fresh inquiries on additional genes involved in ZTDO sensory signaling and its mechanism of action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All nematodes were raised on NGM media containing OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> at ∼23°C as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hong and Sommer, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2008a</xref>).

PS312 animals were injected with a DNA mix containing a final concentration of 10 ng/μl of the SpeI/SalI digested 4.3 kb <italic>Ppa-obi-1 promoter::NLS-gfp</italic>-SalI fusion PCR product from three independent reactions; 10 ng/μl SpeI digested <italic>Ppa-egl-20p::rfp</italic> linearized plasmid; and 60 ng/μl SpeI/SalI digested PS312 genomic DNA.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor), Oliver Hobert (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has summarized the substantive comments that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Please strengthen the analysis of the role of the amphid sheath cell. Either ablate amphid sheath in Ppa or express Ppa <italic>obi-1</italic> (or C06G1.1) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> under an amphid sheath cell promoter to see if <italic>C. elegans</italic> now becomes sensitive to ZTDO.</p><p>2) RNAi of C06G1.1 to resolve its role in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>3) Please include all data that support the claim that <italic>tu404</italic> and <italic>tu405</italic> are allelic.</p><p>4) Strengthen or remove the feeding rescue experiment, which appears weak.</p><p>5) Strengthen or more explicitly discuss the caveat of the difference in gene expression of <italic>Cel-obi-1</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors make the interesting observation that the beetle sex pheromone ZTDO a known strong attractant to Pristionchus adults arrests Pritionchus development. Thus ZTDO may thus limit Pristioncus growth upon infection. In a genetic screen they identify a novel gene obi-1 which provides a molecular mechanism for the attraction and sensitivity to the beetle sex pheromone. The role of ZTDO as a developmental regulator are unexpected and exciting and shed new light on the evolution of nematode-insect associations. The data are clearly presented.</p><p>I only have a few suggestions that could improve the manuscript and substantiate their model:</p><p>1) The authors hypothesize that the differential expression between C.e C06G1.1 and Ppa-obi-1 may explain the difference between the susceptibility to ZDTO</p><p>They dismiss the possibility that changes in protein function unlikely to explain the difference between obi-1 and C06G1.1 (line 300)? To me 61% shared identity suggests there is plenty of protein difference. The authors favor a difference in expression pattern to explain the difference between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and P.pa response to ZDTO. A third possibility is that there is another specific receptor for ZDTO that interacts with obi-1 in Ppa but not in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that the authors could mention. The authors focus on the obi-1 expression in glia like sheath cells in Ppa but not <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They suggest that glia like sheath cells expression of obi-1 in Ppa could explain the difference in chemosensation. To substantiate their hypothesis a feasible experiment would be to express obi-1 under control of the C06G1.1 promoter in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and test for attraction and paralysis.</p><p>2) It would have been interesting to determine the null phenotype of the C06G1.1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors did analyze a missense mutation for C06G1.1. I don't think it is clear what the effect of the D48N C06G1.1 missense mutation is. More useful might be a C06G1.1 RNAi experiment. In wormbase the RNAi phenotype is long like the obi-1 mutant in Pristionchus suggesting that RNAi works for C06G1.1. Is D48N C06G1.1 long? According to the authors one would expect that C06G1.1 RNAi animals are more sensitive to the paralytic effect of ZDTO. This should be a straight forward and easy experiment.</p><p>If DL is the primary infective stage in many entomophilic nematodes found on live beetles one would expect ZTDO to be attractive to DL. Have the authors determined the chemotaxis response of DL at even lower concentrations ZTDO?</p><p>Not suggesting that all experiments should be done but some of these experiments might substantiate their conclusions.</p><p>1) Can the authors specify what percentage of arrested Dauer Larva are paralyzed rather than some and majority? Is the developmental block specific for dauer exit or do they not exit the dauer stage because of paralysis?</p><p>2) I did not completely follow the rationale for the <italic>egl-4</italic> experiment is not entirely clear. Is the role of <italic>egl-4</italic> in chemosensation and body size important? Also reference Etoille 2002 should that be Daniels 2000?</p><p>3) No egg laying data are presented so show the data or add “(data not shown)”</p><p>4) How do you know they are in equal abundance? RT-PCR? qPCR? “(data not shown)”.</p><p>5) Since splice form variation does not contribute to the difference in insect pheromone attraction, not sure why this is “Interestingly”.</p><p>6) Why are the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> different from those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Cincornpumin and colleague report the discovery of a molecule required for the detection of a host-derived cue and its effects on the development of the necromenic nematode Pristionchus pacificus. Pristionchus is a powerful model for comparative molecular studies of development and behavior, and also offers the opportunity to study the molecular bases of interspecies interactions because of its fascinating ethology. This work is rigorous and clearly presented. The findings not only illuminate an important molecular mechanisms that functions in Pristionchus but also has important implications for the community of researchers who use C. elegans as a model to study chemosensation. I have one issue that I feel should definitely be addressed by the authors before publication and several suggestions that might strengthen the story.</p><p>Two alleles of <italic>obi-1</italic> – <italic>tu404</italic> and <italic>tu405</italic> – were isolated by screens for mutants defective in beetle pheromone sensing. The authors refer to data from complementation testing but do not show these data. Please include all data that support the claim the <italic>tu404</italic> and <italic>tu405</italic> are allelic. Also, the authors only report the molecular characterization of tu404. Is there no coding mutation in the <italic>tu405</italic> strain? Does the transgene that rescues the <italic>tu404</italic> mutant phenotype also rescue the <italic>tu405</italic> mutant phenotype? In its current form the data in the manuscript leave open the possibility that <italic>tu404</italic> and <italic>tu405</italic> are not allelic but display some interesting interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I like the results described in this manuscript. The finding that beetle odor inhibits growth of Pristionchus at three stages: embryo development, paralysis of J2 and blocking dauer exit is very interesting. The screening for and positional cloning of the <italic>obi-1</italic> gene represents a significant and important effort. The cloning is quite convincing, with transgenic rescue following fine genetic mapping and sequencing. OBI-1 is a putative lipid binding protein expressed in potential secretory cells. I have two major concerns;</p><p>1) One important point made by the authors is the difference in expression between Ppa and Cel. However, the expression pattern in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is based solely on a transgenic reporter assay. Since this is a key point, I think smFISH of Cel-C06G1.1 (<italic>Cel-obi-1</italic>) is necessary to establish a convincing negative expression result.</p><p>2) I am confused and concerned by the feeding rescue experiment. It just seems weird to me. I suppose it could be acting in the intestine. This result needs shoring up with something like localized expression of <italic>obi-1</italic> in gut, nervous system, etc.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03229.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Please strengthen the analysis of the role of the amphid sheath cell. Either ablate amphid sheath in Ppa or express Ppa obi-1 (or C06G1.1) in C. elegans under an amphid sheath cell promoter to see if C. elegans now becomes sensitive to ZTDO</italic>.</p><p>We constructed <italic>C. elegans</italic> transgenic strains that expressed <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> cDNA under the amphid sheath cell-specific promoter <italic>T02B11.3</italic> and <italic>F16F9.3</italic>. The translational fusion protein <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1:GFP is expressed faithfully in amphid sheath cells and improved the ability of <italic>F16F9.3p::obi-1:gfp</italic> worms to resist ZTDO-induced paralysis in the L4 larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). However, misexpression of <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> amphid sheath cells did not result in changes in chemotaxis response to ZTDO. We attempted but were not able to train a researcher to use a cell ablation setup in a facility nearby to definitively answer if amphid cells mediate ZTDO sensitivity in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. We have thus tempered our speculation that <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1is required only in the amphid sheath cells in <italic>P. pacificus</italic>. However, given the growing evidence by the Shaham lab at the Rockefeller University that glial cells are important for amphid neuron ontogeny and function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that secreted proteins in the sheath cell have not been actively studied, we feel obliged to discuss several models for how <italic>Ppa</italic>-OBI-1 proteins may function in the amphid sheath cells.</p><p><italic>2) RNAi of C06G1.1 to resolve its role in C.</italic> elegans.</p><p>We have performed RNAi against <italic>C06G1.1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using two fragments of the coding sequence and measured their body dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref>).

The statement now reads “While small changes in sequence can lead to large changes in protein function, the absence of expression of the <italic>C. elegans obi-1</italic> ortholog in amphid sheath cells suggests changes in gene expression pattern may also play a role in determining ZTDO sensitivity.” We also mentioned other possible tissues types that can mediate ZTDO sensing.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) Can the authors specify what percentage of arrested Dauer Larva are paralyzed rather than some and majority? Is the developmental block specific for dauer exit or do they not exit the dauer stage because of paralysis?</italic></p><p>Very few wild-type DL became paralyzed or died on plates with 0-0.001% ZTDO. Approximately 40% wild-type DL remained active after two days on food with 0.01% ZTDO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure. 2G</xref>). However for the <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> mutant, the dauer-exit defect is exacerbated by the hypersensitivity to ZTDO, in which 79±17% of all two-day old dauers became paralyzed and died on plates without ZTDO, and 94.6±5% DL became paralyzed on 0.001% ZTDO. Therefore, 0.01% ZTDO can block active wild-type <italic>P. pacificus</italic> DL from progressing to the reproductive stage without causing paralysis, but 0.001-0.01% ZTDO significantly reduced dauer exit in <italic>Ppa-obi-1</italic> DL primary by inducing paralysis and death.</p><p>We have explained this finding more explicitly in the main text.</p><p><italic>2) I did not completely follow the rationale for the egl-4 experiment is not entirely clear</italic>. <italic>Is the role of egl-4 in chemosensation and body size important?
