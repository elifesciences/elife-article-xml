Pigmentation can reveal identity, protection, and even have antimicrobial functions. Pigmentation in an individual or in a species can change annually, or even instantaneously for camouflage for exmple arctic hares or cephalopod mollusks and chameleons respectively, making pigmentation even more dynamic in response to the environment. Echinoderms, a phylum of marine organisms, display diverse pigmentation schemes in embryos, larvae, and adults. From an intense red sea star (<italic>Fromia milleporella</italic>) to a black and white striped brittle star (<italic>Ophiactis savignyi</italic>) to the variegated sea urchin (<italic>Lytechinus variegatus),</italic> pigment is a pervasive feature of this phylum. Because of the molecular techniques now available for echinoderms, mechanisms controlling pigmentation in these animals are being revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yaguchi et al., 2020</xref>). The purple sea urchin, <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>, provides a molecularly tractable model organism to dissect the developmental importance of pigmented cells, and the biosynthesis of their pigment. The adult of this echinoderm is intensely dark purple as a result of a family of polyketides, including echinochrome and various related spinochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1969</xref>). Furthermore, like most sea urchins, <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> larvae are pigmented due to the accumulation of a red/orange pigment in single cells embedded in, and scattered throughout, the aboral ectodermal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibson and Burke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffiths, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gustafson and Wolpert, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kominami et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McClendon, 1912</xref>). This pigment is a napthoquinone called echinochrome A, which accumulates in the pigment cell precursors during gastrulation in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Griffiths, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuhn and Wallenfels, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oulhen and Wessel, 2016</xref>). Mutations that affect the pigmentation pathway lead to albinism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oulhen and Wessel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>), and adult sea urchins that lack pigments are less resistant to environmental challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>). The functional relationship between these larval and adult pigments and associated cells, and whether their biosynthetic pathways are similar, are open questions.</p><p>A known function of sea urchin larval pigment cells includes an essential role in the innate immune defense system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckley and Rast, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hibino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kiselev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schrankel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Solek et al., 2013</xref>). When larvae are exposed to bacteria, pigment cells migrate from the ectoderm to the gut, a site for invading microbes, and interact with other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ch Ho et al., 2016</xref>). This cell-cell interaction is at least in part regulated by IL17 cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buckley and Rast, 2017</xref>). Echinochrome A is also present in eggs of certain sea urchin species, in immune cells of the coelomic fluid of the adult (the red spherule cells, RSC), in spines, gonads, the digestive system, and in tube feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasseur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perry and Epel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Service and Wardlaw, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). It is also thought that pigment is released by the pigmented cell that directly harms microbes. The antimicrobial mechanism of echinochrome has not been completely resolved, but evidence suggests its production of hydrogen peroxide and/or iron chelation, abates microbial proliferation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lebedev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perry and Epel, 1981</xref>). All of these studies agree that sea urchin pigments have anti-microbial activity, and that these small molecules may also contribute to states of cell physiology and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The developmental origins of pigment cells in the purple sea urchin have been traced to a group of mesodermal cells, the non-skeletogenic mesoderm (NSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croce and McClay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Materna and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McClay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliveri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ruffins and Ettensohn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sweet et al., 1999</xref>). Among the NSM cell types, pigment cells are specified first by Delta/Notch (D/N) signaling from the micromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calestani and Rogers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croce and McClay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davidson et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Materna and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McClay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliveri et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ransick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rast et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherwood and McClay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sweet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sweet et al., 1999</xref>). The D/N signaling directly activates the transcription factor <italic>glial cells missing</italic> (<italic>gcm</italic>), which in turn activates several pigment cell genes, including: <italic>polyketide synthase1</italic> (<italic>pks1</italic>), three <italic>flavin monooxygenases</italic> (<italic>fmo1, 2 and 3</italic>), a <italic>sulfotransferase</italic> (<italic>sult</italic>) and a <italic>dopachrome tautomerase</italic> (<italic>dopt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calestani and Rogers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davidson et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ransick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rast et al., 2002</xref>). The enzymes Pks1 and Fmo1 (reannotated as Fmo3 in this study) are required for the biosynthesis of the echinochrome in pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>). Pks1 is required for any pigment biosynthesis in the adult while Fmo3 is required for accumulation of Spinochrome B in spines, but not for echinochrome synthesis in RSC and tube feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>). Genes expressed selectively in pigment cells, such as <italic>gcm</italic> and <italic>pks1,</italic> are first detected at blastula stage in a ring of NSM precursors surrounding the skeletogenic mesenchyme (SM) and later during blastula stage they become restricted to the aboral NSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson and Burke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gustafson and Wolpert, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kominami et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Materna et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ransick and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ransick et al., 2002</xref>). At the gastrula stage, <italic>gcm,</italic> as well as the pigment biosynthetic genes are expressed in cells migrating into the blastocoel, and their expression is maintained throughout larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson and Burke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gustafson and Wolpert, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kominami et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ransick et al., 2002</xref>). Some evidence suggests <italic>gcm</italic> may be required for the development of pigment cells, since in <italic>gcm</italic> knockdown embryos, the cells do not migrate to the ectoderm at the mesenchyme blastula stage, and pigments are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of <italic>gcm</italic> in skeletogenic mesoderm (SM) cells is sufficient to induce a similar single cell migration to the ectoderm and the accumulation of pigment in these cells, but not the acquisition of the typical morphology of pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Damle and Davidson, 2012</xref>). <italic>Gcm</italic> is also expressed at higher levels in adult hematopoietic tissues, the pharynx and the axial organ, which produce new coelomocytes upon immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Golconda et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, while <italic>gcm</italic> is an important transcriptional regulator, its mechanistic role in larval and adult pigmented cells is still unclear.</p><p>Here we tested the role of <italic>gcm</italic> in pigment cell development through single cell transcriptomic approaches, and define polytypic pigment cell subpopulations. Our analyses revealed two distinct groups of pigment cells, a mitotic population and a differentiated population. We further analyzed the diversity of <italic>fmo</italic> genes, essential players in the pigmentation pathway, and found a group of <italic>fmo</italic> genes specifically expressed in the embryonic pigment cells and in the coelomocytes of the adult immune system. We also performed a single cell mRNA analysis of <italic>gcm</italic> morphants and revealed that pigment cell specification is dependent on <italic>gcm</italic>. Our study leverages our understanding of the Gcm transcription factor, an essential factor in the development of pigmentation in the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calestani and Rogers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oulhen and Wessel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ransick and Davidson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>) and provides deep datasets for exploring evolutionary selection of the biosynthesis of pigmentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ectodermal transcriptional state at a single cell level</title><p>Pigment cells of the sea urchin larva appear as a homogeneous population based on their morphology, expression of the transcription factor <italic>gcm</italic>, the enzyme <italic>pks1</italic>, and the presence of red pigment. Yet the many immune functions ascribed to pigmented cells in larvae and in adult tissues implies a heterogeneous population of cells. We tested this hypothesis with single cell sequencing technology. To enrich for pigment cells, we dissociated embryos/larvae from 48hpf and 72hpf, enriching for the ectodermal layer that includes the pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClay and Marchase, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ransick and Davidson, 2012</xref>), captured cells by drop-seq technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and sequenced the resulting cDNAs at a single cell level. The ectoderm-enriched single cell transcriptome revealed multiple cell-types, mostly of ectodermal origin as expected, and the overall cell cluster organization was highly reproducible between 48hpf and 72hpf samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The cells that formed the main clusters of the tSNE plots represented ectodermal cell types, including ciliary band cells, apical, oral, aboral, and lateral ectodermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) based on expression of known cell-type marker genes. The pigment cell markers <italic>gcm</italic> and <italic>pks1</italic> were found in clusters 2 and 13, which showed a similar transcriptome profile, and cluster 12, which had a transcriptomic profile that was distinct from clusters 2 and 13.

Of these cell clusters expressing <italic>gcm</italic>, we found enrichment for other pigment cell terminal differentiation genes in three clusters in late gastrulae (48hpf; clusters 2,12, 13) and two clusters in larvae (72hpf; clusters 2, 13 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). We next examined pigment gene expression in these three clusters. <italic>Pks1</italic> was highly expressed in cells of clusters 2 and 13, and at low levels in cells of clusters 12 at gastrula stage (see violin plot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Feature plots showed that clusters 2 and 13 are spatially close, but separate, meaning that cell states 2 and 13 had similarities in their transcript profiles, while cluster 12 diverged significantly from cluster 2 and 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To define the differences in each of these three <italic>gcm</italic>+ clusters we performed differential gene expression analysis (clusters 2 vs 12, 2 vs 13 and 12 vs 13) and analyzed the average logFC for <italic>pks1</italic> in each cluster. We found that <italic>pks1</italic> was highly expressed in clusters 2 and 13 with respect to cluster 12, where <italic>pks1</italic> levels were low. To determine if the <italic>pks1</italic> low levels are stage dependent we normalized the data and compared cluster 12 to cluster 13 at 48hpf and 72hpf separately and found that at both stages <italic>pks1</italic> levels in cluster 12 were lower than in clusters 2 and 13 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Similarly, other known pigment cell markers, such as <italic>sult1c2</italic> or <italic>fmo5-1</italic> (previously called <italic>sult</italic> and <italic>fmo2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calestani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ransick and Davidson, 2012</xref>) were highly expressed in clusters 2 and 13 but not in cluster 12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The number of cells in these two clusters changed from 48hpf to 72hpf. Over a period of 24 hours, the proportion of cells in cluster two increased, while the proportion of cells in cluster 13 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To investigate the differences between the clusters, we performed differential gene expression analysis of clusters 2 and 13 at 48hpf and 72hpf. Both clusters expressed pigment cell markers at high levels, and the only difference was that cluster 13 (the cluster with fewer cells at both time points) also expressed transcripts encoding S-phase and mitotic activities at high levels. The elevated markers in cluster 13 included <italic>cdk1</italic>, <italic>pcna</italic>, DNA polymerases, DNA ligases, condensins, and centromere proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), all genes that were absent in cluster 2. This result suggested that there were two pigmented cell clusters with a different cell cycle potential, cluster 13 being pigment cells still undergoing mitosis and cluster two being post-mitotic pigment cells. To test whether there are pigment cells in a mitotic state, or whether migrating pigment cells are all mitotic, we performed an EdU pulse for 30 min, followed by Sp1 staining (a conserved pigment cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibson and Burke, 1985</xref>]). We found that from gastrula to early larva, cells that were in S-phase represented 34% of total pigment cells, and were broadly distributed in the embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F,G</xref>). These cells were synthesizing DNA and dividing (see anaphase cells, inset <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, white arrowhead). This finding of a mitotic pigment cell cluster suggests that pigment cells have the ability to divide as migratory cells. Unique about this tSNE cluster of pigment cells though is the significant increase in mRNAs involved in cell cycle progression, a feature not normally seen in other dividing cells within the embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Expression of unique pigment genes identified by scRNA-seq</title><p>To test for polytypic pigment cells, we defined the expression of newly identified pigment cell markers found in the scRNA-seq by in situ hybridization. scRNA-seq data showed that <italic>gcm</italic> and <italic>pks1</italic> are expressed in the same group of cells at these timepoints.

We first documented that spines and tube feet have pigmented cells by the criteria of deep red color and immunoreactivity to a conserved pigment cell marker recognized by the antibody Sp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibson and Burke, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). We found that at least one gene of clades 2, 3 and 4 was expressed in the spines, while <italic>fmos</italic> from clade one were lacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Tube feet were not a site of significant <italic>fmo</italic> expression, only two of the <italic>fmos</italic> were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Coelomocytes, however, expressed <italic>fmos</italic> from clade 1, but not the other <italic>fmos</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These cells are diverse in morphology and putative function, of which the red spherule cells are known to produce echinochrome and spinochrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hira et al., 2020</xref>). In the pigment biosynthesis pathway, the enzyme <italic>pks1</italic> is upstream of the <italic>fmos</italic> in the biosynthetic pathway of echinochrome. We found that <italic>pks1</italic> was highly expressed in the adult immune cells, but expressed only at low levels in spines and tube feet. We interpret these results as <italic>fmos</italic> might function independently from <italic>pks1</italic>, and that low levels of polyketide synthase gene activity are sufficient for maintenance levels of polyketide synthesis and pigmentation, especially in immune-quiescent animals (not challenged by bacteria). Taken together, these results suggested that of the four <italic>fmo</italic> families, only clade 1 was found specifically in pigment cells of the embryo and in the adult red spherule cells, two cell-types with known immune functions. Within this clade, <italic>fmo2-2</italic> and <italic>fmo2</italic> are expressed also in embryonic cells that do not contain pigments, pointing these to a distinct oxidizing function. Other <italic>fmos</italic> are expressed in the spines (clades 2, 3 and 4) where <italic>pks1 is</italic> expressed at low levels, suggesting a role for non-clade 1 <italic>fmos</italic> independent of pigment biosynthesis and from <italic>gcm</italic> and <italic>pks1</italic>.

Even if some indirect evidence exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ransick and Davidson, 2006</xref>) a direct test of pigment cells presence/absence in gcm KD or null embryos is still missing. To understand whether in <italic>gcm</italic> KD embryos pigment cells are ‘pigmentless’ because of a lack of <italic>pks1</italic> and <italic>fmo3</italic>, or whether there are fewer pigment cells, we tested <italic>gcm</italic> role in pigment cells early specification and pigment production. We performed a single cell differential gene analysis of 48hpf embryos compared to control embryos to determine the fate of the pigment cell clusters when <italic>gcm</italic> is knocked down. We dissociated control and <italic>gcm</italic> KD gastrulae without enriching for the ectoderm to ensure that all cells were captured for the analysis. Therefore, these tSNE plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) revealed information different than the scRNAseq of ectoderm-enriched wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The tSNE plots of the single cell transcriptome of control gastrula show a main group of ectodermal clusters (ciliary band neurons, serotonergic neurons, apical and aboral ectoderm), and clusters for skeleton, coelomic pouches, foregut and mid-gut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Cells from gcm-KD embryos were very sensitive to dissociation and more susceptible to lysis than normal embryos. Because of the low number of sequenced cells, and the consequent lack of many ectodermal cell types, pigment cells were represented by a single cluster (cluster 6). The <italic>gcm</italic> KD experiment resulted in the same tSNE cluster profile as with the control MO. Since fewer cells were sequenced in the <italic>gcm</italic> MO experiment as a result of greater sensitivity to dissociation, we normalized the cells in each cluster for the total sequenced cells in each experimental condition.

Here, by integrating the <italic>gcm</italic> positive cells from the ectodermal scRNAseq with a time course over eight embryonic stages, we found that <italic>gcm</italic> was expressed broadly and that its expression was dynamic. Since Notch signaling is activated not at the same time in the ring of mesodermal cells surrounding primary mesenchyme cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sherwood and McClay, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sweet et al., 1999</xref>), it is possible that <italic>gcm</italic> and downstream genes are activated at slightly different times, one cell after the other.

Moreover, immunostaining with the Sp1 antibody found that a small population of pigment cells remain when Gcm is depleted, but we can’t exclude the existence of <italic>gcm</italic>-independent compensatory mechanisms. Our results suggest that despite <italic>gcm</italic> being necessary to specify most pigment cells, <italic>gcm</italic>-independent mechanisms appear to activate pigment cell identity when <italic>gcm</italic> activity is depleted.

To evaluate our single cell data in this comparative light, we searched for the pigment cell markers described in our study in the list of genes previously reported, and found that all of the candidates we identified were enriched in the above gcm+ transcriptome. Some of the pigment markers we found were also expressed in other cell states. For example, <italic>oprk</italic>, that in other organisms modulates feeding and dopamine-induced behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crawley, 1991</xref>) and the glutamate receptor <italic>gluR6,</italic> were expressed in pigment cells and also in the ciliary band neurons (cluster 16). In particular, <italic>gluR</italic>6 is expressed in a cluster of neurons located in the blastocoel basal to the ciliary band that resemble the localization of the lateral ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisgrove and Burke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perillo et al., 2018</xref>). We interpret the neuronal expression as new gene expression in those cells, and not a cell fate transition of the pigment cells since pigment cells are differentiated in larvae. The fact that pigment cells were expressing these neuronal receptors and others (this study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barsi et al., 2015</xref>]) suggests that they might also have a sensory function possibly coordinated with their immune response function. Our study provides new insights into the expression and function of <italic>gcm,</italic> a transcriptional factor that we found dynamically expressed in several embryonic clusters, and that controls the different states of pigment cells and possibly their different functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Do pigment cells maintain a stem state?</title><p>How the pigment cells are regulated through larval development and into adulthood is not clear. Do all the various pigment cells of the adult, including in the spines, tube feet, and coelomocytes, come from a core stem cell population? Or do they each have their own developmental lineage from a unipotential precursor? Each of these populations, as shown here, appear to have different transcript profiles and functions. What is clear is that the numbers of pigment cells expand if larvae are immune challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kiselev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ageenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>). In our scRNA-seq of ectodermal cells we found two distinct populations of pigment cells, one of which is enriched in mitotic markers, suggesting the possibility of a stem cohort of dividing cells. We favor the concept of a stem population for this lineage because the transcript profile is distinct in the mitotic cohort and those cells are resistant to the <italic>gcm</italic> knockdown. Perhaps Gcm is essential for the lineage expansion, but not for the stem precursors.</p><p>The molecular analysis does suggest distinct populations, or at least different cell states, of pigment cells. By labeling mitotic cells with a pulse of EdU and pigment cells with the marker Sp1, we visualized the mitotic pigment cells in vivo. These cells do not seem to belong to a specific embryonic stem niche, but are distributed throughout the embryo, suggesting that a portion of all pigment cells undergo mitosis to increase the pool. The presence of mitotic pigment cells at the early larva stage also suggests that these cells retain a very active cell cycle while migrating. With such essential functionality likely in the innate immune defense, it may be expected that a stem cell-type population may be responsible for homeostatic functions in pigment cell populations. Pigment cells from embryos of the sand dollar <italic>S. mirabilis</italic> and in the sea urchin <italic>S. intermedius c</italic>an be induced to differentiate when cultured in the adult coelomic fluid in vitro, suggesting that genes involved in pigment synthesis in the adult also regulates pigment cells of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ageenko et al., 2016</xref>). Our finding that adult coelomocytes from <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> express <italic>gcm</italic>, <italic>pks1</italic> and group1 <italic>fmos</italic> suggests that pigmented cells from the adult cells share biosynthetic and cell fate pathways.</p><p>We pose two hypotheses to explain the finding of a mitotic pigment cell cluster: either there is a unique stem cell population of pigment cells, or all pigment cells have the ability to divide. In both cases, a follow up question is whether they divide upon a signal, and what this signal might be (i.e. coelom infection, arm growth, ectodermal injury). It has been suggested that in adult sea urchin a population of pigment stem cells is set aside in the pre-metamorphosis larva to serve as a reservoir for the adult cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wessel et al., 2020</xref>). This is more than initially activating the program for these cells to develop, but also to maintain and replace these cells in the adult. We can rule out pigment presence as an indicator of homeostasis since the <italic>pks1</italic> knock out larvae had similar pigment cells distribution as wild-type larvae. Thus, a stem population for these cells may be key for adult survival and the single cell results herein may point to this population. We propose that the hereby-identified embryonic mitotic cluster might be the cells that are selected in early embryos to replenish the larvae and/or adult stages. However, as we learned here, pigmented cells in the diverse tissues of an adult are pigmented cells in distinct states. Either the presumed stem cluster is capable of diversifying, or new pigment lineages form later in development. An alternative hypothesis is that the pigment cell mitotic cluster serves in the embryo as a reservoir to replenish blastocoelar cell-types. We propose that the mitotic pigment cell cluster might represent a group of cells that retain the developmental potential that allows these cells to convert to other blastocoelar cells, or to the highly migratory pigment cells of the larvae. Overall our interpretation of mitotic and post-mitotic pigment cell clusters is compatible with cells in the latter cluster having immune function, whereas the mitotic pigment cells population may be a stem/dividing population. Indelible lineage labeling will be important to test these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A unique family of <italic>fmos</italic> is expressed in cells with immune functions</title><p>Spines, tube feet, cells in coelomic fluid and larvae of sea urchins express different types of flavin containing monooxygenases (<italic>fmo</italic>) enzymes that contribute to the pigment biosynthesis.

In the case of cells with predicted similar functions, for example coelomic-pigmented cells (the red spherule cells), versus larval-pigmented cells, the composition of pigment synthesizing enzymes and other gene expression is instead similar.

Both cells produce the pigment echinochrome A, a molecule with antimicrobial properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brasseur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coates et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerardi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lebedev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perry and Epel, 1981</xref>), suggesting that <italic>gcm</italic>, <italic>pks1</italic>, and group1 <italic>fmos</italic> work together to make this unique pigment, but might not interact to make other echinoderm pigments. These results may reveal that distinct biochemical pathways lead to the same chemical outcome, or that pigmentation is just one of multiple different functions in what we routinely refer to as a single pigment cell.</p><p>The revelation of the <italic>fmo</italic> family in sea urchins is striking. <italic>Fmos</italic> are broadly expressed in yeast, plants and animals where their main role is detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolphin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Janmohamed et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Phillips et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Phillips and Shephard, 2017</xref>). Seeing diverse expressions throughout the sea urchin tissues suggests more than ‘just’ a metabolic or detoxifying function for these family members. Fmo enzymes catalyze the oxidation of different types of substrates that are involved in different types of biological processes across phyla: detoxification, metabolite activation, and in the case of the sea urchin, pigmentation and maybe more. In the sea urchin, <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>, one cohort of <italic>fmos</italic> (Group 4, that includes <italic>fmo1, 2–5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>) groups together with the fly orthologs. Flies have two <italic>fmos,</italic> one with housekeeping functions and another involved in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scharf et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Fmos</italic> from clade two are instead grouped with the human Fmos. These <italic>fmos</italic> were not detectable in embryogenesis, but rather in the spines. Human <italic>fmos</italic> are expressed in liver, lung, kidney and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peters, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schlaich, 2007</xref>), cannot be induced or inhibited, and although being involved with drug metabolism, their physiological role is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scharf et al., 2004</xref>). The most studied FMO is the human Fmo3, an enzyme that is constitutively active in the adult human liver where it participates in the oxidation of drugs and xenobiotics, and mutations in Fmo3 contribute to the disease trimethylaminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cashman and Zhang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolphin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krueger and Williams, 2005</xref>). We find no expression of the <italic>fmos</italic> in clade 2 (the sea urchin group closest to vertebrates) in embryos, nor in the coelomocytes, as it is only expressed in spines. Sea urchin spines are covered by a thin epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peters, 1985</xref>) that is populated by pigmented cells that we show here are marked with the embryonic pigment cell marker Sp1, most likely being red spherule cells. We suggest that the <italic>fmo</italic> clade two role might be connected to human Fmo function in the skin, where it might detoxify xenobiotics to which the spines are exposed in the seawater. The other fmo clades are also expressed in the spines, and further studies will need to determine the expression and function of these genes in other adult structures.</p><p>It is still not understood why the <italic>fmo</italic> family is so expanded in this sea urchin. Only 1 <italic>fmo</italic> gene is present in yeast, whereas many flowering plants have 26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schlaich, 2007</xref>), two in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scharf et al., 2004</xref>), six in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolphin et al., 1996</xref>) and at least 12 in sea urchin that are not pseudogenes, since each are expressed at some time and place in the animal. A hypothesis to explain this expansion is that such a variety of enzymes is necessary for the detoxification of a wide range of xenobiotics present in diverse ecosystems, especially benthic niches. We predict that with Cas9 targeting mechanisms of <italic>fmos</italic> followed by pigment MS/MS analysis will enable definitive Fmo functionality to expose this enigmatic family of enzymes. Furthermore, single cell RNA-seq of adult tissues will likely reveal the cell-types that express these genes.</p><p>In conclusion, by leveraging two distinctly derived RNA-seq datasets, we were able to create confident profiles of genes relevant to pigment cell function. We discovered that pigment cells conserve a mitotic cell population that might represent a stem population for embryonic and adult immune cells. We also realize how important in situ FISH and single-cell RNA-seq is for confidence in conclusions. Bulk sequencing, even isolated populations of cells, brings many caveats of interpretation which likely shift upon testing with scRNA-seq and double-FISH.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gcm</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_006462</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>pks1</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_002895</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>fmo2</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_002963</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>fmo3</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_017374</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>fmo2-2</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_014947</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>fmo5-1</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_012348</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>sult1c2</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_006187</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>oprk1c</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_000719</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>mif5</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_020036</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>glur6</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_018876</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>abcg11</italic></td><td valign="top">Echinobase</td><td valign="top">SPU_018876</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Sp1 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">Cat# Sp1, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013527">SCR_013527</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequenced-based reagent</td><td valign="top">control MO; control morpholino</td><td valign="top">Gene Tools</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCTTTGGAGTAACCTTCTGCACCAT</named-content>-3’ <break/>(0.5 mM)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequenced-based reagent</td><td valign="top">gcm MO; gcm morpholino</td><td valign="top">Gene Tools</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCTTTGGAGTAACCTTCTGCACCAT</named-content>-3’ <break/>(0.5 mM)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Image J</td><td>Image J</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Seurat v 3.1.4</td><td>SEURAT</td><td>SEURAT, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007322">SCR_007322</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">DAPI stain</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">D1306</td><td valign="top">(1 µg/mL)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic> were obtained from Josh Ross (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scbiomarine.com/">info@scbiomarine.com</ext-link>) off the California coast and kept in artificial seawater at 16°C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jonathan Patrick Rast (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Perillo et al. uses single-cell sequencing to characterize the development of pigment cells in the purple sea urchin, <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>. In addition to producing various chemically interesting pigments, these cells play a role in the animal's innate immune system (e.g., one of the pigments has been shown to have anti-microbial activity). Thus, understanding how these cells are generated and characterizing the biochemical pathways used to synthesize their diverse pigments should be of broad interest.</p><p>Single-cell analysis at distinct developmental time points (gastrulae and larvae) identified two pigment cell clusters in larval ectoderm and one cluster of mesodermal pigment cell precursors in gastrulae. One of the larval pigment cell clusters expresses cell cycle-associated genes and the authors show that cells expressing a pigment cell marker can incorporate EdU in gastrulae and larvae. New pigment cell markers identified via single-cell sequencing were validated by double fluorescent in situ hybridization. Because a flavin-dependent monooxygenase (<italic>fmo</italic>) is involved in pigment synthesis, the authors examined <italic>fmo</italic> genes present in the <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> genome, and found one group (of the four families they describe) with enriched expression in embryonic pigment cells and adult coelomocytes (immune cells). Finally, based on previous work showing that the transcription factor glial cells missing (<italic>gcm</italic>) was required for pigmentation, the authors perform single-cell analysis of <italic>gcm</italic> knockdown embryos and conclude that this gene is required for pigment cell specification. Overall, this work presents a new view of the process of pigment cell development in the purple sea urchin as well as the relationship of larval pigment cells to different adult pigment cell types and to red spherule immune cells. Pending the clarification of the issues outlined below and substantial editing of the text, it will serve as a useful resource for those interested in this system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors seem to be overstating the case that they have identified a population of pigment stem cells. It has been evident for some time that pigment cell numbers increase after they delaminate from the archenteron and before they differentiate (Gibson and Burke, 1987) consistent with a round of cell division after delamination. What evidence is there from the single cell sequence data that these cells have stem cell qualities and are not just progenitors at the last division before differentiation. Their data show that pigment cells can divide, but their subsequent fates after taking up EdU have not been followed. In the absence of additional evidence, the authors should soften their language about stem cells and stem cell niches.</p><p>2) Do the authors know whether the dividing Cluster 13 cells are granular at this point in development? A description of the morphology/behavior of the cluster 12 and cluster 13 cells would be interesting if the authors know anything about this. Cluster 12 is of interest since it is most unlike cluster 2 and 13. As GCM disappears at 72 hrs in these cells, the cluster remains in the tSNE plot.

It has been evident for some time that pigment cell numbers increase after they delaminate from the archenteron and before they differentiate (Gibson and Burke 1987) consistent with a round of cell division after delamination. What evidence is there from the single cell sequence data that these cells have stem cell qualities and are not just progenitors at the last division before differentiation. Their data show that pigment cells can divide, but their subsequent fates after taking up EdU have not been followed. In the absence of additional evidence, the authors should soften their language about stem cells and stem cell niches.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tempered the language of pigment stem cells in the Abstract, Introduction, and Results, but we have retained this consideration in the Discussion section to ensure a broader dialog within the community</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do the authors know whether the dividing Cluster 13 cells are granular at this point in development? A description of the morphology/behavior of the cluster 12 and cluster 13 cells would be interesting if the authors know anything about this. Cluster 12 is of interest since it is most unlike cluster 2 and 13. As GCM disappears at 72 hrs in these cells, the cluster remains in the tSNE plot. Do the authors know where these cells are at this time? Are these some type of blastocoelar cell?</p></disp-quote><p>The cluster 13 cells are not blastocoelar cells because we did not find any blastocoelar markers (e.g. ese, gataC). Cluster 12 has mesodermal markers and might represent undifferentiated mesoderm. From Sp1 staining they look migratory, extending filopodia as the non-dividing cells, but we cannot yet identify pigment levels in these cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In their characterization of fmo gene families in S. purpuratus, the authors conclude that two of the protein families are not found in other organisms. Because the only animals represented are humans and S. purpuratus (Figure 4A), it would be reasonable for the authors to broaden the sampling of organisms on their phylogenetic tree to include a more diverse set of animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point – We made a new phylogenetic tree of <italic>fmos</italic> including sequences from mouse, frog, fish, flies, chicken. In this new tree we found that Fmo5-6 belongs to clade 3 (which previously did not group with any other sequence), but all other associations were consistent. We now document that two different methods of tree construction (maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony) resulted in the same outcome, providing additional confidence in our interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Because the authors have previously published the lack of pigment cells following CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of gcm (Oulhen and Wessel, 2016), they should clarify why they instead used morpholino knockdowns for the scSeq experiments reported here.</p></disp-quote><p>CRISPR/Cas9 randomly mutates the targeted genomic sequences. These are, after all, wildtype animals and not strains of homogenous animals that have a single type of mutation. We wanted to have data that could be clearly interpreted and reproducible and the morpholino will always bind the same sequence of the mRNA to stop its translation. Every injection of CRISPR/Cas9, however, will yield different mutations (between experiments, and between each injected embryo) that could have different effects in the gene expression and the phenotypes obtained. Moreover, with CRISPR/Cas9, the resulting truncated proteins are still being translated and could still be active depending on the mutations. Such variations may complicate the scRNA-sq results so we decided to use the morpholino as a more reliable method to downregulate <italic>gcm</italic>. A paraphrased version of this explanation is now in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 6F it is not obvious that pigment cell numbers are unaffected by PKS Cas9. Based on the image shown, a naïve reader could conclude that there are fewer pigment cells and that they are larger. As they have done for gcm MO embryos, this should be quantified. It would also help the reader if the rationale for this experiment were made clearer at the outset. In its current form the results are described in the middle of a paragraph about the phenotype of gcm knockdown embryos without any introduction or explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>The Pks1 – KO here is used to test homeostasis in the pigment cells and whether PKS may have any function, directly or indirectly, in regulating gene expression. This is topical in the Discussion. We have now also mentioned this briefly in the Results section as justification for doing the experiment, but retained its position in the paragraph. It is an experimental result that contrasts with the GCM experiment, so we believe the order in the paragraph is appropriate. We have now also quantitated these results as requested and these data are now shown in Figure 6F, G and H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) What is covered in Foster et al., 2020, in review?

We use that dataset here to extract <italic>gcm</italic> mRNA expression, which was not performed in Foster et al., 2020. As seen for several genes, the mRNA profile is more broad and earlier than seen by in situ RNA or qPCR experiments. Foster et al., 2020, discusses this phenomenon extensively, and we refer to that discussion but only briefly highlight the finding here. The Foster et al., 2020 manuscript was recently accepted for publication (Development) so readers of this pigment paper will also have access to that single cell RNA-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The rationale and description of integrating this gcm expression analysis with the gastrula and larva scSeq (starting at the second paragraph of the subsection “Gcm is Enriched in Three Clusters at Gastrula and Early Larva Stages”) was unclear.
