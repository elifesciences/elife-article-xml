KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) is a voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, and its auxiliary subunit KCNE proteins dramatically regulate its gating. For example, KCNE3 makes KCNQ1 a constitutively open channel at physiological voltages by affecting the voltage sensor movement. However, how KCNE proteins regulate the voltage sensor domain is largely unknown. In this study, by utilizing the KCNQ1-KCNE3-calmodulin complex structure, we thoroughly surveyed amino acid residues on KCNE3 and the S1 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor facing each other. By changing the side-chain bulkiness of these interacting amino acid residues (volume scanning), we found that the distance between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is elaborately optimized to achieve the constitutive activity. In addition, we identified two pairs of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 mutants that partially restored constitutive activity by co-expression.

Its gating behavior depends mainly on its auxiliary subunit KCNE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). There are five KCNE genes in the human genome, and all of them are known to modify KCNQ1 channel gating behavior, at least in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes or mammalian cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bendahhou et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the physiological functions of the KCNQ1 channel are determined by the type of KCNE proteins that are co-expressed in a tissue. The most well-studied example is the cardiac KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel, which underlies the slow cardiac delayed-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>Ks</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takumi et al., 1988</xref>). Another example is the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel, a constitutively open channel expressed in epithelial cells in the trachea, stomach, and intestine. This channel complex couples with some ion transporters to facilitate ion transport by recycling K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grahammer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schroeder et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which KCNE proteins modify KCNQ1 channel gating behavior have been a central question of this ion channel. Since KCNQ1 is a classic <italic>shaker</italic>-type tetrameric voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel, it has four independent voltage sensor domains (VSDs), one from each Î± subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Each VSD consists of four transmembrane segments, S1âS4. Each S4 segment bears several positively charged amino acid residues. When the membrane potential is depolarized, each S4 segment moves upward (toward the extracellular side). That upward movement eventually triggers pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, the S4 segment is considered to be an essential part of voltage sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catterall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fedida and Hesketh, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Logothetis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noda et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papazian et al., 1991</xref>). As in the <italic>Shaker</italic> K<sup>+</sup> channel, the S4 segment of the KCNQ1 channel also moves upward with depolarization, as proved by scanning cysteine accessibility mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakajo and Kubo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rocheleau and Kobertz, 2008</xref>) and voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakajo and Kubo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osteen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osteen et al., 2010</xref>). In those studies, the presence of KCNE proteins was found to affect the voltage sensor movement. These results suggest that KCNE proteins stabilize a specific state during the voltage sensor transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barro-Soria et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakajo, 2019</xref>). There should be at least three positions in the VSDs of KCNQ1: âdown,â âintermediate,â and âupâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). KCNE1 stabilizes the intermediate position of VSDs along with a direct interaction of the pore domain and inhibits opening of the pore domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, KCNE3 may stabilize the intermediate or up position of VSDs and indirectly stabilize the channelâs open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barro-Soria et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). However, it remains unknown how KCNE proteins stabilize VSDs at a specific position.</p><p>Early studies by Melman et al. revealed âthe tripletâ of amino acid residues in the middle of the transmembrane segment (âFTLâ: F57-T58-L59 in KCNE1 and âTVGâ: T71-V72-G73 in KCNE3) as structural determinants of KCNE modulation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Melman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melman et al., 2001</xref>). Exchanging the triplet (or one of the three amino acid residues) between KCNE1 and KCNE3 could introduce the otherâs modulation properties, at least partially. For example, introducing âFTLâ into KCNE3 transforms it into a KCNE1-like protein. Therefore, it has been long considered that âthe tripletâ is a functional interaction site between KCNQ1 and KCNE proteins. Possible interaction sites of the KCNQ1 side have also been explored and are believed to be located between the pore domain and the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakajo and Kubo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Horn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). By utilizing the KCNQ1 ortholog from ascidian <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, which lacks KCNE genes, we previously found that F127 and F130 of the S1 segment are required for KCNE3 to make KCNQ1 a constitutively open channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakajo et al., 2011</xref>). A recent computational model and the cryo-EM structure of the KCNQ1-KCNE3-calmodulin (CaM) complex clearly showed that KCNE3 interacts with the S1 segment and the pore domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kroncke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism by which KCNE3 retains the KCNQ1 VSD at a specific position is still not clearly understood.</p><p>In this work, by taking advantage of the cryo-EM structure of the KCNQ1-KCNE3-CaM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>), we created a series of the S1 segment and KCNE3 mutants to change the bulkiness of the S1 segment and KCNE3 interface, and we found that the interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is elaborately optimized to achieve the constitutive activity. In addition, we identified two pairs of the S1 segment and KCNE3 mutants that partially restored constitutive activity by co-expression. Our work suggests tight binding of the S1 segment and KCNE3 is crucial for controlling the VSDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The side-chain volumes of amino acid residues in the S1 segment of KCNQ1 facing KCNE3 are optimized for channel modulation</title><p>The cryo-EM structure of the KCNQ1-KCNE3-CaM complex revealed that KCNE3 interacts with the S1 segment of KCNQ1 in the transmembrane segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). In the structure, the side chains of seven amino acid residues in the S1 segment of KCNQ1 (F123, F127, F130, L134, I138, L142, and I145) face lining those of six amino acid residues of the KCNE3 transmembrane segment (S57, I61, M65, A69, G73, and I76; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We previously reported that F127 and F130 are required to make KCNQ1-KCNE3 a constitutively open channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nakajo and Kubo, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the interactions between the S1 segment of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 might be crucial for stabilizing the open states. To confirm the functional roles of these amino acid residues, we first created and tested small alanine and large tryptophan-substituted mutants of the S1 segment of KCNQ1. If the alanine- and/or tryptophan-substituted mutants changed the functional output induced by the KCNQ1-KCNE3 interaction (i.e. did not show the constitutive activity), we also created and tested intermediate-sized hydrophobic residues valine-, leucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted mutants. When expressed alone, most of the S1 segment mutants showed conductance-voltage (G-V) curves similar to that of KCNQ1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>). We then tested how these mutations introduced to the S1 segment affect the modulation by KCNE3. When co-expressed with KCNE3 WT, KCNQ1 WT shifted the G-V curve in the far-negative direction, becoming a constitutively open channel for the physiological membrane potential range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, G and L</xref>; black traces and black G-V curves). Because of that, the relative conductance of KCNQ1 WT-KCNE3 WT at â100 mV (G<sub>-100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub>) was 10-times higher (KCNQ1 WT, 0.08Â±0.01; KCNQ1 WT-KCNE3 WT, 0.80Â±0.02; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> M-S; black bars). In contrast, when co-expressed with KCNE3 WT, the S1 segment mutants yielded various G-V curves and G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values. Since one of the unique features of the KCNE3 modulation is constitutive KCNQ1 activity even in the hyperpolarized voltage range, we then mainly evaluated the effect of each mutation on KCNE3 modulation by the G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> value for comparison. However, other parameters, such as the midpoint of the GâV curve (<italic>V<sub>1/2</sub></italic>) or effective charge (<italic>z</italic>), were evaluated when possible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>). Both of the F123 mutants (F123A and F123W) shifted the G-V curves in the far-negative direction and kept the G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values over 0.5 (F123A, 0.61Â±0.01; F123W, 0.66Â±0.01; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the F123 residue did not have a large impact on the KCNE3 modulation. Among the F127 mutants (F127A, F127V, F127L, and F127W), F127A, F127V, and F127L mutants failed to shift the G-V curves in the far-negative direction and showed smaller G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values depending on the side-chain size (F127A, 0.17Â±0.02; F127V, 0.25Â±0.02; F127L, 0.38Â±0.02; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâG and N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). It seemed that the modulation depended on the side-chain volume: the more different the size was, the more significant the change of functional output induced by the KCNQ1-KCNE3 interaction was (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). The F130 mutants (F130A, F130V, F130L, and F130W) failed to shift the G-V curves in the far-negative direction or even positively shifted the G-V curves. They showed substantially reduced G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values (F130A, 0.02Â±0.00; F130V, 0.10Â±0.01; F130L, 0.01Â±0.00; F130W, 0.37Â±0.02; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Among the L134 mutants (L134A, L134V, L134F, and L134W), the L134A, L134V, and L134F mutants failed to shift the G-V curves in the far-negative direction and reduced the G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values (L134A, 0.25Â±0.01; L134V, 0.08Â±0.01; L134F, 0.35Â±0.02; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). All the I138 mutants (I138A, I138V, I138F, and I138W) showed relatively mild attenuation in the G-V shift and G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values (I138A, 0.36Â±0.02; I138V, 0.66Â±0.01; I138F, 0.64Â±0.01; I138W, 0.36Â±0.02; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). The I138 mutants showed an explicit size dependency in the KCNE3 modulation with wild-type isoleucine having the largest impact on the KCNE3 modulation, as in the case of the F127 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). The L142 mutants (L142A, L142V, L142F, and L142W) failed to shift the G-V curves in the negative direction and mildly reduced the G<sub>â100mV</sub>/G<sub>max</sub> values (L142A, 0.24Â±0.03; L142V, 0.42Â±0.02; L142F, 0.60Â±0.01; KCNQ1 L142W-KCNE3 WT, 0.23Â±0.02; n=10 for each; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6</xref>).

Five of them (F127, F130, I138, L142, and I145) showed some side-chain volume dependency for the modulation by KCNE3: KCNQ1 WT showed the highest modulation effect by KCNE3, and the modulation effects by KCNE3 changed gradually if introduced mutations at the S1 segment became more different from WT in terms of amino acid size.

As in the case of evaluating the S1 segment, we created various mutants of these residues and co-expressed them with KCNQ1 WT. Throughout the experiments, 10 ng RNA of KCNQ1 was co-injected with 1 ng RNA of KCNE3 into oocytes since 1 ng RNA of KCNE3 was sufficient to fully modulate KCNQ1 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We next performed VCF to monitor the S4 segment to investigate whether the mutations of the S1 segment affect voltage sensor movement and whether it is restored by the identified pairs of mutants (F127A[Q1]-G73L[E3] and I145F[Q1]-S57A[E3]). The KCNQ1 construct for VCF (KCNQ1 C214A/G219C; this construct hereafter being referred to as âKCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WTâ) was labeled at the introduced cysteine residue (G219C) by Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osteen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osteen et al., 2010</xref>).

KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT alone showed a fluorescence-voltage (F-V) relationship that mostly fitted to a single Boltzmann function and closely overlapped with its G-V curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A, D and E</xref>). In contrast, KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT co-expressed with KCNE3 WT showed a split F-V relationship. Its fluorescence changes were observed in the far negative and positive voltages, while they were very small and remained almost unchanged within the voltage range between 0 and â100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, F and G</xref>). Consequently, the F-V relationship of KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT-KCNE3 WT does not fit to a single Boltzmann function but fits to a double Boltzmann function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, F and G</xref>), which is consistent with the results of a previous VCF study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that most of the S4 segments of the channels are at the down position and move to the upper position with depolarization in KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT alone and that a substantial number of S4 segments are in the intermediate position and move either with depolarization or deep hyperpolarization in KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT-KCNE3 WT. We then assessed the F-V relationships of the KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> F127A mutant co-expressed with the KCNE3 WT or G73L mutant as well as those of the KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> I145F mutant co-expressed with the KCNE3 WT or S57A mutant.

We therefore hypothesized that the interaction of these amino acid residues is essential for the KCNE3 function and found that besides F127 and F130, a broader range of amino acid residues (F127, F130, L134, I138, L142, and I145), which forms five helical turns in total in the middle of the transmembrane segment of the S1 segment, was important for the channel modulation by KCNE3. Furthermore, in most cases, the introduction of larger and smaller amino acid residues at the hydrophobic interface between the S1 segment and KCNE3 disrupted the KCNE3 function to modulate KCNQ1 gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>). This suggests that the side-chain volume of the amino acid residues in the S1 segment and KCNE3 is optimized for proper gating modulation of KCNQ1 induced by KCNE3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplements 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). The restorations of the KCNQ1 F127A mutant by the KCNE3 G73L mutant and the KCNQ1 I145F mutant by the KCNE3 S57A mutant further support this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, three of the five KCNQ1 residues tested (F130, I138, and L142) were not successfully restored by KCNE3 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). They could have even more prominent roles in the KCNE3 modulation than just the tight hydrophobic interaction tested in this study. Further analyses are needed to understand the functions of these residues in gating modulation by KCNE3.</p><p>According to previous VCF studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barro-Soria et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>), we further performed VCF analysis to investigate how the S1 segment and KCNE3 interaction influences the voltage sensor movement. Previous VCF analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT co-expressed with KCNE3 WT showed two components (F1 and F2) in the F-V relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, F and G</xref>). In addition, KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> F127A-KCNE3 WT and KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> I145F-KCNE3 WT pairs showed positively shifted <italic>V<sub>1/2</sub></italic><sub>(F1)</sub> and diminished the plateau phase observed in the KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> WT-KCNE3 WT pair, while KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> F127A-KCNE3 G73L and KCNQ1<sub>vcf</sub> I145F-KCNE3 S57A pairs partially restored <italic>V<sub>1/2</sub></italic><sub>(F1)</sub> and the plateau phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that the tight interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is required to keep the S4 segment in the intermediate position at resting membrane potential. Disrupting the interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 by mutation allows the S4 segment to move down by hyperpolarization.</p><p>How the tight interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 identified in the current study that affects the S4 segment is still up in the air. In the KCNQ1-KCNE3-CaM complex structure, the S4 segment directly interacts with KCNE3 and the S1 segment through its lower part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the tight interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 directly affects the S4 movement upon membrane potential change. However, further mutational analyses are needed to understand how the tight interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 changes the S4 movement.</p><p>It is interesting whether the tight interaction we saw in the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel also plays a role in the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel. We examined a series of KCNQ1 F127 mutants co-expressed with KCNE1 and found that the mutant effects also showed size dependency, as in the case of KCNE3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is noteworthy, though, that the F127 mutants strengthened the positive shift of the G-V curve in the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel, while the same mutants reduced the constitutive activity in the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel. As previously revealed by some VCF experiments, KCNE1 and KCNE3 stabilize the intermediate state of the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barro-Soria et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Osteen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>). One possible interpretation of the KCNE1 results could be that the mutations of F127 might destabilize the intermediate state (or stabilize the closed/down state), as seen in KCNE3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, the S1 segment might have a similar role in both KCNE1 and KCNE3 to assist in stabilizing the intermediate state. However, further experiments will be needed to find out the possible role of the S1 segment in the KCNE1 modulation.</p><p>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that tight interaction between the S1 segment of the KCNQ1 channel and KCNE3 is required for retaining the VSD in the intermediate position, probably by preventing the S4 segment from going to the down position, thereby keeping the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channels constitutively active.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes</title><p>The human <italic>KCNQ1</italic> (NCBI Accession Number NP_000209.2; WT and mutants), human <italic>KCNE1</italic> (HsKCNE1, NP_000210), and mouse <italic>Kcne3</italic> (NP_001177798; WT and mutants) cDNAs were inserted into the pGEMHE expression vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liman et al., 1992</xref>).

Therefore, we calculated the bleaching rate for each experiment using the baseline levels of the initial 1100 ms before test pulses of each trace and compensated the fluorescence traces by subtracting the bleached component calculated from each traceâs bleaching rate (R), assuming that the fluorescence was linearly decreased.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Triad interaction stabilizes the voltage sensor domains in a constitutively open KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jon T Sack as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The functional validation of the KCNQ1/KCNE3 structural interface is compelling, yet was not deemed to comprise a conceptual advance sufficient to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers agreed that validation of the interface by KCNQ1 F127A-KCNE3 G73L is an important result. However, this major conclusion could benefit from further experiments. Reviewers all thought that the data analysis needs substantial revision, and other claims should be tempered. If further experiments lead to additional mechanistic insights, the combined results could be submitted as a new manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study aimed to identify amino acid residues on KCNE3 facing the S1 segment of KCNQ1 that are required for constitutive activity, and identify residues on the S4 segment which convert KCNE effects into voltage sensor movement. The research appears technically sound and expertly performed. The major strength of this work is the molecular redesign of KCNE3 and the S1 segment of KCNQ1 to rescue the functional interaction between KCNE3 and KCNQ1. However, this key result rests on a single pair of mutations. The weaknesses are some of the mechanistic interpretations pertaining to functional coupling between KCNQ1 and KCNE3. The manuscript achieved its aim of identifying amino acid residues on KCNE3 facing the S1 segment of KCNQ1 that are required for constitutive activity. This work also identifies mutations on the S4 segment which diminish KCNE1 effects, but data seems inadequate to support the claim that the residues identified on the S4 are the site of conversion of KCNE effects into voltage sensor movement, as alternate explanations also appear plausible. Importantly, this work presents strong evidence that the KCNE3/S1 interface observed structurally is accurate in its molecular detail, and crucial for inter-protein coupling. This study should cement the functional relevance of the KCNE3 interface with the S1 of KCNQ1 observed in a recent structure. Additionally. this work identifies key sites that perturb the modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE proteins.</p><p>The KCNQ1 F127A-KCNE3 G73L result is compelling, it is strong conceptual evidence that the KCNE3/S1 interface forms as advertised. I think the paper would be better appreciated if it focused almost entirely on this result, and perhaps further investigate this key finding with a few more related experiments. The manuscript states that &quot; Appropriate side-chain volumes at the interaction interface are necessary&quot; yet could other physical/chemical concepts explain the reason for rescue?</p><p>Testing further sets of double mutations at positions 127 and 73 could test whether this apparent rescue by the swap of side chain bulk is more than just a happy coincidence, and whether bulk inversions at positions 127 and 73 could be found that produce channels even more functionally similar to WT KCNE/KCNQ</p><p>I wonder if this KCNQ1 F127A-KCNE3 G73L protein engineering could be used to knock in KCNE-resistant channels that will only respond when a mutant KCNE is expressedâ¦possibly useful for experiments conceptually similar to DREADDs or Kevan Shokat's knob-in-hole chemical genetics.</p><p>line 134</p><p>&quot;For the KCNQ1 F127A mutant, co-expression with KCNE3 F68A or V72A yielded G-V curves similar to that for KCNE3 WT, implying that F127 of the S1 segment and F68/V72 of KCNE3 are functionally coupled.&quot;</p><p>I disagree. these results just mean that all of the mutations eliminate the E3 effect. The functional coupling analysis here and in the following sentences (up to line 144) seems flawed, or maybe I am failing to understand it. What basis is there for &quot;additive&quot; shifting?</p><p>line 182</p><p>&quot;Therefore, we concluded that M238 and V241 are the sites where the binding of KCNE3 is converted to the VSD movement's modulation.&quot;</p><p>I disagree, and suggest softening this conclusion. In combination with the structure, the possibility of this being a site of conversion does seems plausible, but these results do not make this certain. This result merely means that perturbation of these sites perturbs the coupling. This is consistent with being a site of physical coupling, or conversion, but based on this result alone, other physical possibilities also seem plausible. For example, this could be a site needed to align the site of conversion or There could be multiple sites of conversion.</p><p>Figure Supplement 1D</p><p>The confocal images do clearly show surface expression, but provide little information about the density of surface KCNE1, nor association with KCNQ1.

These mutated residues are located in the transmembrane segment S1 and S4 of KCNQ1 and of KCNE3. The authors found that the KCNE4 mutations F68A, V72A and I 76 A abolished the ability of KCNE3 to shift GV relation to voltages more negative than -160 mV, which is similar to the findings of their previous study that the S1 mutations F127A and F130A also abolished the ability of KCNE3 to shift GV to negative voltages. A double mutation Q1 F127A + E3 G73L rescued a large part of the GV shift, supporting the observation from the structure that KCNQ1 S1 and KCNE3 may interact among these residues for the modulatory effects of KCNE3 on channel gating. The authors also measured VSD movements in the WT and these mutant channels using VCF, and concluded that the S1-E3 interactions at the S1 site are important for the KCNE3 induced shift of VSD activation to the negative voltages. The authors then found that mutations of S4, M238A and M241A, also reduced the ability of KCNE3 to shift the GV relation, and reduce VSD activation at negative voltages. Based on these results, the authors conclude that the interactions among S1, S4 and KCNE3 at the location of these residues modulate VSD activation and stabilize the open state of the channel. The manuscript presents some interesting data, including the Q1 F127A + E3 G73L results as evidence for S1-KCNE3 interaction. However, some of the conclusions made in the manuscript seem to be based on incomplete experiments or analyses of the data.</p><p>Some questions and comments are as follows.</p><p>1) Although mutant KCNE3 was shown to express in the surface membrane, it is not known if E3 association with Q1 is reduced by the mutations. It is known that Q1:E1 at different ratio can have different stoichiometry (as shown by the author of this manuscript) and the channels with different stoichiometry show different function including G-V and kinetics. Does KCNE3 share similar properties? Additional experiments may be needed to address this concern.</p><p>2) The authors used DF-160/DF60 to measure VSD activation. In VCF measurements it is not clear how VCF amplitude is related to VSD movements. This method seems to be flawed.</p><p>3) It is not clear why the authors did not analyze the VCF data to show FV. The relationship between FV and GV is not analyzed either. The authors made conclusions in reference of intermediate and activated states of the VSD, but these conclusions were not backed up by data of fluorescence or current measurements.</p><p>4) KCNE3 may also contact with S3 and S5 of KCNQ1 in the cryo-EM structure. Why did not the authors inspect the residues in these motifs? In addition, the cryo-EM structure shows the conformation of only one state, but the KCNE3-KCNQ1 interactions in other states are not known. These need to be considered in the structure motivated mutagenesis study.</p><p>5) Related to comment 4, how does this study reconcile with the studies by the McDonald lab (Melman et al. 2004 Neuron), which concluded that KCNE1 (and KCNE3) interacted with the pore domain of KCNQ1 to modulate channel activation?</p><p>6) Figure 2. What does &quot;functionally coupled&quot; mean? How is this defined? The interpretation of Figure 2 data is hard to follow and seems to be arbitrary. For example, for F127A the E3 mutations are &quot;functionally coupled&quot; when the GV is the same to E3 WT (Figure 2A &amp; B), but for F130A, the E3 mutations are &quot;functionally coupled&quot; when the GV differs from E3 WT (Figure 2C &amp; D).</p><p>7) Figure 4. The FV of the mutant channels + E3 WT shifts to negative voltages and shows two components. The shifts need to be characterized and compared to WT KCNQ1+E3. The ratio of DF-160/DF60 in Figure 4F does not reflect the shift and is misleading (see comment 2).</p><p>8) E1 differs from E3 in sequence and function but the S4 mutations are shown to affect E1 and E3 similarly, please explain. In addition, previous studies (Melman et al. 2001 JBC) showed that the triplet amino acids in the middle of the transmembrane segment of KCNE1 and 3 can switch the function between KCNE1 and KCNE3. How does this study reconcile with the previous results?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript dealing with the functional effect of KCNE3 on KCNQ1 function. Using the latest KCNQ1/KCNE3 CryoEM structures, they test different residues for functional effects on S4 movement or gate opening. They identify some interactions between S1 and KCNE3 and that these interactions affect the voltage sensor S4 movement via two residues in S4. This is a timely study on a physiologically important K channel involved in many diseases. My main concern is how the analysis of the data was done. But if it stands up to more rigorous analysis, I think the findings are very important and would be interesting to a general audience.</p><p>1. Pg. 7. Line 108. Is ÎF-160mV/ÎF60mV a convincing measure for determining the voltage dependence? Can authors explain more about the parameter and why they choose this one? To me, it is not clear that this parameter will give unambiguous conclusions. For example, If F1 is shifted to more depolarized potentials, then the ratio will be bigger. But if F2 is shifted to the right instead, then the ratio will also be bigger. So how distinguish between these two cases with this parameter? Why didn't the authors use even more negative voltages (-180 mV) or positive voltages (+80 mV) to get complete FVs?</p><p>2. Also, normalizing the FVs at +60mV if they are not saturated at +60mV will distort the FVs. Not sure how to get around this problem though?</p><p>3. Pg. 9. Line 167. M238 and V241 are important for KCNE3 binding and modulation of KCNQ1, but no evidence shows that M238 and V241 interact with S1 of KCNQ1, even though they seem face to each other. In other words, the authors have not identified the functional coupling between S1 and S4. Therefore, the subtitle here is not appropriate.</p><p>4. Admittedly, KCNE3 interacts with S1 and S4, but the authors have not shown any evidence that S4 and S1 interact, and that these interactions are important for VSD modulation of KCNE1 or KCNE3. The title stating the triad interaction need to be revised. Any statement talking about triad interaction, such as line 73 and 278, should be avoided.</p><p>5. Pg. 8. Line 134-138.

The new data and improved presentation provide very strong evidence that the KCNQ1 S1 â KCNE3 interface observed in a cryo-EM structure is critical for KCNE3 to exert its proper functional effect on KCNQ1. The volume scanning of each residue on both sides of a double mutant cycle analysis that resulted in rescue by multiple sets of interacting pairs makes it difficult to imagine that the binding interface observed in the structure is not an interface that enables KCNE3 function.</p><p>General suggestion:</p><p>The language in the paper refers to mutants &quot;impairing&quot; the modulation or being &quot;tolerated&quot;.

I now have only one comment that should be addressed:</p><p>The fits of the FVs are in some cases not constrained enough by the data, e.g. when the data do not tend to saturate at either the negative or positive range of voltages. In those cases, it is much better to just report an upward bound for the V0.5. For example, one can state that the V0.5&gt;+60 mV for FVs that do tend to saturate at positive voltages and V0.5&lt;-160 mV for FVs that do tend to saturate at negative voltages. The conclusions will still be the same and valid even without an exact V0.5 number, since for the single mutants you have a V0.5 that is different from +60mV or -160 mV.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this interesting study the interaction between the S1 segment of KCNQ1 and the transmembrane segment of KCNE3 was shown to determine the shift of voltage dependence of activation of both the voltage sensor and the conductance. Guided by the KCNQ1-KCNE3 structure that was previously solved using cryo-EM, extensive mutations suggested that the S1-KCNE3 interaction depended on the size of the side chain of residues in these segments. Changing side chain sizes in either S1 or KCNE3 altered the conductance shifts, and at two pairs of S1-KCNE3 interaction residues, the complementary size changes rescued voltage shifts for both conductance and voltage sensor activation. The data are clearly presented with compelling conclusions. These results provide molecular mechanism for subunit modulation of a physiologically important ion channel. Some comments are as follows.</p><p>1. It is known that KCNE1, which is an important KCNQ1 regulatory subunit in the heart, also shifts voltage sensor activation to more negative voltages similarly as KCNE3. This study only focuses on KCNE3. While the study is well done with interesting results, the results would be more significant for publishing in <italic>eLife</italic> if some of the KCNQ1 mutations can be coexpressed with KCNE1 to examine if similar interactions proposed here are important for KCNE1 function. Such experiments do not have to be extensive as for the KCNE3 study. The insights can be very valuable. It seems that the previous version of the manuscript included some KCNE1 results. The authors should not cut out these results in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2. The authors addressed the comments from previous reviews on the issue of association of mutant KCNE3 with KCNQ1. 10 ng KCNQ1 was used to express the channel complex with 1 ng mutant KCNE3. To support that this method allows a full association of KCNE3 with KCNQ1, the functional dependence on different concentrations of KCNE3 RNA, a high and a low concentration, should be shown for at least a couple of KCNE3 mutations.</p><p>3.

The reviewers agreed that validation of the interface by KCNQ1 F127A-KCNE3 G73L is an important result. However, this major conclusion could benefit from further experiments. Reviewers all thought that the data analysis needs substantial revision, and other claims should be tempered. If further experiments lead to additional mechanistic insights, the combined results could be submitted as a new manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study aimed to identify amino acid residues on KCNE3 facing the S1 segment of KCNQ1 that are required for constitutive activity, and identify residues on the S4 segment which convert KCNE effects into voltage sensor movement. The research appears technically sound and expertly performed. The major strength of this work is the molecular redesign of KCNE3 and the S1 segment of KCNQ1 to rescue the functional interaction between KCNE3 and KCNQ1. However, this key result rests on a single pair of mutations. The weaknesses are some of the mechanistic interpretations pertaining to functional coupling between KCNQ1 and KCNE3. The manuscript achieved its aim of identifying amino acid residues on KCNE3 facing the S1 segment of KCNQ1 that are required for constitutive activity. This work also identifies mutations on the S4 segment which diminish KCNE1 effects, but data seems inadequate to support the claim that the residues identified on the S4 are the site of conversion of KCNE effects into voltage sensor movement, as alternate explanations also appear plausible. Importantly, this work presents strong evidence that the KCNE3/S1 interface observed structurally is accurate in its molecular detail, and crucial for inter-protein coupling. This study should cement the functional relevance of the KCNE3 interface with the S1 of KCNQ1 observed in a recent structure. Additionally. this work identifies key sites that perturb the modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE proteins.</p><p>The KCNQ1 F127A-KCNE3 G73L result is compelling, it is strong conceptual evidence that the KCNE3/S1 interface forms as advertised. I think the paper would be better appreciated if it focused almost entirely on this result, and perhaps further investigate this key finding with a few more related experiments. The manuscript states that &quot; Appropriate side-chain volumes at the interaction interface are necessary&quot; yet could other physical/chemical concepts explain the reason for rescue?</p><p>Testing further sets of double mutations at positions 127 and 73 could test whether this apparent rescue by the swap of side chain bulk is more than just a happy coincidence, and whether bulk inversions at positions 127 and 73 could be found that produce channels even more functionally similar to WT KCNE/KCNQ</p><p>I wonder if this KCNQ1 F127A-KCNE3 G73L protein engineering could be used to knock in KCNE-resistant channels that will only respond when a mutant KCNE is expressedâ¦possibly useful for experiments conceptually similar to DREADDs or Kevan Shokat's knob-in-hole chemical genetics.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your valuable comments. In this revised manuscript, we exclusively focused on the interaction between the S1 and KCNE3, following your suggestions.

In combination with the structure, the possibility of this being a site of conversion does seems plausible, but these results do not make this certain. This result merely means that perturbation of these sites perturbs the coupling. This is consistent with being a site of physical coupling, or conversion, but based on this result alone, other physical possibilities also seem plausible.

Furthermore, as seen in Figure supplement 8, we confirmed that our experiment condition where 10 ng RNA of KCNQ1 co-injected with 1 ng RNA of KCNE3 is sufficient to fully modulate KCNQ1 currents at least in the cases of KCNE3 WT and two representative mutants (S57A and G73L).

These mutated residues are located in the transmembrane segment S1 and S4 of KCNQ1 and of KCNE3. The authors found that the KCNE4 mutations F68A, V72A and I 76 A abolished the ability of KCNE3 to shift GV relation to voltages more negative than -160 mV, which is similar to the findings of their previous study that the S1 mutations F127A and F130A also abolished the ability of KCNE3 to shift GV to negative voltages. A double mutation Q1 F127A + E3 G73L rescued a large part of the GV shift, supporting the observation from the structure that KCNQ1 S1 and KCNE3 may interact among these residues for the modulatory effects of KCNE3 on channel gating. The authors also measured VSD movements in the WT and these mutant channels using VCF, and concluded that the S1-E3 interactions at the S1 site are important for the KCNE3 induced shift of VSD activation to the negative voltages. The authors then found that mutations of S4, M238A and M241A, also reduced the ability of KCNE3 to shift the GV relation, and reduce VSD activation at negative voltages. Based on these results, the authors conclude that the interactions among S1, S4 and KCNE3 at the location of these residues modulate VSD activation and stabilize the open state of the channel. The manuscript presents some interesting data, including the Q1 F127A + E3 G73L results as evidence for S1-KCNE3 interaction. However, some of the conclusions made in the manuscript seem to be based on incomplete experiments or analyses of the data.</p><p>Some questions and comments are as follows.</p><p>1) Although mutant KCNE3 was shown to express in the surface membrane, it is not known if E3 association with Q1 is reduced by the mutations. It is known that Q1:E1 at different ratio can have different stoichiometry (as shown by the author of this manuscript) and the channels with different stoichiometry show different function including G-V and kinetics. Does KCNE3 share similar properties? Additional experiments may be needed to address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this critical point. We also think the stoichiometry could be various, especially when E3 expression is low, as in the case of Q1:E1. To verify the E3 expression level was high enough, we conducted KCNQ1-KCNE3 current measurements with various amounts of KCNE3 RNAs (Figure supplement 8). According to the experiments, 1 ng of KCNE3 RNA is sufficient to fully modulate 10 ng of KCNQ1 channels. We added these descriptions to explain our rational experiment design (Lines 146-148).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors used DF-160/DF60 to measure VSD activation. In VCF measurements it is not clear how VCF amplitude is related to VSD movements. This method seems to be flawed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing the problem out. We admit the DF-160/DF60 index may not be appropriate and is no longer used for evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear why the authors did not analyze the VCF data to show FV. The relationship between FV and GV is not analyzed either. The authors made conclusions in reference of intermediate and activated states of the VSD, but these conclusions were not backed up by data of fluorescence or current measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added G-Vs and F-Vs for all VCF data in Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) KCNE3 may also contact with S3 and S5 of KCNQ1 in the cryo-EM structure. Why did not the authors inspect the residues in these motifs? In addition, the cryo-EM structure shows the conformation of only one state, but the KCNE3-KCNQ1 interactions in other states are not known. These need to be considered in the structure motivated mutagenesis study.</p></disp-quote><p>As you pointed out, other segments are in contact with KCNE3 in the cryo-EM structure. In this paper, however, we focused on the S1 segment in the VSD in this study. Of course, our results do not exclude any significance of the contact with the pore domain (S5 and S6).</p><p>We understand that the cryo-EM structure represents one of many states. Still, our mutagenesis studies clearly show that most of the interactions between S1 and KCNE3 in the structure are required for the constitutive activity of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to comment 4, how does this study reconcile with the studies by the McDonald lab (Melman et al. 2004 Neuron), which concluded that KCNE1 (and KCNE3) interacted with the pore domain of KCNQ1 to modulate channel activation?</p></disp-quote><p>As answered for comment 4, our results do not exclude any significance of the contact with the pore domain (S5 and S6). However, according to Barro-Soria et al. (PNAS, 2017), KCNE1 affects both the S4 movement and the gate, while KCNE3 affects the S4 movement and only affects the gate indirectly. Therefore, the interaction between the pore domain and KCNE3 could be less important than in the case of KCNE1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 2. What does &quot;functionally coupled&quot; mean? How is this defined? The interpretation of Figure 2 data is hard to follow and seems to be arbitrary. For example, for F127A the E3 mutations are &quot;functionally coupled&quot; when the GV is the same to E3 WT (Figure 2A &amp; B), but for F130A, the E3 mutations are &quot;functionally coupled&quot; when the GV differs from E3 WT (Figure 2C &amp; D).</p></disp-quote><p>As we answered to reviewer #1, the analysis may be flawed, and we abandoned this part in this revision. Therefore, the sentence no longer exists.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 4. The FV of the mutant channels + E3 WT shifts to negative voltages and shows two components. The shifts need to be characterized and compared to WT KCNQ1+E3. The ratio of DF-160/DF60 in Figure 4F does not reflect the shift and is misleading (see comment 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We updated the FV analysis to clearly show the two components in the Q1WT + E3 WT. Mutations on KCNQ1 diminished the first component, suggesting that the intermediate state of the VSD became harder to maintain by the mutations. Then, E3 mutants partly restored the first component (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) E1 differs from E3 in sequence and function but the S4 mutations are shown to affect E1 and E3 similarly, please explain. In addition, previous studies (Melman et al. 2001 JBC) showed that the triplet amino acids in the middle of the transmembrane segment of KCNE1 and 3 can switch the function between KCNE1 and KCNE3. How does this study reconcile with the previous results?</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript, we no longer examined KCNE1 and solely focused on KCNE3. However, the functional difference between KCNE1 and KCNE3 is still an open and vital question that remains to be seen. One possible explanation is the intermediate state of KCNQ1-KCNE1 is non-conductive while the intermediate state of KCNQ1-KCNE3 is conductive. Amino acid sequence difference may contribute to the conductive state of the intermediate state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript dealing with the functional effect of KCNE3 on KCNQ1 function. Using the latest KCNQ1/KCNE3 CryoEM structures, they test different residues for functional effects on S4 movement or gate opening. They identify some interactions between S1 and KCNE3 and that these interactions affect the voltage sensor S4 movement via two residues in S4. This is a timely study on a physiologically important K channel involved in many diseases. My main concern is how the analysis of the data was done. But if it stands up to more rigorous analysis, I think the findings are very important and would be interesting to a general audience.</p><p>1. Pg. 7. Line 108. Is ÎF-160mV/ÎF60mV a convincing measure for determining the voltage dependence? Can authors explain more about the parameter and why they choose this one? To me, it is not clear that this parameter will give unambiguous conclusions. For example, If F1 is shifted to more depolarized potentials, then the ratio will be bigger. But if F2 is shifted to the right instead, then the ratio will also be bigger. So how distinguish between these two cases with this parameter? Why didn't the authors use even more negative voltages (-180 mV) or positive voltages (+80 mV) to get complete FVs?</p></disp-quote><p>As we answered reviewer #2âs comment, we admitÎF-160mV/ÎF60mV may not be appropriate.

According to the experiments, 1 ng of KCNE3 RNA is high enough to fully modulate KCNQ1 channels. The G73L and S57A showed similar tendencies. Most KCNE3 mutants show different z and V1/2 values, as shown in Table supplement 2, indicating they successfully modulated KCNE3. Only one exception is I76A. KCNQ1+KCNE3 I76A showed similar z and V1/2 values to KCNQ1 WT alone (Table supplements 1-2, Figure supplement 12). It may fail to bind KCNQ1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 1D and 1F, for the trace of -160 mV in Q1-WT-E3-WT, the fluorescence signal is lower at the tail voltage of -30 mV than at the resting voltage of -90 mV, which seems incorrect. I would expect S4 would move up higher during -30 mV than -90 mV, which means the fluorescence signal would be bigger at -30 mV than -90 mV. Please show better recordings or explain why.

The new data and improved presentation provide very strong evidence that the KCNQ1 S1 â KCNE3 interface observed in a cryo-EM structure is critical for KCNE3 to exert its proper functional effect on KCNQ1.

Such speculation is not necessary but is my conceptual takeaway from this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the reviewer #1âs insightful speculation. As shown in Figure supplement 8G-R, no matter how much the KCNE3 RNA ratio increased, the modulation was not fully recovered in KCNE3 mutants. This result indicates the latter is likely the case. Accordingly, as reviewer #1 suggested, we stopped using the word âimpairingâ and âtoleratedâ and changed them like âchanged the functional outputâ or âdistortedâ (lines 90-91, 114-115, 133-134, 138, 141, 163-164, 167-168, 172-173, 181-182, 184, 190-191, 195, 201, 207, and 232, highlighted in yellow).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific suggestions:</p><p>Line 112</p><p>&quot; It seemed that the modulation depended on the side-chain volume: the more different the size was, the more significant was the impairment of modulation (Figure 2N). &quot;</p><p>It could be helpful to quantitate what the side chain volumes are for G, A, V, L, F, W.</p></disp-quote><p>According to this comment, we added the volumes of amino acid residues in Figure 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 220</p><p>&quot;which further strengthens the importance of the tight interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3. &quot;</p><p>I think it would be more appropriate to state that this is the strong evidence that the specific interaction between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is important.

I now have only one comment that should be addressed:</p><p>The fits of the FVs are in some cases not constrained enough by the data, e.g. when the data do not tend to saturate at either the negative or positive range of voltages. In those cases, it is much better to just report an upward bound for the V0.5. For example, one can state that the V0.5&gt;+60 mV for FVs that do tend to saturate at positive voltages and V0.5&lt;-160 mV for FVs that do tend to saturate at negative voltages. The conclusions will still be the same and valid even without an exact V0.5 number, since for the single mutants you have a V0.5 that is different from +60mV or -160 mV.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that we were able to respond to your previous comments appropriately. According to the additional comment, we revised the table (Figure 5-source data 2) as well as lines 259 and 268.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this interesting study the interaction between the S1 segment of KCNQ1 and the transmembrane segment of KCNE3 was shown to determine the shift of voltage dependence of activation of both the voltage sensor and the conductance. Guided by the KCNQ1-KCNE3 structure that was previously solved using cryo-EM, extensive mutations suggested that the S1-KCNE3 interaction depended on the size of the side chain of residues in these segments. Changing side chain sizes in either S1 or KCNE3 altered the conductance shifts, and at two pairs of S1-KCNE3 interaction residues, the complementary size changes rescued voltage shifts for both conductance and voltage sensor activation. The data are clearly presented with compelling conclusions. These results provide molecular mechanism for subunit modulation of a physiologically important ion channel. Some comments are as follows.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your valuable comments. The responses to each comment are as follows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is known that KCNE1, which is an important KCNQ1 regulatory subunit in the heart, also shifts voltage sensor activation to more negative voltages similarly as KCNE3. This study only focuses on KCNE3. While the study is well done with interesting results, the results would be more significant for publishing in eLife if some of the KCNQ1 mutations can be coexpressed with KCNE1 to examine if similar interactions proposed here are important for KCNE1 function. Such experiments do not have to be extensive as for the KCNE3 study. The insights can be very valuable. It seems that the previous version of the manuscript included some KCNE1 results. The authors should not cut out these results in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive comment. Following this comment, we performed a preliminary mutational analysis of KCNQ1 F127 mutants (F127A, F127V, F127L, and F127W) to investigate the functional relationship between the S1 segment and KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We chose the F127 residue here since its modulation by KCNE3 depends on its side-chain volume size (Figure 2A-G, N), and the KCNQ1 F127A mutant-KCNE3 G73L mutant pair restored the modulation of KCNQ1 by KCNE3 (Figure 4A-G). All the F127 mutants potentiated KCNE1-dependent half-activation voltage (<italic>V<sub>1/2</sub></italic>) shifts. Moreover, the more different side chain sizes induced the more significant <italic>V<sub>1/2</sub></italic> shifts. (Please note that the G-V curve for F127A+E1 is omitted in the Cover letter figure 1K because the curve is shifted far in the positive direction and is impossible to fit with the Boltzmann function.) These results suggest that, at least for the F127 residue, the modulation by KCNE1 depended on the side-chain volume, as in the case of KCNE3. However, we would like to keep the KCNE1 results for the next manuscript because we think it is necessary to show all the scanning results of S1 residue to claim possible side-chain volume dependence on the KCNE1 modulation. (We hope the next one will lead to an exciting result that can suffice to submit <italic>eLife</italic>.) Adding the partial F127 residue result to this manuscript may confuse readers. We would still be happy to add the KCNE1 results to the current manuscript if reviewer #3 thinks it is indispensable.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Functional effects of KCNQ1 F127 mutants on KCNQ1 modulation by KCNE1.</title><p>(A-N) Representative current traces (A-J) and G-V relationships (K-N) of KCNQ1 WT and F127 mutants with or without KCNE1 WT.

The authors addressed the comments from previous reviews on the issue of association of mutant KCNE3 with KCNQ1. 10 ng KCNQ1 was used to express the channel complex with 1 ng mutant KCNE3. To support that this method allows a full association of KCNE3 with KCNQ1, the functional dependence on different concentrations of KCNE3 RNA, a high and a low concentration, should be shown for at least a couple of KCNE3 mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already presented the suggested experiment for KCNE3 S57A and G73L mutants in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G-R. We chose the KCNE3 mutants since they are functionally coupling with KCNQ1 I145F and F127A mutants, respectively (Figure 4). In both KCNE3 mutants, 0.3 ng KCNE3 RNA is enough to achieve maximum modulation with 10 ng KCNQ1 WT RNA. These results support that our expression condition through the experiment (10 ng KCNQ1 RNA and 1 ng KCNE3 RNA) is reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As reviewer #3 noted, the sequence of F127 mutations in KCNQ1 seem to shift the GV of both +KCNE1 and +KCNE3 in a similar way, even though KCNE1 and KCNE3 shift the GV of KCNQ1 in opposing fashions. This is very interesting, broadens the significance of the findings to the KCNE family generally, and deserves thoughtful mechanistic discussion. Also, please show data quantifying the reproducibility of the Cover Letter Figure 1D results show to back the claim that the F127A+E1 GV is shifted far in the positive direction.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have responded to my comments. Yes, please include the KCNE1 results shown in the rebuttal in the manuscript, and a discussion of the comparison between KCNE1 and KCNE3 results will be significant since KCNE1 and KCNE3 modulate channel function with drastic differences. These results, on the other hand, do not show mechanistic differences. What would this comparison mean to the mechanism studied in this manuscript?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs constructive comments. We have added the new Figure 6 of KCNQ1 F127 mutants co-expressed with KCNE1 WT. We have also added the Results section (lines 274-286) and the Discussion section (lines 350-361). As discussed in the manuscript, we hypothesize the S1 segment may have a similar role in the KCNE1 and KCNE3 modulations, which is to help stabilize the intermediate state of the voltage sensor domain. Further extensive study is required for the possible role of the S1 segment in the KCNE1 modulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
