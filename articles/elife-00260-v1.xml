In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, we found that exogenous sugar decreased the abundance of miR156, whereas reduced photosynthesis increased the level of this miRNA. This effect was correlated with a change in the timing of vegetative phase change, and was primarily attributable to a change in the expression of two genes, <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>, which were found to play dominant roles in this transition. The glucose-induced repression of miR156 was dependent on the signaling activity of HEXOKINASE1. We also show that the defoliation-induced increase in miR156 levels can be suppressed by exogenous glucose.

Now, based on experiments with the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, Yang et al. and, independently, Yu et al. have provided fresh insights into the role of sugar in ‘vegetative phase change'—the transition from the juvenile form of a plant to the adult plant.</p><p>The new work takes advantage of the fact that vegetative phase change is controlled by two genes that encode microRNAs (MIRNAs). <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has eight <italic>MIR156</italic> genes and both groups confirmed that supplying plants with sugar reduces the expression of two of these—<italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>—whereas sugar deprivation increases their expression. Removing leaves also leads to upregulation of both genes, and delays the juvenile to adult transition. Given that this effect can be partially reversed by providing the plant with sugar, it is likely that sugar produced in the leaves—or one of its metabolites—is the signal that triggers the juvenile to adult transition through the reduction of miR156 levels.</p><p>Consistent with this idea, Yang and co-workers revealed that mutant plants that are deficient in chlorophyll show elevated levels of miR156 and a delayed transition to the adult form. In addition, they showed that a gene called <italic>HXK1</italic>, which encodes a glucose signaling protein, helps to keep plants in the juvenile form under conditions of low sugar availability. HXK1 also contributes to the glucose-induced decrease in miR156 levels and does so, at least in part, by regulating the transcription of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> genes into messenger mRNA. HXK1 is not solely responsible for the juvenile to adult transition, however, because plants that lack this protein are only slightly precocious in their transition to the adult form.</p><p>The works of Yang et al. and Yu et al. have thus provided key insights into the mechanisms by which a leaf-derived signal controls a key developmental change in plants. Just as fruit flies use their nutritional status to regulate the onset of metamorphosis, and mammals use it to control the onset of puberty, so plants use the level of sugar in their leaves to trigger the transition from juvenile to adult forms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00260.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00260.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>phase change</kwd><kwd>heteroblasty</kwd><kwd>Nicotiana benthamiana</kwd><kwd>heterochrony</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH-R01-GM051893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poethig</surname><given-names>R Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sugar levels in leaves act as a signal for plants to switch from their juvenile to their adult form by regulating the expression of two genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Higher plants and animals undergo several distinct transitions during their post-embryonic development. The correct timing of these developmental events is critical for survival and reproduction, and is regulated by complex interactions between endogenous and environmental factors, such as nutrition, temperature, or photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernier, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rougvie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amasino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tolson and Chappell, 2012</xref>). In plants, the maturation of the shoot can be divided into three phases: a juvenile vegetative phase, an adult vegetative phase, and a reproductive phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poethig, 1990</xref>). The juvenile to adult transition (vegetative phase change) is regulated by miR156 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu and Poethig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chuck et al., 2007</xref>), a microRNA that is conserved throughout the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Axtell and Bowman, 2008</xref>). miR156 is highly expressed in the juvenile phase and decreases dramatically during vegetative phase change. This decrease produces an increase in the expression of its direct targets, SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SBP/SPL) transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwab et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2009</xref>), which go on to mediate the morphological and physiological changes associated with this transition. The basis for the decrease in miR156 expression is unknown.</p><p>One of the most obvious signs of phase change is a change in leaf shape. Goebel termed this phenomenon ‘heteroblasty’, and recognized that shoot development could be divided into more-or-less discrete stages on the basis of this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebel, 1889</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1900</xref>). Goebel believed that the transition between juvenile and adult leaf types—the hallmark of vegetative phase change—is the result of a change in the nutritional status of the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goebel, 1908</xref>). According to this hypothesis, leaves produced early in shoot development are typically small and morphologically simple because leaf development is arrested by low endogenous nutrient levels, and leaves become more complex as the size and metabolic capacity of the plant increases. Subsequent studies in both ferns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allsopp, 1953a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">1953b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wetmore, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steeves and Sussex, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sussex and Clutter, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottlieb and Steeves, 1965</xref>) and flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Njoku, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röbbelen, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feldman and Cutter, 1970</xref>) have shown that exogenous sugar promotes the production of larger and more complex leaves, whereas growing plants or isolated leaf primordia in nutrient-deprived conditions or low light promotes the production of simple leaves. However, the implications of these results for the regulation of vegetative phase change remain controversial. In particular, it is still unclear if the leaf types produced by modifying carbohydrate levels correspond to juvenile and adult leaves. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones (1995)</xref> reported that the developmental anatomy of <italic>Cucurbita argyrosperma</italic> leaves produced under low light conditions is not identical to that of juvenile leaves. Defining the molecular basis for the effect of sugar on shoot morphogenesis is therefore an important problem in plant development.</p><p>Sugars regulate plant physiology and development by several different signaling pathways, which interact with various hormone and nutrient response pathways, resulting in complex signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smeekens et al., 2010</xref>). The function of HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1) in sugar signaling has been particularly well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rolland et al., 2006</xref>). HXK1 has dual roles in glucose homeostasis. Its enzymatic function is to catalyze the first step in glycolysis, the transformation of glucose into glucose-6-phosphate. It also functions as a sugar sensor, and can regulate gene transcription in response to changes in glucose concentration. This latter function was identified when it was discovered that glucose phosphorylation—which is a major output of the catalytic function of HXK1—was not correlated with the quantitative indicators of glucose signaling such as chlorophyll production and photosynthetic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore et al., 2003</xref>). Mutated forms of HXK1 that lack glucose phosphorylation capacity are nevertheless capable of mediating glucose signaling, demonstrating that the signaling function of HXK1 is independent of its enzymatic activity. This signaling function is executed by an HXK1-containing nuclear complex, which is thought to bind to the promoters of various genes in the presence of high levels of glucose to control their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the role of sugar in vegetative phase change by examining the effect of a photosynthetic mutation and exogenous sugar on the expression of miR156 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Given that miR156 regulates all aspects of vegetative phase change, we reasoned that factors that affect its expression are likely to play an important role in this process. We show that glucose promotes vegetative phase change by repressing the accumulation of miR156 and that this effect can be attributed to a decrease in the expression of two of the eight <italic>MIR156</italic> genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. HXK1 is required for this effect, and acts through its signaling function to promote the expression of miR156 under conditions of low sugar availability. Finally, the effect of glucose on miR156 expression in defoliated seedlings supports the hypothesis that glucose, or a derivative of this sugar, is a component of the leaf signal that promotes vegetative phase change. These results provide a potential molecular mechanism for the temporal decrease in miR156 during vegetative phase change, linking nutrient levels to shoot maturation in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced photosynthesis delays vegetative phase change</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the onset of the adult phase is characterized by the appearance of abaxial trichomes and a change of leaf shape from round leaves with a smooth margin to elongated leaves with a serrated margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Telfer et al., 1997</xref>). In the original description of heteroblasty in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röbbelen (1957)</xref> reported that several chlorophyll-deficient mutations increased the number of juvenile leaves, and concluded from this observation that the production of adult leaves was promoted by the products of photosynthesis. We reinvestigated this observation by characterizing the phenotype of <italic>chlorina1-4</italic> (<italic>ch1-4</italic>), a mutation in chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> oxygenase (AtCAO, At1g44446) that blocks the biosynthesis of chlorophyll b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Espineda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oster et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>ch1-4</italic> plants were yellow-green, grew more slowly than normal, and also underwent vegetative phase change significantly later than wild-type plants; under short day (SD) conditions, abaxial trichome production was delayed by five leaves and mutant leaves were rounder and had a smoother margin than the leaves of wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). <italic>ch1-4</italic> plants did not display a delay in abaxial trichome production under long days (LD), although their leaves were still rounder than normal.

Northern blots showed that miR156 was initially more abundant and declined more slowly in <italic>ch1-4</italic> than in wild-type plants: miR156 expression declined to a basal level between 12 and 16 days after planting (DAP) in wild-type plants, and between 16 and 20 days DAP in <italic>ch1-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although the <italic>ch1-4</italic> mutants grew more slowly than Col, the difference in miR156 accumulation is unlikely to be a consequence of delayed development because <italic>ch1-4</italic> mutants at 16 DAP had the same number of leaves as wild-type plants at 12 DAP, but still had more miR156 than 12-day-old wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). Consistent with the elevated expression of miR156, the transcript levels of several direct targets of miR156 (<italic>SPL3</italic>, <italic>SPL9</italic>, <italic>SPL13</italic>) were reduced in <italic>ch1-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Thus, HXK1 contributes to the elevated level of miR156 in juvenile plants, but plays a minor role in the expression of miR156 at later stages of shoot development. To determine if HXK1 is required for the response to exogenous sugar, we examined miR156 levels in 10-day-old L<italic>er</italic> and <italic>gin2-1</italic> seedlings grown in the presence and absence of 10 mM glucose (these seedlings were at the same developmental stage as 8-day-old soil-grown seedlings).

Thus, the enzymatic function of HXK1 is not responsible for promoting miR156 expression in sugar-deficient conditions. <italic>gin2-1</italic> produced a small, but statistically significant, decrease in the number of leaves without abaxial trichomes, and this phenotype was completely rescued by both the <italic>S177A</italic> and the wild-type <italic>HXK1</italic> transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Additionally, we found that <italic>MIR156</italic> genes are differentially regulated and that sugar only affects a subset of these genes. Analyses of the expression patterns and mutant phenotypes of two of these sugar-repressed genes, <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>, demonstrated that they play a major role in vegetative phase change. These results, as well as the evidence that sugars increase the expression of the direct targets of miR156, support the hypothesis that sugars promote vegetative phase change through their effect on miR156, and suggest potential mechanisms for the temporal regulation of vegetative phase change in flowering plants.</p><p>Our results also indicate that HXK1 contributes to the sugar-mediated repression of miR156 by promoting the accumulation of miR156 under low sugar conditions. Hexokinases function as glucose sensors in both yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rolland et al., 2002</xref>), so the requirement for HXK1 suggests that glucose is at least partially involved in the sugar response. HXK1 participates in a nuclear complex to directly regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). One possibility is that HXK1 directly promotes the transcription of <italic>MIR156</italic> genes. In this scenario, binding of glucose to HXK1 would block its activity, resulting in a reduction in <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> transcription. Because HXK1 does not seem to have transcriptional activity on its own, this would require an interaction between HXK1 and DNA-binding transcription factors, as has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2006</xref>). It is also possible that sugar represses the accumulation of mature miR156 post-transcriptionally, in addition to its role in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>. In this scenario, sugar operates by one pathway to repress the transcription of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> and by a different pathway to post-transcriptionally reduce the abundance of miR156. The differential effect of glucose and sucrose on the expression of <italic>MIR156A-GUS</italic> and <italic>MIR156C-GUS</italic> may be significant in this regard. Whereas sucrose reliably decreased the expression of these reporters, they were largely insensitive to glucose. This result does not reflect a difference in the inherent sensitivity of seedlings to these sugars because glucose and sucrose were equally effective in reducing the abundance of the endogenous pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C transcripts. This result could reflect the absence of glucose-responding <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in these constructs, but this seems unlikely because we included the entire intragenic regions upstream and downstream of the miR156 hairpin. A third possibility (based on the observation that glucose decreases the abundance of the endogenous pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C transcripts but not transcripts in which the miR156 stem-loop is replaced by GUS) is that glucose regulates the abundance of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C post-transcriptionally, by a mechanism that is dependent on the presence of the miR156 stem-loop structure. If so, glucose must act by destabilizing these primary transcripts, not by blocking the processing of the miR156 stem-loop, because a defect in miR156 processing would be expected to produce an increase in the level of pri-MIR156, not the decrease that we observed. Whatever the case may be, the relatively mild phenotype of <italic>gin2-1</italic> and the observation that miR156 decreases over time in <italic>gin2-1</italic> demonstrates that HXK1 is only one of several signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smeekens et al., 2010</xref>) involved in the regulation of miR156.</p><p>It remains to be determined if sugar levels increase in the shoot apex during vegetative phase change. Nevertheless, it is worth considering how such an increase might occur. One possibility is a regulated increase in sugar export, as occurs upon photoperiodic induction of flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lejeune et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perilleux and Bernier, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corbesier et al., 2002</xref>). However, photoperiod does not play a major role in vegetative phase change in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willmann and Poethig, 2011</xref>), so if the pattern of sugar export changes during vegetative phase change, this event must be regulated by a different factor. An alternative possibility is that vegetative phase change is simply a consequence of an increase in the overall photosynthetic output of the shoot resulting, perhaps, from an increase in leaf number, or a change in photosynthetic efficiency. The observation that the rate of photosynthesis increases significantly during vegetative phase change in <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cameron, 1970</xref>), maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thiagarajah et al., 1981</xref>), and rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Asai et al., 2002</xref>) is consistent with this latter hypothesis. A corollary of this hypothesis is that the juvenile phase is specifically adapted for growth under light-limited conditions, and studies of <italic>Acacia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brodribb and Hill, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pasquet-Kok et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cameron, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ashton and Turner, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">James and Bell, 2000</xref>), and several other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Day, 1998</xref>) indicate that this is the case.</p><p>Endogenous sugar levels fluctuate throughout the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blasing et al., 2005</xref>) and in response to various stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hummel et al., 2010</xref>). Presumably, this fluctuation in sugar levels affects miR156 expression; yet, most plants do not revert to the juvenile phase once they are in the adult phase, and if they do, this event usually involves a few leaves or branches in a localized region of the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaffalitzky de Muckadell, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brink, 1962</xref>), which is not the pattern expected from a global change in nutrient levels. What accounts for the stability of these phases? One possible explanation is that the sensitivity to sugar in the adult phase is overcome by stable epigenetic modification of <italic>MIR156</italic> loci. An alternative possibility is that miR156 expression is only strongly affected by sugar below a threshold concentration of sugar. If sugar levels are above this threshold—as they are expected to be in the adult phase—a further increase might have minor effects on miR156 expression, but this variation would not be sufficient to affect shoot identity. In this regard, it is significant that <italic>gin2-1</italic> had lower levels of miR156 than wild-type plants in the absence of exogenous glucose, but did not differ from wild type in the presence of glucose. The implication of this observation is that HXK1 only promotes miR156 expression under low sugar conditions; above a threshold concentration, glucose blocks HXK1 activity, resulting in a decrease in miR156 expression and buffering miR156 expression against fluctuations in glucose concentration. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in <italic>ch1-4</italic> miR156 is only elevated in the juvenile phase; adult phase <italic>ch1-4</italic> plants had the same level of miR156 as wild-type plants, although there was no obvious improvement in their growth rate or color that might indicate an increase in their photosynthetic capacity.</p><p>The results presented here provide molecular evidence for the long-standing hypothesis that states that maturation is regulated by an increase in endogenous carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allsopp, 1954</xref>). Additional studies will be required to determine if carbohydrates are the primary regulators of vegetative phase change, or if other endogenous factors play an important role in this developmental transition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetic stocks</title><p>Unless otherwise specified, all stocks were in a Col genetic background. <italic>ch1-4</italic> was a gift from Roberto Bassi (University of Verona), <italic>mir156a-1</italic> (SALK_056809) and <italic>mir156a-2</italic> (SALK_131562) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, United States), and <italic>mir156c-1</italic> (GT22288) was a gift from Robert Martienssen. <italic>mir156c-1</italic> was originally in a L<italic>er</italic> background, and was crossed to Col six times, accompanied by PCR-genotyping to minimize linkage drag.

Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor (Detlef Weigel) and 2 reviewers, one of whom (Rick Amasino) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments based on the reviewers' reports.</p><p>The finding that sugar may be the age signal that acts via the miR156/SPL module is a significant advance in plant biology that will stimulate further research.</p><p>There are, however, some issues that need to be resolved, in particular the inconsistencies between your paper and the related paper submitted by the Wang lab.</p><p>[Editors' note: these two studies were conducted independently; each was reviewed on its own merits, on the understanding that it would be published alongside the related study if both were accepted.]</p><p>Although the major conclusion of both papers is the same, namely that sugar treatment reduces the levels of miR156, three major differences are: 1) effect or lack thereof of cycloheximide, 2) hexokinase dependence (i.e., whether or not HXK1 is a glucose sensor for the age effect), and 3) transcriptional versus post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>MIR156</italic> expression. Some of these inconsistencies might result from studying different promoters (<italic>MIR156A</italic> vs <italic>MIR156C</italic>), measuring miR156 versus <italic>pri-MIR156C</italic> levels, the use of liquid culture versus solid media, or different temperature and light regimens.</p><p>Two other issues are:</p><p>4) The possible difference in effect of the <italic>cao/chlorina1</italic> mutant is due to short day versus long day conditions.

Some of these inconsistencies might result from studying different promoters (MIR156A vs MIR156C), measuring miR156 versus pri-MIR156C levels, the use of liquid culture versus solid media, or different temperature and light regimens</italic>.</p><p>1) We examined the effect of cycloheximide on the level of mature miR156 and found that sugar-mediated repression of this transcript does not occur in the presence of cycloheximide. Jia-Wei's result for <italic>MIR156A</italic> matches our results for mature miR156. One possible explanation is that we examined the effect of cycloheximide on mature miR156 levels and Jia-Wei examined the effect on pri-miR156 transcripts. If sugar represses the accumulation of miR156 post-transcriptionally through a translation-dependent process, this may explain the difference. It also could be the case that <italic>MIR156A</italic> is the major contributor to the mature miR156 pool at this stage.</p><p>2) Jia-Wei reported that <italic>gin2</italic> mutations do not block the repressive effect of sugar on miR156 expression; in contrast, we found that the accumulation of the mature miR156 in <italic>gin2-1</italic> is insensitive to sugar. We tested the effect of sugar on the primary <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> transcripts in Ler and <italic>gin2-1</italic> by qRT-PCR, and found that <italic>gin2-1</italic> completely blocks the glucose-induced decrease in <italic>pri-MIR156A</italic> and partially blocks the decrease in <italic>pri-MIR156C</italic> (data not shown). These results are consistent with our northern results for the mature miR156 transcript.</p><p>It should be emphasized that our claim that HXK1 promotes miR156 expression is not based on the lack of an effect of sugar on miR156 expression in <italic>gin2-1</italic>, but rather on the effect of <italic>gin2-1</italic> on miR156 expression in the absence of exogenous sugar. We observed that <italic>gin2-1</italic> has lower levels of miR156 than wild-type plants on sugar-free media (i.e., in soil), leading to the conclusion that HXK1 promotes the accumulation of miR156 under conditions of low sugar.</p><p>We should also emphasize that we are not claiming that HXK1 is the only sugar sensor involved in miR156 expression, and do not believe that this is the case. In the revised manuscript, we present a new panel (Figure 5A) demonstrating that miR156 declines in <italic>gin2-1</italic> over time, just as it does in wild-type plants. Thus, HXK is not required for the temporal decline in miR156, but it does contribute to the initial high level of miR156 expression.</p><p>We assayed the effect of sugar on <italic>gin2-1</italic> using two methods: 1) directly growing seedlings on ½ MS medium containing various sugars; 2) growing seedlings on ½ MS medium without any sugar, and then transferring these seedlings to media containing various sugars for 4–12 hrs. Both methods produced similar results.</p><p>It is important to note that the effect of <italic>gin2</italic> is dependent on both genetic background and mineral nutrients. In contrast to <italic>gin2-1,</italic> which is in a Ler background, we did not observe a stable low level of miR156 in T-DNA alleles of HXK1 in a Col background. Second, we found that nitrogen in the form of nitrate or ammonia is essential for the sugar response. When we performed sugar response experiments in a nitrogen-deficient medium, the sugar-mediated regulation of miR156 disappeared. It is well known that plants are acutely sensitive to the C:N ratio, so this result is not surprising. For example, the repressive role glucose on photosynthetic gene expression is most evident in a nitrate-deficient medium (Moore et al, 2003).</p><p>3) We re-examined the effect glucose and sucrose on the <italic>MIR156A</italic>-GUS reporter, and expanded this analysis to <italic>MIR156C</italic>, using a newly-constructed <italic>MIR156C</italic>-GUS reporter. We confirmed that sucrose decreased the expression of the <italic>MIR156A</italic>-GUS reporter, and found that it suppressed the <italic>MIR156C</italic>-GUS reporter as well (Figure 5). Glucose had no effect on the expression of <italic>MIR156A</italic>-GUS and only a modest effect on <italic>MIR156C</italic>-GUS, even at a concentration that decreased in the expression of the endogenous <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic> primary transcripts. This result suggests that sucrose represses the transcription of <italic>MIR156A</italic> and <italic>MIR156C</italic>, whereas glucose destabilizes the primary transcripts of these genes by a mechanism that might be dependent on the presence of the miR156 hairpin. These new data may explain some of the initial discrepancies between our conclusions and those of Jia-Wei.</p><p><italic>Two other issues are</italic>:</p><p><italic>4) The possible difference in effect of the cao/chlorina1 mutant is due to short day versus long day conditions. In addition to day length, light intensity, and temperature are likely to play a role. (There also needs to be agreement on the nomenclature of the mutant.</italic>)</p><p>The effect of <italic>ch1</italic> on leaf shape is independent of day length, but the effect of this mutation on abaxial trichome production is only observed under short days. This is common for many genes affecting vegetative phase change. For example, over-expression of miR156 or loss-of-function mutations in SPL genes have much more significant effects on abaxial trichome production in short days than in long days. Presumably this is because photoperiod promotes abaxial trichome production independently of miR156 and the SPL genes.</p><p>We have changed “chlrophyllide a oxygenase” to “chlorophyll a oxygenase”, and provide the AGI number for CH1. We note that it is standard practice in Arabidopsis genetics to use the original name for a gene. AtCAO was originally identified as CHLORINA1, so we use the original name for this gene.</p><p><italic>5) Differences in glucose concentrations used</italic>.</p><p>It is our understanding that Jia-Wei performed most experiments using 50 mM glucose. We had originally tested concentrations of glucose up to 80 mM, and observed no greater effect on miR156 abundance than with 10 mM glucose. We have now included these data in Figure 3C. We used 10 mM glucose for all our experiments because high concentrations of glucose have deleterious effects on plant growth.</p><p><italic>Comments specific to your paper</italic>:</p><p><italic>A) Different sugar concentrations were used for the gene expression and promoter experiments; for the former 0.5–20 mM glucose is used, while 1% (∼50 mM) was used for the latter. Is there a reason for this? If so, please make that clear to the reader</italic>.</p><p>As noted above, we have re-examined the effect of sugar on the expression of these reporters. The GUS-fusion experiments were performed with 50 mM glucose and sucrose – a concentration that is similar to the amount used for the gene expression studies – and is the concentration used by Jia-Wei Wang for most of his experiments. 10 mM glucose or sucrose had no obvious effect on the expression of these reporters.</p><p><italic>B) You should attempt to quantify GUS activity for the MIR156 promoter response experiments</italic>.</p><p>We now include qRT-PCR data for the expression of these reporters (Figure 5).</p><p><italic>C) Regarding the signaling role of HXK1 presented in Figure 6A and 6B, how many biological replicates were performed</italic>?</p><p>In 10/12 independent experiments without sugar treatment, Ler accumulated more mature miR156 than <italic>gin2-1</italic>. In 9/10 independent experiments with sugar treatment, <italic>gin2-1</italic> did <italic>not</italic> display a reduced level of miR156 relative to wild-type plants. Experiments with the transgenic lines (<italic>HXK1/gin2-1</italic> and <italic>S177A/gin2-1</italic>) were performed 5 times, and in four cases we obtained results like those shown in Figure 6C. We have included a figure supplement to demonstrate the repeatability of these results (Figure 6–figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>D) The plant growth conditions for the gin2 experiments are very different from those of the other experiments: plants were grown at 16ºC instead of 22ºC and the light intensity was much lower (60 vs 200 micromol). What is the rationale for this, especially since it is has been reported that MIR156A becomes up-regulated at lower temperatures (see e.g., Lee et al., 2010) and the differences between Ler (WT) and gin2-1 are only marginal (Figure 6C)</italic>?</p><p>We reasoned that low temperature, low light intensity might reduce the accumulation of endogenous sugar, which would provide a sensitized background to score the <italic>gin2-1</italic> phenotype. The increased number of juvenile leaves (18 vs 5) under these conditions is consistent with reports (mentioned above) that low temperature increases miR156 level. We observed the same results under 23°C, SD conditions, although the difference was less significant. This latter result is now presented in Figure 6–figure supplement 2.</p><p><italic>E) Furthermore, are the complemented gin2 mutants significantly different from the gin2 single mutants (column 2 vs 4)? If not, this affects the ability to draw conclusions about the role of HXK1 in the regulation of miR156 levels</italic>.</p><p>Abaxial trichome production in plants containing the complementing transgenes was not significantly different from wild-type (p &gt; 0.1), demonstrating that these transgenes correct the phenotype of <italic>gin2-1</italic>. <italic>gin2-1</italic> mutants were significantly different from both wild type and transgenic plants.</p><p><italic>F) In Figure 6, it would be useful to include results for Ler + glucose when grown under the same conditions. In Figure 6A it is shown that gin2-1 w/o glucose has similar low levels of miR156 as Ler + glucose, but it would be useful to know whether at the morphological level (# of leaves w/o abaxial trichomes) the outcome is the same</italic>.</p><p>The effect of sugar and <italic>gin2-1</italic> on leaf morphology is difficult to score in a Ler background for two reasons. Ler plants produce adult leaves very early on plates (at about leaves 3–4). Given that we have never observed abaxial trichomes on leaf 1 or 2 in any ecotype (including Ler), this gives a very small window (1–2 leaves) to score the <italic>gin2-1</italic> phenotype, greatly reducing any possible difference that may exist. Furthermore, it is difficult to score leaf shape on plants growing on plates because leaves do not develop completely normally under these conditions; this is the reason we did not do this experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
