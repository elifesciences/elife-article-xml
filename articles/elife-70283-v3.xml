cells exhaust proliferative capacity and enter into replicative senescence has become a prominent model for cellular aging in vitro. Despite decades of study, this cellular state is not fully understood in culture and even much less so during aging. Here, we revisit Leonard Hayflick’s original observation of replicative senescence in WI-38 human lung fibroblasts equipped with a battery of modern techniques including RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and ATAC-seq. We find evidence that the transition to a senescent state manifests early, increases gradually, and corresponds to a concomitant global increase in DNA accessibility in nucleolar and lamin associated domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate that senescent WI-38 cells acquire a striking resemblance to myofibroblasts in a process similar to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is regulated by t YAP1/TEAD1 and TGF-β2. Lastly, we show that verteporfin inhibition of YAP1/TEAD1 activity in aged WI-38 cells robustly attenuates this gene expression program.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replicative senescence</kwd><kwd>epithelial to mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>myofibroblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive molecular description of the cellular transition into replicative senescence provides evidence of metabolic, epigenetic, and regulatory rewiring that links senescence with wound healing and fibrosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Replicative senescence in animal cells growing in vitro was first discovered by Leonard Hayflick. He found that primary human diploid fibroblast cell lines ceased to proliferate after an extended number of serial passages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hayflick, 1965</xref>). Since then, considerable work has been done to describe this phenomenon. A major causal feature of replicative senescence is telomere erosion, a process in which the telomeres gradually shorten with increasing cellular divisions. Eventually, the telomeres become uncapped which triggers a DNA damage response that results in cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harley et al., 1990</xref>). It is understood that this is due to the absence of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), the catalytic component of human telomerase which adds telomeric sequences to the ends of chromosomes to maintain telomere length in germ cells and stem cells. As hTERT activity is undetectable in normal human somatic cells, telomere attrition is a common aging phenotype hypothesized to underlie cellular senescence at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Meyerson et al., 1997</xref>). Replicative senescence of human somatic cell lines in vitro can be avoided by overexpression of hTERT which prevents telomere shortening and confers apparently unlimited replicative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bodnar et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Beyond growth arrest and telomere shortening, phenotypic changes exhibited in replicatively senescent cells include the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Proteins of the SASP include proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, angiogenic factors, and proteases. The SASP has been shown to play a role in paracrine signaling whereby senescent cells can promote local wound healing and/or drive healthy neighboring cells into senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acosta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coppé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>). Replicatively senescent cells also accumulate DNA and protein damage, accumulate lipids, and lose regulatory control of mitochondria and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gorgoulis et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The phenotypic similarity (telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and loss of proteostasis) between the cell autonomous aging hallmarks and in vitro senescence has led to the hypothesis that senescent cells in vivo play a causal role in organismal aging and aging-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campisi and d’Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Sedelnikova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jeyapalan and Sedivy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herbig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Childs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this model, several age-related disease states can be directly linked to telomere length or telomerase activity. For example, up to 15% of familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) cases arise from mutations in telomerase and up to 25% of sporadic cases occur in people with telomere lengths less than the 10th percentile. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Tsakiri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armanios et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cronkhite et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Stuart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Raghu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Duckworth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Stuart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dai et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the elimination of senescent cells in a number of age-related diseases, such as cardiac fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis, and metabolic disorders have been argued to alleviate the disease state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Pignolo et al., 2020</xref>). Clinical trials for senolytics targeting fibrotic diseases, osteoporosis, frailty, and metabolic syndromes are currently underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borghesan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which senescent cells might contribute to aging phenotypes is currently still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hernandez-Segura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hernandez-Segura et al., 2018</xref>). In an effort to bring clarity to the replicative senescence process in vitro that in turn could elucidate in vivo function, we revisited and redesigned the original Hayflick experiment. Making use of recent advances in technology we tracked changes in cell state throughout the rplicative lifespan of the original Hayflick WI-38 cell line using bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), ATAC-seq, metabolomics and proteomics.</p><p>Overall, our data recapitulate many known features of the in vitro senescence process while simultaneously providing novel insight. First, the time resolution of our experiment coupled with single-cell trajectory analysis reveals that senescence is a gradual process that shares transcriptional, proteomic, and metabolomic features with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Second, our metabolomic data identifies Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) activity as a potential initiating event in replicative senescence dependent loss of epigenetic silencing. Third, we show that these genomic regions that exhibit increased accessibility with increasing cellular age are concentrated in nucleolar/lamin associated domains and correspond with observed changes in the replicative senescence transcriptome. Lastly, integration across data modalities reveals that senescent WI-38 cells bear a strong resemblance to myofibroblasts. We provide bioinformatic and experimental evidence that the YAP1/TEAD1 transcription factor complex and TGF-β2 signaling are putative regulators of the transition to this state. Together our data suggests that a process similar to fibroblast to myofibroblast transition (FMT; analogous to EMT) is an intrinsic aspect of the replicative senescence phenotype in WI-38 fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic profiles of replicative senescence, radiation-induced senescence, and increasing cellular density</title><p>To capture the replicative senescence process with high resolution we designed an experiment to continuously grow and intermittently sample cells from a starter batch of WI-38 cells that had undergone only 20 population doublings (PDL 20) (methods). To distinguish between replicative senescence-dependent changes and those arising from altered cell density and growth rate, we performed a cell density control study (methods). Briefly, early PDL cells were sampled at increasing levels of cell density to measure gene expression changes associated with cellular density and decreasing cell proliferation independent of replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to the cell density control, we also included TERT immortalized WI-38 cells (hTERT) grown in parallel and sampled alongside wild type (WT) cells as a control for long term culturing and day-to-day sampling batch effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bodnar et al., 1998</xref>). The hTERT cell line was generated in advance of the experiment. Frozen aliquots of the hTERT line were thawed alongside and sampled in parallel with WT WI-38 cells. As expected, hTERT immortalized cells grew at a constant rate and did not slow or cease growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression dynamics of replicative senescence (RS), radiation induced senescence (RIS), increasing cell density (CD) and hTERT WI-38 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design for the RS, RIS, CD and hTERT experiments.

First, as expected, gene expression in the hTERT-immortalized WI-38 cells remained largely stable. Second, replicative senescence, radiation induced senescence, and cell density exhibited many shared, but also unique, gene expression changes with respect to both the identity of differentially expressed genes and the magnitude of their changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To facilitate a biological interpretation of these shifting transcriptomic landscapes, we applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the MSigDB Hallmark annotation sets to learn which general processes are shared and distinct between replicative senescence, radiation induced senescence, and cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Liberzon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>). All three perturbations (and not the immortalized cells), exhibited dramatic reductions in expression of genes belonging to S, G2M, and M cell cycle phases, consistent with cessation of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> - top cluster). Perhaps driven by this shift, we also found significant overlap in additional enriched annotations among genes induced in replicative senescence, radiation induced senescence and cell density, albeit with some variation in significance. Many of the shared enriched annotations can be categorized as stress responses, for example apoptosis, p53 pathway, inflammatory and interferon responses, and STAT3/5 signaling. In addition, we also observed enrichment of several developmental gene sets including myogenesis, angiogenesis, and adipogenesis.</p><p>We observed relatively few gene sets with discordant patterns across the replicative senescence, radiation induced senescence, and cell density experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, the gene set for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was significantly enriched in genes that increased with replicative senescence as opposed to radiation induced senescence (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p=5.5e-6 vs. Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p=0.12) or cell density wherein the term was actually underrepresented, but not significantly so (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p=0.4). Although replicative senescence, radiation induced senescence, and cell density are highly similar at the abstracted level of enriched gene sets, it is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> that there are many induced genes specific to replicative senescence. In addition, we applied GSEA to each individual time point for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>) and found the EMT gene set is enriched early and robustly during replicative senescence.

To do this, we employed UMAP projection as opposed to t-SNE as the former is faster and preserves local structure more so than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>). Cells from the two cell lines organize separately, however, share a similar geometry composed of a S/G2M phase roundabout and a large G1 lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although the overall pattern of WI-38 cells for both cultures was highly similar, we observed progression of cell grouping with PDL that had no concordance with increasing hTERT time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> - red to blue). Specifically, PDL 50 cells (but not the temporally paired hTERT PDL.ctrl 50 time point) organize apart from all other cells within the UMAP projection. To test if these cells were senescent, we scored all cells with a senescent gene expression signature derived from the bulk RNA-seq and found that the highest scoring cells reside within this grouping composed of PDL 50 cells (methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To test model A vs. B, we compared the pseudo-bulk gene expression profiles across the cell cycle at each PDL. We reasoned that if replicative senescence were gradual, we would observe the replicative senescence gene expression pattern even in young cycling cells without respect to G1/S/G2M. Indeed, the replicative senescence signature is present in all cell cycle phases even in early PDLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>- left panels vs. far right panel). In addition, bioinformatic segregation and UMAP projection of cells scored as S/G2M phase cells revealed that the dominant source of variance in cycling cells is the PDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Lastly, we did not observe any cells &lt; PDL 50 in close association with the senescent cells in the UMAP projection PDLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>It has previously been reported and observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) that cell size increases with PDL in primary cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ogrodnik et al., 2019</xref>). We hypothesized that perhaps the higher PDL cells by nature of their larger size, might reach contact inhibition faster than early PDL cells. In this scenario, given the high correlation between the gene expression signatures of senescence and cell density, the increase in senescence signature could be an artifact of cell culture arising from changing morphology. To test this possibility, we scored our single cells again with modified signatures for senescence and cell density composed only of genes uniquely induced in either perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found that the specific senescent signature increases with PDL in WT WI-38 cells in contrast with the specific cell density signature which stays relatively flat. These data provide more evidence supporting a gradual increase in the senescent gene expression program that is independent from changes in cell density.</p><p>Together, these results argue in favor of a gradual model (A) of replicative senescence wherein cells ramp up expression of the replicative senescence program with increasing PDL even when still proliferative. We cannot rule out there are a small minority of cells that enter senescence early in the experiment as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Smith and Whitney, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Passos et al., 2007</xref>). However, for the cells that made it to PDL 50, we observed that the senescent gene expression program manifests in their primogenitors. These data are also consistent with the previously reported changes in cellular phenotype (larger cell size and increased cycling time) with increasing PDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Macieira-Coelho and Azzarone, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ogrodnik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absher et al., 1974</xref>). Importantly, this observation suggests that aspects of cellular senescence are present in non-senescent cells. This result raises the intriguing possibility that the reported pathological features of senescent or senescent-like cells in vivo might also manifest in cells that are not classically senescent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Proteomic landscape of replicative senescence WI-38 cells suggests large metabolic alterations</title><p>We next turned to our proteomics data generated from the same cultures and time points as above.

Indeed, metabolomic data collected from various types of senescence models has shown increased fatty acid oxidation, lipid accumulation, TCA up-regulation, and glycolytic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Zwerschke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ogrodnik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Flor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Unterluggauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Johmura et al., 2021</xref>).

Thus, NNMT effectively acts as a sink for two of the primary metabolites a cell requires for silencing chromatin and regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>). We found that MNA levels mirror those of NNMT; increasing early and robustly during replicative senescence progression consistent with high NNMT activity. Both SAM and is methyl-depleted counterpart, S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), were depleted with replicative senescence albeit to a lesser extent than the observed increase in MNA.

From the WT and hTERT ATAC-seq data from all time points, we identified 363,470 ATAC-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). We found a slight but significant (~5%, p=0.014,linear regression) linear PDL-dependent decrease in the fraction of reads in peaks during replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4">Figure 5—source data 4</xref>). We tested experimentally whether the increased heterochromatic accessibility was an artifact of increasing numbers of dead cells in later PDL samples by repeating the experiment using late (PDL 45) cells with a cross-linking agent (propidium monoazide-PMA) that renders DNA from dead cells inert as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hendrickson et al., 2018</xref>). No significant change in read distribution across chromatin states was observed with addition of PMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>We then divided the ATAC-seq peaks into each of the 25 discrete chromatin states and calculated the fold change in accessibility for each state and PDL compared to the first time point. We observed that changes in peak accessibility mirrors that for all reads. Again we observed a clear increase in accessibility with PDL across the miscellaneous category with a concomitant decrease in all other states in WT WI-38 cells and not in immortalized hTERTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>The undefined state from the miscellaneous category piqued our interest for two reasons, one being that it alone accounted for 20–40% of all ATAC-seq reads and a large 10% increase with senescence. The second point of interest was the observed early onset of change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). In looking to define the undefined state, we found that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dillinger et al., 2017</xref> previously reported that the undefined state is largely overlapping with both lamin-associated domains (LADs) and nucleolar-associated domains (NADs). In support of this observation, we too found that the undefined chromatin state is markedly gene poor and overwhelmingly overlapping with both empirically defined LADs and NADs (Z-score 90 and 150) that had previously reported in IMR-90 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata5">Figure 5—source data 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dillinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Sadaie et al., 2013</xref>). For reference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E</xref> provides a chromosome level view of the significant overlap between replicative senescence accessible ATAC-seq peaks in the undefined state with NADs and LADs compared to all peaks annotated in WI-38 cells.</p><p>To control for the fact that the chromatin state annotations we used were derived from a different, albeit closely related cell line, we performed the same analysis using gene annotations which are cell line independent. We found that peaks in intergenic regions increase in accessibility with PDL on average which is consistent with the undefined (and gene poor) chromatin state annotation from IMR-90 cells. These results suggest that the chromatin states defined in IMR-90 cells are capturing the chromatin states in WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>).</p><p>We tested and found that ATAC-seq peaks falling within NADs and LADs exhibit increased accessibility with replicative senescence (p &lt; 10 e-16 for both: Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Notably, this trend was much greater in magnitude for peaks in NADs versus peaks in LADs, with a median log2 fold change of 0.98 for NADs vs. 0.24 for LADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Digging deeper into NADs, we next asked the chromatin residing within NADs might respond differently than the rest of the genome to increasing PDL. We repeated the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> with two subsets; peaks excluded from NADs or peaks overlapping NADS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Dividing these two sets of peaks into the 25 chromatin states revealed that as expected, NAD excluded peaks mirror the pattern observed for significantly changing peaks across the whole genome in the original analysis. Conversely peaks overlapping NADs were found to increase in accessibility in a variety of chromatin states (e.g. poised promoters and many classes of enhancers) that exhibit reduced accessibility across the rest of the genome with increasing PDL.</p><p>One interpretation is that although the aggregate peak accessibility data appear to suggest that transcription is globally shutting down, the NAD specific view reveals rather that transcription is induced in a subset of loci. Although widespread, the reduced accessibility in euchromatin we observed in aggregate is not reflective of a pervasive shutdown of transcription across the entire genome. To formally test this hypothesis, we next asked if the shifts in NAD/LAD accessibility correlate with productive transcription and found that indeed, senescence induced genes significantly overlap NAD domains. Radiation and cell density induced genes exhibited weaker (cell density) or nonexistent (radiation) overlap with NADs and LADs. These data suggest that increasing accessibility in LADs and specifically NADs is a prominent feature of the replicative senescence epigenome that is directly connected to the senescent gene expression program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Together these results highlight a striking increase in accessibility within nucleolar associated DNA that connects changes in the transcription with a global shift in the epigenome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Transcriptional regulators of the replicative senescence transcriptome and epigenome</title><p>To parse out the regulatory logic of the senescence gene expression program, we leveraged our ATAC-seq data to gain insight into which transcription factors regulate replicative senescence accessibility via transcription factor motif analysis.

In addition, another YAP1 target, thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), is also upregulated at both the protein and transcript level with RS; THBS1 is known to act as an activator of TGF-β signaling, and specifically TGF-β2, through proteolytic cleavage of latent TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Ribeiro et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Inhibiting the YAP1/TEAD1 interaction in WI-38 cells suppresses expression of YAP1/TEAD1 targets and the replicative senescence gene signature</title><p>In all, the data reveal that replicative senescence WI-38 cells share multiple defining transcriptomic and proteomic features with myofibroblasts.

Importantly, very little changed across all modalities in the hTERT cell line consistent with the changes we highlight in nine as specific to replicative senescence.</p><p>The kinetics and precise timing of senescence onset have been obscured by low temporal resolution and ensemble measurements that cannot differentiate between global shifts in gene expression versus changing proportions of senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Passos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Victorelli and Passos, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Smith and Whitney, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Wiley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Nassrally et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Smith and Whitney, 1980</xref>). Here, with a combination of high time resolution and single-cell RNA-seq, we provide evidence that the early manifestation of the senescent gene expression reflects gradual changes on a per cell basis rather than changing cell proportions. In effect, individual cells ‘show their age’” with increasing PDL long before permanently exiting the cell cycle and transiting fully into the senescent state. The implications of this conclusion extend to organismal aging. For example, the percentage of senescent cells calculated from aging organisms varies greatly depending on the marker/phenotype used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ogrodnik, 2021</xref>). The reported disparities could be explained in part by the use of early versus end stage markers. Likewise, it is possible the reported increase in fibroblast heterogeneity and altered functionality with age is a direct result of cells slowly moving along a spectrum towards replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Mahmoudi et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, the gradual progression suggests that cells need not reach the endpoint to elicit a phenotype. For instance, proliferative fibroblasts isolated from IPF patients exhibited multiple senescent features and phenotypes in addition to accelerated senescence progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Yanai et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, this phenomenon is not constrained to fibroblasts as we observe that the salient regulatory features of replicative senescence extend to cell types as distant as astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>In our data, the pattern of gene expression annotated to EMT as a unique feature of replicative senescence that consistently presents early and robustly at both the RNA, protein, and single cell level. Given the fundamental nature of the EMT transition with respect to cellular function (development, fibrosis, and wound healing), it is not surprising that this hallmark tracks with multiple proteins and gene sets suggesting drastic metabolic rewiring. In our metabolic data, we highlight shifts in carbon and fatty acid utilization that have been reported previously as hallmark metabolic features of EMT. These metabolic changes demonstrate that our observations represent an authentic change in cellular state as opposed to a superficial uptick in a few EMT-related genes.</p><p>The data presented above across multiple data modalities to provide a clear connection between senescent cells and myofibroblasts supported by independent observations at the level of DNA, RNA, protein, transcription factor activity and metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In light of these, replicative senescence resembles a specialized subtype of EMT specific to the trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (FMT) in response to wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lombardi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gibb et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hinz and Lagares, 2020</xref>). We hypothesize that during fibrotic disease states and/or age, fibroblasts migrate to sites of micro-injuries. As these proliferating fibroblasts become replicatively aged, they are triggered (by DNA damage or other insults) to rewire their metabolism to induce FMT via active epigenetic reorganization (NNMT-SAM/NAD sink). It is important to note here that the in vitro DNA damage here arises primarily from telomere erosion documented by the observation that our hTERT control cultures do not exhibit the same changes. However, genotoxic stress in vivo may originate from a variety of endogenous and environmental sources e.g. reactive oxygen species, replication stress, chemical exposure etc.</p><p>Following increases in DNA accessiblity, expression of newly opened TEAD1/YAP1/SMAD target genes cement FMT transition by promoting fibrosis and a myofibroblast-like, ECM-secreting state. This model is supported by the synergy between TEAD1 motifs and NAD domains we report and reconciles conflicting reports that YAP1/TEAD1 inhibition can both prevent and promote senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kurppa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jia et al., 2018</xref>). Basically, the functional consequences of YAP1/TEAD1 inhibition will depend on the epigenetic organization of the cells used.</p><p>Further metabolic changes (hexoasmine/collagen synthesis and fatty acid oxidation) then support the new pro-fibrotic state. Finally, end point senescent cells reinforce the senescent state and contribute to neighboring cell progression towards senescence via secretion of inflammatory factors and SASP.</p><p>We think that this transition is distinct from classic FMT as the endpoint cells are not proliferative, but instead bear striking resemblance to lingering senescent myofibroblasts that can persist long after wound repair is complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hinz and Lagares, 2020</xref>). Rather than a privileged or unique state, perhaps replicative senescence is better categorized as a DNA damage mediated path to a potentially common stress-induced endpoint.</p><p>The complex interplay between metabolism and epigenetic regulation preclude easy determination of a causal factor in translating DNA damage into the replicative senescence/EMT program in WI-38 cells. Does EMT regulate metabolism or vice versa? Here we present compelling evidence on the side of metabolism. We observe both an early and sharp rise in NNMT expression and activity in addition to a global increase in heterochromatin accessibility. These results are consistent with NNMT’s reported role as global epigenetic regulator through its methylation sink activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Komatsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eckert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Pissios, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Ulanovskaya et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the observed shifts in repressed chromatin induced by NNMT are functional and may play a central role in fibroblast biology and stress response in multiple contexts. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eckert et al., 2019</xref> recently demonstrated that NNMT activity and the resulting heterochromatin reorganization initiate the expression program of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) associated with oncogenic stroma in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Eckert et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to senescent fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, the defining features of CAFs are increased cytokine production, metabolic rewiring, and ECM alteration and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sahai et al., 2020</xref>). Second, NNMT is one the most upregulated genes in a TGF-β-mediated in vitro FMT conversion in WI-38 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Walker et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the changes in silenced chromatin we observed during replicative senescence overlap with induction of gene expression driving the senescent phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In fact, pseudotime analysis argues that chromatin reorganization may precedes the FMT induction as evidenced by the loss of polycomb activity that appears prior to enrichment of the EMT and YAP1/TEAD1 transcription factors enrichments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>The path to replicative senescence process has many in vivo parallels with implications for aging and pathogenesis. After observing induction in WI-38 cells of IPF myofibroblast markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), we expanded our literature search and found a striking overlap (TGF-β signaling, YAP1 activity, and EMT) between our data and scRNA-seq expression profiles from alveolar epithelial cells collected from IPF patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). These studies also report a large induction of TGF-β2 relative to TGF-β1 which is consistent with our findings and highlights a clear connection between in vitro replicative senescence and an in vivo disease state.</p><p>Another example of such a connection arises from our LISA analysis: one of the top enriched transcription factors, TCF21, has been implicated in atherosclerotic disease progression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Wirka et al., 2019</xref> found that TCF21 promotes the transition of vascular smooth muscle cells into a novel fibroblast-like cell type they dub ‘fibromyocytes’ owing to their possession of both fibroblast and myocyte phenotypes in atherosclerotic lesions in both mice and humans.</p><p>In general, the FMT hypothesis provides a conceptual framework and integrative model for linking the multi-modal senescent phenotypes we observed to multiple human age-related diseases. Given the observation that fibrosis and senescence markers correlate with increasing age in multiple tissues, it is possible that FMT might be a widespread phenomenon underlying many age-related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Yousefzadeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Idda et al., 2020</xref>). Future work harnessing multi-modal single cell technology coupled with relevant in vivo models will aid greatly in determining the exact order of events and physiological import.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, 11885084) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, F0392) and maintained in an incubator set to 37° C, 5% CO2, and 20% O2. 0.3–0.5 E6 WI-38 cells were seeded and maintained on 10 cm collagen coated plates (Corning, 354450) and split when cells reached about 70% confluence. For WI-38 cells PDL 15 tp PDL 40, it took about 4 days to reach 70% confluence. WI-38s &gt; PDL 40 were slower growing, and therefore split every 5–7 days instead; media was replenished every 3–4 days (supplementary methods). Cells were passaged by washing the cell monolayer with PBS, followed by incubating cells with TrypLE Express (Gibco, 12604013) for 5 min. Media was added to neutralize the TrypLE and the cell suspension was collected into conical tubes. The cell suspension was spun at 200 x g for 5 min and the supernatant was aspirated.

The median protein concentration for each PDL and PDL.ctrl was calculated and divided by the median protein concentration across all samples for either cell line (WT and hTERT) to derive a protein concentration normalization factor. The raw metabolite values for each PDL and hTERT PDL.ctrl were multiplied by the protein concentration normalization factor for that strain and sample. Protein normalized metabolite values were then converted to log2 fold change values using the first time point as a reference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). To remove sample day batch effects, we took the protein normalized metabolite values and divide each WT metabolite value by the corresponding metabolite value in the temporally paired hTERT sample (e.g. PDL 25 values were divided by PDL 25.ctrl values) and converted to log2 fold change with first sample as reference.</p><p>Finally, the normalized log2 ratios were fit to a linear model to test for a linear trend across the time course.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lynne Cox (Reviewer #2); Payel Sen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers have raised various concerns about robustness of analyses and statistics for the multi-omics data. They recognize that significant amounts of these analyses will need to be redone and some additional analyses were recommended. However, they all agree that these revisions are essential. Please address these concerns as much as possible.</p><p>2) Reviewers #2 and #3 pointed out the necessity to provide some biological validations for novel findings from these multi-omics analyses. This will require additional experiments but will greatly improve this manuscript.</p><p>3) All three reviewers have identified the lack of description for certain methods and techniques, mislabeling, typographical errors, etc. Please address all these issues.</p><p>4) Reviewer #2 pointed out that the proteomics data should be made publicly available at one of the major proteomics data repositories. Reviewer #1 also pointed out that in-house software codes and scripts for data analyses should also be made publicly available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are major concerns about the statistics in the analysis of the dataset.</p><p>a. For the differential expression analysis (4.2.3), the authors state: &quot;DEGs were defined as having p-values &lt; 0.001.&quot; This is an incorrect method of filtering DEGs as it does not correct for multiple hypothesis testing. This is all the more surprising because DESeq2, used by the authors, natively provides FDR corrected p-values. The data should be re-analyzed after proper multiple hypothesis correction control (native DEseq2 FDR, Bonferroni, or other).</p><p>b. Potentially related to the absence of FDR thresholding, the number of DEGs identified-&quot;8969 genes change with increasing PDL … 11652 genes vary with increasing cell density&quot;-seemed, to this reviewer, really high, and likely the result of improper FDR correction. It will be interesting to see how those numbers change with the multiple testing correction.</p><p>c. Based on the methods, the other analyses should also always incorporate a multiple testing correction, i.e. differential ATACseq peaks (4.4.3 p &lt; 0.001, no FDR correction), metabolomics (4.5 no information on differential analysis) and proteomics (4.6.5 no information on differential analysis).</p><p>d. When carrying out differential analyses, the authors should always avoid filtering on fold change. They do this for instance in section 2.4 &quot;we focused on compounds exhibiting PDL-dependent changes in abundance &gt; log2 0.5.&quot;. Fold-change filtering leads to extremely poor FDR control and should not be used post hoc – the only acceptable method to integrate fold change filtering includes a new statistical framework which takes into account fold change for FDR calculations (see PMC2654802). All results should be presented with this criterion removed or re-calculated with a method that takes fold-change into account.</p><p>e. Based on figure legends (Figure 1F, 3A, etc) and methods (4.2.5), FDR correction for multiple testing was also not performed for GSEA results. Please recompute everything including the correction, and only report corrected p-values.</p><p>f. There are several key issues with the ATAC-seq analysis (4.4.2), which will require a ground-up reanalysis of the data. Quantile normalization of count data and subsequent use of limma for differential accessibility analysis of ATAC-seq (4.4.2, end) is potential problematic. Indeed, limma is not appropriate for count data (it should only be used for continuous data such as microarray) unless the authors mean that they used limma-voom, which is a different algorithm. Please correct this in the revised analyses. In cases where differential depth cannot be corrected for appropriately, the authors should instead use downsampling of mapped reads to match the lowest depth sample. This will remove sequencing depth biases and allow proper count based methods, such as DEseq2, to perform properly.</p><p>2. Additional methodological information is needed for long-term reproducibility of analyses.</p><p>a. For reproducibility of code and analyses, all analytical code for this study should be deposited in a repository such as github or made available as a Supplementary file.</p><p>b. Please include all version numbers for all used software (e.g. R, Trimmomatic, Salmon, LISA, etc.) packages and R packages (e.g. DESeq2, fgsea, etc.) command parameters where relevant (such as for Trimmomatic, if not available elsewhere). The same should be applied to annotation databases, and if a version number doesn't exist, date of access should be provided.</p><p>c. All reagents (e.g. DMEM) should include suppliers and catalogue numbers in order to remove any ambiguity as to which product was used.</p><p>d. Salmon is a pseudoaligning method that uses a transcriptome reference, not a genome. The methods say that the index was derived from hg38, but how and using which information and software is not clear. In general, the authors should make sure that all key analytical steps are explicitly documented in the methods for long term reproducibility of the study.</p><p>3. It is completely unclear which data/plots were generated using the Illumina mRNA kit and which were generated using the Total RNA Kit. Please specify in text and legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The -omics aspects of the paper are generally well conducted and provide either confirmatory data on pre-existing studies of senescence or add new data (especially on the key FMT pathway and transcription factors involved). Log2FC of +/- 0.5 is somewhat lower than usual cut-offs, so justification is needed where that is selected. No mention is made of quality control steps in RNAseq analysis, but I assume these were conducted? Use of in-house programs for proteomics analysis does mean that others will not be able to conduct the same analyses, though availability of datasets should allow for validation of findings on other data analysis platforms – have these been publicly deposited as links provided are only to RNAseq datasets? From the protocol provided, it is also not clear that the methodology for protein extraction would release chromatin-bound factors – inclusion of a potent nuclease e.g. Benzonase, would ensure that tightly bound proteins are not lost in the spin steps to remove 'cellular debris'.</p><p>Figure 2E: there appears to be an aberrant pattern for cells at PDL33 that is present in all parts – is 33 an outlier? What is this cluster?</p><p>The cell biology aspects are much less well described making it impossible for others to reproduce the work – in particular, cell seeding density is critical but not even mentioned for longitudinal culture, and Figure 1D images suggest significant cell crowding. Along the senescence trajectory, primary fibroblasts grown in monolayers increase in surface area (and to some extent in volume) and populations at later PDLs undergo contact inhibition at lower cell densities than those at earlier PDLs so it may be the case that some of the 'gradual' changes (especially those associated with cell cycle changes) reflect simply quiescence form contact inhibition rather than steps to senescence. Methodology to count cells and calculate PDL is needed as different labs may conduct this differently. Daily microscopy inspection of cultures to assess appropriate time points for subculturing is essential – simply choosing to split at 4 or 7 days according to PDL does not account for the morphological changes that occur across the replicative lifecourse. It would therefore be helpful to determine to what degree these findings are cell type specific and which changes represent general cell senescence, especially as multiple RNAseq datasets exist on lung and skin fibroblast senescence with various mode of senescence induction. The Methods mentions 'deep senescence' but it is not clear in the main text what datasets are derived from this. Images of cells at different points along the pathway to senescence would be reassuring, and orthogonal validation of senescence markers e.g. p16, p21 by qRT-PCR is needed. It would be extremely helpful if the RNA seq and protein changes reported were cross validated by conventional techniques.</p><p>Although studies are conducted on the influence of cell density on -omics changes over a short time course of 10 days, the effect of cell cycle exit in senescence would be better accounted for by comparing with genuinely quiescent cell populations e.g. serum starvation of the hTERT cells eg Figure 3A</p><p>Time points used for comparisons are poorly labelled – are hTERT samples taken at daily intervals or at the same time points in long term culture as the RS samples? The text states that the aim is to control for the effects of long-term cell culture, but this is not apparent from later figures. Figure 1D implies that cell population at the same PDL are used for RS and hTERT groups (were cells transduced at PDL20 to allow analysis at PDL25 allowing for drug selection steps?) yet later on time points are simply given numbers e.g. 1,7 in Figure 2B and 2,4,5,6,7 in Figure 3A. It is not even stated if these are days, weeks or sample numbers.</p><p>A comparison between early PDL WT WI38 with hTERT WI38 should be conducted (the authors have the relevant data sets) to ensure that the hTERT expression simply leads to cell immortality without impacting on gene expression patterns – this is critical since telomerase has roles other than at the telomere, including in gene expression control, RNA splicing and mitochondrial metabolism. hTERT transduction is very poorly described in the methods section so that others will not be able to reproduce the experiments: &quot;appropriate target plasmid and packaging constructs&quot; are completely uninformative, as is 'selected. with a selection drug&quot;. Specific details are needed.</p><p>Experiments on radiation damage to induce senescence assay relatively early time points – cell cycle exit is an early event in the DNA damage response but not indicative of senescence per se. True damage-induced senescence onset should be monitored at later time points post-damage (eg from 14 days) to avoid conflating the acute DDR with senescence-specific gene expression patterns. This could account for the large discrepancy between RS and RIS datasets here.</p><p>The oxidative phosphorylation data are interesting and consistent with known changes on senescence (though the effect on ROS generation should be considered more). However, the citation in this context of papers that refer to lipid peroxidation – a state of lipid damage – rather than physiological energy generation through β oxidation of fats. Please take care not to conflate energy generating β oxidation and damaging oxidation in the citations.</p><p>The NNMT data are fascinating and really provocative – did the authors consider including bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation state in conjunction with the ATAC-seq data? The finding of CTCF upregulation is also interesting in the context of the LAD/NAD data – would 3C/Hi-C give clearer data on overall chromatin configuration? (It would be intersting to see if TADs change significantly, which would be predicted from the data here).</p><p>The manuscript has not been fully proof-read which is somewhat frustrating for the reader e.g. the first few references don't even have volume or page numbers, there is incorrect use of upper/lower case in some places (e.g. amp instead of AMP) and there are various typos throughout. Methods section has gaps/omissions e.g. 4.4.3 refers to Figure ??B, 4.5.1 refers to &quot;(vendor?)&quot; and 4.7.2 refers to &quot;(Cite CIS-BP)&quot;. Tenses should be consistent.</p><p>Most worryingly, very little effort has been made to ensure the Supplementary figures are informative – figure legends are lacking, labels of figure parts are missing e.g. time points/PDLs on Figure S2, Figure S3; the interpretation that EMT (or rather FMT) is a feature of sesncence depends to some extent on the data in Figure S2 but these appear to show that there is no change of the progression from early proliferation to senescence (though hard to tell as PDLs not given)? statements such as &quot;S phase and G2M cells were isolated&quot; – this is wholly misleading as the cells were not isolated physically according to cell cycle stage (eg FACS), but the data were processed post-hoc to determine which cell cycle stage they most closely fit with according to gene expression patterns. Figure S8 legend states cells at PDL20, figure labels cells at PDL25; time points/cell ages are missing for Figure S9- and cannot state mitochondrial functions are already simply by looking at protein levels – safer to say that changes are consistent with altered mitochondrial metabolism. Again, PDL20 is referred to yet throughout the paper, the earliest PDL analysis is at 25. Figure S10 is uninterpretable as no X axis is given, and time points/PDLs are also missing in Figure S11B. Figure S12D – what do the boxes represent? The lack of labels and suitable legend make it impossible to interpret. Why analyse PDL 46 here, as cells are not yet senescent? Is the whole of chromosome 22 shown in part E? Please provide Mb scale – and state what platform was used to view (e.g. IGV?).Figure S14 – GO terms would be a better way of showing the processes than the word clouds used. Figure S15 lacks a legend – myofibroblast markers (from lit) – I presume from literature? Which are the fibrillar collagens (the collagen number matters).</p><p>When describing what samples the data shown are compared against, the terminology &quot;the first sample&quot; needs more information – is this PDL25 for RS? But this 'first sample' appears later in metabolomic analysis eg Figure 3E (hence fold changes will not be comparable with proteomics).</p><p>Overall this could be a really great paper, bringing together a range of potent -omics techniques to study replicative senescence at high resolution cross time. Most of the paper is well written and provides a clear and sensible discussion of the work carried out, the data and implications of the results. It is somewhat dense (which may be inevitable with multi-omics studies) and could benefit from more accessible explanation of some of the analyses performed (eg readers will be more familiar with tSNE than UMAP – a brief explanation would help here). However, the paper is let down in parts by sloppy presentation, lack of critical experimental detail (meaning the work cannot be reproduced by others), poor design (or one hopes simply poor description) of comparators, an apparent lack of understanding of the nuances of senescent cell behaviour in culture, and by lack of statical validation of the simpler experiments (no n values noted in some cases – e.g. Figure 1D, Figure 5A, C, Figure S3 etc etc). Confirmatory experiments to cross validate top hits from the -omics studies are also required. Mining the existing proteomics data for PTMs should also be possible and may add some value, though not essential here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are some technical points about ATAC-seq that need to be clarified. (a) global chromatin accessibility may be higher in senescent cells. Could the authors share the bioanalyzer profiles of the ATAC-seq libraries from the different timepoints? Are they similar? (b) senescent cells typically produce far more mitochondrial reads. Could the authors confirm that sufficient depth of sequencing was achieved in their ATAC-seq runs? These data including sequencing statistics, peak coordinates, fragment distribution graphs etc. should be included in the Supplementary Section.</p><p>2. The ATAC-seq data might benefit from a RepEnrich analysis to identify peaks in repeat elements that are known to be heterochromatinized in proliferating cells and derepressed in senescence. This, in my opinion, is a better way to look at constitutive heterochromatin desilencing compared to NAD/LAD overlap and is also independent of NAD/LAD calls in a different cell line (in this case IMR-90).</p><p>3. What are the authors thoughts about the decrease in chromatin accessibility at promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies in their ATAC-seq data (Figure 5B)? Does this imply a global shut down of transcription? Is it reflected in the transcriptomic analyses?</p><p>4. While the authors perform an in-depth analyses of transcription factors most likely to drive RS, they haven't really shown the direct binding of these factors to chromatin in RS (and not hTERT, RIS or CD cells) and/or the change in their expression in senescence. Additionally, no functional experiments are performed by knocking down or overexpressing TEAD1 and investigating its effect on senescence. If possible, it would be nice to include this data (i.e., a western blot, genomic binding of TEAD1 and some functional experiments).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70283.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All three reviewers have raised various concerns about robustness of analyses and statistics for the multi-omics data. They recognize that significant amounts of these analyses will need to be redone and some additional analyses were recommended. However, they all agree that these revisions are essential. Please address these concerns as much as possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have preformed a statistical reanalysis of the metabolic and proteomic data sets as per the reviewers requests. In addition we have revamped the ATAC-seq analysis using limma-voom, which is compatible with quantile normalized count data to make significance calls on our ATAC-seq peak data. Lastly, we have employed higher stringency thresholds for many of our other analyses including the differential calls on our bulk RNA-seq and GSEA analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers #2 and #3 pointed out the necessity to provide some biological validations for novel findings from these multi-omics analyses. This will require additional experiments but will greatly improve this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We embarked on this project to create a high resolution definition of replicative senescence across multiple modalities wherein the integration of data types would foment novel hypothesis that would not have likely been made looking at any one or two data types (e.g. NNMT→metabolism →chromatin). The effort in collecting, analyzing and integrating all the modalities presented was immense, and we argue that the manuscript stands as a complete piece of work in its own right.</p><p>That being said, we wholeheartedly agree that the functional verification of the central regulatory hypothesis would clearly illustrate the utility of this data set.</p><p>To that end we have tested the central regulatory hypothesis, that the YAP1/TEAD1 transcription factor activity regulates the EMT/FMT signature in old and senescent WI-38 cells that were isolated in our experiments. Using verteporfin, a molecule that blocks YAP1/TEAD1 activity, we found that inhibition of YAP1/TEAD1 activity robustly down-regulates the published YAP targets in addition to the EMT/FMT signature in older WI-38 cells (Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In addition, we have two new analyses based on insightful reviewer questions and observations. First, reviewer number 2 pointed out that the gradual effect of increasing PDL on the transcriptome could arise from earlier onset (prior to sampling) contact inhibition due to the larger size of older cells. To test this hypothesis we scored our single cell data with significant genes that change only during replicative senescence, or only during contact inhibition. We found that only the senescence score increases with PDL suggesting that cell density is not a major confounding factor in our analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Second, Reviewer 3 asked if the decrease in accessibility within euchromatin was indicative of a global shut down of transcription. Given that we did observe gene induction and increased accessibility in NADs, we asked if we subdivide the genome into NADs or NAD excluded regions if the chromatin state changes suggest a global shutdown. We found an increase in accessibility with replicative senescence in enhancer and alternate promoter states that reside with NADs (Figure 5—figure supplement 5) This result suggests transcription is not globally inhibited.</p><p>In all, these experiments, data, and analyses make the manuscript much stronger and much more compelling in the context of current work at the interface of wound healing, myofibroblast biology, and replicative senescence. We greatly appreciate the reviewers comments and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All three reviewers have identified the lack of description for certain methods and techniques, mislabeling, typographical errors, etc. Please address all these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for typos and oversights.

There are major concerns about the statistics in the analysis of the dataset.</p><p>a. For the differential expression analysis (4.2.3), the authors state: &quot;DEGs were defined as having p-values &lt; 0.001.&quot; This is an incorrect method of filtering DEGs as it does not correct for multiple hypothesis testing. This is all the more surprising because DESeq2, used by the authors, natively provides FDR corrected p-values. The data should be re-analyzed after proper multiple hypothesis correction control (native DEseq2 FDR, Bonferroni, or other).</p><p>b. Potentially related to the absence of FDR thresholding, the number of DEGs identified-&quot;8969 genes change with increasing PDL … 11652 genes vary with increasing cell density&quot;-seemed, to this reviewer, really high, and likely the result of improper FDR correction. It will be interesting to see how those numbers change with the multiple testing correction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have switched to using adjusted p-values generated by DESeq2. We have fixed this oversight in the text as well as methods. The number of significant genes is as follows: 6995 replicative senescence DEGs, 7065 radiation induced senescence DEGs, and 9958 cell density DEGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Based on the methods, the other analyses should also always incorporate a multiple testing correction, i.e. differential ATACseq peaks (4.4.3 p &lt; 0.001, no FDR correction), metabolomics (4.5 no information on differential analysis) and proteomics (4.6.5 no information on differential analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>As per Reviewer 1’s request (see below), we re-analyzed the data with limma-voom and used corrected p-values for differential analysis.</p><p>For the metabolites, we have applied a linear model across time for each metabolite in both the hTERT cells and WT WI-38 cells. We now have this analysis described in the methods and include a supplementary data file with the resulting p-values and the FDR adjusted p-values [Storey and Tibshirani, 2003]. We now call out significantly changing metabolites (q-value <italic>&lt;</italic> 0.05) with asterisks in relevant figures and supplementary figures.</p><p>Similarly to the metabolomics, we applied a linear model across time for each protein in both the hTERT cells and WT WI-38 cells. We have now described this analysis in the methods and include a supplementary data file with the resulting p-values and q-values. We also now mark significantly changing metabolites and proteins (adj. p value <italic>&lt;</italic> 0.01) with asterisks in relevant figures and supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. When carrying out differential analyses, the authors should always avoid filtering on fold change. They do this for instance in section 2.4 &quot;we focused on compounds exhibiting PDL-dependent changes in abundance &gt; log2 0.5.&quot;. Fold-change filtering leads to extremely poor FDR control and should not be used post hoc – the only acceptable method to integrate fold change filtering includes a new statistical framework which takes into account fold change for FDR calculations (see PMC2654802). All results should be presented with this criterion removed or re-calculated with a method that takes fold-change into account.</p><p>e. Based on figure legends (Figure 1F, 3A, etc) and methods (4.2.5), FDR correction for multiple testing was also not performed for GSEA results. Please recompute everything including the correction, and only report corrected p-values.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the described analysis and significance thresholds have been applied to the metabolomics and proteomics data. The p-values used in the GSEA analysis are Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjusted pvalues. We have made this clear in text, figure legends and methods. We apologize for the confusion. We thank the reviewer for their attention to detail, and we believe the analyses are now more robust and the conclusions stronger.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. There are several key issues with the ATAC-seq analysis (4.4.2), which will require a ground-up reanalysis of the data. Quantile normalization of count data and subsequent use of limma for differential accessibility analysis of ATAC-seq (4.4.2, end) is potential problematic. Indeed, limma is not appropriate for count data (it should only be used for continuous data such as microarray) unless the authors mean that they used limma-voom, which is a different algorithm. Please correct this in the revised analyses. In cases where differential depth cannot be corrected for appropriately, the authors should instead use downsampling of mapped reads to match the lowest depth sample. This will remove sequencing depth biases and allow proper count based methods, such as DEseq2, to perform properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reanalyzed the ATAC-seq data using limma-voom as opposed to limma. In addition, limma-voom, is compatible with quantile normalization as previously described by the voom devloper in Law et al., and others [Shi et al., 2015, Law et al., 2014]. The current analysis using the original limma significance calls on quantile normalized ATAC data have been replaced with the limma-voom significance calls on quantile normalized ATAC-seq data (manuscript Figure 6A and 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Along the senescence trajectory, primary fibroblasts grown in monolayers increase in surface area (and to some extent in volume) and populations at later PDLs undergo contact inhibition at lower cell densities than those at earlier PDLs so it may be the case that some of the 'gradual' changes (especially those associated with cell cycle changes) reflect simply quiescence form contact inhibition rather than steps to senescence. Methodology to count cells and calculate PDL is needed as different labs may conduct this differently. Daily microscopy inspection of cultures to assess appropriate time points for subculturing is essential – simply choosing to split at 4 or 7 days according to PDL does not account for the morphological changes that occur across the replicative lifecourse.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to detail. We have added more detailed descriptions to our methods section for cell culture including the equation we used to calculate PDL. We have also added a supplementary figure with representative cell density images at time of harvest. We have also added a supplementary methods document outlining the extensive testing we carried out prior to initiation of the time course and the reasoning behind the sampling windows chosen. In our preliminary experiments testing the effect of cell density on gene expression we found that cells reach contact inhibition quicker at younger PDLs as evidenced by inhibition of cell cycle genes and up-regulation of the hypoxia response (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p>The reviewer raises an insightful point with respect to increased cell size that we had not ruled out with respect to the gradual increase in the senescent gene expression program. Although great care was taken to control cell density this is entirely plausible. Accordingly, we have added the following text, analysis and updated supplementary figure. Below is new in manuscript:</p><p>“It has previously been reported and observed here (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) that cell size increases with PDL in primary cell lines [Ogrodnik et al., 2019]. We hypothesized that perhaps the higher PDL cells by nature of their larger size, might reach contact inhibition faster than early PDL cells. In this scenario, given the high correlation between the gene expression signatures of senescence and cell density, the increase in senescence signature could be an artifact of cell culture arising from changing morphology. To test this possibility, we scored our single cells again with modified signatures for senescence and cell density composed only of genes uniquely induced in either perturbation (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). We found that the specific senescent signature increases with PDL in WT WI-38 cells in contrast with the specific cell density signature which stays relatively flat providing additional evidence for a gradual increase in the senescent gene expression program that is independent from changes in cell density.”</p><p>The following text is the additional supplementary methods.</p><p>“0.1 Sampling proliferating WI-38 cells at different cell densities confounds assessment of cell cycle state and senescence</p><p>A limited pilot (performed prior to RS time course) experiment was conducted to determine optimal sampling conditions. Using gene expression as a readout for cellular state, we performed RNA-seq on PDL 20, PDL 29, and PDL 39 WI-38 cells. We plated an equal number of cells in triplicate for the three PDLs and cells were collected for RNA extraction after 4 days of growth. We looked for any significant changes in transcript levels between the three samples.”</p><p>We observed two notable trends. First, we found stronger expression of genes associated with cell cycle and mitosis in the older PDL 39 cells compared to PDL 20 and PDL 29 cells. This was unexpected based on previous observations of slower growth and less active mitosis in cells closer to senescence.(Hayflick 1965). Second, the cells at PDL 20 and PDL 29 expressed genes associated with hypoxic stress (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A).</p><p>These data, in tandem with the observation that older cells grow at a slower rate, suggest that the highly proliferative younger cells (PDL 20 and 29) grow to higher cell density faster and therefore encounter earlier in real time, the various normal mitosis-inhibiting stresses, e.g. hypoxia, contact inhibition, and starvation that trigger cell cycle exit (Dayan et al., 2009).</p><p>To understand the effects of growth rates and cell density on gene expression, we performed a cell density study (CD) wherein young PDL cells were sampled at increasing levels of cell density to measure the effects of cell density and proliferation on gene expression (Figure 1A). We observed that based on the seeding density we employed (to minimize the stress of sparse plating) the sampling window we had originally targeted (4 days after seeding) was located in a volatile region with respect to proliferation rate and hypoxic stress using Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and VegfA (VEGFA) expression as proxies for each respectively (Figure 1—figure supplement 5B).</p><p>Accordingly, we modified the sampling window by choosing a time interval (2.5-3 days) prior to the onset of VEGF-A induction and CCNB1 repression (Figure 1—figure supplement 5B). For older, slower growing cells in the plateauing region of the replicative senescence process (PDL <italic>&gt;</italic> 40) we shifted the sampling window to 3.5-4 days based on visual inspection and cell counts. Ultimately in the actual extended time course, we tracked cell density with a phase contrast EVOS microscope to ensure cellular confluence was similar across all time points during sampling (Figure 2—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would therefore be helpful to determine to what degree these findings are cell type specific and which changes represent general cell senescence, especially as multiple RNAseq datasets exist on lung and skin fibroblast senescence with various mode of senescence induction.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, we do compare our data set to a model compiled by Hernandez-Segura 2017 over multiple skin and lung fibroblast cell lines approaching replicative senescence and find high concordance (manuscript Figure 1D). Although we agree with the reviewer that it would be informative to expand this to a comprehensive analysis of all types of senescence induction, it is outside the scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Methods mentions 'deep senescence' but it is not clear in the main text what datasets are derived from this. Images of cells at different points along the pathway to senescence would be reassuring, and orthogonal validation of senescence markers e.g. p16, p21 by qRT-PCR is needed. It would be extremely helpful if the RNA seq and protein changes reported were cross validated by conventional techniques.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. The ’deep senescence’ time course consists of a second time course and three samples at 45, 52, 53 PDLs that were used for bulk RNA-seq. We have added a sample manifest that clearly shows what assays were performed on which samples and time courses (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We added the second deep senescence time course after De Cecco et al., reported transcriptomic differences between early and deep senescence to ensure we were not missing a crucial aspect of replicative senescence [De Cecco et al., 2019]. The PDL 45 cells served as a bridge sample for batch correction so that we could accurately compare the deep senescence time points to first time course. We have added clarifying language and updated manuscript Figure 1B.</p><p>Additionally, as mentioned we now have images of cells at harvest for original time course (Figure 2—figure supplement 5).</p><p>For orthogonal validation, we would point out that each different modality of ”omics” experiments validates the other orthogonally. For example, many of the genes that we highlight as induced at the transcriptomic level (e.g. NNMT or TGFB2) are also induced in our proteomics data, our single cell RNA-seq data, and have significant change in their promoter regions in our ATAC-seq data. The strength of this work in part rests with this intrinsic cross-validation across modalities. In addition, all of our experiments were performed with replicates and at adequate depth for NGS experiments.</p><p>In addition, a plethora of previous work has demonstrated that qPCR and RNA-seq data are highly correlated [Wu et al., 2014, Shi and He, 2014, Asmann et al., 2009, Griffith et al., 2010]. We argue that the orthogonal validation across multiple modalities is substantial validation and sufficient for the conclusions drawn. In addition we argue superior to qPCR in terms of satisfying orthogonal validation given that RNA-seq and qPCR are both based on reverse transcription and cDNA amplification.</p><p>We have collated the RNA-seq and proteomics data for p21, p16, and β-galactodsidase along side NNMT and TGFB2 to demonstrate the overlap between technologies (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). For p16 and p21 we have also included Western blots to confirm as the induction in the proteomics data exhibits high variance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although studies are conducted on the influence of cell density on -omics changes over a short time course of 10 days, the effect of cell cycle exit in senescence would be better accounted for by comparing with genuinely quiescent cell populations e.g. serum starvation of the hTERT cells eg Figure 3A</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to comparing replicative senescence to other senescence inductions, we agree with the reviewer that a full workup of comparing senescence to many types of cell cycle inhibition would further our understanding about the regulatory logic of cell cycle exit and what may or may not be specific to replicative senescence. However, our aim in using the confluence condition was to account for cell cycle inhibition driven by cell density as we reasoned it was the most likely source of variability in our experimental set up. A comprehensive comparison to multiple types of cell cycle exit, although an important data set, is outside the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Time points used for comparisons are poorly labelled – are hTERT samples taken at daily intervals or at the same time points in long term culture as the RS samples? The text states that the aim is to control for the effects of long-term cell culture, but this is not apparent from later figures. Figure 1D implies that cell population at the same PDL are used for RS and hTERT groups (were cells transduced at PDL20 to allow analysis at PDL25 allowing for drug selection steps?) yet later on time points are simply given numbers e.g. 1,7 in Figure 2B and 2,4,5,6,7 in Figure 3A. It is not even stated if these are days, weeks or sample numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing description. We have added clarifying text to emphasize that the hTERT timepoints are matched to WT PDL samples. We have also added a visual dotted line connection in manuscript Figure 1B to highlight that the samples are paired. The transduction to generate the WI-38 hTERT cells happened far in advance of the time course. We have updated the methods to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comparison between early PDL WT WI38 with hTERT WI38 should be conducted (the authors have the relevant data sets) to ensure that the hTERT expression simply leads to cell immortality without impacting on gene expression patterns – this is critical since telomerase has roles other than at the telomere, including in gene expression control, RNA splicing and mitochondrial metabolism. hTERT transduction is very poorly described in the methods section so that others will not be able to reproduce the experiments: &quot;appropriate target plasmid and packaging constructs&quot; are completely uninformative, as is 'selected. with a selection drug&quot;. Specific details are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The selection process in generating the hTERT line, has made meaningful comparison to address the specific effect of hTERT over-expression impossible. To test that, we would need an inducible hTERT system to follow cells after hTERT induction. In this study the hTERT cells were only a control for the long term culture effects and not to test the effects of hTERT expression.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be a worthwhile comparison if we had the appropriate experimental set up. We have clarified our methods concerning the generation of the WI-38 hTERT cells to make this clear. The transduction to make the hTERTs occurred far in advance of the time course.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiments on radiation damage to induce senescence assay relatively early time points – cell cycle exit is an early event in the DNA damage response but not indicative of senescence per se. True damage-induced senescence onset should be monitored at later time points post-damage (eg from 14 days) to avoid conflating the acute DDR with senescence-specific gene expression patterns. This could account for the large discrepancy between RS and RIS datasets here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have changed the language surrounding comparisons to the radiation induced senescence condition and have added clarifying context where relevant and in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The oxidative phosphorylation data are interesting and consistent with known changes on senescence (though the effect on ROS generation should be considered more).

The finding of CTCF upregulation is also interesting in the context of the LAD/NAD data – would 3C/Hi-C give clearer data on overall chromatin configuration? (It would be intersting to see if TADs change significantly, which would be predicted from the data here).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and find this result very exciting. We are in fact working on directly measuring DNA methylation chromatin conformation during replicative senescence but as part of a future publication related to the findings here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has not been fully proof-read which is somewhat frustrating for the reader e.g. the first few references don't even have volume or page numbers, there is incorrect use of upper/lower case in some places (e.g. amp instead of AMP) and there are various typos throughout. Methods section has gaps/omissions e.g. 4.4.3 refers to Figure ??B, 4.5.1 refers to &quot;(vendor?)&quot; and 4.7.2 refers to &quot;(Cite CIS-BP)&quot;. Tenses should be consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize and have gone through the manuscript to fix typos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most worryingly, very little effort has been made to ensure the Supplementary figures are informative – figure legends are lacking, labels of figure parts are missing e.g. time points/PDLs on Figure S2, Figure S3; the interpretation that EMT (or rather FMT) is a feature of sesncence depends to some extent on the data in Figure S2 but these appear to show that there is no change of the progression from early proliferation to senescence (though hard to tell as PDLs not given)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have remade many of the supplementary figures and main figures with more labels. The GSEA enrichment can be hard to interpret with respect to magnitude of change, i.e. even in the face of monotonic increase, the p-value of GSEA enrichment would not necessarily go up as the analysis is based on rank rather than magnitude. We thank the reviewer for calling this out as it is central to the EMT/FMT conclusions drawn. We have updated the figure to include the actual log2 fold changes of the genes driving the enrichment at each PDL to emphasize the progression from early proliferation to senescence (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>statements such as &quot;S phase and G2M cells were isolated&quot; – this is wholly misleading as the cells were not isolated physically according to cell cycle stage (eg FACS), but the data were processed post-hoc to determine which cell cycle stage they most closely fit with according to gene expression patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have fixed the language.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S8 legend states cells at PDL20, figure labels cells at PDL25; time points/cell ages are missing for Figure S9- and cannot state mitochondrial functions are already simply by looking at protein levels – safer to say that changes are consistent with altered mitochondrial metabolism. Again, PDL20 is referred to yet throughout the paper, the earliest PDL analysis is at 25.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a label key for the supplementary figure. Reference time points for log2 fold change heatmaps are not shown as values are at or near (when mean subtracted) zero. We have emphasized what is being compared (e.g. vs. PDL20 rather than first timepoint) and what is not being shown in figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S10 is uninterpretable as no X axis is given, and time points/PDLs are also missing in Figure S11B. Figure S12D – what do the boxes represent? The lack of labels and suitable legend make it impossible to interpret. Why analyse PDL 46 here, as cells are not yet senescent? Is the whole of chromosome 22 shown in part E? Please provide Mb scale – and state what platform was used to view (e.g. IGV?).Figure S14 – GO terms would be a better way of showing the processes than the word clouds used. Figure S15 lacks a legend – myofibroblast markers (from lit) – I presume from literature? Which are the fibrillar collagens (the collagen number matters).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added PDL and timepoint labels to all figures. The long arm of Chr22 is shown and that is reflected in figure now.</p><p>PDL 46 was used as the changes in epigenome we report begin prior to PDL 46. As the observed heterochromatic opening begins prior to senescence, there was not a requirement to use senescent cells. If these changes were driven by dead cells, then treatment of cells with PMA prior to ATAC-seq would have altered the results in PDL 46.</p><p>The ATAC-seq supplementary figure was rendered in R. We have the relevant packages listed and code is now accessible. The heatmap from the pseudotime clustering was made using 800 GO terms that cannot fit into figure. We have now included the data underlying the heatmap for readers who would like to see the GO terms that compose the word clouds.</p><p>We have removed Figure S15 in the revised manuscript- However Col5A2 was labeled in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When describing what samples the data shown are compared against, the terminology &quot;the first sample&quot; needs more information – is this PDL25 for RS? But this 'first sample' appears later in metabolomic analysis eg Figure 3E (hence fold changes will not be comparable with proteomics).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more explicit labels and included a sample manifest (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) to make it easier for readers to see what the time points are available for each modality. It is true that we do not have the exact same time course samples for all modalities e.g. metabolomics and proteomics.</p><p>However, we did not, and do not want readers to directly compare fold changes. Even if both metabolomics and proteomics had the exact same reference point, there is not an expectation that any of the modalities should scale similarly in magnitude or time. The aim of the figures is to show change over time from proliferating state to replicative senescence. It was extraordinarily hard to seed and sample the cells required for these experiments. When we lost the PDL20 sample for metabolomics and single cell RNA-seq, we opted not to throw out PDL20 for all other modalities as the change over time with respect to proliferation state was the key parameter and PDL25 and PDL20 are both very much in the proliferative state (manuscript Figure 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall this could be a really great paper, bringing together a range of potent -omics techniques to study replicative senescence at high resolution cross time. Most of the paper is well written and provides a clear and sensible discussion of the work carried out, the data and implications of the results. It is somewhat dense (which may be inevitable with multi-omics studies) and could benefit from more accessible explanation of some of the analyses performed (eg readers will be more familiar with tSNE than UMAP – a brief explanation would help here).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for praise and appreciate the criticisms which helped improve the manuscript overall. We have added a quick UMAP explanation in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the paper is let down in parts by sloppy presentation, lack of critical experimental detail (meaning the work cannot be reproduced by others), poor design (or one hopes simply poor description) of comparators, an apparent lack of understanding of the nuances of senescent cell behaviour in culture, and by lack of statical validation of the simpler experiments (no n values noted in some cases – e.g. Figure 1D, Figure 5A, C, Figure S3 etc etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Hopefully, the changes we have made will strengthen the paper. Specifically, we hope that the additional methods and supplementary text concerning cell culture and hTERT cell line generation convince the reviewer that we took great care in our design and cell culture. As mentioned, we specifically chose cell density as a control as cell density is most likely to be altered between sampling periods especially in cells changing in size and growth rate. For example, the cell density experiment combined with the single cell data bolsters our conclusion of ’gradual’ onset senescence and provides evidence beyond that our careful work with respect to sampling density was successful (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>We have added statistical validation of simpler experiments in manuscript Figure 1. manuscript Figure 5A was an exploratory analysis that was simply a starting point for manuscript Figure 5B, i.e. we would have proceeded with higher resolution analysis even if global percentage changes were not significant. The significance testing for the analysis in manuscript Figure 5C, originally just in text, has been added to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Confirmatory experiments to cross validate top hits from the -omics studies are also required. Mining the existing proteomics data for PTMs should also be possible and may add some value, though not essential here.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned, we argue that the different modalities serve as sufficient cross validation and that experiments to confirm changes that are robust across multiple disparate data types would not add to conclusions or invalidate them. For example, an inconsistency from a western blot of NNMT could signify that the purchased antibody has poor binding or specificity since we have available data to validate from the gene level (RNA-seq), protein level (proteomics), and readout of cellular metabolic state (metabolomics). A simple western blot or qPCR would not strengthen the conclusions further. However as mentioned above, we have included p21 and p16 due to variance in proteomics data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. There are some technical points about ATAC-seq that need to be clarified. (a) global chromatin accessibility may be higher in senescent cells. Could the authors share the bioanalyzer profiles of the ATAC-seq libraries from the different timepoints? Are they similar? (b) senescent cells typically produce far more mitochondrial reads. Could the authors confirm that sufficient depth of sequencing was achieved in their ATAC-seq runs? These data including sequencing statistics, peak coordinates, fragment distribution graphs etc. should be included in the Supplementary Section.</p></disp-quote><p>A) We have added a supplementary figure with representative bionalyzer traces (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and 2). ATACseq libraries from all PDLs sampled share the same fragment length distribution before and after sequencing. We employed a size selection cut-off to enrich for nucleosome free regions.</p><p>B) We have added a supplementary figure with mitochondrial percentages and transcription start site enrichment (Figure 9). We do not observe an increase in mitochondrial percentage (less than 2% across all samples) with increasing PDL. We attribute the low mitochondrial percentages to the use of the Corces et al., ”Omni-ATAC” protocol, which claims a 13-fold decrease in reads that map to mtDNA compared to the standard ATAC-seq protocol [Corces et al., 2017].</p><p>In addition, we have included a supplementary file with read depth, duplicate read percentages, mitochondrial read percentage, alignment statistics, and TSS score for each sample–all of which pass the ENCODE pipeline standards: https://www.encodeproject.org/atac-seq/.</p><p>Significant peak coordinates were included in original manuscript and in revised manuscript. They can also be found in GEO repository along with bedgraphs of alignment and coverage. We included representative fragment length distribution plots which mirror the size selected ATAC-libraries sequenced (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, final pool bioA trace).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The ATAC-seq data might benefit from a RepEnrich analysis to identify peaks in repeat elements that are known to be heterochromatinized in proliferating cells and derepressed in senescence. This, in my opinion, is a better way to look at constitutive heterochromatin desilencing compared to NAD/LAD overlap and is also independent of NAD/LAD calls in a different cell line (in this case IMR-90).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. However, for our analysis we specifically were interested in experimentally validated NAD and LAD domains which contain both gene bodies and heterochromatin as opposed to solely constitutive heterochromatin (see point 3 below). We argue that use of the IMR-90 labels is justified based on the observed decrease in transcription start site coverage in Figure 5—figure supplement 3. These analyses was carried out solely based on genomic gene annotation independent of cell type. That we observe the similar results when using chromatin state labels derived from IMR-90 cells (also fetal lung fibroblasts) independent of gene annotation (manuscript Figure 5A and 5B) suggests that the IMR90 derived labels are accurately reflecting WI-38 chromatin state.</p><p>We think that digging deeper into constitutive heterochromatin especially in light of our NNMT findings is an exciting avenue for further research and is part of ongoing follow up work, and we will look into RepEnrich analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. What are the authors thoughts about the decrease in chromatin accessibility at promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies in their ATAC-seq data (Figure 5B)? Does this imply a global shut down of transcription? Is it reflected in the transcriptomic analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question. We interpret the results as a winnowing down or specialization of function in senescent cells (e.g. permanent cell cycle exit, etc. ). Although the aggregate pattern is down, we do observe promoters that exhibit increased accessibility resulting in higher transcription of neighboring genes and increased protein levels e.g. NNMT and TGFB2. In fact, in response to this question, we carried out the same analysis used in the manuscript Figure 5B (changing peak accessibility by chromatin state label) and instead divided into peaks overlapping or excluded from NADs (Figure 5—figure supplement 5). We found that ATAC-seq peaks within NADs exhibit an altered chromatin state profile. For NAD exluded peaks, the results largely mirror the results for all peaks (increased accessibility in closed regions and vice versa). Conversely, multiple chromatin states in the enhancer and promoter categories, which decrease in accessibility with PDL in NADs excluded peaks, display increased accessibility with increasing PDL only in NAD overlapping peaks.</p><p>Given that we also observe overlap with replicative senescent gene expression from bulk RNA-seq data and NADs (manuscript Figure 5C), we interpret this result as consistent with the hypothesis that transcription is not entirely shutting down rather so much as changing where it is happening. Basically, although widespread, the reduced accessibility in euchromatin observed in aggregate, is not reflective of a pervasive shutdown of transcription across the entire genome.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question. We have added this result as a supplement to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While the authors perform an in-depth analyses of transcription factors most likely to drive RS, they haven't really shown the direct binding of these factors to chromatin in RS (and not hTERT, RIS or CD cells) and/or the change in their expression in senescence. Additionally, no functional experiments are performed by knocking down or overexpressing TEAD1 and investigating its effect on senescence. If possible, it would be nice to include this data (i.e., a western blot, genomic binding of TEAD1 and some functional experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>We embarked on this project to create a high resolution definition of replicative senescence across multiple modalities wherein the integration of data types would incite novel hypothesis that would not have likely been made looking at any one or two data types (e.g. NNMT →metabolism →chromatin). The effort in collecting, analyzing and integrating all the modalities presented was extensive, and we argue that the manuscript stands as a complete piece of work in its own right. However, we do agree that the functional verification of the central regulatory hypothesis would clearly illustrate the utility of this data set.</p><p>To that end, we have taken late passage PDL 40 WI-38 cells wherein increase in expression of the EMT signature was observed, (Figure 5B) and treated with verteporfin, a molecule that blocks YAP1/TEAD1 interaction as demonstrated by [Mascharak et al., 2021]. We preformed RNA-seq on these treated cells and found robust inhibition of known YAP targets, TGFB2, and the EMT signature that started this line of inquiry (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). These data are consistent with a regulatory role for YAP1/TEAD1 in establishing the EMT/FMT gene expression program in WI-38 cells approaching replicative senescence.</p><p>These data make the paper stronger and highlight the utility and relevance of the generated data sets.
