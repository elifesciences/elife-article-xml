the correct architecture. However, insights into organ architecture are currently hampered by an absence of standardized quantitative 3D analysis. We aimed to develop a robust technology to visualize, digitalize, and segment the architecture of two tubular systems in 3D: <italic>d</italic>o<italic>u</italic>ble resin <italic>c</italic>asting micro computed <italic>t</italic>omography (DUCT). As proof of principle, we applied DUCT to a mouse model for Alagille syndrome (<italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice), characterized by intrahepatic bile duct paucity, that can spontaneously generate a biliary system in adulthood. DUCT identified increased central biliary branching and peripheral bile duct tortuosity as two compensatory processes occurring in distinct regions of <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> liver, leading to full reconstitution of wild-type biliary volume and phenotypic recovery. DUCT is thus a powerful new technology for 3D analysis, which can reveal novel phenotypes and provide a standardized method of defining liver architecture in mouse models.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many essential parts of the body contain tubes: the liver for example, contains bile ducts and blood vessels. These tubes develop right next to each other, like entwined trees. To do their jobs, these ducts must communicate and collaborate, but they do not always grow properly. For example, babies with Alagille syndrome are born with few or no bile ducts, resulting in serious liver disease. Understanding the architecture of the tubes in their livers could explain why some children with this syndrome improve with time, but many others need a liver transplant.</p><p>Visualising biological tubes in three dimensions is challenging. One major roadblock is the difficulty in seeing several tubular structures at once. Traditional microscopic imaging of anatomy is in two dimensions, using slices of tissue. This approach shows the cross-sections of tubes, but not how the ducts connect and interact. An alternative is to use micro computed tomography scans, which use X-rays to examine structures in three dimensions. The challenge with this approach is that soft tissues, which tubes in the body are made of, do not show up well on X-ray. One way to solve this is to fill the ducts with X-ray absorbing resins, making a cast of the entire tree structure. The question is, can two closely connected tree structures be distinguished if they are cast at the same time?</p><p>To address this question, Hankeova, Salplachta et al. developed a technique called double resin casting micro computed tomography, or DUCT for short. The approach involved making casts of tube systems using two types of resin that show up differently under X-rays. The new technique was tested on a mouse model of Alagille syndrome. One resin was injected into the bile ducts, and another into the blood vessels. This allowed Hankeova, Salplachta et al. to reconstruction both trees digitally, revealing their length, volume, branching, and interactions. In healthy mice, the bile ducts were straight with uniform branches, but in mice with Alagille syndrome ducts were wiggly, and had extra branches in the centre of the liver.</p><p>This new imaging technique could improve the understanding of tube systems in animal models of diseases, both in the liver and in other organs with tubes, such as the lungs or the kidneys. Hankeova, Salplachta et al. also lay a foundation for a deeper understanding of bile duct recovery in Alagille syndrome. In the future, DUCT could help researchers to see how mouse bile ducts change in response to experimental therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alagille

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The correct three-dimensional (3D) architecture of lumenized structures in our bodies is essential for function and health. The cardiovascular system, lungs, kidneys, liver, and other organs depend on precisely patterned tubular networks. Several diseases are caused by, or result in, alterations in the 3D architecture of lumenized structures. Vascular architecture defects contribute to Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Klohs et al., 2014</xref>), opportunistic infections cause narrowing of bile ducts in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Angelis et al., 2009</xref>), and branching morphogenesis defects in the renal urinary system cause hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Short and Smyth, 2016</xref>). In some pathologies, several lumenized structures are affected at once. Visualizing multiple tubular systems in tandem in 3D, in animal disease models, is necessary to allow investigation of how these systems interact in vivo in development, homeostasis, and disease.</p><p>2D histological sections remain the standard practice for all types of tissues. Recent advances in tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) carbon ink injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaneko et al., 2015</xref>) and high-end microscopy begin to address the need for, and benefits of, whole organ analysis. Importantly, organ systems often interact with one another and almost always are connected to blood supply. In order to study tissue spatial organization in development, disease, and regeneration, a 3D analysis of multiple networks is indispensable. A lack of markers, suitable antibodies, tissue autofluorescence and/or organ size often preclude the possibility for whole organ analysis. Radiopaque resin casting is an alternative approach that enables micro computed tomography (µCT) scanning, digitalization with full rotation and the possibility for both qualitative and quantitative analyses compatible with multiple imaging softwares.</p><p>In this study, we focused on establishing a simple, robust, antibody-free and inexpensive method for whole organ visualization of lumenized structures. We built on previous work to image a single network using resin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masyuk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kline et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walter et al., 2012</xref>) and imaging with µCT. First, in order to visualize multiple structures, we tested different radiopaque substances to enhance the resin contrast, resulting in mixing of two MICROFIL resins with distinctive radiopacity. As proof of principle, we focused on studying the hepatic vascular and biliary systems of wild type and <italic>Jagged1</italic> Nodder (<italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2018</xref>) mice, which are challenging to image by other methods due to liver size and autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Renier et al., 2016</xref>). We devised <italic>d</italic>o<italic>u</italic>ble resin-casting micro <italic>c</italic>omputed <italic>t</italic>omography (DUCT) to inject, image and digitalize two systems in tandem in 3D to gain a deeper insight into the organ recovery process. The subsequent analysis is performed using a custom-written MATLAB pipeline (available and deposited in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JakubSalplachta/DUCT">https://github.com/JakubSalplachta/DUCT</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hankeova, 2021</xref> copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:afbad9c713d7371c41db68b434647c147709600c;origin=https://github.com/JakubSalplachta/DUCT;visit=swh:1:snp:078f3064f3631c5a2055016f6184b774fccacba4;anchor=swh:1:rev:6b0b0eb88bbaf9bfc4f8ee42cafa4c122866fbba/">swh:1:rev:6b0b0eb88bbaf9bfc4f8ee42cafa4c122866fbba</ext-link>) as well as with ImageJ.</p><p>Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a congenital disorder affecting multiple organs, including the hepatic and cardiovascular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Spinner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mašek and Andersson, 2017</xref>). The disease is usually caused by mutations in the Notch ligand <italic>JAGGED1</italic> (<italic>JAG1</italic>, OMIM: ALGS1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>]) or, less frequently, in the receptor <italic>NOTCH2</italic> (OMIM: ALGS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Spinner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McDaniell et al., 2006</xref>]), and is chiefly characterized by intrahepatic peripheral bile duct paucity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alagille et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Riely et al., 1979</xref>). Importantly, bile duct development is regulated by portal vein mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>), implying that the architectural relationship between liver cells and the vasculature affects opportunities for signaling cross-talk between these systems in liver. Some patients with ALGS spontaneously recover a biliary system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Riely et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fujisawa et al., 1994</xref>). Ductular reaction, aberrant biliary growth and/or trans-differentiation from hepatocytes can contribute to biliary recovery in ALGS and other cholestatic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schaub et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fabris et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported that liver vascular architecture is affected in ALGS (previously also known as arteriohepatic dysplasia or syndromic paucity of bile ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hadchouel et al., 1978</xref>]). It is thus clear that understanding and defining both biliary and vascular intrahepatic defects is essential for ALGS.</p><p>DUCT is a versatile, reliable tool allowing standardized architecture analysis and definition of multiple lumenized trees on a whole organ level, facilitating systems insights. We demonstrated the applicability of DUCT by revealing the distinct morphological features that allow the de novo generated <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> adult biliary system to achieve wild-type biliary volume: (1) an increase in the number of central low generation branches and (2) profound tortuosity in the liver periphery. We confirmed these 3D findings in 2D sections from <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice and patients with ALGS, demonstrating that the new phenotypes identified with DUCT in the mouse model are representative of patient pathology. Using DUCT we also discovered novel phenotypes such as bile duct bridging between two portal veins, which would be misinterpreted as bile duct proliferation in 2D histological sections. Hence, 2D histological sections are not sufficient to understand the structural abnormalities of tubular networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DUCT revealed that <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> adult mice generate a full-volume biliary system</title><p>In order to define and quantify the adaptive process resulting in a de novo generated biliary system in adult <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice, we investigated the spatial relationship of portal venous and biliary systems in normal and diseased liver in 3D.

Neither carbon ink injection nor iDISCO+ (due to poor labeling of vascular network) were suitable for dual 3D analysis of vascular and biliary networks. We therefore developed an alternative approach for 3D analysis: DUCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) followed by semi-automated segmentation generating 3D binary masks of these two systems.

One limitation, however, is that DUCT cannot visualize lumens smaller than 5 µm. Finally, to test whether DUCT can be applied to other organ systems, we visualized lung architecture by injecting the airways (via the trachea) and the vasculature (via the pulmonary artery) and 3D reconstructed the respiratory and vascular systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In lungs, as in liver, the two lumenized systems can be clearly distinguished using DUCT. In all the DUCT liver experiments in this manuscript, we applied DUCT to the right medial lobe, and used the other lobes for sample-matched quality control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work revealed that <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> bi-potential hepatoblasts did not differentiate into cholangiocytes during embryonic development. Newborn <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice were jaundiced and displayed intrahepatic bile duct paucity. However, by adulthood <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers exhibited mature bile ducts, but with abnormal apical polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2018</xref>). Using DUCT, we first investigated to what degree <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice can grow a biliary tree by postnatal day 15 (P15). We examined the biliary system in 7 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> P15 pups and discovered a rudimentary or absent biliary tree in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pups, while there was a fully developed biliary tree in <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The 3D reconstruction of both systems can be explored in separate channels or in tandem with rotation (interactive PDFs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). We noted high variability in biliary outgrowth between the right medial lobe (RML) and the left lateral lobe (LLL) in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers (illustration of liver lobes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). In the RML of five <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pups, the biliary tree covered &gt;5% of liver area, whereas in LLL only 1 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pup displayed &gt;5% biliary tree coverage, while four <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pups had no lumenized bile ducts. In <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> pups the biliary network covered on average 75% of the liver area in both RML and LLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B and C</xref>). The P15 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pups were cholestatic, and manifested increased levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased levels of albumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). Interestingly, two different groups were noted in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pups with regard to the total bilirubin levels, that is, 50% of the animals had highly increased and 50% had mildly increased total bilirubin (p=0.0079), while all <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice displayed bilirubin levels below detection limits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). We correlated the total bilirubin amount with the liver area covered by lumenized bile ducts and detected a strong negative correlation between these two factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, r = −0.8214). We further sectioned the resin injected P15 liver and stained for the early biliary marker SOX9 (SRY-Box transcription factor 9) (note remaining resin in some portal veins). In <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> central liver, lumenized bile ducts were clearly detected, whereas in all four <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> central livers no lumenized bile ducts were visible and the number of SOX9 positive cells varied between animals, poorly reflecting the total bilirubin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we aimed to characterize and quantify the biliary architecture of the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> de novo generated biliary system in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

While <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice demonstrated a stereotyped vascular and biliary architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12A, B and C</xref>), <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers exhibited greater architectural variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12D, E and F</xref>). To quantify the degree of de novo biliary formation, we extracted the volume (using the binary masks) and diameters of the portal venous and biliary systems (using the binary masks and skeletons). The total volume of the vascular and biliary trees was similar in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> and <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12H</xref>). There was a tendency toward a larger portal venous volume and smaller biliary volume in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice, resulting in a trend toward a reduced BD:PV (bile duct, portal vein) volume ratio in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12H</xref>, p=0.0594). Next, we investigated portal vein and bile duct diameters along the main branch.

However, there was high variability in venous and bile duct diameter in the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> hilar region. In <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> liver, the BD:PV diameter ratio was consistently 1:3 in hilar and intermediate regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This BD:PV diameter ratio was not preserved in the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>DUCT enabled 3D visualization of postnatal and adult biliary and vascular trees. The biliary network in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice appeared postnatally, but with high heterogeneity between liver lobes and animals. Moreover, the liver area with lumenized bile ducts correlated with total bilirubin levels and disease severity at P15. The adult segmented µCT data were analyzed for volume and inner diameter of two injected systems. Comparisons of the portal vein and bile duct diameters demonstrated a conserved portal vein – bile duct architectural relationship with a stereotype BD:PV 1:3 diameter ratio in <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> liver. The adult <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice displayed a heterogeneous phenotype that nevertheless resulted in full restoration of biliary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2018</xref>) via recovery of a wild-type biliary volume.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Alagille syndrome human and murine bile ducts end abruptly</title><p>The intrahepatic biliary tree forms by a tubulogenic process in which a heterogeneous, hierarchical fine mesh of connected cholangiocytes is refined to single larger conduits of bile ducts, resembling a branching tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ober and Lemaigre, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanimizu et al., 2016</xref>).

Whether postnatally de novo generated bile ducts arise adjacent to the portal vein, or whether they are less dependent on portal vein proximity has not yet been explored. We therefore analyzed the distance between the biliary and portal venous systems by calculating the surface distances using the MATLAB pipeline. Specifically, the surface distance was defined as the shortest length from biliary skeleton to the portal venous skeleton, minus radiuses of these systems at the defined points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> bile ducts maintained a uniform distance to adjacent portal veins throughout the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> top panel, asterisk, 3C, 3D 100% of BDs within 0.5 mm of a PV).

One means of enlarging length is by duct convolution. We therefore investigated the length and tortuosity of the biliary and portal vascular trees using the DUCT pipeline in combination with the MATLAB algorithm (whole system and main branch quantification) and ImageJ (R1, R2 and R3 analysis). 3D reconstruction of portal vein vasculature and the biliary network revealed straight <italic>Jag1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> bile ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> top panel), whereas <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> bile ducts were tortuous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> bottom panel), especially in the liver periphery.

Until now, 3D liver analysis has been restricted by a lack of adequate tools and high auto-fluorescence of the tissue. Carbon ink injection is robust, but imaging is 2D, precluding 3D analysis of the architecture. In contrast, immunostaining and clearing allows 3D analysis, but success is variable and highly dependent on tissue fixation, antibody quality, penetrance and tissue autofluorescence. Here, we further advanced organ resin casting, which was previously used to analyze one system at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masyuk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kline et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Walter et al., 2012</xref>). We developed a simple, robust and inexpensive method (DUCT) for simultaneous visualization and digitalization of two lumenized systems in mouse to analyze organ architecture. DUCT is completely independent of antibody staining, endogenous fluorescent proteins and is not sensitive to tissue fixation. Unlike whole mount immunohistochemistry techniques, DUCT provides information about the lumen, internal diameter, perfusion and connectivity of the injected tree. The most important limitation of DUCT is that it cannot visualize structures with a diameter under 5 μm, due to resin viscosity. We showed that resin casting, segmentation and 3D representation can be used as input for further investigation by visual qualitative assessment, and for in depth analysis by imaging softwares such as ImageJ or custom written MATLAB scripts. The pipeline for imaging and segmentation followed by detailed customized quantification of cellular and architectural mechanisms of two tubular networks could serve as a standard for whole organ analysis in animal models, and can be further adapted for a specific applications.</p><p>DUCT is based on radiopaque resin injection into multiple lumenized systems. First, identifying resins with sufficient contrast and low viscosity is crucial for scanning using computed tomography. Combining multiple resins with distinct contrasts can upscale the analysis to several networks simultaneously. In our study, it was imperative to use two fresh MICROFIL resins to obtain sufficiently distinct contrast to separate the two injected systems. Prolonged storage (~&gt;3 months) of the MICROFIL resin leads to resin precipitation and a significant decrease in the resin radiopacity (for details see materials and methods). Future efforts to identify or develop differentially radiopaque substances would further accelerate the analysis pipeline. Second, in order to achieve a successful injection, an appropriate resin injection site for each system must be identified, and a suitable amount of pressure must be applied while avoiding bubble formation. Third, resin segmentation of the scanned sample is straightforward in well-injected, well-contrasted samples, but in samples with bubbles or poor contrast segmentation requires time-consuming manual correction and careful tracing of the resin throughout the whole organ to ensure a coherent network. Minor resin leakage can be digitally excluded during the image segmentation, but artefacts such as air bubbles in resin, non-homogenous resin contrast (in our set up caused by mixing of blue and yellow MICROFIL) and resin leakage due to lumen rupture (probably caused by high pressure during injection) slow down the analyses substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, a well-chosen and well-injected resin are a prerequisite for efficient downstream analyses.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic of <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> biliary abnormalities in de novo generated bile ducts.</title><p>Left panel depicts a simplified wild type or healthy human spatial arrangement of portal veins and bile ducts in three liver regions (R1, R2 and R3).

In line with this, in the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> pups the total bilirubin levels correlated well with 3D postnatal bile duct growth, which was apparent from 3D resin-injected whole lobe analysis, but did not correlate with bile duct paucity in 2D sections of central liver.

We demonstrated here that DUCT is a powerful method for visualization and semi-automated quantitative analysis of two lumenized biological systems in vivo. DUCT could be applied to other tubular networks including blood vessels and bronchi in lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or blood vessels and urinary ducts in kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wei et al., 2006</xref>). DUCT has multiple advantages over ink injections and iDISCO+, as 3D imaging with µCT avoids the drawbacks of tissue autofluorescence or poor antibody penetration. By injecting two resins into a single animal, it is possible to study the relation between these biological systems, which has not been previously reported. While experts in the field are careful to discriminate hilar and peripheral regions of the liver, carefully tracing organ structures for hundreds of micrometers in tissue sections is not standard practice and is a demanding endeavor. DUCT would be a suitable readout for testing drug compounds in mouse models for liver cholestatic diseases. With DUCT, it is now possible to map and quantify architecture of two networks in mouse models, setting the stage for an in depth understanding of how systems interact in health, disease, and regenerative processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Cytokeratin 7 <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat # ab181598 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2783822">AB_2783822</ext-link></td><td valign="top">iDISCO+ (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Cytokeratin 7 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen/ThermoFisher <break/>Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat # MA5-11986, <break/>clone: OV-TL 12/30 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10989596">AB_10989596</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Cytokeratin 7 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Sigma - Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat # C6198 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_476856">AB_476856</ext-link></td><td valign="top">iDISCO+ (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Cytokeratin 19 <break/>(rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">DSHB</td><td valign="top">Cat # TROMA-III <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2133570">AB_2133570</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-human SOX9 <break/>(goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">RnD Systems</td><td valign="top">Cat # AF3075 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2194160">AB_2194160</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">MICROFIL</td><td valign="top">Flow Tech Inc</td><td valign="top">Cat # MV120, MV-122</td><td valign="top">DUCT</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">Mathworks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top">codes available: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JakubSalplachta/DUCT">https://github.com/JakubSalplachta/DUCT</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental mice</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in accordance with Stockholm’s Norra Djurförsöksetiska nämnd (Stockholm animal research ethics board, ethics approval numbers: N150/14, N61/16, N5253/19, N2987/20) regulations.

The next day the liver was fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution (FA) (Sigma-Aldrich cat. #F1635) diluted in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (Life Technologies cat. # 14190144). After 24 hr, liver was washed and kept in DPBS. Liver was separated into lobes. The left lateral lobe was placed in 50% methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. # 322415) for 4 hr and into 100% methanol ON. Further, the lobe was placed in benzyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #402834) and benzyl benzoate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #B6630) (BA:BB 1:2) solution until transparent.

A silk suture was wrapped loosely around the PA as close to the heart as possible. A small incision was made in the right ventricle with spring scissors. Tubing (PE50, BD bioscience, cat #427411) ~15 cm long (stretched at the tip) connected to (23G) needle was inserted into the PA through the incision in the right ventricle and tightened with the suture. A total of 1 ml of DPBS was injected into the lung via PA to remove all the remaining blood. Afterwards, to expand the collapsed lung, the trachea was exposed and cleaned from surrounding tissue. A silk suture was loosely wrapped around the trachea and a small incision was made into the trachea with spring scissors. Tubing (PE50) ~15 cm long connected to (23G) needle was inserted into the trachea and tightened with the suture. One ml of DPBS was injected into the lungs via trachea – this inflates the collapsed lungs. A 1 ml syringe filled with yellow MICROFIL was connected to the tubing inserted into the PA, and MICROFIL was injected into the PA vasculature until all the blood vessels were filled. Massaging the lung with a cotton swab while injecting helped to disperse the MICROFIL. After the vasculature was completely filled, the tubing was removed and the suture around the PA tightened to prevent MICROFIL leakage. For airways injection, a 1 ml syringe filled with green MICROFIL was connected to the tubing inserted into the trachea, and MICROFIL was injected into the trachea until the lung was entirely filled with MICROFIL. Massaging the lung with cotton swab while injecting again helped to disperse the MICROFIL. After the lung was completely filled, the tubing was removed and the suture around the trachea tightened to prevent MICROFIL leakage.</p><p>Lungs were dissected out and placed at 4°C ON to allow the MICROFIL to solidify.

The segmentation was based on differential contrast between the resin and the soft tissue. Two different resins were used to identify the individual tubular systems. The differential contrast for system identification was highly dependent on the freshness of the MICROFIL.</p><p>The resin segmentation was performed by global thresholding in VG Studio MAX 3.3 (Volume Graphics GmbH, Germany) software together with manual corrections where necessary. The threshold value was determined based on the histogram shape and visual evaluation of a selected cross-section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,A'</xref>). The resin cast, especially when using an old MICROFIL, could contain artefacts caused by poor contrast, insufficient filling or high injection pressure. These artefacts include air bubbles in resin, non-homogenous resin contrast (caused by mixing of blue and yellow MICROFIL) and resin leakage due to lumen rupture (probably caused by high pressure during injection), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Therefore, the thresholding step was supplemented with manual corrections to create smooth, continuous and solid canal masks. Furthermore, the cut-off for the smallest distal canal included in the mask is considered an area of at least four voxels.</p><p>Next, the individual tubular systems were identified in the segmented resin mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s12">Figure 1—figure supplement 12D and G</xref>). When fresh MICROFIL was used, it was possible to identify each system by global thresholding with threshold value determined based on histogram shape and visual evaluation of CT data. However, in case of the old MICROFIL (used for adult liver samples) the resin absorption properties were not distinguishable in CT data. In most regions, both tubular systems blended with each other in one continuous region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref> left panel). Manual segmentation was therefore necessary to ensure the correct identification of both systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref> right panel). The manual segmentation was performed by outlining the BD regions in every slice of the CT data.

This parameter was calculated using 3D Euclidean distances between the BD branching points and the nearest branching point from PV system. The data is represented as cumulative sum of percentage of BD branching point at a given distances between BD and PV branching points (from 0.015 mm to 3 mm).</p><p>For branch length analysis the structure of BD and PV trees were first reconstructed in 3D, using the Analyze Skeleton toolbox in ImageJ, which provided the three-dimensional coordinates of all branch points for both BD and PV, as well as the connectivity of the graph. Next, we computed for each branch the length along its path to the Euclidean distance between its extremities (branch points). To calculate the generation number of branches (both for the PV and BD structures), we manually defined the origin of the ducts and vessels as generation 1, and computed generation number as the number of generation branches separating a given branch from the origin. To distinguish side branching events, we calculated the angle between a branch and its ‘parent’ by computing the dot product p of both their unit vectors. A branch with p&gt;0.95 with its parent branch was considered to belong to the same generation. We then computed distributions of length for the BD and PV structures as a function of generation number. Each generation was assigned to a region R1, R2, or R3.</p><p>The branch distribution in each region was calculated as a summary of number of branches per generation in a given region. The sum of branch numbers of each region is displayed as a proportion of the total number of branches per sample.</p><p>The number of bi-furcations (i.e. one input and two outputs), tri-furcations (i.e. one input and three outputs) and quadri- and more-furcations (one input and more than three outputs), were assessed in Matlab based on binary mask skeleton nodes that were divided into endpoints and branching points. Branching points closer than 0.2 mm (this threshold value was derived based on visual assessment and knowledge of the system) were merged together and further represented by one node.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-6"><title>Gap analysis between bile duct and portal vein</title><p>To evaluate the gap between BD and PV the surface distances were calculated in Matlab for each BD skeleton point by detecting the nearest PV skeleton point and connecting the two points with a line and measuring the non-resin area on this line (zero area in the input binary masks). Surface distance was then calculated using 3D Euclidean distance between the detected non-resin voxel coordinates. The data is represented as cumulative sum of percentage of BD at a given distance from PV (from 0.015 mm to 1.5 mm). The maximum distance between BD and PV for each liver sample was depicted in a separate graph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-7"><title>Tortuosity measurements</title><p>To quantify length and tortuosity, total (curved) and theoretical (chord) lengths were measured in Matlab for the whole system length and for the corresponding main branch. The curved length was defined as a cumulative sum of 3D Euclidean distances between neighboring graph points (i.e. links forming points) multiplied by voxel size. The chord length was defined as cumulative sum of 3D Euclidean distances between neighboring nodes multiplied by voxel size. The chord length therefore reflects system length where any nodes are connected by links with the shortest possible length. To analyze the relationship between BD and PV a length of the BD was divided by a PV length (curved or chord). Tortuosity was calculated as curved length divided by chord length of the same system and distributed into regions based on the generation number as previously described. Tortuosity was assessed in %, as BD and PV are not straight lines the actual tortuosity measurements were subtracted by 100% (perfectly straight line).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-8"><title>Volume analysis</title><p>Total system volume was calculated in Matlab by multiplying a number of voxels representing PV or BD by volume of one voxel.

The radius was defined as the minimal distance from the skeleton to the segmented area boundary in the input binary mask (i.e. border between background and area of interest). This boundary was calculated using a two-step procedure. In the first step, the input map was eroded using a 3D spherical shaped structural element with one pixel radius. Subsequently, the eroded area was subtracted from the original binary mask. This resulted in a binary mask representing the boundary between the background and the area of interest. One radius value at a given skeleton point was then expressed as the minimum distance from that point to the mask boundary. This was calculated, using the minimal value search in the intersection of the boundary mask and the distance map from that point. The distance map from a given skeleton point was calculated as 3D Euclidean distance of the spatial coordinates. Subsequently the diameter value was calculated as the minimum distance to the boundary area multiplied by 2. To avoid any misrepresentation, the one final diameter value at a given point (every 1.5 mm of branch length) was calculated as a mean value of a diameter at that point and diameters at four neighboring points (two on each side). PV and BD diameters were divided into three areas: hilum, intermediate and periphery. Hilar region represents distance from 0 to 1.5 (sample #2401) or 0–3 mm (other samples), Intermediate region is from 3 to 6 mm (sample #2401) or 4.5 mm – 9 mm (other samples), Periphery is from 7.5 mm – 9 mm (sample #2401) or 10.5–13.5 mm (other samples).

clarify the pathogenesis and progression of Alagille syndrome in mouse models of that disease. The new data from Alagille syndrome patients and new studies that you performed in the mouse model at earlier stages of the disease provide compelling support for your initial conclusions. Further, the added work that you did to assess branching morphogenesis in the lung strengthens your initial contention that this new technical approach provides a broadly relevant tool for researchers in developmental biology and regenerative medicine.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DUCT reveals architectural mechanisms contributing to bile duct recovery in a mouse model for Alagille syndrome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Anna Mae Diehl as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that you will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>We are excited by the novel technique that you developed which enables coincident visualization of ductular structures and their accompanying vasculature. The utility of the approach is well-demonstrated by your studies in a mouse model of Allagille's syndrome. The high quality of your data in that system support your claim that the technology could be extended to examine vasculogenesis and tubulogenesis in other organs and other diseases. This would represent an important technical advance and you have provided readers sufficient methodological detail to enable this.</p><p>Your current manuscript does have some limitations, however:</p><p>(1) Direct evidence for the generalizability of your success in the liver disease model is not presented in the current manuscript. Thus, including new data from at least one other organ/disease would strengthen your argument that the new technology is broadly applicable. The editors acknowledge that initiating new experiments to address this concern would significantly delay publication and so, are not insisting such studies be done prior to publication. However, the text should be edited to acknowledge the need for further research to confirm the utility of the new technology in other organs/diseases.</p><p>2) Based on your findings in adult mice, you draw conclusions about the pathogenesis of Allagille's syndrome that somewhat contradict current paradigms for that disease. Reviewer 2 has detailed new experiments that are necessary to validate your interpretation. Evaluation of additional human liver biopsy material would seem to be feasible in the short term. If the additional mouse studies cannot be accomplished in a sufficiently timely fashion, the current manuscript should be revised to acknowledge the limitations of the existing data set and need for further research to clarify disease pathogenesis.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>As noted above:</p><p>1) Text should be edited to address both of the aforementioned concerns.</p><p>2) Liver histology and clinical data from additional Allagille's syndrome patients with less severe/earlier stage disease should be incorporated.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) Additional experiments in the mouse model to evaluate ductal/vascular pathology at earlier stages of disease.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work is exciting because:</p><p>1) It provides a technological advance that is broadly applicable to studying effective and dysregulated tubulogenesis in multiple organs and preclinical models of various diseases.</p><p>2) The technology is novel because it permits simultaneous mapping of vascular and ductal morphogenesis – processes that are known to be linked but which have been challenging to examine coincidentally.</p><p>3) The new technique is clearly described and the authors provide appropriate caveats about is limitations, as well as its advantages, relative to current approaches that are being used to evaluate branching morphogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Hankeova and colleagues describe a new technology named DUCT, which they have developed for 3D visualization and quantification of the architectural parameters of two tubular systems in a given organ simultaneously. The authors chose the biliary and portal vein trees in the mouse liver as their model for the development and assessment of DUCT. Comparison of DUCT with two other techniques used for the visualization of tubular structures (ink injection and iDISCO+) indicated a number of advantages for DUCT, although, as the authors acknowledge, using resins limits the diameter of smallest detectable tubes to 5 μm. They then used DUCT to investigate the patterns of biliary tree regeneration and the potential processes involved in the age-dependent improvement of the liver phenotypes in a mouse model of Alagille syndrome (ALGS). This model<italic>, Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> strain, was previously shown (by the authors) to have a rather severe cholestatic phenotype in the early postnatal period but a significant improvement of the phenotypes in adult animals, in agreement with other mouse models of this disease. The DUCT analysis showed a number of novel and somewhat unexpected features in the biliary tree of the adult <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers, suggesting potential mechanisms involved in the improvement of the liver phenotypes in some ALGS patients. In support of these observations, the authors observed similar features in the biliary system of several ALGS patients based on liver staining and 2D imaging.</p><p>Development of DUCT and the related data analysis pipeline reported in the current manuscript can be considered an important technological advance in the analysis of biliary development and regeneration and the relation between biliary and portal venous structures. The study has also provided potentially important insights into the mechanisms through which ALGS livers compensate for poor initial bile duct maturation. In addition, the DUCT technique has applications beyond liver development, namely the analysis of other organs with tubular structures, like vascular system, bronchi in the lung and urinary ducts in the kidney. Moreover, the authors provide a balanced Discussion by acknowledging that DUCT has a number of shortcomings that need to be addressed in future work (the above-mentioned 5 μm limit, the semi-automatic nature of the analysis, as opposed to a fully automated analysis, etc.).</p><p>A couple of major concerns need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Lack of analysis of an earlier time point in the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mouse:</p><p>The authors mention throughout the manuscript that their analysis of adult mouse livers show the outcome of the biliary system regeneration in these mice. However, they do not mention whether they have analyzed the livers of younger <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice before their phenotypic improvement. To use the parameters measured in adults as an indication for biliary tree regeneration, one will need to know how the biliary tree looked like at an earlier time point. Given the abnormal serum chemistry and liver histology in younger <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice (the authors' previous work), these animals will undoubtedly have biliary tree abnormalities at a young age. However, the specifics of those abnormalities are not known. Therefore, whether a given feature of the adult, &quot;regenerated&quot; tree is truly a compensatory phenomenon occurring during the improvement phase or whether it's part of the original biliary tree abnormality in these mice is not clear. The best and most conclusive way to address this issue would be to analyze 3-4 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> animals at a young age, when there is still significant cholestasis. Such analysis will also determine whether there are intermediary structural steps that occur during regeneration. It will also determine how DUCT performs in livers with bile duct paucity.</p><p>It is possible that the resin casting would not work well in younger animals due to smaller liver size and biliary/portal system diameter. If because of this issue or due to COVID-related restrictions the authors are not able to address this point by performing the suggested experiment, they should clarify throughout the manuscript that these features are called regenerative in the manuscript based on the assumption that they do not exist in the younger <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice, and that without performing DUCT on livers from young animals, one cannot know for sure which one of the observed biliary tree features are responsible for the functional recovery in these animals.</p><p>2) Patient sample selection and analysis</p><p>Based on the description in the Materials and methods section, the patient samples seem to all come from severe cases (liver transplant). These are presumably patients whose biliary system was not able to (sufficiently) regenerate to avoid transplantation. Therefore, one can argue that they are not equivalent to the Ndr mice (which show phenotypic recovery). This needs to be highlighted in the Results section. To test whether the Ndr findings correspond to the recovery in human patients, one would ideally need to analyze ALGS liver biopsies from older (&gt;5 year old) patients who did not need a transplant despite significant cholestasis early in life. However, those patients are not likely to undergo a liver biopsy once they show phenotypic recovery. Therefore, the next best thing might be to analyze liver biopsies from younger patients that based on their medical chart have gone on to show improvement later in life. Regardless of how the authors decide to address this issue, they should try to obtain and report additional information about the patients (like total and direct bilirubin) so that the readers can assess the severity of their cholestasis at the time of tissue harvest.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors describe an improvement of an existing resin casting technique which enables to visualize and quantify the 3D morphology of two distinct tubular (lumenized) structures in a single organ. The new method is applied to the characterization of portal veins and bile ducts in normal mouse livers and in livers affected with Alagille syndrome. The authors beautifully illustrate the morphology and spatial relationship between veins and ducts in normal and diseased livers. The quality of the 3D images is outstanding, the conclusions are well supported by the data, the text is very clearly written.</p><p>1) The authors' main goal is to describe a widely applicable method for investigating tubular structures.

Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms are not investigated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60916.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] (1) Direct evidence for the generalizability of your success in the liver disease model is not presented in the current manuscript.

To validate our interpretation, we analysed biopsies from 6 additional patients with mild Alagille syndrome that never went through liver transplantation, the overview of all patient samples is summarized in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Importantly, one of these patients had been biopsied on three occasions from the neonatal period, via a regenerating period, to a post-regenerated stage with de novo generated bile ducts. We identified, in these liver biopsies from patients with mild Alagille syndrome, the same regenerative features as in <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> adult mice. These results are presented in new Figure 2C, Figure 3F, Figure 4E and Figure 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) Additional experiments in the mouse model to evaluate ductal/vascular pathology at earlier stages of disease.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we applied DUCT to analyse P15 liver, a stage at which the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> animals display mild jaundice and are cholestatic (new Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 5D). DUCT revealed severe bile duct paucity in most of the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> lobes, but we detected a rudimentary biliary system in 6 out of 7 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers imaged (Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 5B, C, E). Based on our previous data (Andersson et al., 2018) and current results we propose that the adult <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> biliary system is not established during embryogenesis and early postnatal stages, but forms postnatally between P-15 and adulthood, in a subset of animals. Due to the phenotype observed at P15 we decided to use the term “de novo generated” bile ducts for the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> bile ducts throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] A couple of major concerns need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Lack of analysis of an earlier time point in the Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup> mouse:</p><p>The authors mention throughout the manuscript that their analysis of adult mouse livers show the outcome of the biliary system regeneration in these mice.

Initially we had not performed DUCT on the younger animals due to major surgical challenges of performing the procedure in young mice, and due to the frailty of the <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice in both the vascular and biliary systems. Nevertheless, we agree that DUCT would be important to apply to younger mice, and therefore applied DUCT to 10 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> animals at P15. The resin was possible to inject in 7 out of 10 <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice included in the experiment. The common bile duct was too narrow in the 3 uninjected <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice and could not accommodate the stretched PE10 tubing used for injections. The new data on P15 injected mice is presented in new Figure 1C, D, E and new Figure 1—figure supplement 5. DUCT showed a very rudimentary biliary system in P15 livers, and quantification of cleared resin-injected mice showed that while wild type mice have ca 75% coverage of the liver by a biliary system at this stage, <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> mice display 0-40% coverage. Interestingly, the coverage is inversely correlated with total bilirubin levels, supporting our later suggestion that 3D analysis of the biliary system may correlate better with bilirubin levels than 2D analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Patient sample selection and analysis</p><p>Based on the description in the Materials and methods section, the patient samples seem to all come from severe cases (liver transplant).

To address this question, we have analysed 8 liver biopsies from 6 patients with mild Alagille syndrome (see comment 2). Further, we have provided a table (Table 1) that shows the results from liver functional tests from all the patients included in the study and specified which sample type was used (biopsy vs. explant). We changed the labelling throughout the manuscript to distinguish patients that had liver recovery as M-ALGS (mild) and patients who went through liver transplantation are labelled as S-ALGS (severe). As mentioned above, one of the mild patients was biopsied as a neonate, during regeneration, and after regeneration. The mild/regenerated patients also show the phenotypes we identified with DUCT and in sections from <italic>Jag1<sup>Ndr/Ndr</sup></italic> livers. These new data are presented in new Figure 2C, Figure 3F, Figure 4E and Figure 6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors describe an improvement of an existing resin casting technique which enables to visualize and quantify the 3D morphology of two distinct tubular (lumenized) structures in a single organ.
