Such task-related responses (TRRs) covary with reward magnitude and physiological signatures of arousal. It is unknown, however, if TRRs change on a trial-to-trial basis according to behavioral performance and task difficulty. If so, this would suggest that TRRs reflect arousal on a trial-to-trial timescale and covary with critical task and behavioral variables. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging blood-oxygen-level-dependent (fMRI-BOLD) responses in the early visual cortex of human observers performing an orientation discrimination task consisting of separate easy and hard runs of trials. Stimuli were presented in a small portion of one hemifield, but the fMRI response was measured in the ipsilateral hemisphere, far from the stimulus representation and focus of spatial attention. TRRs scaled in amplitude with task difficulty, behavioral accuracy, reaction time, and lapses across trials. These modulations were not explained by the influence of respiration, cardiac activity, or head movement on the fMRI signal. Similar modulations with task difficulty and behavior were observed in pupil size. These results suggest that TRRs reflect arousal and behavior on the timescale of individual trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>task-related response</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>hemodynamics</kwd><kwd>visual cortex</kwd><kwd>global signal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EY025330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heeger</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA MH002966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merriam</surname><given-names>Elisha P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-EY007136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingham</surname><given-names>Charlie S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014037</institution-id><institution>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burlingham</surname><given-names>Charlie S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The fMRI-BOLD signal in human early visual cortex reflects alertness and behavioral performance on the timescale of individual trials.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Widespread hemodynamic responses, time-locked to trial onsets, occur in the absence of a visual stimulus in early visual cortex, the earliest site of visual cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>). These ‘task-related’ responses (TRRs) have been reported in awake macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>) using intrinsic signal optical imaging, and in humans using BOLD-fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ress et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jack et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike stimulus-evoked responses in V1, they are poorly predicted by changes in mean firing rates or local field potential (LFP) amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>), and unlike spatial attentional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tootell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gandhi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herrmann et al., 2010</xref>), they are spatially diffuse, extending far beyond the focus of spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). Previous studies demonstrate that TRRs are modulated in amplitude by reward and correlate with heart rate and pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that they reflect arousal. These findings raise the question of whether TRRs in early visual cortex change from trial to trial according to task difficulty and behavioral performance, variables linked to arousal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we measured TRRs in human early visual cortex while observers performed a visual orientation discrimination task varying in difficulty, building on the task protocol introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref> averaged fMRI responses over many trials and observed a positive relationship between reward magnitude and trial-averaged TRR amplitude. Here, we instead used a general linear mixed model (GLMM) to probe the relation between behavioral performance and response amplitude on the timescale of individual trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We found that TRRs in early visual cortex scaled in amplitude with task difficulty, accuracy, reaction time (RT), and lapses, with decreasing strength ascending the visual cortical hierarchy. We found similar modulations in pupil size and cardiac activity. Importantly, task- and behavior-dependent modulations of the TRR were not explained by the artifactual influence of respiration and cardiac activity on cerebral blood oxygenation, which suggests that TRRs are linked directly to arousal. Our results demonstrate the existence of a widespread hemodynamic response in early visual cortex that reflects arousal on the timescale of individual trials. One intriguing possibility raised by our findings is that this arousal-linked response may alter encoding and/or decoding of visual information, thereby having a causal influence on behavior. For example, this might occur by modulating the cortical circuit computation to shift the balance in inference between prior and likelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heeger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Gee et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Task protocol and hypothesis</title><p>Human observers (<italic>N</italic> = 13) performed a visual orientation discrimination task consisting of separate easy and hard runs of trials while undergoing fMRI scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each trial was 15 s, composed of a 0.2 s stimulus presentation and 14.8 s interstimulus interval. On runs of easy trials, the tilt of the stimulus (grating; diameter, 1.5°) was fixed at ±20° from vertical, yielding discrimination accuracy of ~90%. On runs of hard trials, the tilt was set adaptively with a staircase that yielded ~75% accuracy, typically converging to a tilt of ±1–4° from vertical. The fixation cross was a different color for easy and hard runs (green or red) to ensure that observers were aware of the difficulty of the task. The stimulus was always presented in the same location in the lower right hemifield such that stimulus-evoked responses and spatial attention responses were confined to a small region of the contralateral hemisphere. fMRI responses were measured in the right hemisphere, ipsilateral to the stimulus. These responses in the ipsilateral hemisphere were termed ‘task-related’ because they were neither stimulus evoked nor related to spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). TRRs were estimated by averaging over all voxels on the cortical surface in ipsilateral V1. We first used linear regression to project out the global signal from each voxel in V1, a procedure that has been shown to be the most effective in reducing the influence of physiological variables on the fMRI signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Power et al., 2018</xref>). To account for any possible residual physiological artifacts, we additionally predicted cardiac- and respiration-evoked hemodynamic activity (from cardiac and respiration signals measured during scanning) and projected these out of the fMRI data as well, a standard approach in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2009</xref>). We used a GLMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) to assess the hypothesis that TRRs scale in amplitude with task difficulty and behavioral performance, while controlling for inter-observer differences in the fMRI signal.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task, orientation discrimination around vertical.</title><p>Trial structure, 200 ms stimulus presentation, followed by a 14.8 s interstimulus interval (ISI), during which the observer made a button press response and immediately received tone feedback.

We restricted the analysis to responses in ipsilateral V1, which corresponded to the hemifield in which no stimulus was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These responses were entrained to trial timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), i.e., the maximum amplitude component of the frequency response in ipsilateral V1 was 1/15 Hz, matching the frequency of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Observers were instructed to covertly attend the peripheral stimulus, which was offset 5° from the central fixation cross. Thus, based on numerous prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tootell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gandhi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herrmann et al., 2010</xref>), it was assumed that the attention field was restricted to a small region in the contralateral hemisphere surrounding the location of the stimulus.

Task-related responses in V1 were higher in amplitude on hard than easy trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To quantify this effect, we ran a GLMM which included the following predictors: the convolution of each observer’s hemodynamic response function with impulses time-locked to (1) trial onset (which coincided with the stimulus presentation), (2) button press, and (3) a time-on-task boxcar in-between trial onset and button press; (4) task difficulty (easy or hard); (5) behavioral accuracy; (6) a prediction for the influence of cardiac activity (7) and respiration (8) on the fMRI signal following refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2009</xref>); (9) the translational and rotational movement of the head, consisting of six parameters (see Materials and methods).

It was essential to include in the model both difficulty and accuracy, as well as their interactions with each other and with the three fMRI predictors to isolate the effect of task difficulty from behavioral performance, which is also linked to arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>).

For correct trials, regardless of task difficulty, TRRs were higher in amplitude when the RT was fast (i.e. where ‘fast’ means above the median of the RT distribution for that specific trial type, e.g., easy/correct or hard/correct; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that there are three inputs to the TRR: (1) a delta function at the trial onset time, (2) a delta function at the button press time, and (3) a boxcar extending between the trial onset and button press times (i.e. representing time on task; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We hypothesized that amplitude modulation of the TRR with RT (on individual trials) was determined by the sum of these three hypothesized inputs. If this hypothesis is correct, the model and data should exhibit a similar pattern of amplitude modulation with RT on average across trials and participants. To test this, we performed a simulation in which we (1) predicted fMRI activity in response to the trial onset, button press, and time-on-task inputs using the RTs measured in the task, (2) averaged the simulated responses over all high and low RT trials (median split) and participants, crossed by difficulty and accuracy, and (3) compared the pattern of amplitudes between data and simulation. The predicted fMRI activity was computed by convolving a canonical HRF separately with each of the three inputs. We found that some aspects of the data were captured best by the time-on-task input (‘fMRI_ToT’) and other aspects were captured better by the linear sum of the trial onset and button press inputs (‘fMRI_TO + fMRI_BP’), and overall the data lay somewhere in between these two extremes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We separated fMRI_ToT and fMRI_TO + fMRI_BP in the figure because we expected RT to have opposing effects on the amplitude of each. That is, for fMRI_TOT, a slower RT would result in a longer boxcar, which in turn would lead to a higher amplitude output. Conversely, for fMRI_TO + fMRI_BP, a slower RT would result in a larger separation between the trial onset and button press impulses, which would lead to a lower amplitude output (see Discussion for further comments). Specifically, the fMRI_TO + fMRI_BP simulation captured the pattern of amplitude modulation with RT on correct trials as well as the overall amplitude modulation with accuracy, and the fMRI_ToT simulation better captured RT-dependent amplitude modulation seen on incorrect trials. This validates our use of a model with a sum of the three inputs, which can interpolate between these two extremes in a flexible way. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that amplitude modulation of the TRR with RT may arise from linear summation of three task/behavior-related components, a model commonly used for linking arousal to pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Denison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van den Brink et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Task-related fMRI responses were large and delayed on lapsed trials</title><p>A previous study found that TRRs in macaque V1 were largest when the animal disengaged from the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that TRRs may become largest, paradoxically, at very low arousal levels.

We tested whether task difficulty similarly modulates temporal variability. We measured temporal variability (across trials) in the TRR as the circular standard deviation of the Fourier phase at the task-onset frequency (1/15 Hz). The larger this number is, the more dispersed the response phases were across trials, with a maximum of square root of two if the phases were uniformly distributed, and a minimum of zero if the phases were identical across trials (a delta function). Temporal variability was modulated by both task difficulty and behavioral accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), being lowest for easy incorrect trials, higher for hard incorrect, followed by hard correct, and highest for easy correct (compare with Figure 5 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>).

This retinal stimulation might, in turn, evoke visual responses in V1. The scanner room was dark, but the screen edge was visible, so we might expect eye movement–related artifacts in V1 at the retinotopic position corresponding to the screen’s edge. In some conditions (e.g. when the task is easier and there is an error), observers might move their eyes more, causing larger visual responses in V1, thereby ‘explaining away’ our findings. We ruled out this possibility in two ways. First, we analyzed fixation stability during the task (measured outside the scanner in a separate pupillometry session) and tested for systematic differences in fixation stability between conditions (difficulty, accuracy, RT). We quantified fixation stability as the variability (std) over time within a trial of the distance between gaze and fixation in degrees of visual angle. Fixation stability (median across trials) was 0.18° on average across participants (for each observer: 0.18, 0.21, 0.20, 0.15, 0.17°), i.e., each observer fixated stably on the central cross. We performed a GLMM fitting fixation stability across trials with difficulty, accuracy, RT, and their interactions, as well as random intercepts for each subject and session. There were no statistically significant effects (all p&gt;0.4, all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 0.34), i.e., no evidence to suggest that fixation stability varied between conditions.</p><p>Next, we tested whether fMRI activity in V1 was highest at the retinotopic locations corresponding to the screen edge, as predicted by this luminance-artifact hypothesis. Specifically, we measured the average BOLD amplitude across all visual field locations within a rectangular border with a ‘thickness’ of 7.2° surrounding the screen edge (which extended from –35 to 35° horizontally and from –19.75 to 19.75° vertically), derived from the visual field amplitude maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We compared this test statistic to a null distribution comprising the average BOLD amplitude within 100,000 randomly selected rectangular borders in the visual field, with the same visual area in degrees squared. These random borders’ centers were drawn from a uniform distribution. We computed an exact p-value as the proportion of the null distribution beyond the test statistic (right-tailed) and found no evidence of a statistically significant difference in amplitude for easy (p=0.39, N = 100,000 samples) or hard runs of trials (p=0.56, <italic>N</italic> = 100,000 samples). The statistical outcome (0.5 &lt; p &lt; 0.7) was the same regardless of the border thickness (varied between 1.8 and 10.8°). This demonstrates that visual responses arising from the screen edge and eye movements, if present, do not account for the TRR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We observed large fMRI responses in human early visual cortex that were spatially widespread, independent of visual stimulation, and tightly entrained to trial timing. These TRRs, measured in V1 in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulus, were larger in amplitude when the task was more difficult, and on trials on which observers made an erroneous response, failed to respond, or were faster to respond. Neither the TRR nor its modulation with task difficulty or behavioral performance was explained by common fMRI-BOLD artifacts, i.e., changes in head movement, cardiac activity, and respiration, nor by the fMRI ‘global signal’. The temporal variability of the TRR was also modulated by task difficulty and behavioral performance, complementing similar findings from previous studies that manipulated reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). Contrary to the consensus of opinion that the fMRI-BOLD signal in V1 primarily reflects stimulus-evoked and attentional neuronal activity, we found evidence that the BOLD signal also contains a component that reflects the demands of a task and behavioral performance on the timescale of individual trials.</p><p>TRRs in early visual cortex are modulated by task difficulty, reward, and behavioral performance. Two previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref> examined the effect of reward magnitude on TRRs in early visual cortex, and found that larger rewards led to decreased temporal variability and increased response amplitude on individual trials, as well as larger trial-averaged response amplitude. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref> found that multiple measures of trial-to-trial variability in TRRs (i.e. timepoint, amplitude, and temporal variability) changed with reward. The authors used computational simulations to show that simultaneous increases in trial-averaged TRR amplitude with reward and decreases in the three measures of variability were consistent with only one possibility: changes in trial-to-trial temporal jitter. That is, averaging over many temporally jittered responses led to a lower amplitude trial-averaged response whereas averaging over many temporally aligned responses led to the opposite. And likewise, more temporal jitter also generated increases in all measures of trial-to-trial variability (timepoint, amplitude, and temporal variability). However, these results don’t preclude additional changes in trial-to-trial response amplitude with reward, but instead suggest that a portion of the trial-averaged response amplitude cannot be predicted by trial-to-trial amplitude alone. Indeed, Cardoso et al. found that both the trial-to-trial amplitude and timing of TRRs in macaque V1 were modulated by reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>). Our results provide a complementary account. We found that trial-to-trial amplitude, trial-averaged amplitude, and temporal variability of the TRR were all modulated by task difficulty and behavioral performance. Temporal variability was reduced for unexpected task events (i.e. incorrect feedback tone on an easy run of trials), consistent with previous findings showing that temporal precision (1/variability) scaled with arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, the evidence suggests that reward, task difficulty, and behavioral performance modulate both the temporal variability and amplitude of TRRs.</p><p>We found that TRR amplitude was modulated by RT on a trial-to-trial basis. It is well known that arousal influences RTs, with a classic inverted-U relation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Widdicombe and Sterling, 1970</xref>), an effect that shows up in standard physiological measures of arousal, including pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>) and cardiac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chin and Kales, 2019</xref>). So if TRR amplitude reflects arousal, as we hypothesized, we would expect that it would be higher when an observer responds faster, which is what we found (on correct trials). Note that we assume that our task primarily operates in the left half of the inverted-U, because even the hard task is rather boring, so arousal levels are never very high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>). Previous fMRI studies offer an alternative, but complementary perspective on the relationship between RT and TRR amplitude. A previous study measured the TRR in human V1 in a visual detection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jack et al., 2006</xref>) with either an immediate or delayed behavioral report (delay, ~9 s). In the delayed condition, there were response peaks following both trial onset <italic>and</italic> the behavioral report. In peripheral V1, far from the representation of the stimulus, the amplitude of fMRI activity was lower for a delayed than immediate report. This indicates that for an immediate report, there were also two components of the TRR — one for the trial onset and one for the response — but because they were so close in time, their impulse responses summed to a unimodal response. We might assume that two such ‘blurred-together’ responses were also present in our experiment, in which observers responded immediately after the stimulus presentation. It would follow then, that differences in RT should affect this summation and thereby modulate the amplitude of the unimodal TRR — slower RTs associated with lower fMRI amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Conversely, it could be that the amplitude of the TRR reflects time-on-task, i.e., a sustained input between trial onset and RT, often modeled as a boxcar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yarkoni et al., 2009</xref>). If true, TRR amplitude would be higher for trials with slower RTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). And a third possibility is that all three inputs are present, at trial onset, at the response time, and time on task. This scenario would produce some effect in-between these two extremes, which depends flexibly on the relative strengths of the three inputs. A model similar to this, with three inputs, is commonly used to predict the task-evoked pupil response from task structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Denison et al., 2020</xref>). To be liberal in our assumptions, we used a GLMM with these three putative inputs — fMRI_TO, fMRI_BP, and fMRI_ToT — as well as their combinations. We found that the combination of all three inputs best explained the results (i.e. the interactions of the combined fMRI predictor with task and behavioral variables were significant in the model). This agrees with the results of many studies linking arousal and pupil size, which used a similar model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Denison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van den Brink et al., 2016</xref>). Differences in RT are associated with changes in the timing and variability of phasic locus coeruleus (LC) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). And pupil size changes are linked closely to changes in neural activity in LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>) as well as other neuromodulatory brainstem loci, including the dorsal raphé (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cazettes et al., 2021</xref>), ventral tegmental area, subsantia nigra, and basal forebrain, and other subcortical and cortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that the link between TRR amplitude and RT is mediated by neuromodulatory influences on visual cortex and/or other, decision-related areas of the brain.</p><p>We found that TRRs and pupil responses were both modulated by task difficulty and behavioral accuracy in a similar manner. Previous empirical and computational modeling work suggests that such modulations may emerge via pupil-linked arousal systems being driven by internal beliefs about ones own behavioral choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Urai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref>). Signal detection theoretic models that take into account ones uncertainty about ones own choices (i.e. confidence) correctly predict modulations of the task-evoked pupil response before and after external feedback and their scaling with difficulty and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Urai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref>). According to these models, the brain might use its arousal system to ‘broadcast’ these uncertainty signals to a wide set of brain regions in order to facilitate inference and information processing. Under this account, the TRR’s modulation with difficulty and behavior may reflect adaptations in an underlying computational process to task demands, internal sensory noise, and internal beliefs (decision uncertainty). Accordingly, we found modulations of the task-evoked pupil response and TRR with difficulty and accuracy that matched predictions from this model (compare our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref> with Figure 2B from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref> ). This decision-uncertainty-arousal model also predicts that RTs vary in the same manner (i.e. fastest to slowest: easy correct, hard correct, hard incorrect, easy incorrect) — however, our findings weren’t consistent with this. Only 1/9 observers showed the expected pattern of RTs; instead, RTs were faster overall for easy trials, regardless of accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, inset). This difference may be due to the fact that there was no variability in stimulus orientation in our easy task, but there was in the hard task (due to the staircase), whereas the stimulus variability was the same across difficulty levels in refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Urai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref>). A ripe area for future study would be to link decision-theoretic models such as this with a linear systems model of the fMRI signal, and try to predict the TRR from task and behavioral parameters.</p><p>Our results are not attributable to the effects of spatial attention. Previous studies have measured the spatial distribution of spatial attention (the ‘attention field’ ) in early visual cortex and found that it tightly surrounds the retinotopic location of the attended stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herrmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>), particularly when it appears at a predictable location, size, and time, as in our experiment. Furthermore, we previously found, using a similar stimulus and protocol, that reward magnitude modulated TRR amplitude (also measured in ipsilateral cortex) even though behavioral accuracy and RT were statistically indistinguishable between low and high reward conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>). That is, increased reward did not alter the allocation of spatial attention, as quantified as a behavioral enhancement, which is how attention is typically operationalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dugué et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, we found that the measured TRR was lower in amplitude ascending the visual cortical hierarchy. This is opposite to what is seen in fMRI studies of spatial attention responses, which increase in amplitude from V1 to V2 to V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dugué et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The origin and control of the TRR in early visual cortex remain unclear. One possibility is that they are driven by an intrinsic vascular mechanism rather than a local neuronal one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sirotin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Herman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Das et al., 2021</xref>). This putative mechanism, vasomotion, or oscillation in tone of blood vessels independent of cardiac and respiratory activity, occurs in cerebral arteries and is influenced by arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nilsson and Aalkjaer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borovik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mateo et al., 2017</xref>). More broadly, cerebral blood flow is complex and modulated by arousal via multiple cellular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raichle et al., 1975</xref>), including activity of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duffy and MacVicar, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Takata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peppiatt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hall et al., 2014</xref>), endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sorriento et al., 2011</xref>), and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Faber, 1988</xref>). Our fMRI data cannot reveal the origins of the TRR, but may provide some clues. We found that the amplitude of the trial-averaged TRR was highest in V1, and progressively smaller in V2 and V3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), whereas temporal variability was similar among the three visual areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). On the other hand, both temporal variability and response amplitude were modulated by task difficulty and behavioral performance <italic>within</italic> each visual area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, D</xref>). The larger TRRs in V1 (vs. V2 and V3) may arise from some non-neural factor, possibly the unique vasculature of V1, where there are two input arteries, the calcarine artery (branch of the posterior cerebral artery) and posterior temporal artery (branch of the middle cerebral artery). This would support the view that the TRR is purely vascular in origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Das et al., 2021</xref>) and may be modulated (via vascular mechanisms) by neuromodulatory activity arising in the brainstem. It’s also possible that the TRR is actually not smaller across the visual hierarchy, but instead simply appears so because of how the fMRI signal pools across local neural and/or vascular processes. Furthermore, it’s known that some neuromodulatory projections are stronger in some areas than others, meaning that the pooled magnitude of the TRR might be higher in one area than another, even if the local process and its function is the same. For example, the density of noradrenergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foote and Morrison, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shimegi et al., 2016</xref>) and cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Disney et al., 2006</xref>) projections differs in V1 and V2.</p><p>The TRR may be neural in origin. Our pupillometry results suggest that arousal increases at trial onset in our task. It’s well known that the noradrenergic projections are relatively unspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foote and Morrison, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Waterhouse, 2016</xref>). If the NE-arousal brainstem system is active at task onset, this would be expected to modulate neural activity in early visual cortex, given prior anatomical and physiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foote and Morrison, 1987</xref>). A number of previous studies have proposed that neuromodulators can alter the weighing of new evidence and prior expectations in cortical computations via changes in synaptic gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dayan and Yu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heeger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Gee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Friston, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moran et al., 2013</xref>), with NE tamping down the effect of the prior. Consistent with this idea, pupil-linked arousal has been found to primarily affect decision biases, which can be modeled as a change in the weighing of prior vs. likelihood. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de Gee et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Gee et al., 2020</xref> found that larger pupil responses were linked with reductions in decision bias (measured via the signal detection theoretical criterion) in a visual detection task and increased activity in a number of neuromodulatory loci, measured using fMRI. Another study manipulated prior expectations on a trial-by-trial basis and found that pupil size dynamically tracked resulting decision biases in human behavior, with smaller pupil responses corresponding to smaller biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnamurthy et al., 2017</xref>). This, taken together with other results showing that pupil-linked arousal also varies with serial choice biases, decision confidence, and prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Urai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colizoli et al., 2018</xref>), suggests that a portion of variability in behavioral choices may be causally controlled by arousal. Our results, considered from this perspective, may indicate that TRRs have a computational role, shaping neural activity and/or readouts in visual cortex and thereby having a causal effect on behavior. The TRRs we measure with fMRI may therefore reflect the widespread effect of neuromodulators like NE on cortical computation via normal neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>), separate effects of NE or other neuromodulators on the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Purkayastha and Raven, 2011</xref>), or a combination of these factors.</p><p>Our findings may also be related to recent neurophysiology studies in animal models linking arousal, global brain states, and visual cortical activity. New recording techniques have allowed researchers to measure the activity of many thousands of neurons at once (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Studies using such techniques have observed widespread responses in visual cortex (and beyond) during delay period and behavioral response times, i.e., in the absence of a stimulus. A number of studies have found that arousal, measured by pupil size, explains much of the variability in this widespread visual cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salkoff et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in mouse V1, hemodynamic responses recorded during visual stimulation can be decomposed into a local and global component, the latter of which is correlated with changes in pupil size, consistent with the hypothesis that the global component reflects arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pisauro et al., 2016</xref>). It remains to be seen if these widespread neural responses give rise to the TRR. We found that the temporal precision of the TRR across trials scaled with arousal level. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the TRR is neural in origin, given previous findings demonstrating that increased alertness leads to more precise neural activity in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lombardo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arazi et al., 2019</xref>). If the TRR is neural in origin, it may be driven by a relatively small subpopulation of neurons, not evident in LFPs or mean firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Das et al., 2021</xref>), or by widespread changes in subthreshold neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>). The TRR may instead, as described above, be evoked by a widespread release of neuromodulators that both evoke a hemodynamic response and shift the weighing of prior vs. likelihood, both of which may occur without a change in mean firing rates or mean LFP amplitude.</p><p>A previous study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>, found that macaque V1 exhibited alternating increasing and decreasing ramps in blood volume on the timescale of minutes between blocks of low and high reward. This is an interesting result that suggests that the TRR is characterized by both differences in the baseline blood volume and the amplitude of hemodynamic responses. Unfortunately, unlike optical imaging, fMRI-BOLD is not sensitive to such slow changes in the baseline, because the signal is affected by many other sources of noise in the same slow frequency range. Future studies using alternative imaging methods like Vascular-Space-Occupancy (VASO) could potentially resolve these slow ramps in blood volume and validate the results of ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>) in humans.</p><p>Our findings may be related to previous studies identifying a component of the fMRI-BOLD signal related to arousal, but further research is necessary to test if this component and the TRR reflect the same phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Özbay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gonzalez-Castillo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goodale et al., 2021</xref>). One of these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Goodale et al., 2021</xref> found that the most responsive voxels measured were in the primary sensory cortices, including early visual cortex, and that these voxels alone sufficed for prediction of behavioral performance and an EEG measure of arousal. If future studies find that this fMRI component is equivalent to the TRR, it could lead to a productive unification of these two areas of research.</p><p>The amplitude of the TRR in V1 (mean across all voxels and trials, 0.32% change; median, 0.28% change; max, 6.20% change) is similar to that of stimulus-evoked and attentional hemodynamic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dugué et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Das et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>). This raises concerns about fMRI task designs in which attention or other psychological variables are operationalized according to behavioral performance and/or task parameters. In such cases, TRRs, which are modulated by critical task variables and behavior, may mix with other fMRI signal components, and thereby confound analysis. Our results demonstrate that common preprocessing approaches (i.e. global signal regression, physiological ‘noise’ correction) do not remove the TRR from fMRI data. Furthermore, the TRR contains information about brain state that would otherwise typically be measured independently with pupil size and/or cardiac activity. Therefore, in some scenarios it may be useful to model the TRR, remove it from fMRI data as a preprocessing step, and then possibly analyze it as an independent measure of arousal. One way to achieve this is to run a 5–10 min version of a task in which the visual stimulus is confined to one visual field, so that the TRR can be easily isolated and measured later (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Donner et al., 2008</xref> for a simple protocol for removing the TRR).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Approaches to analyzing and interpreting fMRI data are largely based on studies of early visual cortex, where neural activity is time-locked to visual stimulation, and the fMRI signal is well approximated by a linear transformation of that stimulus-evoked neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ress et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heeger and Ress, 2002</xref>).

One of these components, the task-related fMRI response, is widespread and entrained to task timing, and it covaries with physiological measures of arousal as well as reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sirotin and Das, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sirotin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Herman et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that the TRR is also modulated across trials by task difficulty, accuracy, RT, and lapses. These findings demonstrate the existence of a component of the fMRI-BOLD signal in human early visual cortex that reflects arousal on the timescale of individual trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Observers</title><p>Experiments were conducted at two sites. fMRI<italic>,</italic> cardiac, and respiration measurements were acquired from 13 observers at the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Core Facility at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

All observers were healthy adults, with no history of neurological disorders and with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. For the fMRI experiment, four observers were missing either high-quality cardiac and/or respiratory data, so all of their data was excluded from all analyses. Experiments were conducted with the written consent of each observer.

The stimulus was a grating patch (spatial frequency, 4 cycles/°) multiplied by a circular envelope (diameter, 1.5°) with raised-cosine edges (contrast, 100%). The stimulus was equiluminant with the gray background, such that it would not evoke a luminance response in visual cortex or a light reflex response in the pupil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>). On each trial, the grating was flashed briefly in the lower right visual field (5° diagonal to fixation) and observers covertly attended to the stimulus. Stimulus location was determined by the recording chambers used in related monkey electrophysiological experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>), which are typically centered at ~4–5° eccentricity in the lower visual hemifield, along the diagonal, i.e., ~45 or 135° polar angle. The difficulty of the task was manipulated by changing the tilt angle of the grating. In blocks of easy trials, the grating was tilted ±20° away from vertical. In blocks of hard trials, the grating was tilted by a much smaller amount (typically ±1°), with an adaptive staircase (one-up, two-down) ensuring ~70–75% correct discrimination accuracy. Observers were instructed to fixate a central cross on the monitor throughout the experimental session. The color of the fixation cross indicated the difficulty of the current block of trials — red for hard and green for easy blocks. This ensured that the observer was always informed of the current task difficulty. Each block had a predictable trial structure with a fixed interstimulus interval. Each trial was 15 s long, starting with a 200 ms stimulus presentation and a 14.8 s interstimulus interval, during which the observer was instructed to make a key press response indicating the perceived orientation of the grating. Observers could respond at any time during the ISI. 99.6% of RTs were under 4 s, and 86.2% were under 1 s (median RT: 552 ms). A long ISI was employed because it allowed us to better measure the full-time course of the TRR. Tone feedback was given immediately following the behavioral response — a high tone indicated correct behavioral responses and a low tone indicated incorrect behavioral responses. There were 16 trials per run (240 s), but the first trial was always removed in our analysis to allow the hemodynamic response to reach steady state.

To obtain a precise estimate of the peak times in the cardiac signal, given the temporal undersampling of the pulse oximeter, we used linear extrapolation based on signal to the left and the right of each putative undersampled peak location and solved for the missing peak as the intersection of the two best-fit lines. Heart rate was computed as the mean of the time series of interpeak durations and converted into beats per minute. Heart rate variability was computed using the root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shaffer and Ginsberg, 2017</xref>), which acts as a high-pass filter, removing low frequency components of the time series of interpeak durations, such as those related to respiration. Heart rate variability is a widely used measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Goldberger et al., 2001</xref>) and is typically higher when a participant is more calm. Heart rate acceleration was computed as the mean of the first derivative of the time series of interpeak durations, with units of beats/s<sup>2</sup>, so positive numbers reflect acceleration and negative numbers deceleration. Acceleration/deceleration of the heart beat is associated with changes in either parasympathetic (vagus nerve) or sympathetic nervous system activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pan et al., 2016</xref>).

The respiration signal was mean-subtracted and converted into percent signal change. Its amplitude (volume) was obtained by taking the standard deviation of the time series on each trial separately. Respiration frequency was computed, on each trial, as the component with the maximum amplitude in the frequency response. People hold their breath more when more alert, leading us to predict that respiration frequency should be lower when arousal is higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Widdicombe and Sterling, 1970</xref>). Respiration variability was computed in the same way as heart rate variability, without the peak extrapolation method, by finding the signal peak times and computing the RMSSD thereof. We included all of these physiological measures because they capture different components of arousal (e.g. reflecting sympathetic and/or parasympathetic nervous system activity), which may have different links with behavior and task demands. Head movement estimates were computed from the times series from the first TE of the multiecho sequence, and then this estimate was used to motion correct the images from all three TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kundu et al., 2013</xref>). We used these estimates of the translational and rotational movement of the head in each dimension of movement (roll, pitch, yaw, y, x, and z) as predictors in the GLMM. All physiological measures were computed with a time bin of 15 s (the duration of a trial).</p><p>To analyze the influence of task difficulty and behavioral accuracy on physiological measures of arousal, we binned these physiological measures by trial type (difficulty × accuracy) and ran permutation tests to check for differences among trial types. Permutation tests were performed to assess the differences in the amplitude of task-evoked pupil responses as well. We computed a test statistic from the data, the difference in the mean physiological measure across trials between easy correct and easy incorrect trials, hard correct and hard incorrect trials, and easy correct and hard correct trials. For heart rate variability and breathing frequency only, the direction of the test was reversed, as we expected these measures to be lower when arousal is greater. We constructed a null distribution by concatenating the data from the two conditions, randomly shuffling the trial type labels (10,000 iterations), splitting the resulting array into two new groups (with the same sizes as the original two labeled groups), and computing the difference of the mean of these two new groups. For each test, the p-value of the test was equal to the proportion of samples in the null distribution greater than the test statistic. These ‘exact p-values’ were then corrected for the finite number of permutations performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Phipson and Smyth, 2010</xref>). We chose not to analyze the effect of RT on the physiological signals as a simple scaling. Instead, we modeled the influence of RT on the fMRI signal via the weighted sum of three components, two of which are determined by RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Gee et al., 2014</xref>). This approach is expected to be more sensitive in revealing the influence of RT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data cleaning</title><p>The first trial of each run was removed. This was done for all data types: fMRI, physiological, head movement, and behavioral data. Trials on which the observer did not respond were removed and analyzed separately as ‘lapse trials.’ No feedback tone was played on lapse trials. The lapse rate was 4.48% for hard runs and 6.68% for easy runs. We expected a larger lapse rate for easy runs because alertness was expected to be lower, which would cause more lapses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>General linear mixed model</title><p>Our aim was to test the hypothesis that task difficulty and behavioral performance modulate the amplitude of TRRs in V1. We used a standard general linear model approach, with additional random intercepts and slopes for each observer to account for systematic differences in the fMRI signal across observers, i.e., a GLMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We included all predictors of interest in the model: putative TRR components (trial onset [‘fMRI_TO’], button press [‘fMRI_BP’], and time on task [‘fMRI_ToT’]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yarkoni et al., 2009</xref>), task difficulty, behavioral performance, predictions of the fMRI signal evoked by respiration and cardiac activity, and head movement. The GLMM had 24 fixed effects coefficients, corresponding to the following predictors: the convolution of a parametric HRF (the sum of two gamma functions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shan et al., 2014</xref>) fit separately to each observer’s grand mean TRR with impulses at (1) trial onset and (2) button press, and with a (3) time-on-task boxcar between them, as well as (4) task difficulty, (5) behavioral accuracy, predictions for fMRI activity evoked by (6) respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birn et al., 2008</xref>) and (7) cardiac activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2009</xref>), (8–13) the movement of the head in six dimensions (roll, pitch, yaw, y, x, and z) and (14–24) the interactions of all fMRI, task, and behavioral predictors (every combination). All predictors were downsampled (and appropriately low-pass filtered first, i.e., decimated) to the sampling rate of the fMRI signal. We also included one random intercept for each observer, and random slopes for the three fMRI predictors for each observer, for a total of 63 random effects coefficients. Each predictor was a time course the same length as the fMRI signal across all trials and runs, and for all observers. All predictors were included in a single design matrix, which was used to predict the trial-to-trial TRR in ipsilateral (right) V1. Head movement, cardiac, and respiration predictors were included to partial out their influence on the fMRI signal.</p><p>We used the fitlme function in Matlab to fit the GLMM to the voxel-averaged TRR (rV1) time course. We tested the assumptions of the linear model by examining the residuals as a function of the fitted values, and found that there was no trend, just a large Gaussian-looking cloud centered at zero. The distribution of residuals appeared Gaussian and the qq-plot showed slight deviation from Gaussian behavior at the tails, but Gaussian behavior in the center of the distribution. The total <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of the model was 4.5%, suggesting that the inclusion of the multiple interaction terms in the model didn’t cause overfitting. The total <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of the model was low in comparison to linear models of stimulus-evoked fMRI activity, but nonetheless many of the regressors were statistically significant. Due to the paucity of studies that have modeled the TRR, it’s unclear what one might expect this <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> to be, given the intrinsic variability of the TRR and measurement noise. Next, we examined the full time course of the model prediction vs. the data, and observed that the random slopes we included for the fMRI predictors were necessary to capture sometimes large difference in the fMRI signal amplitude across observers. To compute p-values and <italic>F</italic> statistics for linear combinations of the predictors (e.g. the combination of the three fMRI inputs, and its interaction with difficulty and/or accuracy), we performed an <italic>F</italic>-test using the coefTest function in Matlab.</p><p>To build the respiration and cardiac fMRI predictors, we convolved the raw signal from the respiration belt with a canonical respiration response function (computed at the same sampling rate), which effectively models the influence of respiration on the fMRI signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birn et al., 2008</xref>). We did the same with the cardiac (pulse oximeter) signal, based on ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2009</xref>). Only after computing the convolutions at the intrinsic sampling rates of the respiration/cardiac measurements did we downsample these predictions to the sampling rate of the BOLD signal.</p><p>Note that we observed large and widespread hemodynamic responses in ipsilateral early visual cortex in the raw fMRI-BOLD signal and after every type of preprocessing procedure we tried (ME-ICA, global signal regression, and physiological artifact regression). We found that it was not possible to remove the TRR by ‘denoising’ the fMRI time series in preprocessing.</p><p>For each observer, we fit six parameters of a parametric HRF (the sum of two gamma functions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shan et al., 2014</xref>) to their grand mean trial-averaged TRR using fminsearch in Matlab. We could only use the 16 s of the grand mean TRR that we had to fit the parameters of the parametric form, but we allowed the resulting parametric HRF to be 32-s long. We used this best-fit parametric HRF to build the three fMRI predictors (fMRI_TO, fMRI_BP, and fMRI_ToT) by convolving the HRF with the impulses or boxcar occurring every trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yarkoni et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Pupillometry</title><p>The experiment was repeated outside the scanner with an identical protocol, except with a shorter, 4-s ISI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>). Pupil area was recorded continuously during the task using an Eyelink 1000 infrared eye tracker (SR Research Ltd., Ontario, Canada) with a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Nine-point calibration and validation were performed before each run. Blinks and saccades were removed from the pupil size time series and interpolated over (using piecewise cubic interpolation). Pupil size time series from each run were band-pass filtered with a fourth order zero-phase (i.e. ‘filtfilt’ in Matlab) Butterworth filter with 0.03 Hz and 10 Hz cutoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burlingham et al., 2022</xref>). Average pupil responses, time-locked to trial onset, were calculated for hard and easy runs, correct and incorrect trials separately. The SEM for each average time series was computed across all runs and observers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Global signal does not show same dependence on task difficulty and behavioral performance that the TRR does</title><p>We repeated the same GLMM that we performed on the TRR, but instead tested the global signal to see whether it shows a similar dependence on task difficulty and behavioral performance. There was only one statistically significant predictor out of nine, which was the interaction of task difficulty and the fMRI_BP predictor (p=0.02). Additionally, the <italic>F</italic> statistic (5.04) was smaller for the global signal than it was for the TRR in V1, for this interaction. Correspondingly, the coefficient test was only significant for difficulty, not accuracy, nor the interaction of difficulty × accuracy. These observations suggest that the global signal may depend on task difficulty, but to a smaller degree than the TRR. This is not surprising, given that the global signal covaries with artifactual physiological influences on the BOLD signal (such as head motion), and these artifacts are themselves known to depend on task difficulty. Overall, we conclude that the global signal shows a weaker and different dependence on task difficulty and behavioral performance than the TRR in early visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>TRRs in V1, V2, and V3 largely showed statistically significant relationships with task difficulty and behavioral performance</title><p>We found that TRR amplitudes were largest in V1, and progressively smaller in V2 and V3. To more closely examine the statistical relationships between TRR amplitude, task difficulty, and behavioral performance, we conducted the same GLMM in V2 and V3 that we conducted in V1. <italic>F</italic> values for the coefficient tests were as follows — difficulty (V1/V2/V3): 6.61, 3.05, 7.96; accuracy (V1/V2/V3): 3.81, 0.48, 3.43; difficulty × accuracy (V1/V2/V3): 3.79, 0.91, 3.78. All p-values were statistically significant except for accuracy and difficulty × accuracy in V2. Overall, this shows task difficulty modulated TRR amplitude within V1, V2, and V3, and that accuracy significantly modulated TRR amplitude in V1 and V3, but to a lesser degree in V2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Lack of support for the hypothesis that contralateral connections in visual cortex cause the TRR</title><p>Previous studies have hypothesized that contralateral anatomical connections between the two hemispheres of visual cortex lead to coordinated retinotopically organized activity in left and right hemisphere visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arcaro et al., 2015</xref>). If so, one might imagine that our visual stimulus, which was presented in the right hemifield only, may have evoked a neural response in the right hemisphere as well as the left that could explain away our results. To test this idea, we took voxels from the right hemisphere representing only the upper visual field where we could be confident that there was no visual response (because our stimulus was always in the lower visual field) and reran the main GLMM analysis, which tests for modulations of the TRR with difficulty and behavioral performance. This analysis returned the same statistical outcomes as when we initially included both the upper and lower visual fields, with p-values of 1.85x10<sup>-4</sup>, 0.0096, and 0.0099 (<italic>F</italic>: 6.61, 3.81, 3.79) for the effects of difficulty, accuracy, and the interaction difficulty × accuracy, respectively. We repeated this upper-visual-field-only analysis on V2 and V3 and still found statistically significant effects for all comparisons (except the effect of accuracy in V2, for which p&gt;0.05). These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that the TRR arises from stimulus-evoked activity showing up in the ipsilateral hemisphere via interhemispheric connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Stimulus-evoked activity during the localizer</title><p>Each observer completed a stimulus localizer scan, in which a stimulus was presented in the location of the stimulus during the task (right hemifield) or in its mirror location in the left hemifield. The stimulus was a grating identical to that used in the main experiment, except that it remained on the screen continuously for 9 s and changed phase and orientation every 200 ms to prevent adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To analyze these data, we performed a correlation analysis in which we identified fluctuations in the fMRI signal matching the temporal frequency with which the stimulus alternated visual field (left-right change every 18 s). We observed robust stimulus-evoked activity in antiphase between the two hemispheres, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). That is, the fMRI signal peaked in the left hemisphere at a fixed delay after the stimulus was presented in the right hemifield, and the fMRI signal peaked in the right hemisphere the same delay after the stimulus was presented in the left hemifield. We projected this stimulus-evoked activity into the space of the visual field using a pRF analysis first introduced in ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>) (see their methods for details) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis produced two foci of activity nearly antiphase with each other in the lower left and right hemifield at the location of the two stimuli in the localizer experiment.</p><p>The stimulus-evoked responses we observed (in brain space; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) during the localizer were much more circumscribed compared to the responses observed during the task in the left hemisphere, which were a combination of stimulus-evoked, attentional, and task-related responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and compared to the responses in right hemisphere, which were just task-related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The amplitude of the fMRI response in the right hemisphere (measured as std of time course) was similar during the localizer and task (0.30% vs. 0.28% change, median across all voxels in right V1, all runs, and all observers). And likewise for the left hemisphere (localizer vs. task, 0.32% vs. 0.30% change). That said, it is unclear how stimulus-evoked, attentional, and task-related responses interact in visual cortex. This is an important question, and one that has been addressed extensively in the attention literature, where attention has been shown to have multiplicative effect on stimulus-evoked activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herrmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>). We couldn’t investigate this sort of question in our data because we purposely designed our task to minimize the stimulus-evoked activity (note that stimulus duration was 9 s in the localizer vs. only 200 ms in the task, and the stimulus was only 1.5° in size). For this same reason, a detailed comparison of stimulus- and task-driven activity is beyond the scope of this paper. However, see refs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardoso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardoso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Herman et al., 2017</xref>) for some first hints about these questions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roth et al., 2020</xref>), in which the authors excluded voxels responsive to the stimulus in the localizer and still observed robust TRRs that were significantly amplitude modulated by reward magnitude.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Correction for multiple comparisons</title><p>A total of 128 hypothesis tests were performed throughout the paper. We note that not all tests were independent, but that positive dependencies were expected to exist between them because they were computed using the same test statistics. To control the overall type I error rate at an ⍺ level of 0.05 while assuming dependencies between tests, we subjected all exact p-values to a ‘two-stage’ adaptive procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>). It has been shown via simulation that of a number of similar tests, this adaptive test is best at controlling false discovery rate, regardless of effect size, in the presence of positive dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stevens et al., 2017</xref>). This procedure yielded a corrected critical p-value, ⍺ = 0.0491, which was adopted as a conservative cutoff to judge the strength of the statistical evidence for each hypothesis test. We found no p-values between 0.0491 and 0.05, so we treated our effective ⍺ as 0.05 throughout the text.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Informed consent, and consent to publish, was obtained from all human participants.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Task-related hemodynamic responses in human early visual cortex are modulated by task difficulty and behavioral performance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kristina Visscher (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Burlingham and colleagues studied a number of individuals using fMRI while they performed an orientation discrimination task. In this task they were able to isolate a task-related response (TRR) in the fMRI BOLD signal, that was present in visual cortex in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulus, independent of other physiological variables such as respiration, and dependent on the difficulty of the task. They use a mathematical model to isolate the magnitude of the TRR on individual trials, and link it to shifts in arousal.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this work was clearly interesting to the field of fMRI researchers, and extends previous research by the authors and others showing what is contained in the TRR. In order to make this work suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and extend the reach of the work to those beyond this specialized field, the reviewers agreed that the authors would have to demonstrate two key points about the TRR:</p><p>1. Demonstrate convincingly that the TRR shown here, and its properties, are a new feature of the brain's activity that is being described and uncovered – i.e., that it could not simply be an artifact, either of signal due to retinal responses to the stimuli (due to eye movements in the scanner), connections to contralateral V1 which we know receives inputs from the stimuli, respiration, and maybe other things.</p><p>2. Link the TRR and the work here convincingly to other literature and work outside the field of those studying TRR, to provide a computational or mechanistic interpretation of this phenomenon. For example, there are numerous studies of the pupil and arousal, neurovascular coupling and arousal, and broadly how arousal modulates neurons and behavior. Links between the TRRs observed here and that work would make its broad appeal clearer.</p><p>Below is a more detailed description of the issues related to concerns 1 and 2 above, as well as a compiled list of specific additional comments from all reviewers.</p><p>(1A) The authors state that because the measurements were collected from ipsilateral V1 and &quot;based on numerous prior studies,&quot; the TRR was unlikely to be a stimulus or attention evoked response (lines 70-73). Do the authors have any data from the contralateral hemisphere to demonstrate the difference between the evoked and task-related response or can they elaborate more on the prior work that distinguishes these responses? This would be helpful given the first major concern about the subject's eye position during the task. Also, spatial attention modulates activity both at the site of the attention and elsewhere in single-neuron recordings. Can the authors elaborate a bit on what these prior studies show that rules out attention here? It seems like showing the comparison of contralateral and ipsilateral responses in this case, at least as a supplement, would be useful.</p><p>It would be informative to know what the patterns of activity in contralateral visual cortex are. If it is the case that the same patterns exist in the contralateral cortex (e.g. effects of 'arousal' are similar), then a possible interpretation would be that the strong connections between homologous brain areas drives the effects seen in the ipsilateral cortex. However, if the patterns in the contralateral cortex do not show a hint of the effect shown in ipsilateral cortex (e.g. the effects shown in ipsilateral cortex are still present after regressing out effects in contralateral cortex, or the effects in contralateral cortex were very close to 0) this would strengthen the claim that the effects observed are independent of contralateral cortex.</p><p>B) During the main experimental paradigm in the MRI scanner, the subject was instructed to centrally fixate throughout the session. Was there any eye tracking to ensure they maintained fixation within the scanner or to remove trials where they looked towards the target? Otherwise, the subject could have developed a strategy, in the extreme, to look towards or directly at the target during more difficult trials (or something more subtle but equally problematic). Eye movements, both small saccades or larger ones that shift the visual field, could account for some aspect of the task-related hemodynamic response. It's also unclear how, if at all, the authors handled this concern in their second experiment with pupillometry repeated outside the scanner, where they clearly do have the eye tracking data. One way to test for this effect in data with pupillometry would be to compare the variance in eye stability (that is, how well were they fixating) between conditions (easy vs. hard, correct vs. incorrect, slow RT vs. fast RT). Although they may not have the eye tracking data in the scanner, at least in the analogous experiment outside they should better analyze the eye data to determine whether the fixation was similar in the different conditions. Changes in fixation can also impact pupillometry data as well, another reason to do this control analysis.</p><p>Overall, the lack of fixation tracking poses a concern to the claim that TRRs do not arise from spatial attention (who knows if people really fixated). While acknowledging that rectifying this would only be possible with new data, the authors would be encouraged to collect eye-tracking data in the fMRI in the future. There may even be publicly available datasets of fMRI + eye tracking, allowing them to account for potential fixation confounds in follow-up work.</p><p>(2A) The authors claim the results in Figure 4 suggest arousal as a common driver for the modulation of the TRR by task difficulty and performance. However, this statement seems weakly supported given most of the physiologic metrics don't show significant effects across conditions. While pupil changes appear consistent with the fMRI results, concerns about the subject failing to maintain fixation in certain conditions could potentially contribute to these results. Furthermore, the effect of trial difficulty on trial-averaged pupil dynamics is not a new result (see Urai et al. 2017, Nat. Comm) and the authors should place their findings in context of those results, which demonstrated similar trends.</p><p>B) The paper does not seem to consider the potential computational nature of TRRs (figure 3) and the other physiological measures (figure 4). Beyond quantifying their dependence on difficulty, RT and lapses, would there be a unified model that could explain all of these (e.g. confidence or prediction errors, which are known to predict pupil responses? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31985-3). If the authors could link their finding to the literature on decision-making and psychophysiology, the relevance of the work would extend much beyond the fMRI community.</p><p>C) Related to these points, the introduction is very brief and centered entirely on the phenomenon of the TRR, without placing it very firmly in the broader context of the literature of arousal, decision-making, etc, to extend the relevance of the work beyond the fMRI community. Similarly, the discussion presents potential vascular origins of the TRR, but only very briefly as an aside mentions neuromodulation, subthreshold activity, and subpopulations of neurons as possible explanations. Many of these have been studied extensively in other contexts in linking fMRI results to neuronal activity, and could be discussed here in better linking this work to the broader field.</p><p>Additional specific comments:</p><p>– I find the color coding in figure 4 very confusing: I'm used to correct = green and error = red. Perhaps changing this would make the figure easier to parse.</p><p>– what is the sampling rate of the pulse oximeter? If this signal (as well as respiration) is significantly down-sampled with respect to the fMRI TR, could this lead to an under correction of physiological noise?</p><p>– How many trials were lapses? Did this vary across the session, or with hard/easy blocks?</p><p>– It is difficult to judge whether the pre-processing steps (physiological noise removal, global signal regression) are appropriate and sufficient. However, it's likely that the measurement of TRRs strongly depends on these steps – for the non-fMRI expert, it would help to read a short statement describing the choice of procedures.</p><p>– The analyses done to compare TRRs in V2 and V3 were unclear- was another GLMM constructed or are the authors simply comparing the trial-averaged responses across conditions? Secondly, no statistics are shown. If they want to claim smaller effects across the visual hierarchy, they should test that specifically (i.e., test whether V2's effects are &lt; V1, or V3 &lt; V2 &lt; V1). Were the difficulty and performance related effects on TRRs in V2 and V3 significant? Or just visually smaller than V1? Lastly, the shape of the TRRs in V2 and V3 seem more similar to the lapsed trials in Figure 3e. Some discussion of the shape of the TRRs might be warranted (especially given lapse trials in 3e and V2 and V3 in 5c seem to have an &quot;initial dip&quot; in the BOLD signal and deviate from the typical TRR shape).</p><p>– Lines 129-131 (RT analysis)- did the proportion of trials with fast vs. slow RTs vary with task difficulty or performance? For example, did the subjects tend to respond faster overall in the more difficult trials? Also, it would be helpful if the prediction for a relationship between RT and arousal was more specific or placed in context of RT changes with arousal in the literature (ex. elevated arousal is associated with faster RTs).</p><p>– Lines 133-136 &quot;. first, by the latency between the trial onset and button press inputs, and second, by the duration of the time-on-task input (Figure S1). We hypothesized that amplitude modulation of the TRR with reaction time (on individual trials) was determined by the sum of these three hypothesized inputs.&quot; Those are two hypothesized inputs. What is the third?</p><p>– Why refer to &quot;time on task&quot; as wholly separate from Reaction Time – they are the same construct. I think it would be easier to follow your argument if you used the same word for them. If there is a separate construct I'm missing, then that needs to be clearer. On line 133, you say that latency was represented by latency between trial onset and button press, and second by duration of the time on task input. This needs to be explained better, because from what I know at this point in the paper, time on task IS the time difference between trial onset and button press. I understand why you would want the three components in your model, but not why you would refer to the effects of a fMRI_TO+fMRI_BP as a &quot;reaction time&quot; measurement. Perhaps you are using the term in a special way? (do you mean RT as &quot;time of responses&quot; rather than the more common &quot;time between stimulus and response?&quot;)</p><p>– Also, in for example Figure 5, you don't include Easy incorrect trials (because there aren't enough trials to compute temporal variability), but you can compute e.g. % change for those trials. I don't see why the power should make it impossible to calculate the Easy I condition variability (Figure 5D), but give reliable estimates of the mean and SD for the Easy I condition. A quick power analysis here would be sufficient.</p><p>– Was there a tone presented non lapse trials? If so, the logic of the lapse trials amplitude being bigger than response trials could be the same as the easy error trials having stronger responses than the correct trials: the participant is surprised and brought back to full attention to the task.</p><p>– Line 139- add some indication of how the simulation was performed (presumably using the GLMM?)</p><p>– It isn't clear why reaction time was not also addressed in the analysis of physiological data, as it was in the hemodynamic data. Some of the bigger effects in Figure 3 were for fast vs. slow RTs.</p><p>– Figure 3c-d- it's initially confusing that the color scheme for fast/slow RT is the same as the correct/incorrect trials in 3b</p><p>– Figure 3f-g- why are there no statistics demonstrating the significance of these results?</p><p>– Figure 3G legend: &quot;viability&quot; should be &quot;variability.&quot;</p><p>– Line 167- an additional line providing details on how the circular standard deviation of the Fourier phase serves as a measure of temporal variability would provide clarity.</p><p>– Line 168- the authors imply that temporal precision was highest when arousal level was higher. Some brief discussion of this point in the Discussion section would be interesting.</p><p>– Line 177 (pupil analysis)- although potentially outside the scope of this paper, it might be valuable to also assess microsaccade rate, which has been linked to arousal, in different task/performance conditions</p><p>– Line 189- it should be clearer that all the other physiologic metrics besides pupil were measured in the scanner simultaneously during the fMRI experiment</p><p>– Figure 4: For each physiologic metric, the authors are making multiple comparisons across task/performance conditions but don't discuss any statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Do the significant trends in this figure survive that correction?</p><p>– Figure 4: Was each metric (ex. heart rate, pupil) averaged over the whole trial or some smaller bin within the trial? This detail should be clearer in the methods. If the whole trial was used, could some of the pupil effect be related to the pupillary light reflex evoked by the stimulus flash? Alternatively, if a smaller bin near the feedback tone was used, this could provide a better estimate of the surprise-related arousal effect the authors mention.</p><p>– Line 290 -&gt; pupil dilation has been found to scale with many neuromodulatory (and other cortical and subcortical) systems (e.g. de Gee et al. 2017, Cazettes et al. 2021, Joshi); I find it too strong to equate pupil fluctuations with the LC-NE system.</p><p>– Global signal- if some aspect of the task-related response was present across cortex (consistent with a global arousal signature), then it might be present in the global signal, which was regressed out in this work because it also contains elements of physiologic processes. Potentially outside the scope of this work, but does this trial-to-trial analysis method find a similar TRR in the global signal?</p><p>– Prior work on TRRs demonstrated &quot;ramp-like&quot; increases and decreases in hemodynamics over minutes between blocks of high and low reward conditions (Cardoso et al. 2019, PLOS). It would be interesting, although potentially outside the scope of this work, if the authors saw similar trends between easy and difficult task blocks or could model this effect in their GLMM by adding trial number within the block as a variable.</p><p>– As the authors know, BOLD fMRI studies show robust attention effects in V1 that are much less evident in single-unit studies. This raises the point of how the effects of attention on individual neurons, and in brain areas, relate to the pooled fMRI signal. A similar point could be made here. Perhaps it's not that the effects are smaller across the hierarchy, but rather that the way they manifest across the hierarchy makes them less visible to the MRI signal? Certainly at least one neuromodulator that is thought to relate to arousal, norepinephrine, seems to be more strongly distributed to PFC than to sensory cortical areas (Foote and Morrison, Annual Review of Neurosci 1987, among many suitable papers to reference). I would suggest some discussion of this literature, and idea, as a caveat to this conclusion if it remains.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73018.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Burlingham and colleagues studied a number of individuals using fMRI while they performed an orientation discrimination task. In this task they were able to isolate a task-related response (TRR) in the fMRI BOLD signal, that was present in visual cortex in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulus, independent of other physiological variables such as respiration, and dependent on the difficulty of the task. They use a mathematical model to isolate the magnitude of the TRR on individual trials, and link it to shifts in arousal.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this work was clearly interesting to the field of fMRI researchers, and extends previous research by the authors and others showing what is contained in the TRR. In order to make this work suitable for publication in eLife and extend the reach of the work to those beyond this specialized field, the reviewers agreed that the authors would have to demonstrate two key points about the TRR:</p><p>1. Demonstrate convincingly that the TRR shown here, and its properties, are a new feature of the brain's activity that is being described and uncovered – i.e., that it could not simply be an artifact, either of signal due to retinal responses to the stimuli (due to eye movements in the scanner), connections to contralateral V1 which we know receives inputs from the stimuli, respiration, and maybe other things.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed each of these alternative explanations for TRRs and we are confident that the TRR is not a trivial artifact of any of these factors. Regarding respiration, we have addressed this on lines 59-64 and 81-87. See below for detailed replies about each of the other alternatives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Link the TRR and the work here convincingly to other literature and work outside the field of those studying TRR, to provide a computational or mechanistic interpretation of this phenomenon. For example, there are numerous studies of the pupil and arousal, neurovascular coupling and arousal, and broadly how arousal modulates neurons and behavior. Links between the TRRs observed here and that work would make its broad appeal clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially revised the discussion to link our findings with the broader literature, specifically focusing on possible computational and mechanistic interpretations of TRRs.

This localizer also allowed us to analyze portions of visual cortex that were not responsive to the visual stimulus. In the revision, we now report these results in the supplement section “Stimulus-evoked activity during the localizer” and the new SI Figure S4. The spatial profile of the stimulus-evoked activity was very different from the spatial profile of the TRR. Specifically, stimulus-evoked activity was concentrated at the retinotopic location of the stimulus, as expected, and the TRR was widespread throughout early visual cortex, even in the absence of a stimulus. Please also see Roth et al. 2020 (<italic>PLOS Biology</italic>), a related study that used the same stimulus and a similar task protocol, for additional analyses that address this same question. The issue of whether stimulus-evoked activity and TRRs interact is outside the scope of this work, and one would require an entirely different experimental protocol to properly address (e.g., see Cardoso et al., <italic>Nat.

For removing physiological artifacts from the TRR, we took the raw pulse oximeter and respiration belt signals and them convolved with an HRF (either cardiac HRF or respiratory HRF) that was at the same sampling rate, and only then down sampled the predicted physiologically-driven BOLD activity to the same sampling rate of the BOLD signal (0.67 Hz). Lowpass filtering with the HRF before down sampling avoids aliasing. So, the under correction scenario that the reviewer suggests is not an issue.

I don't see why the power should make it impossible to calculate the Easy I condition variability (Figure 5D), but give reliable estimates of the mean and SD for the Easy I condition. A quick power analysis here would be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added it. We forgot to include this in the Figure 5 caption (as had already been done for Figure 3). See the new caption for the mean and SEM of the temporal variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Was there a tone presented non lapse trials? If so, the logic of the lapse trials amplitude being bigger than response trials could be the same as the easy error trials having stronger responses than the correct trials: the participant is surprised and brought back to full attention to the task.</p></disp-quote><p>No tone was played on lapse trials. We now describe this on lines 623-628 of the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 139- add some indication of how the simulation was performed (presumably using the GLMM?)</p></disp-quote><p>Done. See lines 153-154.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It isn't clear why reaction time was not also addressed in the analysis of physiological data, as it was in the hemodynamic data. Some of the bigger effects in Figure 3 were for fast vs. slow RTs.</p></disp-quote><p>It is already well known that physiological measures of arousal like pupil size and heart rate covary with RT (see lines 327-329 and 364-385), but the detailed modeling work necessary to link each of these signals to arousal is outside the scope of this paper which focuses on the relationship between the TRR and behavioral performance. We are publishing a separate paper that explores this question, for pupil responses, in detail (Burlingham, Mirbagheri, and Heeger 2022).</p><p>We have changed Figure 3C-D, moved the original Figure 3C-D to the supplement (Figure S1), and added a disclaimer about the interpretation of that figure in the caption of Figure S1. We chose not to plot the physiological signals split by RTs in the main text to avoid confusion (see De Gee et al. 2014 and Denison et al. 2020 for further details about the appropriate model). Also see lines 618-622.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3c-d- it's initially confusing that the color scheme for fast/slow RT is the same as the correct/incorrect trials in 3b</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have moved Figure 3C-D to the supplement and updated the labelling / color scheme to make it clearer. See Figure S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3f-g- why are there no statistics demonstrating the significance of these results?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this out. Added here: lines 177-178 and 191-195.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3G legend: &quot;viability&quot; should be &quot;variability.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 167- an additional line providing details on how the circular standard deviation of the Fourier phase serves as a measure of temporal variability would provide clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>See lines 186-189 for the addition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 168- the authors imply that temporal precision was highest when arousal level was higher. Some brief discussion of this point in the Discussion section would be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added discussion of this finding on lines 457-460 of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 177 (pupil analysis)- although potentially outside the scope of this paper, it might be valuable to also assess microsaccade rate, which has been linked to arousal, in different task/performance conditions</p></disp-quote><p>We are publishing a separate paper about task-related pupil responses and micro-saccades (Burlingham, Mirbagheri, and Heeger 2022). We believe analysis of microsaccades and their relation to arousal to be outside of the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 189- it should be clearer that all the other physiologic metrics besides pupil were measured in the scanner simultaneously during the fMRI experiment</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this point on line 63.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4: For each physiologic metric, the authors are making multiple comparisons across task/performance conditions but don't discuss any statistical correction for multiple comparisons. Do the significant trends in this figure survive that correction?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed a correction for multiple comparisons and report the results at the end of the supplement. All of our conclusions are unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4: Was each metric (ex. heart rate, pupil) averaged over the whole trial or some smaller bin within the trial? This detail should be clearer in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The whole trial. We clarify this on lines 602-603.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the whole trial was used, could some of the pupil effect be related to the pupillary light reflex evoked by the stimulus flash?</p></disp-quote><p>The stimulus was a grating that was equiluminant with the grey background, so it doesn’t evoke a pupillary light reflex. See line 528.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, if a smaller bin near the feedback tone was used, this could provide a better estimate of the surprise-related arousal effect the authors mention.</p></disp-quote><p>The stimulus and feedback were close together in time (mean RT, 715 ms), so given the amount of time needed to reliably estimate the physiological metrics, this is not possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 290 -&gt; pupil dilation has been found to scale with many neuromodulatory (and other cortical and subcortical) systems (e.g. de Gee et al. 2017, Cazettes et al. 2021, Joshi); I find it too strong to equate pupil fluctuations with the LC-NE system.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We have modified the discussion on lines 358-362.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Global signal- if some aspect of the task-related response was present across cortex (consistent with a global arousal signature), then it might be present in the global signal, which was regressed out in this work because it also contains elements of physiologic processes. Potentially outside the scope of this work, but does this trial-to-trial analysis method find a similar TRR in the global signal?</p></disp-quote><p>No. We ran the same GLMM (with difficulty, accuracy, fMRI_TO, fMRI_BP, fMRI_TOT, their interactions, and the physiological signals as regressors), and ran the same coefficient tests (looking for modulations with accuracy and difficulty X accuracy). They were both non-significant (p &gt; 0.05). This is now reported in the supplement under the section “Global signal doesn’t show same dependence on task difficulty and behavioral performance that the TRR does.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Prior work on TRRs demonstrated &quot;ramp-like&quot; increases and decreases in hemodynamics over minutes between blocks of high and low reward conditions (Cardoso et al. 2019, PLOS). It would be interesting, although potentially outside the scope of this work, if the authors saw similar trends between easy and difficult task blocks or could model this effect in their GLMM by adding trial number within the block as a variable.</p></disp-quote><p>We also think this is an interesting and relevant finding of that study of TRRs in macaques. We’ve now discussed it here: lines 467-474.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike the optical imaging signal, the BOLD signal doesn’t have an interpretable baseline, i.e., DC component, so this isn’t advisable. There are a number of low frequency artifacts in the BOLD signal that prevent us from doing such analysis on the timescale of minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As the authors know, BOLD fMRI studies show robust attention effects in V1 that are much less evident in single-unit studies. This raises the point of how the effects of attention on individual neurons, and in brain areas, relate to the pooled fMRI signal. A similar point could be made here. Perhaps it's not that the effects are smaller across the hierarchy, but rather that the way they manifest across the hierarchy makes them less visible to the MRI signal? Certainly at least one neuromodulator that is thought to relate to arousal, norepinephrine, seems to be more strongly distributed to PFC than to sensory cortical areas (Foote and Morrison, Annual Review of Neurosci 1987, among many suitable papers to reference). I would suggest some discussion of this literature, and idea, as a caveat to this conclusion if it remains.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this idea. We agree that this is a possibility and have discussed this idea and cited this literature on lines 416-422.</p></body></sub-article></article>
