However, questions remain about CAR regulation under stress conditions. We show that Rgf1p (Rho1p GEF), participates in a delay of cytokinesis under cell wall stress (blankophor, BP). BP did not interfere with CAR assembly or the rate of CAR constriction, but did delay the onset of constriction in the wild type cells but not in the <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells. This delay was also abolished in the absence of Pmk1p, the MAPK of the cell integrity pathway (CIP), leading to premature abscission and a multi-septated phenotype. Moreover, cytokinesis delay correlates with maintained SIN signaling and depends on the SIN to be achieved. Thus, we propose that the CIP participates in a checkpoint, capable of triggering a CAR constriction delay through the SIN pathway to ensure that cytokinesis terminates successfully.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Rho1 GEF</kwd><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>actomyosin ring constriction</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>cell wall</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Regional Government of Castile and Leon</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The European Social Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edreira</surname><given-names>Tomás</given-names></name><name><surname>Manjón</surname><given-names>Elvira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Salamanca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Celador</surname><given-names>Rubén</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In fission yeast cell wall stress triggers a cytokinesis blockage specifically in the onset of actomyosin ring constriction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytokinesis in fission yeast, as in most eukaryotes, involves the function of a contractile ring of actin filaments and myosin-II (AR) placed between the poles of the mitotic spindle during cell division.

CAR dynamics is tightly regulated in space and time and can be divided into several steps including positioning, assembly, maintenance, constriction, and disassembly. Ring position is determined during interphase by a broad band of cortical cytokinetic precursor nodes localized around the equator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akamatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moseley et al., 2009</xref>). These nodes mature further at mitosis entry when the anillin Mid1p becomes activated by the polo kinase Plo1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almonacid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bähler et al., 1998</xref>), which initiates the recruitment of additional cytokinetic factors, including the IQGAP Rng2, Myosin II heavy and light chains (Myo2p, Cdc4p, and Rlc1p), the F-BAR protein Cdc15p and the formin Cdc12p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Padmanabhan et al., 2011</xref>). Upon mitotic entry, more Mid1p binds to the PM, anchoring ring proteins (and then the ring itself) to this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celton-Morizur et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sohrmann et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Ring assembly takes place between 10 and 15 min after SPB separation driven by interactions between actin filaments assembled by Cdc12p and Myo2p in adjacent nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vavylonis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wu et al., 2006</xref>). Once formed, the ring is maintained until the completion of anaphase in an interval known as maturation that lasts ~10 min until the onset of ring constriction. During maturation, the CAR does not change in size or shape, but many proteins are exchanged with others from the cytoplasmic pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pelham and Chang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>). Mid1p disappears, and new F-BAR proteins and partners (Imp2p, Pxl1p, Fic1p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2009</xref>), together with unconventional myosin-II (Myp2p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laplante et al., 2015</xref>) and the glucan synthase Bgs1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goss et al., 2014</xref>) join the ring.</p><p>Ring maintenance, constriction and septum formation depends on the septation initiation network (SIN). This network localizes to the SPB throughout the cell cycle, but also accumulates at the division site immediately prior to cytokinesis and is thought to transmit the signal to the CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goyal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Simanis, 2015</xref>). The SIN signal begins with the activity of the GTPase Spg1p and involves a regulatory GAP complex, several scaffolds and a linear cascade of three kinases (Cdc7p, Sid1p, and Sid2p), in order of their activation. Substrates of the Sid2p kinase are the phosphatase Clp1p/Flp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mishra et al., 2005</xref>), the formin Cdc12p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohnert and Gould, 2012</xref>), the SIN scaffold Cdc11p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feoktistova et al., 2012</xref>), the kinesin Klp2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mana-Capelli et al., 2012</xref>), the SAD kinase Cdr2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rincon et al., 2017</xref>), the anillin Mid1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Willet et al., 2019</xref>) and several others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grallert et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>). Overexpression of Rho GTPase Rho1p, its GEFs Rgf1p and Rgf3p, as well as inactivation of Rho1p GAPs, partially rescues the lethality of <italic>sid2</italic> mutants at a low-restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcaide-Gavilán et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these results, it has been proposed that the SIN activates Rho1p, which in turn activates the Bgs enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jin et al., 2006</xref>). However, the SIN target(s) involved in septum assembly remain unknown nowadays.</p><p>Both the SIN activity and the CAR are required for septum biosynthesis and the septum in turn contributes to CAR stabilization and constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">García Cortés et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Proctor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Thiyagarajan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Willet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). As the CAR constricts at a constant rate, the PM ingresses from the cell surface at the medial division site, with the extracellular cell wall just outside the PM, and the contractile ring attached to the membrane on the cytoplasmic side. Thus, septum biosynthesis is coupled to CAR constriction in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">García Cortés et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roncero and Sánchez, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Rho GTPases are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and their role in cytokinesis has been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glotzer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yoshida et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, local activation of Rho GTPases at the cleavage furrow promotes contractile ring formation in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner and Glotzer, 2016</xref>) and activates formins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, and metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kühn and Geyer, 2014</xref>).

Rho1p is involved in regulation of the septum cell wall, but it has not yet been determined whether Rho1p plays a role in the early steps of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">García Cortés et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Fission yeast Rho1p is a functional homologue of human RhoAp and budding yeast Rho1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nakano et al., 1997</xref>). Rho1p-GTP binds and activates the protein kinases of the PKC family, Pck1p, and Pck2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pérez and Rincón, 2010b</xref>), which function upstream of the MAPK module (Mkh1p, Skh1p/Pek1p, and Pmk1p/Spm1p) of the cell integrity signaling pathway (CIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">García et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sánchez-Mir et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Viana et al., 2013</xref>). Rho1p is activated by three guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), Rgf1p, Rgf2p and Rgf3p, that catalyze the exchange from GDP to GTP, rendering the GTPase in an active state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">García et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrell-Falvey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mutoh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tajadura et al., 2004</xref>). Rgf1p and Rgf2p localize to the septum area, however, to date there is no evidence of their involvement in cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">García et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">G Cortés et al., 2018</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">García et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrell-Falvey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mutoh et al., 2005</xref>).

Rgf1p is required for the actin reorganization necessary for cells to change from monopolar to bipolar growth during NETO (New End Take Off) and activates the β–(1, 3) glucan synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">García et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">García et al., 2006b</xref>). Rgf1p shuttles in and out of the nucleus in interphase, and is accumulated within the cell nucleus in response to replicative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Muñoz et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we investigate the role of Rgf1p and Rho1p in cytokinesis and show that stress affecting cell wall integrity prevents the completion of cytokinesis on time. This inhibition depends on a signaling pathway that involves the Rho1p GEF, Rgf1p, the Rho-GTPase, Rho1p, the ScPkc1p orthologue Pck2p, and the MAP kinase Pmk1p, all components of the cell integrity pathway (CIP). Inactivation of this pathway in stressed cells causes defects in septation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sengar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Toda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zaitsevskaya-Carter and Cooper, 1997</xref>). Thus, we propose that the CIP signaling delays CAR constriction in response to cell wall perturbations to ensure that cytokinesis reaches completion only after the cell has adjusted to the new conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rgf1p localizes to the contractile acto-myosin ring (CAR) and interacts with CAR components</title><p>As described previously, Rgf1p accumulates at actively growing tips during interphase and re-localizes to a central ring during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">García et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrell-Falvey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mutoh et al., 2005</xref>).

To visualize septum formation, cells were treated with blankophor (BP), which is a fluorescent dye that specifically binds to linear β−1,3-glucan at the primary septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cortés et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the addition of BP onto wild-type cells caused a delay in the process of cytokinesis (mean value of 59.7 ± 6.7 min, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). However, in the <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells cytokinesis lasted on average 48.1 ± 6.5 min, a duration which is more similar to the one recorded in the absence of BP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Then, we performed a titration experiment to determine the time of cytokinesis in wild-type cells treated with different concentrations of BP. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, BP caused a dose-effect type delay during our 2 hr movies at 28°C. Thus, for the rest of the experiments we used 5 µg/ml of BP to induce cytokinesis delay. To further test the effect of BP, we used another combination of markers, Rlc1p-tdTom and Atb2p-GFP (encoding α2-tubulin that marks microtubules) in <italic>rgf1</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells. As above, cytokinesis, measured from spindle formation until Rlc1p-tdTom signal closure at the cell equator, lasted longer in the wild-type cells than in <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells treated with BP (n = 15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions (the presence of BP), CAR contraction was completely blocked (rings did not initiate constriction at any time within the duration of the experiments) in 11 of the 61 wild-type cells examined.

Defects in these linkages would result in a failure to draw in the PM and a concomitant delay in cytokinesis. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, proteins like Cdc15p may contribute to the onset of this type of bridging function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Roberts-Galbraith et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, Cdc15p promotes the accumulation of glucan synthase (GS) Bgs1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arasada and Pollard, 2014</xref>), which also contributes to productive ingression. As mentioned above, BP binds to cell wall linear β−1,3-glucan and also interferes with its biosynthesis. Thus, we determined membrane progression and cell wall synthesis during BP treatment. Membrane ingression was followed in cells expressing the LactC2p–GFP fusion protein, which binds to phosphatidylserine at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>). In the absence of BP, the membrane began to ingress ~3 min after spindle breakdown (the moment when the two SPBs with maximum distance began to move toward one another). However, in cells treated with BP, ingression started ~18 min after spindle breakdown, a similar delay as the one detected in CAR constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top panel). Furthermore, ingression was not delayed in <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells treated with BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, lower panel). Thus, BP does not interfere with the linkage between the CAR and the membrane, but temporally inhibits membrane ingression coupled to CAR constriction in wild-type cells.</p><p>Interestingly, the BP signal concentrates at the cell equator forming a ring.

In the wild-type cells, the initial septum was maintained as a ring that did not progress toward the interior until further on. In <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells, the septum progressed more quickly causing the cells to separate earlier than the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This event can be clearly seen in the kymographs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. From their analysis, it was also inferred that the blockage experienced by wild-type cells, did not halted septum synthesis. This is shown by the fact that BP signal intensity near the cortex increased over time until the onset of constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In sum, fluorescence microscopy showed that ingression of the ring (Imp2p-GFP), the PM and the stained septum are blocked during anaphase in wild-type cells treated with BP, and that this effect is much less apparent in the <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells. These results indicate that wild-type cells respond to cell wall stress with a delay in membrane ingression and septum progression and that Rgf1p is involved in this novel pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Rgf1p delays the onset of ring constriction in cell-wall-stressed cells</title><p>To pinpoint the role of Rgf1p in ring constriction, we followed the behavior of the contractile ring through the time-lapse analysis of <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ and <italic>rgf1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells expressing mEGFP-Myo2p/Sid4p-RFP, in the presence or absence of BP (5 µg/ml). We analyzed three different stages of the contractile ring progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>): CAR assembly (time taken by the mEGFP-Myo2p nodes to coalesce into a ring with homogeneous fluorescence); CAR maturation (the interval between completion of contractile ring assembly and the onset of ring constriction); and CAR constriction (time between CAR diameter shrinkage and the complete closure of the ring). All statistical data are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. It was determined that the wild-type cells complete ring assembly within +18 min and +24 min, with a mean completion time of +21.1 ± 2.1 min (mean ± SD) in the absence of BP and 18.6 ± 2.9 in the presence of BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

Next, we followed contractile ring constriction in wild type and <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ individual cells marked with Imp2p-GFP/Sad1p-GFP in the presence of BP. In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ren et al., 2015</xref>), Imp2p localizes to the CAR approximately 15 min after SPB separation, in both, wild type and <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells treated with BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). We measured the ring diameter over time in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and these plots were used to quantify the onset and rates of ring constriction. The initial rings of Imp2p-GFP of wild type and <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ cells were similar in diameter (wild type: 3.56, <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ: 3.32 µm) and constricted at a similar rate,~0.15 µm/min. As pointed out above, the mean time for the onset of wild-type ring constriction after SPB separation was +37.9 ± 5.0 min, whereas rings lacking Rgf1p constricted at the cell-cycle time of +25.1 ± 3.6 min,~13 min earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, the presence of BP delayed the onset of constriction beyond the usual time set by the cell-cycle clock. However, the absence of Rgf1p allowed apparently normal ring constriction in BP stressed cells to take place.

The Rho GTPases, Rho1p and Rho2p, as well as some of its regulators (Rgf1p, Rga4p) and effectors (the protein kinase C PKC orthologues Pck1p and Pck2p) channel different stresses to the MAPK module. However, it is still not well understood which set of components participate in response to each of the initial triggering events. The Rho2p–Pck2p branch is fully responsible for MAPK activation in response to hyper- and hypo-osmotic stresses and both Rho1p and Rho2p target Pck2p for signaling cell wall damage to the CIP. However, the Pmk1p activation observed during cell separation or after treatment with hydrogen peroxide did not involve Rho2p–Pck2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Madrid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sánchez-Mir et al., 2014b</xref>).

To this end, KCl (0.6M) was added to the medium to change the osmotic conditions during the time-lapse experiments. In the set-up, the cells shrank, the ring faded and growth temporarily ceased until turgor pressure had adapted (not shown) to the new environment. Under milder conditions, involving less KCl in the medium (0.2M), we did see a transient delay in cytokinesis (&gt;15 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), which was independent on the presence of Rgf1p but dependent on Pmk1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Although this does not satisfactorily explain the reason for this difference, it could be possible that the other branch of the route, led by Rho2p, accounts for signal transduction under very mild changes in turgor pressure. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Proctor et al., 2012</xref>, have shown that the differential osmotic pressure inside and outside the cell contribute to septum ingression. In these conditions, the phenotype inherent to the mutants (<italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ) and the changes in the turgor pressure imposed by KCl, may explain the different observed behavior. Taken together, the data indicates that in response to mechanical stress, such as a deformed cell wall or stretching of the PM, the CIP temporally blocks CAR constriction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Mild cell wall stress conditions induce cell separation defects in <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ mutant</title><p>MAPK signaling pathways play a key role in eukaryotes to elicit proper adaptive responses to changes in the surrounding or adverse conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pérez and Cansado, 2010a</xref>). Thus, we investigated the physiological consequences resulting from a compromised Pmk1p function in the presence of mild stress conditions (5 µg/ml BP, 0,6M KCl, 8 mM Caf); that is, similar conditions that induce an inhibition of CAR constriction in wild-type cells. In agreement with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Toda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zaitsevskaya-Carter and Cooper, 1997</xref>), the <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ cells were often shorter and rounder than wild-type cells and sometimes multiseptated cells (2%) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

These cells showed a considerable cytokinesis delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sladewski et al., 2009</xref>), which was aggravated in the presence of BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, the peaked level of Cdc7p dropped after ~30 min in the untreated cells and was maintained at the new SPB for prolonged periods (up to 45 min) in the wild-type cells treated with BP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> right and left panels).

These results strongly suggest: (1) that the delay in constriction induced by cell wall stress is not the consequence of low SIN activity, but instead correlates with a prolonged signal; and (2) that Rgf1p and the CIP may function to extend the duration of SIN signaling upon cell wall perturbations, thereby providing an improved opportunity to constrict the ring properly.</p><p>Following on, we asked whether the SIN pathway was required to achieve the cytokinesis delay induced after cell wall stress.

Here, we show that cell wall damage inflicted during cytokinesis triggers a checkpoint-like response, promoting a delay right before CAR constriction. Sensors relay the signal to the small GTPase Rho1p, triggering phosphorylation events through the cell integrity pathway (CIP). Consequently, inactivation of pathway components by mutations leave the damage signal unchecked during cytokinesis, which results in premature CAR constriction and leads to the failure of cell cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we addressed the question of whether Rgf1p and Rho1p play a role in cytokinesis in addition to their function in septum synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pérez et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed and extended previous observations showing that Rgf1p localizes to the proximity of the assembled ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">García et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mutoh et al., 2005</xref>); the protein follows the advancing septum edge leaving behind a trail as division proceeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This localization differs from that of Rgf3p, which forms a ring that disappears at the end of CAR constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morrell-Falvey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mutoh et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting a role for Rgf1p in the furrow ingression step. Rgf1p localizes to the assembled ring before the septum is perceived. Interestingly, we found that Rgf1p controls the onset of ring constriction under cell wall stress (Blankophor 5 µg/ml), but does not affect CAR dynamics in unperturbed growth conditions. This is probably the reason why Rgf1p function in cytokinesis has been ignored for such a long time. Moreover, the requirement of Rgf1p to delay CAR constriction is due to the activation of Rho1p, as both the <italic>rgf1-PTTR</italic> and <italic>rho1-596</italic> mutants exhibited a lack of ability to delay cytokinesis similar to that of the <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ mutant.</p><p>Our work has also built upon what is already known about the contribution of cell wall synthesis to cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Proctor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). A recent idea in the field of cytokinesis is that, for walled eukaryotes such as <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the dominant factor determining the rate of ring constriction is not the amount of tension that can be generated in the contractile ring, but rather the rate of synthesis of new cell wall material used to generate the invaginating furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheffings et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Proctor et al., 2012</xref>). We have shown that treatments that disorganize the cell wall (BP) and delay septum progression also delay CAR constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This impact is considered significant, as 15% of the cells with assembled rings never go on to complete ring closure; the rest (~85%) show a delay of 12–15 min as compared to the untreated cells. Moreover, cell wall stress influences the onset of CAR constriction, but does not interfere with CAR assembly or the rate of CAR constriction. It is possible that in the temporary absence of a cell wall headway the CAR provides insufficient force to be closed. If BP reduces the force generated by the septum, then the cells could experience an imbalance in force production between the CAR and the septum and the CAR might need to provide additional force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Proctor et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, a regulatory pathway may couple constriction of the CAR and septum formation such that a defect in septum formation could prevent the constriction of the CAR. Some of these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. We have shown that cell wall stress (inflicted by BP) generates a delay of approximately 15 min in CAR constriction, and this has a direct impact on cell separation. Moreover, mutants in Rgf1p, Rho1p, Pck2p, upstream regulators, and Pmk1p, the MAP kinase of the cell integrity pathway, do not exhibit a delay in cytokinesis followed by mild cell wall stress. Other sorts of cell wall damage, such as that caused by a point mutant in the main β-GS, also lead to a delay in cytokinesis that is sensed by the CIP. In addition, mild treatments with antifungal agents like caspofungin and caffeine also behaved similarly.</p><p>Time is important. Although, it is known for a long time that the MAP kinase Pmk1p becomes activated ‘within minutes’ by cell wall stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madrid et al., 2007</xref>), it is still unclear how the CIP integrates this stress input with successful cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bähler, 2005</xref>). A quick response is required when the cell’s genome has already split and the cell becomes ready to separate its cytoplasm. Cell wall sensors/transducers detect the perturbation in the septum as it starts to form and activate Pmk1p to block cytokinesis progression under the situation of a deficient septum. The pathway can be equally impacted by modulating the phosphatase Pmp1p, which removes the activating phosphorylation on Pmk1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sugiura et al., 1998</xref>). In the case that the checkpoint is overridden, some septa could be poorly built up. In that sense it is known that conditions of nutrient limitation, hypertonic stress or caffeine, prompt <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ cells to grow as short-branched filaments in which the cell walls and septa are thickened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zaitsevskaya-Carter and Cooper, 1997</xref>). At the same time, Pmk1p might induce the expression of genes that function to replace the damaged wall and restart cytokinesis even under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Takada et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We considered how Pmk1p is able to accomplish CAR regulation after cell wall stress. The coordination mechanism may involve proteins that are physical components of the ring or regulatory proteins that may link the pathways together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheffings et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pollard, 2017</xref>). In this sense, we have shown that defects in formin and myosin II, that are force-generating components of the CAR, show a delay in CAR maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laplante et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lord et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stachowiak et al., 2014</xref>), which was additive to the delay observed during cell wall stress. However, a mutation in the SIN kinase Sid2p was refractory to the delay caused by cell wall stress, indicating that the CIP may act by promoting the maintenance of SIN activity. There is a much evidence that reinforces this premise. First, cell wall stress correlates with a prolonged SIN signal, where Cdc7p remains on the new SPB for more time and the cytoplasmic retention time for Clp1p is longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). This does not occur in the <italic>rgf1</italic>∆ and <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ (not shown) mutants were the SIN signal is deactivated earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>); these mutants behave like wild-type cells in the absence of cell wall damage. Second, cell wall damage makes contractile rings more stable, where they become less vulnerable to mild perturbations of the actin cytoskeleton. Given that Sid2p is required for CAR maintenance when the cytokinesis checkpoint is active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcaide-Gavilán et al., 2014</xref>), it is very likely that the prolonged SIN activity serves to maintain the CAR in a competent state to achieve constriction safely. Third, SIN mutants grown at high temperature block the cell wall stress signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In these conditions, the rings are not maintained owing to a deficient SIN that is incapable of stabilizing them.</p><p>Cytokinetic furrow ingression requires both the actomyosin ring constriction and septum formation. Since one process cannot progress without the other, at least initially, cytokinesis can potentially be arrested through the blockage of either of these two components. There are two reasons that favor the proposal of a blocking model that operates through a halt in the onset of ring constriction. First, septum formation, measured as the increase of BP intake, is not stopped but increases linearly over time even without any trace of ring constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>); and second, the CAR becomes stabilized in a SIN-dependent manner after cell wall stress. In this study, we also address how this system is able to block cytokinesis when the ring is already formed, especially considering the onset of ring constriction is one of the least understood aspects of cytokinesis. Although ring constriction usually coincides with full SIN activation, we have shown a situation where the SIN is kept transiently active and the onset of constriction correlates with SIN inactivation. Similar to the cytokinesis checkpoint, Sid2p may well be blocking the onset of ring constriction by its stabilization under cell wall stress, even with a competent GS.</p><p>In animal cells, RhoA and RhoGEF Ect2p are key players in cytokinesis. Active Rho A around the equator regulates formins that polymerize actin filaments and kinases that activate myosin-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner and Glotzer, 2016</xref>). In addition, RhoA has a role as a negative regulator of the hippo pathway (the SIN counterpart in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Plouffe et al., 2016</xref>). When deleted RHOA, LATS1/2 (Sid2p counterpart in mammals), and YAP/TAZ (the transcription factor downstream) remained highly phosphorylated; the latest is sequestered in the cytoplasm, and is maintained transcriptionally inactive, even in the presence of serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Plouffe et al., 2016</xref>). According to that, our work in <italic>S. pombe</italic> indicates that Rho1p controls the SIN to achieve ring constriction properly under cell wall stress. Understanding the relationship between Rho1p and the SIN pathway in yeasts would be helpful to grasps how RhoA and the Hippo pathway interact in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-phospho-p42/44 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cat#: 9101, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_331646">AB_331646</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:2500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HA (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Roche</td><td>Cat# 11666606001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514506">AB_514506</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HRP anti-mouse (Goat polyclonal)</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat#: 170–6516, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11125547">AB_11125547</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HRP anti-rabbit (Goat polyclonal)</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat#: 170–5046, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11125757">AB_11125757</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:15000)</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Blankophor</td><td>Bayer</td><td>Blankophor BA 267%</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>KCl</td><td>Merck</td><td>Cat#: 104936</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Caffeine</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#: W222402</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Caspofungin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#: SML0425</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Latrunculin A</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#: L5163</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Hydroxyurea</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#: H8627</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Soybean lectin</td><td>Sigma Aldrich</td><td>Cat#: L2650</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay, kit</td><td>Ni-NTA</td><td>Novagen</td><td>Cat#: 70666</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com/">GraphPad Prism</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com">https://graphpad.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">ImageJ</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>μ-Slide eight well</td><td>Ibidi</td><td>Cat#: 80826</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>General yeast growth conditions and genetic methods</title><p>Standard <italic>S. pombe</italic> genetic procedures and media were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forsburg and Rhind, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreno et al., 1991</xref>).

Early logarithmic phase cell cultures grown at 25°C were shifted to 36°C for 3 hr. Approximately 100 µl of cells were collected by a short spin, dissolved in 5 µl of water and Calfofluor white (Blankophor BA 267%, Bayer) was added at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml. Then, 10 slices at 0.2 µm were taken, corrected by 3D Deconvolution (conservative ratio, 10 iterations and medium noise filtering) with softWoRx software (GE Healthcare), and processed with Fiji distribution of Image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Super-resolution images were obtained using an Olympus IXplore SpinSR SoRa confocal Spinning disk microscope (Olympus), composed by the microscope Olympus IX83 (Olympus), U Plan Super Apochromatic 100x/1.45 oil immersion objective and sCMOS ORCA Flash 4.0 V3 camera (Hamamatsu).</p><p>Time-lapse imaging was carried out separately on two different microscopes: the previously described DeltaVision system and an Olympus IX81 spinning disk microscope (Olympus) equipped with a PlanApo 100x/1.40 oil immersion objective, a confocal CSUX1-A1 module (Yokogawa), and an Evolve (Photometrics) camera controlled by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). One ml of midlog-phase cell cultures was collected by centrifugation (3500 g, 1 min) resuspended in 0.3 ml of YES containing the respective drugs and placed in a well of a µ-Slide eight well (Ibidi). Each of the wells was previously coated with 5 µl of 1 mg/ml soybean lectin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were allowed to adhere to the bottom of the well for 2 min before removing the media. Then the cells were washed three times with media and resuspended in 0.3 ml of the same media. Time-lapse experiments were performed at 28°C. For imaging the temperature-sensitive strains at higher temperatures, the cells were shifted from 25°C to the described temperature and incubated for 1 hr prior to imaging. Using the DeltaVision system, 7 slices at 0.6 µm were taken every 3 min within up to three different regions. With the spinning disk, 10 slices at 0.4 µm were taken every 3 min in up to four regions in each of the four different wells.</p><p>In all time-lapse series, we used the SPB separation as time zero of the cellular clock. We define cytokinesis completion time as the time between the SPB separation and the complete closure of the AR. The time of the three stages of the CAR ring are defined as follows: assembly, from the appearance of nodes until there is a uniform ring signal; maturation, from a uniform ring signal to the start of its change in diameter; and constriction, from the first diameter change to its complete closure as a single point.</p><p>Total fluorescence of Cdc7p-GFP over time was measured using the sum projection of the slices taken in the spinning disk system. An area empty of cells was used to determine the average background fluorescence that was subtracted from the images. We used Sad1p-DsRed signal as a marker of both SPBs to select them with a 5-pixel diameter circle (0.37 µm<sup>2</sup>), and we measured the total intensity of the green channel in these regions. Clp1-GFP nuclear intensity over time was measured using the sum projection of the slices taken in the DeltaVision system. An area empty of cells was used to determine the average background fluorescence that was subtracted from the images. Then, Sid4p-GFP was used as a marker of the SPBs to locate the nucleus, encircling it within a 42-pixel diameter circle (6.14 µm<sup>2</sup>), which contained Sid4p in its periphery. The total intensity of the green channel in these regions was subsequently measured. The data were normalized according to their maximum and minimum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Purification and detection of activated Pmk1</title><p>Cells from 30 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, 500 g for 3 min, washed with cold PBS buffer, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

The purified proteins were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and incubated with either monoclonal mouse anti-HA (12CA5, Roche) or polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-p42/44 antibodies (Cell Signaling). The immunoreactive bands were revealed with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot of synchronized cell cultures</title><p>Early-log phase cultures of cells containing Cdc15-HA were synchronized in S phase using hydroxyurea (HU) at a final concentration of 12.5 mM. After 4 hr of growth at 32°C HU was washed out and the cell cultures were released at 28°C, treated or untreated with BP (1 mg/ml). Samples were collected every 30 min after the first hour. 10 ml of cultures were mixed with 40 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7. Cells were immediately harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, 500 g for 3 min and frozen at –80°C in 100 ml of 20% TCA. Protein extracts were obtained by TCA precipitation. Proteins were resolved with 7% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-HA antibodies (12CA5, Roche) and revealed with anti-mouse HRP secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank Cesar Roncero and Henar Valdivieso for their support and our colleges from the Cell Wall group of the Institute of Functional Biology and Genomics at the University Salamanca.

of the cytokinetic actomyosin ring and how the initiation step is regulated to ensure maximum cell viability. In particular, the authors find that cell wall stress causes a delay in actomyosin ring contraction and this delay is dependent on the kinase Pmk1 and GTPase signaling pathways. The work combines some excellent microscopy of the cytokinetic apparatus in cell wall stressed wild-type and pmk1 or rgf1 mutants in a variety of conditions to unveil a new regulatory network regulating genome stability and cell viability.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A novel checkpoint pathway controls actomyosin ring constriction trigger in fission yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Masayuki Onishi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers and the editors agreed that your work is breaking new ground into understanding the mechanism of the septation checkpoint and the unexpected links of the BP induced ring contraction delay to the Pmk1 pathway and the Rho-GTPase pathways. The reviewers also found that a few additional experiments will strengthen the work before publication.</p><p>Below I have summarized the essential revisions for this work. I have also included the reviewer comments verbatim, since they contain a large number of excellent suggestions to carry the work forward in future studies.</p><p>1) rgf1∆ pmk1∆ double mutants. I think it is critical that you repeat (at the very least) the experiments in Figure 4 in this double-mutant background.</p><p>2) A concern of two reviewers centers around the question of the reason and validity of using Imp2 as the marker for CAR in rfg1∆ cells. This point clearly needs to be addressed.</p><p>3) Two reviewers raised a question about the band-shift data. This clearly needs to be addressed.</p><p>4) Two reviewers (reviewer 3 point 1 and reviewer 2 point 7) raise a concern about the putative connection between the CIP and septum structure / cell separation defects. It will be terrific if it was possible to carry out some EM work of the septum architecture (you may already have the data as well). In the absence of this the Discussion should be more hypothetical and balanced.</p><p>5) Reviewer 1 raised a question about Mid1 localization (point 3). This should be done as it strengthens the main point of this manuscript that the CIP delays the onset of CAR constriction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The findings and conclusions in the paper (Edreira et al.,) are very well supported by the experiments. Overall, this paper uses a range of techniques (live cell imaging, genetics and biochemistry) to elegantly elucidate how cell wall integrity pathway halts cytokinesis upon cell stress through SIN pathway. It is an interesting paper, clearly written and largely convincing. The authors should hence address the following major points to improve the manuscript prior to acceptance. This will improve the rigor of the work. Of course, there may be constraints due to the covid19 situation that prevent many experiments.</p><p>1) The authors should look at the localisation (ring proteins are also carrying membrane anchoring domains) of Sbg1 (Sethi et al., 2016; Davidson et al., 2016) and Blt1 in wild type and ∆rgf1 cells with and without BP.</p><p>2) The authors should look at various ring localising proteins (relevant to assembly and constriction) in ∆rgf1 mutants with and without BP.</p><p>3) Anilin like protein Mid1 leaves the ring prior to ring constriction.</p><p>The authors should look at mid1 localisation (disappearance from the ring) during the onset of ring constriction in wild type and ∆rgf1 cells with and without BP and check if mid1 stays longer or leaves the ring earlier in comparison to WT cells.</p><p>4) Is there any specific reason why the authors have used Imp2-GFP as a ring marker and not a conventional marker (rlc1 or myo2)? Is it due to genetic interactions of ring markers with ∆rgf1 cells ?</p><p>5) The authors should test the Rlc1-S35A and S36A mutants and/or shk1 mutants (Loo et al., JCB 2010) to see the constriction timings in combination with ∆rgf1 in the presence and absence of BP.</p><p>6) Did the authors look at the polarisome components upon BP treatment in ∆rgf1 background cells. Polarity kinases (pom1) phosphorylates some of the key components of the rings (i.e Cdc15)</p><p>7) Are there any direct interaction of SIN components with Rgf1 at the cell division site?</p><p>8) Upon Cell wall damage/stress the rings seems to be more stable, did the authors look at the dynamics of actin bundling proteins (i.e alpha actinin) at the cell division site using the same conditions as above.</p><p>9) The Authors should provide some evidence or discuss how Rho1 could possibly control SIN activation via Sid2 kinase activity.</p><p>Is there any downstream components of Rho1 pathway controlling timely activation of SIN via Sid2/Mob1?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors found that fission yeast cells delay onset of cytokinetic ring constriction upon cell wall defects. The impact of this study is high because the authors define two signaling pathways that appear to mediate this novel checkpoint response. By defining the pathways, the authors demonstrate that the checkpoint delay occurs due to a regulatable response. The authors have not identified the “sensor” for the checkpoint, and several connections within the signaling pathways remain unknown. However, these limitations are offset by the large amount of interesting data that establish this new checkpoint and set the framework to understand the underlying signaling mechanisms. The two signaling pathways (MAPK and SIN) that relay this signal are conserved in other organisms, so similar mechanisms might operate broadly in similar or related ways even in cell types that do not have a cell wall.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that addition of BP delays onset of CAR constriction. This result is important for interpretation of past studies that have used BP (or CW) to monitor the timing of cytokinesis events (e.g. Cortes et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2019). The authors might discuss the implication of their results for past studies.</p><p>2) It is unclear to me if BP-treated cells detect a defect in the cell wall organization, or alternatively if they experience an imbalance in force production between the CAR and septum. If force generation by the septum is reduced by BP, then the CAR might need to provide additional force. I don't see any data in the paper that make a strong argument for one possibility versus the other. I don't think that the authors need to resolve this question in the current study, but they might alter their interpretations to include the possibility that Pmk1-SIN signaling delays CAR constriction so that the CAR can recruit additional force-generating machinery.</p><p>3) The mechanism connecting activated Pmk1 with SIN signaling remains unknown. At first glance, the timing of this checkpoint suggests that it operates too rapidly to involve changes gene expression. Instead, it seems possible that Pmk1 phosphorylates component(s) of the SIN pathway. Have the authors looked for Pmk1 consensus sites in SIN proteins, or have any SIN components been identified at Pmk1 targets? Some additional consideration of the underlying mechanism would strengthen the framework for future studies.</p><p>4) Some additional analysis of double mutants would strengthen the conclusions regarding the pathway that signals to Pmk1. For example in Figure 4, I expected to see the phenotype for pmk1∆ rgf1∆ double mutants, with the prediction that they do not exhibit an additive phenotype on the checkpoint.</p><p>5) The authors' experiments build a signaling pathway that leads to activating phosphorylation of Pmk1, but the pathway can be equally impacted by modulating the phosphatase Pmp1, which removes the activating phosphorylation on Pmk1. It does not seem essential for the authors to test the identity or regulation of CIP phosphatases, but they should discuss potential regulatory mechanisms in the text. It seems possible that BP or other stresses might reduce Pmp1 activity, which would facilitate increased activating phosphorylation of Pmk1 by lowering the inhibitory threshold.</p><p>6) Figure 5B could be improved by adding more labels to distinguish WT versus pmk1∆ data.</p><p>7) The connection between the checkpoint pathway and the septum defect in Figure 5 remains murky. The authors suggest that the checkpoint induces &quot;the quality control machinery for septum assembly and/or disassembly.&quot; I am not aware of evidence that these cells build &quot;a defective septum that was difficult to digest by the glucanases.&quot; This speculation is consistent with their data but should be phrased much more hypothetically.</p><p>8) From experiments combining myp2∆ with BP, the authors conclude that &quot;there could be a synergy between the cell wall stress and Myp2 motor action.&quot; I recommend that the authors reword this interpretation to explain that Myp2 and BP act independently on the timing of cytokinesis, as shown by the additive defect of myp2∆ and BP.</p><p>9) The authors conclude that the CAR is more stable upon BP treatment based on low-dose LatA experiments. A more direct test of CAR stability would be the timing of disassembly upon high-dose LatA treatment. The two tests (high and low dose) are complementary and would provide a stronger result in combination. The low-dose experiment sets up a competition between CAR and other actin structures, as opposed to directly testing how quickly the CAR actin turns over.</p><p>10) I do not find the band shift experiments in Figure 6E convincing. One possibility is to run all of the 120 timepoint samples next to each other. As presented, the subtle band shift leaves comparison of different samples quite challenging. This figure also needs a phosphatase-treated control to establish the amount of band shift in the authors' system.</p><p>11) The authors use fixed timepoint microscopy in Figure 7A to conclude that &quot;ring disassembly dynamics was similar in the presence of absence of BP&quot; for sid2-250 mutants. It seems important to perform timelapse imaging and to measure disassembly dyamics for individual rings, if the authors want to draw this conclusion.</p><p>12) Figure 7B provides a very convincing quantification of Cdc7 dynamic localization at SPBs. I would recommend that the authors present a similar graph for the data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The Rho-GTPase pathway has been implicated in cytokinesis with roles in regulation of the contractile actomyosin ring (CAR), cell-wall synthesis (in budding and fission yeasts), and other signaling pathways. In this paper, the authors showed that the Rho1 GEF Rfg1 localizes in the region following the contractile ring during cell division, in a CAR-dependent manner. Interestingly, the authors found that treatment of cells with the BP dye that specifically binds to linear 1,3-β-glucan delays cytokinesis in WT, but not in rfg1∆ cells. The delay was largely in the timing of onset of CAR constriction and concomitant ingression of plasma membrane, rather than the rate of constriction/ingression. Based on these results, the authors hypothesize that Rfg1 is involved in a mechanism that senses cell-wall perturbation and delays the onset of cytokinesis. Because Rfg1 has previously been implicated in the cell-wall integrity pathway (CIP), the authors tested the requirement of known CIP components for BP-responsive cytokinesis delay, and identified Rho1p, Pck2p, and Pmk1p as downstream factors of Rfg1p in this response. pmk1∆ cells show significant increase in septation index upon BP treatment, which the authors conclude to be a consequence of failure to delay cytokinesis onset. The delay in the onset of cytokinesis correlated with prolonged cytoplasmic retention of the Clp1 phosphatase and dephosphorylation of its substrate Cdc15. Finally, the delay in cytokinesis onset requires normal SIN activity, implicating the pathway in this process.</p><p>Contribution of cell wall to cytokinesis has been clearly demonstrated in both fission yeast and budding yeast, yet its regulation and coordination with the CAR pathway has not been fully established. This paper provides a new insight into the ability of the cells of <italic>S. pombe</italic> in controlling CAR constriction, septum synthesis, and membrane ingression in response to perturbation to cell-wall synthesis. Most of the experiments are performed carefully and data are clearly presented, which are of interest to the readers in the field.</p><p>1) While the manuscript clearly demonstrates the cell's ability to respond to cell-wall perturbation that involves delayed onset of CAR constriction and septum synthesis, the biological significance of this observation is unclear. How did <italic>S. pombe</italic> evolve to have this adaptation pathway, and what is the consequence of a defect in it? Although the authors conclude that the observed separation defect is a consequence of the failure to delay cytokinesis onset, the causality between the two phenotypes does not seem to be fully established. The separation defect could be a separate consequence of the defective CIP under cell-wall stress, such as through some defects in the secretory pathway, that is independent of the delayed cytokinesis onset. Do any of the other CIP pathway mutants show separation defects, and if they do, is there a good correlation between the timing of Imp2 constriction (Figure 4) and separation defects? Do mutations in myp2 etc. that delay the onset of constriction also rescue the separation defect in pmk1∆? Can the authors speculate as to whether the cell-separation defect causes a severe morphological or ecological disadvantage that explains the evolution of this response pathway?</p><p>2) In many figures, rgf1∆ and pmk1∆ are used interchangeably to test the role of the proposed pathway in delaying cytokinesis onset. While this is consistent with the previously established CIP pathway, in which Rgf1 and Pmk1 are positioned at the most upstream and downstream (Figure 4B), it is possible that the two proteins function independently in separate or partially overlapping pathways leading to cytokinesis delay in BP-treated cells. Thus, the authors should at least establish that rgf1∆ and pmk1∆ mutations do not have any additive effects in the BP response, and ideally repeat some key experiments in both mutant backgrounds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59333.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below I have summarized the essential revisions for this work.

The impact of this study is high because the authors define two signaling pathways that appear to mediate this novel checkpoint response. By defining the pathways, the authors demonstrate that the checkpoint delay occurs due to a regulatable response. The authors have not identified the “sensor” for the checkpoint, and several connections within the signaling pathways remain unknown. However, these limitations are offset by the large amount of interesting data that establish this new checkpoint and set the framework to understand the underlying signaling mechanisms. The two signaling pathways (MAPK and SIN) that relay this signal are conserved in other organisms, so similar mechanisms might operate broadly in similar or related ways even in cell types that do not have a cell wall.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate that addition of BP delays onset of CAR constriction. This result is important for interpretation of past studies that have used BP (or CW) to monitor the timing of cytokinesis events (e.g. Cortes et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2019). The authors might discuss the implication of their results for past studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The Calcofluor/Blankophor has been used in many laboratories, including ours, as a dye to visualize the cell periphery. Our results indicated that even very low concentrations of BP (5µg/ml) delays onset of CAR constriction slowing down cytokinesis. That said, as a dye BP stains the septum even at much lower concentrations, so the usage of slightly higher dilutions may have avoided this delay while still allowing septum monitoring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear to me if BP-treated cells detect a defect in the cell wall organization, or alternatively if they experience an imbalance in force production between the CAR and septum. If force generation by the septum is reduced by BP, then the CAR might need to provide additional force. I don't see any data in the paper that make a strong argument for one possibility versus the other. I don't think that the authors need to resolve this question in the current study, but they might alter their interpretations to include the possibility that Pmk1-SIN signaling delays CAR constriction so that the CAR can recruit additional force-generating machinery.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first part of the question, both possibilities are not excluding. There may be an “imbalance in force production between the CAR and septum” due to the defect in the organization of the wall; it may even be that this imbalance is the way by which the defect is detected. We cannot differentiate one from the other.</p><p>The second part is about the additional force generated by the CAR and is not so easy to explain with our data. To begin with, we would have to assume that the CAR could exert sufficient constricting force over the septum to overcome the turgor pressure, something quite controversial. Second, we cannot explain the absence of delay in the <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ, <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>sid2-250</italic> mutants based on the force generated by the CAR. Do they have a &quot;stronger&quot; ring? Do they recruit more components previously? Is their septum immune to loss of strength? Third, in the presence of cell wall damage there is no decrease in constriction speed while most mutants of ring components do contract but slower, which fits better with a lesser force generated from the CAR. The response here is more like to stop or not stop before constriction.</p><p>We have added a paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>“Moreover, cell wall stress influences the onset of CAR constriction, but does not interfere with CAR assembly or the rate of CAR constriction. It is possible that in the temporary absence of a cell wall headway the CAR provides insufficient force to be closed. If BP reduces the force generated by the septum, then the cells could experience an imbalance in force production between the CAR and the septum and the CAR might need to provide additional force (Proctor, 2012 #5704). Alternatively, a regulatory pathway may couple constriction of the CAR and septum formation such that a defect in septum formation could prevent the constriction of the CAR. Some of these possibilities are not exclusive. We have shown that cell wall stress (inflicted by BP) generates a delay of approximately 15 min in CAR constriction”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanism connecting activated Pmk1 with SIN signaling remains unknown. At first glance, the timing of this checkpoint suggests that it operates too rapidly to involve changes gene expression. Instead, it seems possible that Pmk1 phosphorylates component(s) of the SIN pathway. Have the authors looked for Pmk1 consensus sites in SIN proteins, or have any SIN components been identified at Pmk1 targets? Some additional consideration of the underlying mechanism would strengthen the framework for future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Except for the Clp1p phosphatase, none of the SIN components has been identified as Pmk1p substrates. Pmk1p phosphorylates Clp1p influencing its redistribution (from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm) upon genotoxic stress (Broadus, 2012 #5805). However, our data indicates that Clp1 is not required to delay cytokinesis in the presence of BP. Whether Pmk1p phosphorylates any of the SIN components has to be tested in the future. Accordingly, we have found several MAP kinase docking motifs (D-motifs) in Sid1p and Sid2p kinases. These motifs (R/K)xxxx#x# (where # is a hydrophobic residue) represent potential sites of interaction with the ERK1/2 and p38 subfamilies of MAP kinases (Pmk1p orthologues).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some additional analysis of double mutants would strengthen the conclusions regarding the pathway that signals to Pmk1. For example in Figure 4, I expected to see the phenotype for pmk1∆ rgf1∆ double mutants, with the prediction that they do not exhibit an additive phenotype on the checkpoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included results that show <italic>rgf1</italic>∆ and <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ mutations do not have any additive effects in the BP response (Figure 4—figure supplement 4).</p><p>Moreover, an <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ double mutant exhibit no synergistic effects in the BP response (Figure 4—figure supplement 4), suggesting that the Rgf1pbranch activating Pmk1p (Figure 4B) channels an efficient cytokinesis delay that protects cells from premature abscission under BP stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors' experiments build a signaling pathway that leads to activating phosphorylation of Pmk1, but the pathway can be equally impacted by modulating the phosphatase Pmp1, which removes the activating phosphorylation on Pmk1. It does not seem essential for the authors to test the identity or regulation of CIP phosphatases, but they should discuss potential regulatory mechanisms in the text. It seems possible that BP or other stresses might reduce Pmp1 activity, which would facilitate increased activating phosphorylation of Pmk1 by lowering the inhibitory threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, we should test whether elimination of Pmp1p will suppress the cytokinesis delay in <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ and <italic>pck2</italic>Δ cells or in the <italic>cwg1-1</italic> mutant cells.

The authors suggest that the checkpoint induces &quot;the quality control machinery for septum assembly and/or disassembly.&quot; I am not aware of evidence that these cells build &quot;a defective septum that was difficult to digest by the glucanases.&quot; This speculation is consistent with their data but should be phrased much more hypothetically.</p></disp-quote><p>We build on previous results.

A more direct test of CAR stability would be the timing of disassembly upon high-dose LatA treatment. The two tests (high and low dose) are complementary and would provide a stronger result in combination. The low-dose experiment sets up a competition between CAR and other actin structures, as opposed to directly testing how quickly the CAR actin turns over.</p></disp-quote><p>For technical reasons we have not been able to test high doses of LatA on the stability of the ring.

Interestingly, the number of rudimentary rings was similar in the presence or absence of BP (Figure 7A), suggesting that the SIN might be involved in CAR stabilization in the presence of cell wall stress.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 7B provides a very convincing quantification of Cdc7 dynamic localization at SPBs. I would recommend that the authors present a similar graph for the data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially try to measure Cdc7p-GFP intensity in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, but, since it shares the same fluorescence as Imp2-GFP, there was too much interference between Imp2p-GFP cytoplasmic/scattered fluorescence and that of Cdc7p. Then, we decided to improve the conditions by removing the ring marker and adding a second SPB marker in another fluorescent channel, which made the quantifications more reliable in Figure 7B. We decided to keep Figure 7—figure supplement 1, as an extension to the quantifications in Figure 7B, where the CAR and septum can be seen in combination with Cdc7p-GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The Rho-GTPase pathway has been implicated in cytokinesis with roles in regulation of the contractile actomyosin ring (CAR), cell-wall synthesis (in budding and fission yeasts), and other signaling pathways. In this paper, the authors showed that the Rho1 GEF Rfg1 localizes in the region following the contractile ring during cell division, in a CAR-dependent manner. Interestingly, the authors found that treatment of cells with the BP dye that specifically binds to linear 1,3-β-glucan delays cytokinesis in WT, but not in rfg1∆ cells. The delay was largely in the timing of onset of CAR constriction and concomitant ingression of plasma membrane, rather than the rate of constriction/ingression. Based on these results, the authors hypothesize that Rfg1 is involved in a mechanism that senses cell-wall perturbation and delays the onset of cytokinesis. Because Rfg1 has previously been implicated in the cell-wall integrity pathway (CIP), the authors tested the requirement of known CIP components for BP-responsive cytokinesis delay, and identified Rho1p, Pck2p, and Pmk1p as downstream factors of Rfg1p in this response. pmk1∆ cells show significant increase in septation index upon BP treatment, which the authors conclude to be a consequence of failure to delay cytokinesis onset. The delay in the onset of cytokinesis correlated with prolonged cytoplasmic retention of the Clp1 phosphatase and dephosphorylation of its substrate Cdc15. Finally, the delay in cytokinesis onset requires normal SIN activity, implicating the pathway in this process.</p><p>Contribution of cell wall to cytokinesis has been clearly demonstrated in both fission yeast and budding yeast, yet its regulation and coordination with the CAR pathway has not been fully established. This paper provides a new insight into the ability of the cells of <italic>S. pombe</italic> in controlling CAR constriction, septum synthesis, and membrane ingression in response to perturbation to cell-wall synthesis. Most of the experiments are performed carefully and data are clearly presented, which are of interest to the readers in the field.</p><p>1) While the manuscript clearly demonstrates the cell's ability to respond to cell-wall perturbation that involves delayed onset of CAR constriction and septum synthesis, the biological significance of this observation is unclear. How did <italic>S. pombe</italic> evolve to have this adaptation pathway, and what is the consequence of a defect in it?</p></disp-quote><p>Fission yeast cells probably evolved from filamentous fungi (Sipiczki, 1995 #1378). Since the absence of Pmk1p leads to a hyphal-like growth pattern under certain stress conditions, it is possible that the CIP contributed to the emergence of proliferation through single cells. In addition, this regulatory pathway can be modulated to fine-tune growth modes depending on environmental conditions. Under conditions of starvation, it may be advantageous to grow in a hyphal mode organism to efficiently capture nutrients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors conclude that the observed separation defect is a consequence of the failure to delay cytokinesis onset, the causality between the two phenotypes does not seem to be fully established. The separation defect could be a separate consequence of the defective CIP under cell-wall stress, such as through some defects in the secretory pathway, that is independent of the delayed cytokinesis onset.</p></disp-quote><p>It is known for a long time that <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ cells grow as short-branched filaments under certain stress conditions (nutrient, high temperature, osmotic stress …). Apparently, these cells had almost finished cytokinesis, but had not completely lysed the external wall, suggesting defects in cell wall remodeling. (Zaitsevskaya-Carter, 1997 #982). However, to date there are not effectors of this pathway with a known function in cytokinesis.</p><p>In this paper we show for the first time that a cell wall stressor (BP induces Pmk1p within minutes (Barba, 2008 #5646;Madrid, 2006 #5648)) triggers a checkpoint-like response during cytokinesis. The response is overridden in the absence of the kinase that channels the damage. Although we found a good correlation between cell wall stress and CIP induction, we cannot demonstrate that the separation defects observed in CIP mutants are exclusively dependent on their inability to activate the checkpoint.</p><p>Thus, we have included the changes shown below.</p><p>“Thus, the chained-cell phenotype was probably due to the mutant´s inability to halt cytokinesis and induce the quality control machinery for septum assembly and/or disassembly.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In the case that the checkpoint is overridden, some septa could be poorly built up. In that sense it is known that conditions of nutrient limitation, hypertonic stress or caffeine, prompt <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ cells to grow as short-branched filaments in which the cell walls and septa are thickened (Zaitsevskaya-Carter and Cooper, 1997). At the same time, Pmk1p might induce the expression of genes that function to replace the damaged wall and restart cytokinesis even under stress conditions (D. Chen et al., 2003; Takada et al., 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do any of the other CIP pathway mutants show separation defects, and if they do, is there a good correlation between the timing of Imp2 constriction (Figure 4) and separation defects?</p></disp-quote><p>Null mutants of Mkh1p, Skh1p/Pek1p and Pmk1p show separation defects when grown in nutrient-limiting conditions at high temperature or in hyperosmotic medium (Sengar, Markley, Marini, and Young, 1997; Toda et al., 1996b; Zaitsevskaya-Carter and Cooper, 1997). Null mutants of Pck2p do not multi-septate but instead cells lyse as doublets during cytokinesis. Regarding Rgf1p, 15% of the null cells lyse and 70% show monopolar growth; these cells are impaired for growth through the new end that comes from the anterior division, suggesting problems in the recognition of a faulty disassembled end (Bohnert, 2012 #5592). Moreover, mutants with late cytokinesis defects likewise frequently exhibit new end growth polarity errors (Bohnert, 2012 #5592).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do mutations in myp2 etc. that delay the onset of constriction also rescue the separation defect in pmk1∆? Can the authors speculate as to whether the cell-separation defect causes a severe morphological or ecological disadvantage that explains the evolution of this response pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, Myp2 mutations do not rescue the cell separation defect in <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ cells. The double mutant <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ <italic>myp2</italic>Δ shows higher percentage of multiseptated cells than any of the individual mutants <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ and <italic>myp2</italic>Δ (not shown). This result also supports that Myp2p and BP act independently on the timing of cytokinesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In many figures, rgf1∆ and pmk1∆ are used interchangeably to test the role of the proposed pathway in delaying cytokinesis onset. While this is consistent with the previously established CIP pathway, in which Rgf1 and Pmk1 are positioned at the most upstream and downstream (Figure 4B), it is possible that the two proteins function independently in separate or partially overlapping pathways leading to cytokinesis delay in BP-treated cells. Thus, the authors should at least establish that rgf1∆ and pmk1∆ mutations do not have any additive effects in the BP response, and ideally repeat some key experiments in both mutant backgrounds.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included results that show <italic>rgf1</italic>∆ and <italic>pmk1</italic>∆ mutations do not have any additive effects in the BP response (Figure S4E).</p><p>“Moreover, an <italic>rgf1</italic>Δ <italic>pmk1</italic>Δ double mutant exhibit no synergistic effects in the BP response (Figure 4—figure supplement 4), suggesting that the Rgf1pbranch activating Pmk1p (Figure 4B) channels an efficient cytokinesis delay that protects cells from premature abscission under BP stress.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
