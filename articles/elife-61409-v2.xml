Understanding progenitor heterogeneity is a major challenge. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval lymph gland is a well-studied model to understand blood progenitor maintenance and recapitulates several aspects of vertebrate hematopoiesis. However in-depth analysis has focused on the anterior lobe progenitors (AP), ignoring the posterior progenitors (PP) from the posterior lobes. Using in situ expression mapping and developmental and transcriptome analysis, we reveal PP heterogeneity and identify molecular-genetic tools to study this abundant progenitor population. Functional analysis shows that PP resist differentiation upon immune challenge, in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and form lamellocytes. In contrast, we show that PP activate STAT92E and remain undifferentiated, promoting survival. <italic>Stat92E</italic> knockdown or genetically reducing JAK-STAT signaling permits PP lamellocyte differentiation. We discuss how heterogeneity and compartmentalization allow functional segregation in response to systemic cues and could be widely applicable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>lymph gland development</kwd><kwd>heterogeneous progenitors</kwd><kwd>posterior lobe markers</kwd><kwd>JAK-STAT pathway</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd><kwd>survival</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001852</institution-id><institution>Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waltzer</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name><name><surname>Inamdar</surname><given-names>Maneesha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inamdar</surname><given-names>Maneesha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>J C Bose Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inamdar</surname><given-names>Maneesha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005116</institution-id><institution>Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inamdar</surname><given-names>Maneesha S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waltzer</surname><given-names>Lucas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive developmental in situ analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland provides markers highlighting blood progenitor diversity and reveals that JAK-STAT signaling prevents posterior progenitor differentiation, promoting survival after immune challenge.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood and immune cells derive from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that were classically thought to be a homogeneous population generating a defined hierarchy of progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Seita and Weissman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yokota, 2019</xref>). Recent studies reveal that mammalian HSCs and progenitor populations have dynamic cell surface marker phenotype and proliferative ability and varying in vivo differentiation potential in response to external cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crisan and Dzierzak, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haas et al., 2018</xref>). Studying aspects of intrapopulation heterogeneity and its implication in conditions of immune stress will improve our understanding of native and emergency hematopoiesis. Owing to the conserved signaling pathways and transcriptional factors that regulate hematopoiesis, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has emerged as a powerful model to study blood cell development and the innate cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Like vertebrates, <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis occurs in spatially and temporally distinct phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tepass et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>). The embryonic wave of hematopoiesis primarily gives rise to macrophage-like phagocytic circulating and sessile hemocytes. A second wave of hematopoiesis takes place in a specialized larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, located dorsally along the anterior cardiac tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grigorian and Hartenstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rugendorff et al., 1994</xref>). In third instar larvae, the mature lymph gland is composed of a pair of anterior or primary lobes in segment T3/A1, followed by twoÂ toÂ three pairs of lobes referred to as the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary lobes â collectively called the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Based on morphology and molecular marker analysis, primary lobes are compartmentalized into distinct zones. The posterior signaling center (PSC), a small group of cells at the posterior tip of the primary lobes, specifically expresses Antennapedia (Antp) and acts as a signaling niche. The medullary zone (MZ), close to the cardiac tube, consists of multi-potent progenitors and is identified by expression of <italic>Drosophila</italic> E-cadherin (DE-cad), the complement-like protein Tep4 and reporters for the JAK-STAT pathway receptor Domeless (Dome). The peripheral cortical zone (CZ) consists of differentiated blood cells thatÂ are mainly phagocytic plasmatocytes identified by Nimrod C1 (NimC1/P1) expression and a few crystal cells that express Lozenge (Lz) and the prophenoloxidases (ProPO). In addition, intermediate progenitors (IZ) reside in the region between the MZ and the CZ; they are identified by the expression of <italic>dome</italic> reporter and early differentiation markers like Hemolectin (Hml) or Peroxidasin (Pxn) but lack the expression of late markers like P1 for plasmatocytes and Lz for crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jung et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The presence of blood cell progenitors in the anterior lobes prompted intense investigations to unravel how their fate is controlled. During normal development, anterior progenitor (AP) proliferation, quiescence, and differentiation are finely orchestrated by the interplay of various pathways. Notably AP maintenance is controlled by activation of the Hedgehog and ADGF-A pathways in the MZ in response to signaling from the PSC and the CZ respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldeosingh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, within the MZ, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, Wingless signaling, and Collier expression regulate AP differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>). Besides, AP fate is controlled by systemic cues and external stresses such as immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khadilkar et al., 2017b</xref>). In particular, deposition of egg from the parasitoid wasp <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> (<italic>L. boulardi</italic>) in the hemocoel triggers AP differentiation into lamellocytes and premature histolysis of the primary lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Small et al., 2014</xref>). ROS-mediated activation of EGFR and Toll/NF-kB signaling pathways in the PSC and the consecutive downregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway in the AP are essential for this cellular immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Makki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In contrast with the anterior lobes, little is known about the posterior progenitors (PP) present in the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). The general view is that these lobes essentially harbor progenitors as initially suggested by the higher expression of DE-cadherin and the lack of expression of mature blood cell markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). Yet only few studies on progenitor differentiation in the primary lobe report on phenotypes in the secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khadilkar et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao and Jin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang and Cadigan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kulkarni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>). These studies revealed that posterior lobes could also differentiate in genetic contexts where there is extensive premature differentiation in primary lobes; however, a thorough analysis of the posterior lymph gland lobes is lacking. In addition, depletion of <italic>asrij</italic>, a<italic>rf1</italic>, <italic>or garz</italic> and overexpression of <italic>arf1GAP</italic>, all show more severe phenotypes of hyperproliferation and premature differentiation in the posterior lobes compared to the primary lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kulkarni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khadilkar et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Stat92E</italic> mutation causes premature progenitor differentiation in the primary lobes but not in the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">KrzemieÅ et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting important differences in regulation and function of these lobes as well as inherent differences within the progenitor pool. Along that line, a recent single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the lymph gland has identified novel hemocyte sub-populations and suggests a higher degree of blood cell progenitor heterogeneity than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). However, the posterior lobes were excluded from this study and positional information is not retained in such single-cell sequencing analysis. A systematic mapping of lymph gland progenitors in vivo is not available, and we thus lack detailed lobe-wise information about these progenitors. The small size and contiguous nature of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic organ allows simultaneous comprehensive assessment of progenitors across lobes, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of progenitor heterogeneity and function in response to local and systemic cues. Such analysis is currently not feasible in vertebrate hematopoiesis. Here we combined in situ expression analysis of the entire lymph gland with differential RNA sequencing analysis of the anterior and the posterior lobes to map expression of known blood cell markers and to identify new progenitor markers. Furthermore, by assessing the response to immune challenge, we reveal the functional heterogeneity of the lymph gland progenitors and we propose that differential regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway underlies the maintenance of PP in response to wasp infestation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of lymph gland anterior lobes and posterior lobes development and gene expression pattern</title><p>In third instar larvae, the lymph gland posterior lobes are separated from the primary lobes and from each other by pericardial cells. To shed further light on these poorly characterized lobes, we used a dissection method that preserves the whole lymph gland (see Materials and methods) and we assessed their formation at different times of larval development, from 60 hr after egg laying (AEL) (mid second instar) to 144 hr AEL (late wandering third instar). While one pair of secondary lobes is generally clearly visible from 60 hr AEL onward, we often distinguished only one tertiary lobe until 120 hr AEL, and quaternary lobes were rarely observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). At 60 hr AEL, primary lobes contain around 80 cells, whereas the secondary lobes consist of approximately 10â15 cells and tertiary lobes are barely visible. As shownÂ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the number of cells in these lobes dramatically increases from 60 to 144 hr AEL. While the lymph gland secondary and tertiary lobes all together contain significantly less cells than the primary lobes from 60 to 96 hr, this ratio is then inverted so that posterior lobes together consist of about twice the number of cells present in the primary lobes at the end of larval life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâF</xref>), indicating that they significantly contribute to the larval hematopoietic system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Blood cell counts and gene expression analysis in the larval lymph gland.</title><p>Whole lymph gland preparations (including primary and posterior lobes [sec., tert., quat. lobes]) were analyzed for third instar larvae except where time points are mentioned.

Accordingly, the gene expression profile of manually-dissected anterior or posterior lobes was determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from biological triplicates using Illumina NextSeq550 sequencing system. We observed that 6709 genes (corresponding toÂ Â±38% of the genes on <italic>Drosophila</italic> reference genome dm6) are expressed with a RPKMÂ &gt;1 in all three samples of the anterior lobes or of the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), including well-known pan-hematopoietic markers such as <italic>asrij</italic> or <italic>serpent</italic> (<italic>srp)</italic>.

Immunostaining against the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) Dally-like protein (Dlp), which was described as a PSC marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), revealed that it is expressed at high levels in the posterior lobes and at very low levels in the MZ of the anterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with the idea that its expression is activated by Col (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao and Jin, 2017</xref>), Dlp displayed an anteroposterior gradient of expression similar to that of <italic>col</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), with particularly strong levels in the tertiary lobes. RNA in situ hybridization against <italic>Dystroglycan</italic> (<italic>Dg</italic>), which encodes a cell surface receptor for the ECM, showed that it is strongly expressed throughout the posterior lobes and at lower level in the MZ of the anterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Using an endogenously GFP-tagged version for Apontic (Apt) that acts a transcription factor and negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling, we found that it is expressed in the posterior lobes, in the heart tube, and at lower levels in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Similarly, a GFP-5-hydroxytryptamine 1B (5-HT1B) fusion showed that this serotonin receptor is expressed in the posterior lobes and in the MZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). GFP or V5 tagged versions of the guidance molecule Netrin-B (NetB) revealed that it is not only expressed throughout the cardiac tube but also in patches of cells in the posterior lobes, especially in the tertiary lobes, but not in the anterior lobes except for the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B,D</xref>). A GFP fusion with Tsp42Ee revealed that this Tetraspanin protein is strongly expressed in the posterior lobes, in particular in the tertiary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the LDL receptor family member CG6024 was expressed in the tertiary lobes and in the PSC, as well as in the pericardial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Actually, two candidates (the Nephrin homolog Sticks and stones [Sns] and the fatty acid elongase CG31522) were specifically expressed in pericardial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that contamination by these cells could contribute to the apparent overexpression of some genes in posterior lobe RNA-seq samples. Finally, immunostaining against Ultrabithorax (Ubx) showed that this HOX transcription factor is expressed in some pericardial and heart cells but only in the tertiary lobes within the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). All together, these data indicate that the lymph gland prohemocytes are more heterogenous in terms of gene expression than previously thought.</p><p>In parallel, we used the G-trace system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2009</xref>) to assess whether different Gal4 whose expression is under the control of putative enhancers of genes overexpressed in the posterior lobes can drive gene expression in specific territories of the lymph gland, and especially in progenitors and/or in the posterior lobes. Accordingly, we identified three Gal4 lines placed under the control of <italic>dlp</italic> regulatory regions that drive expression in part of the tertiary and secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F,G</xref>). We also identified an enhancer in <italic>col</italic> driving expression in the MZ as well as in most cells of the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), contrary to the classically used <italic>pcol85</italic> lines, which is restricted to the PSC and part of the tertiary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly we found that the <italic>Ubx(M3)-Gal4</italic>, which essentially reproduces <italic>Ubx</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Navas et al., 2006</xref>), is expressed throughout the posterior lobes but not in the anterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>), indicating that the anterior and posterior lobes emerge from distinct territories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first posterior lobe-specific driver identified and it could be very useful to manipulate gene expression in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Heterogeneity in gene expression is maintained in the pupal lymph gland</title><p>Previous studies indicated that lymph gland lobes histolyze during the course of pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>). Secondary lobes histolyze by approximately 8 hr (hours) APF (after pupa formation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>). However, the analysis did not cover the entire lymph gland or analyze progenitor marker expression. For a more comprehensive description of the fate of posterior lobes, we analyzed the whole lymph gland in hemi-dissected pupal preparations at different timeÂ points. Expectedly, at 0 hr APF lymph gland primary lobes begin histolyzing and posterior lobes are maintained intact. At 5 hr APF primary lobes continue to histolyze, while secondary and tertiary lobes begin histolyzing by approximately 5 hr APF and 10 hr APF. By 12â15 hr APF most of the lymph gland is histolyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD</xref>).

While all progenitors are assumed to respond uniformly to a given stress, especially to systemic cues, our findings that PPs differ in gene expression led us to hypothesize that this may reflect in the ability to maintain progenitors or differentiate upon immune challenge. Interestingly, infection with the Gram-negative bacteria <italic>E. coli</italic> promoted differentiation in the primary lobes as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khadilkar et al., 2017b</xref>), but not in the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> has been used extensively to study the innate cellular immune response; however, <italic>E. coli</italic> does not infect <italic>Drosophila</italic> naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neyen et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> are natural host to parasitoid wasp and the hemocyte immune response is wellÂ studied in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>).

Of note too, the timing of response seems variable from lab to lab, this could partly be due to the genetic background that is used or the temperature at which the experiment is performed. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanot et al., 2001</xref> observed lamellocyte formation from 10 hr post-parasitism in the primary lobes, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref> reported that lamellocyte production in the primary lobes begins around 51 hr post-parasitism and intensifies by 75 hr.

To account for the inter-individual variation in the extent of the response, we quantified the phenotypes based on the following broad classification â (a) Strong: lobes completely histolyzed and hence lamellocytes absent or few remnant cells attached to the cardiac tube, (b) Medium: few lamellocytes with histolyzing lobes that show uneven or discontinuous boundaries with loose packing of cells, (c) Mild: no lamellocytes but some cells in the lobe fuse or coalesce in groups with disrupted cell-cell boundaries,Â and (d) Unaffected: lobes with undisturbed morphology, intact cellâcell connections, and no lamellocytes.</p><p>Analysis of the lymph gland post-parasitism revealed differences in the response of progenitors from anterior to posterior.

Yet, the role of JAK-STAT signaling in lamellocyte differentiation in the posterior lobes has not been assessed. Hence, we investigated the status of JAK-STAT signaling in the whole lymph gland to gain potential insight into the molecular basis for differential regulation of lamellocyte formation from anterior to posterior.</p><p>Accordingly, we used the 10xSTAT-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bach et al., 2007</xref>) to analyze STAT92E activation in time-matched control (unparasitized) and parasitized larvae at day 2, 3, or 4 post-parasitism. In control larvae, 10xSTAT-GFP expression was essentially restricted to the posterior part of the anterior lobes at 120 hr (2 days post-parasitism) and 144 hr (3 days post-parasitism) AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,C</xref>). However, it was barely detectable at later stage (4 days post-parasitism/168 hr AEL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, we observed consistent 10xSTAT-GFP expression throughout the posterior lobes from 120 hr to 168 hr AEL in parasitized larvae. Consistent with previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Makki et al., 2010</xref>), STAT92E activity was repressed in the anterior lobes following <italic>L. boulardi</italic> infection, as judged by the quasi absence of 10xSTAT-GFP expression in parasitized larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Persistent signal post-parasitism could be due to GFP perdurance. Nevertheless, 2 days post-parasitism secondary lobes showed significantly high GFP<sup>+</sup> cells and at 4 days post-parasitism secondary as well as tertiary lobes had increased GFP-expressing cells, although induction of GFP is lower in tertiary lobes as compared to the secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplements 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G, H</xref>).</p><p>To gain further evidence for increased activity of STAT92E in the posterior lobes of parasitized larvae, we also assessed the expression of the STAT target <italic>Tep1</italic>.

In addition, in line with the idea that <italic>Tep1</italic> is a target of the JAK/STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lagueux et al., 2000</xref>), we found that S<italic>tat92E</italic> overexpression in the progenitors induces <italic>Tep1</italic> expression in unparasitized conditions in the anterior as well as in the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,L</xref>).</p><p>The JAK-STAT pathway participates in various kinds of stress responses.

Hence, we investigated whether increased STAT92E activation in the PP upon wasp parasitism could be a result of increased Asrij expression. However, Asrij protein levels were significantly reduced in both anterior and posterior lobes upon wasp parasitism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>) suggesting an <italic>asrij</italic>-independent mechanism of STAT92E activation post parasitism.

It could thus participate in the differential regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway between AP and PP and/or in the regulation of PP fate. Immunostaining showed no change in Dlp levels post-parasitism and it remained high in posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Nonetheless, we tested the role of Dlp in the response to parasitism by knocking-down its expression by RNAi using the <italic>e33c-Gal4</italic> that shows widespread expression in the lymph gland lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kulkarni et al., 2011</xref>).

However, intra-population heterogeneity has not been explored previously. Here we introduce the lymph gland as a model to analyze progenitor heterogeneity at the level of the complete hematopoietic organ by phenotypic marker expression, proliferative capacity, and differentiation potential. We show that posterior lobes acquire cells during the third instar stage of development. The exponential increase in the size of the posterior lobes is accompanied by increased cell proliferation and mitotic activity from the mid-third instar to the wandering larval stages. At the wandering larval stage posterior lobes consist of a significant population of progenitors and are essentially devoid of differentiated cells. PP express progenitor markers like <italic>Tep4, dome, DE-cad</italic> in the secondary lobes and in some cells of the tertiary lobe but very few cells expressing differentiation markers such as Pxn, P1/NimC1, or ProPO are present. Furthermore, while most cells of the posterior lobes express low levels of <italic>col</italic> like the APs, part of the tertiary lobes express high levels of <italic>col</italic>, like the PSC in the anterior lobes. However, we did not observe expression of other PSC markers such as <italic>Antp</italic> or <italic>hh</italic>, suggesting that there is no clear homologue of the PSC/niche in these lobes. While several autonomous factors and local signals emanating from the PSC have been implicated in progenitor maintenance in the anterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>), how progenitor fate is maintained in the posterior lobes remains largely unknown and certainly deserves further investigation. The identification of genes overexpressed in the PP, such as the transcription factors Apt or the ligand Net-B, paves the way for such investigations.</p><p>AP are responsive to systemic cues/long range signals present in the hemolymph. For instance, they are sensitive to nutrient deprivation and olfactory cues, which regulate specific signaling pathways in the anterior lobes under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tokusumi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). Olfactory-immune crosstalk also helps in priming larvae to respond rapidly in conditions of immune stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Madhwal et al., 2020</xref>). It would be all the more interesting to study whether the same processes operate in PP as we revealed clear differences between AP and PP response to systemic cues elicited by immune challenges. Our finding that <italic>5-HT1B</italic> and <italic>5-HT1A,</italic> which code for serotonin receptors, are expressed at higher levels in the posterior lobes suggests that progenitor fate or function could be controlled by serotonin circulating through the hemolymph or produced by neighboring cells. Indeed, besides its function as a neurotransmitter, serotonin acts as a peripheral hormone and has an immunomodulatory effect on blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herr et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, mice deficient for the serotonin receptor 5-HT2B show altered bone marrow composition, with increased granulocyte precursors and reduced immature endothelial precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Launay et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, phagocytosis is severely impaired in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants for serotonin receptors 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although our transcriptome analysis revealed a strong over-representation of genes associated with ECM organization (such as the laminins LanB1/B2/A, Collagen 4A1, Viking, Tiggrin, Glutactin, or Papilin) among those overexpressed in the primary lobes, the HSPG Dlp and the ECM receptor Dg were overexpressed in the PP. Dlp was shown to regulate PSC size by regulating the response to the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>), but its function in the prohemocytes is unknown. Dg binds ECM proteins like Perlecan, whose mutation causes reduced lymph gland growth and premature differentiation of the AP in the primary lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grigorian et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the ECM protein Tiggrin was found to control the progression of intermediate progenitors to mature plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang and Cadigan, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref> also suggested that hemocytes digest only a small part of the ECM to facilitate their dispersal and most of the ECM is left intact during metamorphosis. Systemic as well as local signals regulating ECM secretion and adhesiveness play an important role in vertebrate bone marrow to regulate blood cell quiescence, maintenance, or egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klamer and Voermans, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gattazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khadilkar et al., 2020</xref>). However, in-depth analysis of the widely dispersed vertebrate hematopoietic compartment is technically challenging. A deeper understanding of the differential expression of ECM components in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland and how they regulate signaling in and maintenance of progenitors could reveal evolutionary conserved mechanisms that help understand bone marrow hematopoiesis.</p><p>Our results bring new insights into the origin and fate of the posterior lobes during development. Posterior lobes flank the dorsal vessel in the abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>); however, there is no literature regarding the ontogeny of the posterior lobes. In the embryo the homeotic gene <italic>Ubx</italic> provides positional cues to restrict the formation of the primary lobes to the thoracic segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mandal et al., 2004</xref>). Yet, our transcriptome show that <italic>Ubx</italic> is strongly expressed in the PP and we observe that Ubx is specifically expressed in the tertiary lobes of third instar larval lymph glands. Moreover, lineage tracing analysis with <italic>Ubx(M3)-Gal4</italic> strongly suggests that all the cells of the posterior lobes (and none of the anterior lobes) are derived from the Ubx<sup>+</sup> anlage, thatÂ is, the embryonic abdominal segments A1âA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lo et al., 2002</xref>). It would be interesting to study the role of Ubx and the more posterior Hox Abdominal-A (Abd-A) or Abdominal-B (Abd-B) (which are not expressed in the AP or PP) in providing positional cues for seeding the posterior lobes. Likewise several Hox, including Ubx ortholog HoxA7, have been implicated in HSPC development in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Thompson, 2018</xref>). Whether they contribute to the emergence of distinct pools of blood cell progenitors during development is still unknown.</p><p>Lymph gland lobes histolyze at the onset of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold and BrÃ¼ckner, 2015</xref>). A previous study focused on the anterior lobes showed that secondary lobes express Pxn at 4 hr APF but disperse before terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grigorian et al., 2011</xref>). We observe that in all the posterior lobes, cells that persist till 10 or 15 hr APF still express progenitor markers and do not undergo terminal differentiation. Pupal and adult blood cells derive from the embryonic and lymph gland lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holz et al., 2003</xref>). We speculate that under normal conditions PP act as a reserve/long-term pool of progenitors that could have specific functions in larval and/or pupal and adult stages. Along that line, it was proposed that undifferentiated blood cells derived from <italic>col</italic>-expressing posterior lobe hemocytes persist in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>), but a recent study challenged these conclusions and found no evidence for active hematopoiesis during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanchez Bosch et al., 2019</xref>). However, a detailed lineage tracing analysis for understanding the contribution of AP and PP to pupal and adult stages has not been possible. It is anticipated that the present identification of new progenitor markers and of a Gal4 driver specifically expressed in the posterior lobes should help characterize the fate of lymph gland progenitors in the pupal and adult stages.</p><p>Importantly, we show here that the PP exhibit a distinct behavior as compared to AP and our data support the hypothesis that differential regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway underlies this functional compartmentalization. In response to wasp parasitism downregulation of JAK-STAT signaling is required for the differentiation of lamellocytes in the primary lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Makki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis of the lymph gland in its entirety indicates that PP exhibit higher level of JAK-STAT signaling than the anterior lobes and further activate the pathway in response to wasp parasitism. Moreover, the maintenance of high level of STAT92E activity in the PP appears to be required to prevent lamellocyte differentiation in these cells. Interestingly, wasp infestation was also shown to cause JAK-STAT signaling activation in the larval somatic muscle, which is essential for mounting an efficient immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, wasp infestation seems to lead to differential regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway in multiple target organs. Notably, sustained JAK-STAT signaling in the PP, by contributing to the expression of complement like factor Tep1, could further activate the humoral arm of immunity. Along that line, our observation that sustained STAT92E activation in PP is important for fly survival following wasp infestation also underlines the biological relevance of PP differential regulation.</p><p>Notably, we monitored Toll/NF-kB and Notch signaling to test whether these pathways are involved in regulating differential immune response across the anteroposterior axis. Indeed Toll/NF-kB activation and Notch repression were implicated in lamellocyte production in the anterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gueguen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao and Jin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Small et al., 2014</xref>). However, we found that Toll signaling was induced both in the anterior andÂ in the posterior lobes in response to wasp parasitism, and Notch signaling was barely active in the posterior lobes in control as well as infected larvae. Thus, the differential response of AP and PP is unlikely to involve these two pathways. Yet, activation of the Toll reporter <italic>Drs-GFP</italic> in the PP in response to wasp infection further supports the idea that they could contribute to the humoral immune response. Indeed, Toll/NF-kB signaling is widely implicated in the regulation of AMP production in response to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Along the same lines, it is interesting to note that while infestation by the specialist wasp <italic>L. boulardi</italic> induces melanization and lamellocyte differentiation, venom from the generalist <italic>L. heterotoma</italic> is more immune suppressive and causes hemocyte lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schlenke et al., 2007</xref>). Toll and JAK/STAT pathway genes are some of the most highly expressed genes in the anti-parasite immune response to <italic>L. boulardi</italic> leading to Tep1 upregulation, which is not seen in <italic>L. heterotoma</italic> infested flies. However, upstream signals that bring about this regulation are not known. The virulence of the parasitoid and the immune response of the host define which species prevails. Several studies show that parasitoid wasps exert a selective pressure on <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in order to overcome infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kraaijeveld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LeitÃ£o et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McGonigle et al., 2017</xref>). Exposing <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to <italic>L.Â boulardi</italic> and selecting flies that survive parasitism over generations lead to constitutive upregulation of immune-inducible genes (including <italic>Drs</italic>) in such selected populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LeitÃ£o et al., 2020</xref>). It would be interesting to know whether PP contribute to the heightened immune response in such resistant <italic>Drosophila</italic> populations.</p><p>The PSC is critically required for lamellocyte production in the anterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>) and PSC-derived systemic signals are also essential for the differentiation of lamellocytes in the circulating blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>). Similar systemic signals emanating from the PSC or relayed by circulating blood cells could contribute to PP response to wasp parasitism as we observed that PSC ablation abrogated cellâcell coalescence in the posterior lobes. In addition to the PSC, signals derived from the differentiated blood cells in the CZ contribute to AP homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, further investigations will be required to elucidate whether systemic signals emanating from the PSC, the CZ, or the circulating hemocytes could influence PP fate in physiological or immune conditions.</p><p>Although the decrease in <italic>latran</italic> expression that we observe in the PP following wasp parasitism could strengthen JAK-STAT signaling, how this pathway is activated in the PP remains unclear. Integration of external stimuli to produce an appropriate response is essential for maintaining blood cell homeostasis and survival. While wasp parasitism causes a decrease in <italic>upd3</italic> expression in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Makki et al., 2010</xref>) and our own results, it also triggers Upd3 and Upd2 upregulation in circulating hemocytes, which leads to JAK-STAT signaling activation in the larval muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and could contribute to JAK-STAT activation in PP. Besides, Dlp is known to promote JAK-STAT activation by binding Upd cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and it is expressed at high levels in the PP. Dlp could thus help sequester Upd2 and/or Upd3 from the hemolymph and promote JAK-STAT signaling in the PP. More generally, enhanced expression of the ECM components, like the HSPG Dlp, in the posterior lobes may help integrate long-range cytokine signals leading to local activation of pathways in response to immune stress. Furthermore, the role of signals such as serotonin or developmental events remains to be investigated.</p><p>In summary, we show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, has a heterogeneous pool of progenitors whose maintenance is spatially and temporally regulated and we reveal a previously unexpected role for JAK-STAT signaling in maintaining the PPs in the presence of immune challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our analysis underscores the linear arrangement and genesis of lymph gland lobes with the youngest and most immature progenitors at the posterior end. Further we identify additional reagents to drive gene expression in specific subsets of progenitors. This provides unique opportunities for visualization and sophisticated developmental analysis of blood progenitor specification and differentiation within the same animal. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland could serve as a potent model to understand blood cell progenitor heterogeneity and our findings pave the way for future investigation aimed at understanding the spatio-temporal regulation of progenitor fate in normal and pathological situations in vivo. Wasp infestation provides refined and relevant interventions, akin to a sensitized genetic background, to highlight the context-dependent roles of signaling and progenitors. Using infestation as a tool we could uncover differences in the progenitor response to systemic signals and evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that regulate these. Understanding such interactions between the immune system and its stimuli could inform developmental analysis and our work sets the stage for future studies to decipher these.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model depicting lymph gland progenitor heterogeneity and response to immune challenge.</title><p>Schematics showing the entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar (wandering) larval lymph gland.

Upon wasp infestation, JAK-STAT pathway is downregulated in anterior progenitors leading to lamellocyte differentiation (dark blue) and histolysis. Systemic signals lead to production of ligands such as Upd (pink) that may be selectively trapped by extracellular matrix components such as Dlp around the posterior lobes (light blue border), leading to increased JAK-STAT signaling, in an Asrij-independent and Latran-dependent manner.

lymph gland, a larval hematopoietic organ, is composed of multiple lobes. However, previous studies have been largely focused on the most anteriorly positioned lobe, called the primary lobe (anterior lobe). In this manuscript, Rodrigues et al. first shed light on how the posteriorly localized lymph gland lobes are regulated, and biological characteristics that distinguish posterior lobes from the anterior lobe. Moreover, this study also provides valuable genetic tools useful for analyzing the posterior lobes, laying the foundation for future studies.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Differential activation of JAK-STAT signaling reveals functional compartmentalization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood progenitors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jiwon Shim as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers found that the manuscript is nice and interesting and contains valid data. Given its future significance to the related field, the reviewers suggested to further strengthen the manuscript by supplementing detailed description/analyses of posterior lobes and investigating a more expanded variety of signaling pathways that might function in posterior lobes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Separate the secondary and tertiary lobe: cell count, cell cycle, and phenotypes etc.</p><p>The authors start the paper with the fact that the posterior lobes contain a larger number of cells than the primary lobe and show that they maintain S to G2/M phase of the cell cycle similar to the primary lobe. To provide fundamental insights into the nature of posterior lobes, basic characteristics of the posterior lobes need to be analyzed with more details in addition to the expression analyses. For example, the number of secondary and tertiary lobes could be separately scored by which we can understand variations in the number of posterior lobes. The authors can also look into the developmental progression of their division (number and cell cycle) from early to late stages (cell counts of Figure 3 for pupal stages), which will explain how/when the posterior lobes acquire more cells as shown in Figure 1A. Moreover, FUCCI-based cell cycle patterns shown in the tertiary lobe could be different from the secondary lobe if separately counted (Figure 1H) and these will better represent the characteristics of the secondary/tertiary lobes.</p><p>In the same vein, more caution should be taken into describing expressions of markers and immune activated phenotypes in the secondary/tertiary lobes. Many gal4 expressions in this manuscript support the idea that the secondary lobe and the tertiary lobe may not be the same and cannot be lumped up as the posterior lobes/progenitors. For example, the tertiary lobe shows milder phenotypes than the secondary lobe when infested (Figures 4B, D, 5H-J, 6C-D, G-H), and that <italic>domeMESO-GFP</italic> is gone up primarily in the secondary lobe 4 days after infestation. These discrepancies are obvious in figures/graphs but are not clearly explained in the Results. Moreover, the secondary and tertiary lobes need to be separately quantitated in Figures 5A-f, K-M, 7E-f and K-L as in other graphs.</p><p>2) Genetic relationship between the PSC in AP and PP</p><p>While the authors focused a lot on how JAK-STAT is regulated intrinsically by different regulators in AP and PP, they seem not to consider that the biggest difference between AP and PP is not only their location but also the cell types they are connected with. AP is connected with hemocytes and the niche PSC, while PP is not at all. Hemocytes in cortical zone and the niche PSC all have been shown to actively secrete signals that control AP behavior. The authors should consider the contribution of hemocytes and PSC to the differential regulation of JAK-STAT in control and upon wasp using additional experiments. For example, does deleting the PSC delay/disrupt the differential regulation of JAK STAT.</p><p>3) Involvement of other pathways (Wg, Notch, NF-kB etc.)</p><p>The authors suggested that Upd3, Dlp, and Latran contribute to the differential regulation of JAK-STAT based on their findings (subsection âDifferential regulation of the JAK-STAT inhibitor latran in lymph gland progenitorsâ): (1) Upd3 is expressed in both AP and PP, but upon wasp parasitism, only Upd3 expression in AP is reduced. (2) Dlp is expressed in PP but is low in AP (Figure 2D) and knockdown of Dlp enhances the response to parasitism in PP but not in AP. (3) Latran is expressed in both AP and PP. As seen in the images (Figure 7K-L), upon wasp parasitism latran expression is reduced in both AP and PP. The authors claim that these experiments provide potential mechanisms to explain why JAK-STAT is differentially regulated. These observations are also consistent with a model that there are differences upstream of JAK-STAT signaling that underlie the differences in response in the AP and PP to wasp infestation. While the author make a convincing argument that JAK-STAT signaling could account for some of these differences, it might not be the primary cause of differences in response. Consistent with this, multiple examples in the literature suggest Dlp is a general regulator of signaling. One way to address this is to see if the differences in Upd expression respond to changes to some of the many signaling pathways known to regulate hematopoiesis in the AP (such as Wg, Notch, hh etc.),</p><p>There are multiple pathways that mediate the immune response in progenitors upon wasp infestation. For example, Louradour et al., 2017, demonstrated that AP blood progenitors show an upregulated NF-kB transcriptional activity upon wasp infestation. However the authors only focused on JAK/STAT signaling. Is there an involvement of these other pathways? Answering this question is important because JAK/STAT might in fact act downstream of these other pathways. To address this question I would advise the authors look at least NF-kB pathway and monitor NF-kB transcriptional activity in both AP and PP in wild-type control and upon wasp parasitism. The authors should also examine possible cross-interaction of the two important immune pathways upon wasp parasitism using genetic interaction experiments.</p><p>4) The biological relevance of differential PP regulation</p><p>The authors revealed functional compartmentalization in the AP and PP of the lymph gland upon wasp parasitism. However, the actual contribution of this differential regulation to animal survival or systemic immune response upon immune challenges seems to be still unclear. Does the differential regulation of the JAK STAT pathway in AP and PP confer to post-survival advantage of flies upon immune challenge? Why is the induction of lamellocytes in PP inhibited even in the presence of wasp eggs? One may expect that the organism produces as many lamellocytes as possible to fight infestation. The authors should do simple experiments to test if induction of lamellocyte formation specifically in AP, PP, or both (for example using STAT RNAi) increases/decreases the survival rate of flies post-wasp parasitism and discuss this question in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61409.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Separate the secondary and tertiary lobe: cell count, cell cycle, and phenotypes etc.</p><p>The authors start the paper with the fact that the posterior lobes contain a larger number of cells than the primary lobe and show that they maintain S to G2/M phase of the cell cycle similar to the primary lobe.

Since very few larvae have quaternary lobes we have clubbed the analysis for the tertiary and the quaternary lobes for all cell counts.</p><p>(1b) As suggested by the reviewers, we also analyzed cell numbers separately for the primary, secondary and tertiary lobes at different times of development: 60h after egg laying (AEL) (mid second instar), 72h (early third instar), 96h (mid third instar), 120h (late third instar) and 144h (late wandering larvae). We observed that at 60h AEL secondary lobes consist of approximately 10-15 cells arranged in a thin row, tertiary lobes are hardly visible and quaternary lobes are absent (revised Figure 1A, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-F). From 60h to 96h AEL we found that lymph gland secondary and tertiary lobes contain significantly fewer cells as compared to the primary lobes. By 120h AEL there is a strong increase in the number of cells in the posterior lobes and at 144h AEL posterior lobes together consist of about twice the number of cells as compared to primary lobes. These data bring novel insight into the development of the lymph gland lobes. The text has been edited appropriately to reflect this.</p><p>(1c) We also provide a thorough analysis of the cell cycle patterns of the progenitors across each lobe and at different time points. We used the FUCCI system in combination with <italic>e33c-Gal4</italic> (which drives expression in most cells of the lymph gland) as well as with <italic>Tep4-Gal4</italic> (driving expression in progenitors in the primary, secondary and, partially in tertiary/ quaternary lobes) to quantify the lymph gland cells and progenitors in G1, S or G2/M at 72h AEL, 96h AEL, 120h AEL and 144h AEL. These data are displayed in revised Figure 1H and revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-G. We found primary and posterior lobes were at different phases of the cell cycle in concordance with their developmental status. Analysis of <italic>Tep4</italic>-expressing progenitors, which form the major fraction of the progenitor pool, showed that most of the AP are in S phases from 72h to 120h AEL and that their proliferation is reduced at 144h AEL (revised Figure 1H and Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-C). In contrast, fewer cells are in S phase among the PP, and the proportion of PP in G1 phase constantly decreases from 72h to 144h AEL essentially to the benefit of cells in G2/M, both in the secondary and tertiary lobes. Cell cycle of the entire pool of lymph gland cells using <italic>e33c-Gal4</italic> driver showed that the overall distribution of proliferative cells was more in the tertiary lobes at 120h AEL (revised Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D-G). These data bring further evidence of the heterogenous nature of the lymph gland progenitors as AP and PP exhibit distinct cell cycle pattern.</p><p>(1d) For better insight into the evolution of lymph gland during the pupal stages, we now also analyze the number of primary, secondary and tertiary lobes that have histolyzed, begin to histolyze, or are intact at 0, 5, 10 and 15h APF. We also provide a quantification of the proportion of cells that express the niche marker <italic>collier</italic>, the progenitor markers â <italic>dome</italic> and <italic>Tep4</italic>, or the differentiation markers- <italic>Pxn</italic> and P1/NimC1 in the primary, secondary and tertiary lobes, at 5h and 10h after pupal formation. These analyses confirm our previous conclusion that posterior progenitors are maintained up to at least 10h of pupal development (revised Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Genetic relationship between the PSC in AP and PP</p><p>While the authors focused a lot on how JAK-STAT is regulated intrinsically by different regulators in AP and PP, they seem not to consider that the biggest difference between AP and PP is not only their location but also the cell types they are connected with. AP is connected with hemocytes and the niche PSC, while PP is not at all. Hemocytes in cortical zone and the niche PSC all have been shown to actively secrete signals that control AP behavior. The authors should consider the contribution of hemocytes and PSC to the differential regulation of JAK-STAT in control and upon wasp using additional experiments. For example, does deleting the PSC delay/disrupt the differential regulation of JAK STAT.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. It is true that anterior progenitors (AP) receive signals from the differentiated hemocytes residing in the cortical zone and from the PSC/ niche, while the PP are physically separated from these cells and may not be subject to their inputs. We now stress this point in the revised Discussion.</p><p>As the PSC is required for the (systemic) response to wasp parasitism and in particular for lamellocyte differentiation in the anterior lobes (e.g. Crozatier et al., 2004; Sinenko et al., 2011; Benmimoun et al., 2015), it may indeed contribute to the differential response between AP and PP. Consistent with previous findings, we find that ablating the PSC by overexpressing the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>reaper</italic> using <italic>Antp-Gal4</italic> prevents lamellocyte differentiation in the primary lobes and we did not observe lamellocyte induction in the posterior lobes either in these conditions. Interestingly, AP of PSC-less larvae did not behave as PP of wild type larvae as they did not exhibit cell coalescence, a frequent PP response to wasp parasitism. Although we could not introduce a JAK/STAT reporter in these experiments to assess JAK/STAT pathway levels/regulation (we could not obtain viable larvae carrying <italic>Antp-Gal4</italic>, 10xSTAT-GFP and <italic>UAS-reaper</italic>, even at 18Â°C), our analysis suggests that the PSC is not responsible for the differential response between AP and PP. In particular, it is not required to prevent lamellocyte induction in the PP. Intriguingly though, PSC ablation prevented PP cell coalescence, indicating that it could be involved in PP response to parasitism, may be through systemic signaling as described for the induction of lamellocytes in circulating blood cells (Sinenko et al., 2011). We have presented these data in revised Figure 4âfigure supplement 2.</p><p>Concerning the hemocytes of cortical zone, while they contribute to AP homeostasis in normal conditions (e.g. Mondal et al., 2011; Zhang and Cadigan, 2017), it is not known whether they also regulate AP response to wasp parasitism, but this is an interesting possibility. However due to lack of specific Gal4 drivers we cannot distinguish between the cortical zone (CZ) and the circulating hemocytes on AP and PP response. Indeed available drivers such as Hml-Gal4 or <italic>Pxn-Gal4</italic> drive expression in CZ as well as circulating/ sessile hemocyte compartments. It is thus not possible to effectively address the role of the CZ (or circulating hemocytes) on AP/PP response to wasp parasitism. Nonetheless we have discussed a possible involvement of the CZ in the differential response of AP and PP in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Involvement of other pathways (Wg, Notch, NF-kB etc.)</p><p>The authors suggested that Upd3, Dlp, and Latran contribute to the differential regulation of JAK-STAT based on their findings (subsection âDifferential regulation of the JAK-STAT inhibitor latran in lymph gland progenitorsâ): (1) Upd3 is expressed in both AP and PP, but upon wasp parasitism, only Upd3 expression in AP is reduced.

One way to address this is to see if the differences in Upd expression respond to changes to some of the many signaling pathways known to regulate hematopoiesis in the AP (such as Wg, Notch, hh etc.),</p><p>There are multiple pathways that mediate the immune response in progenitors upon wasp infestation. For example, Louradour et al., 2017, demonstrated that AP blood progenitors show an upregulated NF-kB transcriptional activity upon wasp infestation. However the authors only focused on JAK/STAT signaling. Is there an involvement of these other pathways? Answering this question is important because JAK/STAT might in fact act downstream of these other pathways. To address this question I would advise the authors look at least NF-kB pathway and monitor NF-kB transcriptional activity in both AP and PP in wild-type control and upon wasp parasitism. The authors should also examine possible cross-interaction of the two important immune pathways upon wasp parasitism using genetic interaction experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewers are convinced that JAK-STAT signaling could account for some of the differences between lobes. We do not intend to imply that it is the primary cause. As this is the first indepth study of posterior progenitors and mechanisms regulating them, interrogating all possible pathways is out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Nevertheless we agree that multiple signaling pathways may regulate immune response in the PP in response to wasp parasitism. Here we show that PP resists differentiation in response to immune stress as compared to AP. Since JAK-STAT signalling has been implicated in progenitor maintenance and mediating immune response, we focused on this pathway. Our analyses suggest Dlp promotes differential activation of JAK-STAT signaling leading to differences in immune response across AP and PP. While Dlp is a regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway, it has also been implicated in Hedgehog, Wingless and Decapentaplegic pathways (Baeg and Perrimon, 2001; Cadigan 2002; Yan and Lin, 2009). Yet, the role of Hedgehog, Wingless and Decapentaplegic in regulating AP immune response to wasp parasitism has not been studied previously hence, characterizing these pathways in the AP and PP will involve major experiments that are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, keeping in mind the reviewerâs concerns we analyzed Toll/NF-kB and Notch signaling, since these pathways have been studied in the AP in the context of wasp parasitism.</p><p>(3a) It was shown that Toll/NF-kB activation occurs in the anterior lobes progenitors and in the PSC to promote lamellocyte fate upon wasp infestation (Louradour et al., 2017; Gueguen et al., 2013). Using <italic>Drosomycin-GFP (Drs-GFP)</italic> reporter line (Ferrandon et al., 1998) we observe activation of Toll/NF-kB signaling in response to wasp parasitism in the AP as reported (Louradour et al., 2017; Gueguen et al., 2013) but also in the PP, although PP show little lamellocyte differentiation. These results thus indicate that the differential response of the PP to wasp infestation between anterior and posterior lobes is unlikely to involve this pathway. We have presented this data in revised Figure 5A-B (<italic>Drs-GFP</italic>).</p><p>(3b) Wasp parasitism was found to inhibit Notch activity, resulting in fewer crystals cells and increased lamellocyte differentiation in the AP (Small et al., 2014). Hence we also tested whether this pathway was differentially regulated in AP and PP. We used the Notch responsive element (<italic>NRE-GFP</italic>) line to assess Notch activity (Saj et al., 2010). In response to wasp infestation primary lobes show reduced Notch activity as reported (Small et al., 2014). However, PP barely express this reporter in control conditions, and upon infestation we observed a few <italic>NRE-GFP-</italic>expressing cells in the secondary lobes of some larvae but not in the tertiary lobes. This suggests that there is no major involvement of Notch pathway in PP upon wasp parasitism. Data are presented in revised Figure 5C-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The biological relevance of differential PP regulation</p><p>The authors revealed functional compartmentalization in the AP and PP of the lymph gland upon wasp parasitism. However, the actual contribution of this differential regulation to animal survival or systemic immune response upon immune challenges seems to be still unclear. Does the differential regulation of the JAK STAT pathway in AP and PP confer to post-survival advantage of flies upon immune challenge? Why is the induction of lamellocytes in PP inhibited even in the presence of wasp eggs? One may expect that the organism produces as many lamellocytes as possible to fight infestation. The authors should do simple experiments to test if induction of lamellocyte formation specifically in AP, PP, or both (for example using STAT RNAi) increases/decreases the survival rate of flies post-wasp parasitism and discuss this question in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is important to understand the relevance of differential activation of JAK-STAT signaling and lamellocyte inhibition in the PP post-parasitism. In this context, we have already shown that <italic>Stat92E</italic> knockdown in AP and PP, driven by <italic>dome-Gal4</italic> or <italic>Tep4-Gal4</italic> leads to reduced survival in response to wasp infestation (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A, B; revised Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A, B). Post-parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and differentiate to lamellocytes (Makki et al., 2010). Therefore our results suggest that preventing lamellocyte differentiation of PP is essential for survival, which could reflect a function for these undifferentiated PP in fighting the parasite (for example by producing the complement-like factor Tep1) or at later stage for proper development (for instance at metamorphosis).</p><p>To substantiate our results, we perturbed JAK-STAT signaling in the AP and/or PP using different Gal4 drivers expressed widely in the lymph gland (<italic>e33c-Gal4</italic>; Harrison et al., 2005, Kulkarni et al., 2011) or in (part of) the posterior lobes (<italic>dlp-Gal4</italic> and <italic>UbxM3-Gal4,</italic> as identified in this work, cf. Revised Figure 2M, O) and we scored the proportion of larvae that survive to adulthood. We found that knocking down <italic>dlp</italic> using <italic>e33c-Gal4,</italic> decreased survival post-parasitism as compared to parasitized Gal4 controls (Figure 7M). Moreover, attenuating JAK-STAT signaling by knocking down <italic>stat92E</italic> in the PP using <italic>dlp-Gal4</italic> or <italic>Ubx(M3)-Gal4</italic> also leads to reduced survival (Figure 7N-O). These data, in line with our previous results (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A, B; revised Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A, B), strongly suggest that increased activation of JAK-STAT signaling in the PP or PP subsets improves adult survival rate in response to wasp parasitism. They also underline the biological relevance of the PP differentiation regulation. We have presented this data in revised Figure 7M-O and incorporated it in the text appropriately.</p></body></sub-article></article>
