Yet, relatively few studies have analyzed the impacts of codon usage on tissue-specific mRNA and protein expression. Here, we use codon-modified reporters to perform an organism-wide screen in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> for distinct tissue responses to codon usage bias. These reporters reveal a cliff-like decline of protein expression near the limit of rare codon usage in endogenously expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes. Near the edge of this limit, however, we find the testis and brain are uniquely capable of expressing rare codon-enriched reporters. We define a new metric of tissue-specific codon usage, the tissue-apparent Codon Adaptation Index (taCAI), to reveal a conserved enrichment for rare codon usage in the endogenously expressed genes of both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human testis. We further demonstrate a role for rare codons in an evolutionarily young testis-specific gene, <italic>RpL10Aa</italic>. Optimizing <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> codons disrupts female fertility. Our work highlights distinct responses to rarely used codons in select tissues, revealing a critical role for codon bias in tissue biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>codon bias</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>testis</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-128945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Donald T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA94184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Counter</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01CA203657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Counter</surname><given-names>Christopher M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM140844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laederach</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL111527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laederach</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A tissue-wide fluoresence-based screen reveals that not all tissues in an organism (<italic>Drosophila</italic>) reinforce a hierarchy of codon usage to the same extent, a finding which impacts tissue-specific protein expression and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genetic code is redundant, with 61 codons encoding only 20 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crick, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965</xref>). It was initially thought that synonymous substitutions, those leading to changes in nucleotide sequence but resulting in an identical protein sequence, were functionally âsilent.â However, it is now clear that this is not the case. Synonymous codons are used at varying frequencies throughout a given genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grantham et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ikemura, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharp and Li, 1986</xref>). This disproportionate usage frequency among synonymous codons is termed codon usage bias (hereafter: codon bias).</p><p>Codon bias is governed by several biochemical mechanisms and has diverse biological consequences. In general, mRNAs enriched in codons commonly used in a given species are more stable and are more robustly translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sorensen and Pedersen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Conversely, a high frequency of rare codons in an mRNA can cause ribosomal stalling and trigger RNA degradation or premature translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Codon bias impacts expression and structure of clock proteins that underlie the in vivo circadian clock function in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, cyanobacteria, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>)<italic>,</italic> protein secretion in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pechmann et al., 2014</xref>), and virus/host interactions (including in COVID-19, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Diambra, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Emerging studies suggest codon bias plays an important role in fundamental tissue-level processes. For example, codon bias underlies differences between maternal and zygotic mRNAs in developing zebrafish, <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mouse, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2016</xref>). Further, while rare codons generally destabilize mRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> whole embryos, this effect is attenuated within the embryonic central nervous system, where codon bias has little impact on mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burow et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, tRNA levels have been shown to differ between tissues and cell types, impacting the translation efficiency of rare codon-enriched transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dittmar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gingold et al., 2014</xref>), and RAS isoforms that differ in codon usage have different transcription/translation kinetics based on cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Studies analyzing gene expression datasets cross-referenced with codon usage also suggest that the impact of codon bias on protein expression may differ between tissues. For example, codon usage frequencies differ between tissue-specific gene sets in numerous plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Camiolo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu, 2012</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Payne et al., 2019</xref>), and potentially humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plotkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">SÃ©mon et al., 2006</xref>), hinting that codon usage could play a fundamental role in tissue and cellular identity.</p><p>Here, we leverage the genetic and cell biological strengths of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to reveal tissue-specific impacts of codon bias. Using a library of codon-altered reporters, we conduct an organism-wide screen during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. We find that reporter protein expression declines drastically over a narrow range of rare codon usage in a gene. We further show that specific tissues, namely the testis and brain, are distinct in the ability to robustly express proteins encoded by rare codons. Focusing further on the testis, the tissue with the strongest protein expression from rare codon-enriched genes, we find the male germ cells and somatic hub cells are capable of robust rare codon-derived protein production, while somatic cyst cells are not. By developing a new metric to examine tissue-specific codon usage, tissue-apparent CAI (taCAI), we find that both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human testes express genes that are enriched in rare codons relative to other tissues. Examining the physiological significance of this conserved enrichment, we highlight a role for abundant rare codons in <italic>RpL10Aa</italic>, an evolutionarily young gene encoding a testis-specific ribosomal subunit. We present evidence that rare codons in this gene are critical for fertility. Just as chromatin states regulate tissue-specific gene expression at the level of transcription, here we find a biologically significant role for codon bias, an important determinant of mRNA translation, in regulating tissue-specific protein production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A cliff-like protein expression threshold determined by rare codons in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>We previously showed that severely altering codon content impacts protein expression from <italic>RAS</italic> family genes or from a <italic>GFP</italic> reporter in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lampson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peterson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2020</xref>). This prompted us to systematically determine the impact of codon usage on protein expression. To do so<italic>,</italic> we again used phiC31 integrase for stable site-specific insertion of a single copy of transgenic codon-modified <italic>GFP</italic> reporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) into the <italic>attP40</italic> locus on chromosome 2. This locus is well-established to express transgenes at robust and reproducible levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Markstein et al., 2008</xref>). As we have done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2020</xref>), we placed all of our transgenic reporters in the same vector backbone, which uses a <italic>ubiquitin</italic> (<italic>ubi-</italic>) promoter sequence for robust gene expression (Methods). In this way, we control for the effects of chromatin environment on gene expression and ensure that any differences in protein production are due to differences in coding sequence.</p><p>We took two approaches to introduce rare codons into our <italic>GFP</italic> reporters. In the first approach, we used a random number generator to select positions in the <italic>GFP</italic> coding sequence to engineer rare codons. This approach keeps the majority of rare codons dispersed throughout the <italic>GFP</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We generated 10 reporters using this dispersed codon strategy, and such reporters are designated with a âD.â Given the potential importance of contiguous stretches of rare codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayes et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kramer and Farabaugh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanjaard and van Duin, 1988</xref>), we also employed a second approach in which all rare codons were clustered at either the 5â or 3â end of the coding sequence. We generated six reporters using this clustered codon strategy, and all reporters generated this way are designated âC5â or âC3.â In defining rare codons, we referred to the Kazusa codon database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). We identified the most used synonymous codon in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome as the âcommonâ codon, the least used codon as the ârareâ codon, and any additional synonymous codons between the rare and common codon as âmiddleâ codons. We designed reporters to contain a specific percentage of rare codons, leaving the remaining portion of the coding sequence split between common and middle codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These reporters were all designed using an identical eGFP amino acid sequence to rule out any effects of amino acid bias on protein production levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weber et al., 2020</xref>). All reporters are designated with the fluorophore (e.g. GFP) followed by the percentage of rare codons, followed by a âDâ or âCâ designation (e.g. <italic>GFP50D</italic>, <italic>GFP70C3â</italic>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strictly defined limits on rare codon usage regulate gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top- schematic of each indicated reporter.

These animals contain fully formed organ systems and are translucent to facilitate imaging. We used the <italic>GFP0D</italic> reporter with no rare codons as a baseline for comparison. Upon examining animals for each reporter, we noticed an apparent âall or noneâ fluorescence pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâQ</xref>). To quantitate our observations seen by fluorescent microscope, we measured protein production by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For reporters with dispersed rare codons, 2/2 reporters with up to 50% rare codons display ubiquitous fluorescence throughout the animal, similar to <italic>GFP0D</italic>. These two reporters (<italic>GFP30D</italic> and <italic>GFP50D</italic>) produce animal-wide GFP protein at levels greater than or equal to 50% of GFP0D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD and R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, 7/7 reporters with greater than 50% dispersed rare codons display no visible fluorescence in the animal and produce protein at a level less than 0.3% of GFP0D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, EâK and R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Similarly, 6/6 reporters with 50% or more clustered rare codons display no fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1LâQ</xref>). Two of these six clustered codon reporters, <italic>GFP50C5â</italic> and <italic>GFP60C3â</italic>, produce barely detectable protein levels by western blot, between 7â9% that of GFP0D, whereas the other four reporters yield less protein than 1% of GFP0D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>). To assess whether mRNA abundance correlates with protein abundance for each reporter, we performed quantitative RT-PCR in each transgenic GFP line and normalized the mRNA abundance to that of GFP0D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1S</xref>). Overall, these values show a consistent trend between mRNA and protein abundance for each reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R vs. S</xref>), suggesting that inclusion of rare codons impacts both protein and RNA abundance for these reporters.</p><p>While it is not surprising that there would be a rare codon threshold beyond which proteins are no longer produced, what is surprising is the magnitude of the differences in protein production (from robust to barely/not detectable) over a narrow range of rare codon usage. A 50% increase in rare codon usage between <italic>GFP0D</italic> and <italic>GFP50D</italic> causes a 50% reduction in protein levels. Yet an additional 10% increase in rare codon usage between <italic>GFP50D</italic> and <italic>GFP60Dv1</italic> decreases detectable protein by 99.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the steep decline in protein levels between 50 and 60% dispersed rare codons is robust and reproducible, we independently designed two more 60% dispersed rare codon reporters. These reporters, <italic>GFP60Dv2</italic> and <italic>GFP60Dv3</italic>, contain rare codons that differ in sequence/position from <italic>GFP60Dv1</italic>. All three GFP60D reporters show the same fluorescence pattern (no detectable GFP), and when protein levels are compared to GFP50D by western blot we again observe a decrease in protein levels of at least 99.5%, with a 99.85 decrease on average across all three GFP60D reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâG and R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Overall, our results indicate there is a narrowly defined window of rare codon content in which protein production drops from robust to barely detectable/none.</p><p>We next put our observed cliff-like decline in protein levels from reporters in context with endogenous <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> gene sequences. To look at the codon usage of endogenous genes, we turned to the well-established Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) as a metric for measuring codon usage optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharp and Li, 1986</xref>). CAI calculates the degree of optimal codon usage in a transcript based on the usage frequency of that codon in a reference set of genes. Higher CAI scores indicate more common codon usage, where a score of 1 indicates a transcript only uses the most common codons for each amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). We plotted the CAI values of each individual transcript in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>, Methods). We similarly computed the CAI values for each of our codon-modified <italic>GFP</italic> reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>).</p><p>Comparing CAI values between reporters and endogenous genes reveals a striking cliff-like protein expression limit imparted by rare codons. This limit is reflected in the all-or-none expression pattern of our reporters. The lowest CAI of any reporter (<italic>GFP50D</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) with detectable fluorescence resides near the limit of CAI for endogenously expressed genes (only above the CAI of 2% of all expressed genes- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref><bold>, see left boundary of gray rectangle</bold>). Below the CAI value of <italic>GFP50D</italic>, none (0/13) of our reporters are expressed at the level of detectable fluorescence, and only two of these reporters produce protein detectable by western blot at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We note that we find no correlation between mRNA or protein length and CAI in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>)<italic>,</italic> in contrast to a previous study comparing frequency of optimal codons to protein length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duret and Mouchiroud, 1999</xref>). Our findings suggest that for endogenous genes in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> a limit on robust rare codon-derived protein expression is in the range of 50â60% rare codon usage or between CAI scores of 0.61 and 0.57. This limit is experimentally validated by the failure of 13/13 transgenic reporters below this range to produce appreciable levels of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and is reflected by the rarity of endogenous genes at or below this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1T</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The testis and brain robustly express rare codon-enriched reporters</title><p>While overall we observe a cliff-like threshold in reporter GFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), none of the clustered rare codon reporters reside within our determined CAI-dependent limit to be detected by fluorescence. Given this, we generated another clustered codon reporter (<italic>GFP54C3â</italic>). In designing <italic>GFP54C3â</italic>, we clustered all of the rare codons in the 3â end of the coding sequence and used only the most common or most rare codons for each amino acid. Compared to <italic>GFP50D,</italic> this design increased rare codon content while maintaining a higher overall CAI score (0.64, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>GFP54C3â</italic> falls near the limit of CAI for endogenously expressed <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes, ranking higher than just 5% of endogenous transcripts. Unlike the all-or-none expression pattern of the reporters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, GFP54C3â shows no signal in most of the animal but has a robust GFP fluorescence in two distinct areas of the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To assess whether the tissue-specific expression of GFP54C3â is due to an unknown sequence motif, we generated an entirely different reporter with similar sequence parameters. To do so, we generated a hybrid <italic>mCherry/GFP</italic> reporter. Both <italic>mCherry</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> are similar in size (708 and 717 nucleotides, respectively). Since the rare codons in <italic>GFP54C3â</italic> are clustered towards the 3â end, we designed <italic>mGFP100Dv1</italic>, where we redesigned <italic>GFP100D</italic> by creating a fusion protein linked to a 5â <italic>mCherry</italic> sequence (Methods). This <italic>mCherry</italic> is naturally enriched in common codons, and the fusion to <italic>GFP100D</italic> creates a reporter with a CAI similar to <italic>GFP54C3â</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). mGFP100Dv1 rescues the lack of expression seen with GFP100D in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Using further altered versions of this hybrid mCherry/GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, Methods), we ruled out that the tissue-specific rescue of expression is due to an unknown sequence motif in the mCherry or fusion linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâG</xref>). We also examined the sequences of all reporters for co-occurring codon pairs known to impact translation fidelity, such as AGG and CGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Letzring et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanjaard and van Duin, 1988</xref>), and find no predictive pattern in their occurrence between our tissue-specific and non-tissue-specific reporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Having established that tissue specificity can be achieved using multiple different coding sequences, we next determined which tissues express rare codon-enriched GFP54C3â and mGFP100Dv1. In larvae, we dissected out the two bright tissues from mGFP100DV1. In doing so, we noticed that male larvae always have two bright tissues, whereas female larvae always have one. Our dissections revealed this difference to be because mGFP100DV1 expresses brightly in the larval testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) but is not detectable in larval ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The other mGFP100DV1 bright tissue, in common to both female and male mGFP100DV1 larvae, is the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Together, our results reveal that, within a narrow range of 50â60% rare codons, a select few tissues are capable of robustly producing protein from rare codon-enriched transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>We next turned to adult animals, to assess if the distinct testis and brain expression carries forward to this stage. We used a combination of fluorescence microscopy of isolated tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâLâ</xref>) and quantitative western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>, Methods). This analysis again revealed that the testis and brain express mGFP100Dv1 with the testis having the strongest relative protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F and M</xref>). Further, we find that other tissues, such as the ovary and male accessory glands, do not express this reporter at a detectable level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H and M</xref>). Conversely, common codon-enriched GFP0D is readily detectible, albeit at different cell type-specific levels in all adult tissues examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD and M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

There is no statistically significant difference in protein levels between GFP0D and mGFP100Dv1 for both testis and brain in adult males, consistent with these tissues having a distinctly higher tolerance for rare codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). In contrast, both the ovary and accessory gland produce mGFP100Dv1 protein at levels less than or equal to 2% that of GFP0D protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), consistent with a lower rare codon tolerance in these (and most other) <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). While we do not observe differences in the ability of the brain to express rare codon-enriched reporters between sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), the testis but not the ovary robustly expresses protein derived from rare codon-enriched reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). One possible explanation for the tissue-specific differences in protein expression could be differences in the strength of the <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promoter in each tissue. However, our fluorescence-based approach suggested this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD</xref>,). We further assessed this by examining the levels of GFP0D (all common codons) by western blot in each tissue. Interestingly, the ovary expresses GFP0D at similar levels to the testis, yet rare codon-enriched mGFP100Dv1 is expressed 100-fold higher in the testis than in the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This confirms that promoter strength is not a confounding variable. A second confounding variable could be chromatin context. To assess if testis and brain specificity of an mGFP100D reporter still occurs when integrated at a different locus, we integrated a reporter with similar codon content (mGFP100Dv8) into the <italic>attP2</italic> locus on chromosome 3, and again observed the same testis and brain specificity of this rare codon-enriched reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight striking differences between <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, most notably between the male and female gonad, with regards to rare codon-derived protein expression.</p><p>Our findings on rare codon-derived protein expression at a whole tissue level, which are most pronounced in the testis, prompted us to further examine which specific cell types in the testis can robustly express rare codon-enriched reporters. Multiple cell types comprise the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, including both somatic and germline cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fairchild et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herrera and Bach, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>). To determine which specific cell types express protein from rare codon-enriched reporters, we used cell type-specific antibodies and assessed co-localization with rare codon-enriched GFP54C3â. Male germ cells (Vasa positive) and the somatic hub cells (FasIII positive), which comprise the male germline stem cell niche, robustly express GFP54C3â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3IâJâ</xref>), whereas somatic cyst cells that encapsulate the germline cells (Eya positive) do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and Kâ</xref>). Importantly, somatic cyst cells robustly express common codon-enriched GFP0D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and Lâ</xref>), indicating that the <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promoter is active in this cell type. Thus, both the male germ cells and the specialized somatic cells of the male germline stem cell niche express protein derived from a rare codon-enriched reporter, while the larger population of somatic cyst cells lack this capability. Together, we find a striking difference between male and female gonads in the expression of protein from rare codon-enriched genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct regulation of rare codon-enriched mRNAs in the testis of flies and humans</title><p>Our observed tissue-specific protein expression of rare codon-enriched reporters in the testis and brain could be primarily driven at the protein level, but could also be regulated at the level of mRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Radhakrishnan and Green, 2016</xref>).

Alternatively, translational repression mechanisms can act independently of mRNA stability, further complicating the relationship between codon optimality and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freimer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed whether reporter protein abundance reflects mRNA levels in different tissues. The highest mRNA level for mGFP100Dv1 is found in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). Further, mRNA levels of mGFP100Dv1 and GFP0D are nearly identical in the testis. This result matches our finding at the protein level in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M vs. N</xref>). mGFP100Dv1 mRNA is also detected in several other tissues, but at a reduced level relative to GFP0D. Specifically, we detect mGFP100Dv1 mRNA in the ovary (50% of GFP0D levels), brain (30% of GFP0D), and accessory gland (10% of GFP0D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>). Among the non-testis tissues examined, only the brain appears able to convert this mRNA into abundant protein. This result is most apparent when plotting the relative translation efficiency (TE) of mGFP100Dv1 in each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>). In contrast, the ovary is capable of accumulating mGFP100Dv1 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>), but translation is impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M and O</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that both mRNA abundance (from the combined effects of transcription/mRNA decay) and translation efficiency of rare codon-enriched reporters are impacted by tissue context. Further, these mRNA results support our finding that, relative to all other tissues examined, gene expression in the testis is less impacted by codon bias.</p><p>Mechanistically, each tissue could process the <italic>GFP</italic> reporter pre-mRNA differently, accounting for different protein abundances. To explore this possibility, we assayed for the presence of four possible alternatively spliced m<italic>GFP100Dv1</italic> mRNAs that could be produced from our transgene in each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A,B</xref>). We observe no obvious difference in mRNA processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Hence, mRNA processing does not appear to substantially contribute to tissue-specific differences for our codon-altered reporters. We next sought to put our findings with synthetic reporter mRNA levels and codon content in context with endogenous genes. Many established bioinformatic metrics related to codon usage such as the species-specific tRNA Adaptation Index (stAI), which utilizes tRNA gene copy numbers to predict translation efficiency, reflect variables that do not change within an organismâs tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sabi and Tuller, 2014</xref>). And indeed, we do not observe differences in stAI between <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we developed a modification to the CAI to create a new codon usage metric that reflects codon usage among highly expressed mRNAs that are enriched in a specific tissue. We term this metric tissue-apparent CAI (taCAI). In developing taCAI, we first defined tissue-specific gene sets from publicly available tissue-specific <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAseq datasets (<bold>Methods</bold>) for each tissue using cutoffs based on relative expression levels (<bold>Methods</bold>). From these tissue-specific gene sets, we then took the 300 most enriched genes for each of 12 adult tissues and obtained the usage frequency for each codon within that set of over-represented genes. The codon usage frequencies for each coding sequence in the genome were then compared against usage frequencies within the tissue-specific gene set to obtain a spread of taCAI values visualized as violin plots. Low taCAI values indicate that mRNAs expressed in a tissue are enriched for rare codons, while high taCAI values indicate that mRNAs expressed in a tissue are enriched for common codons. We calculated taCAI for individual adult tissues in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> for which RNAseq data exists in FlyAtlas2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krause et al., 2022</xref>; <bold>Methods</bold>).</p><p>When visualizing the taCAI distributions for each tissue as a violin plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we notice a clear tissue-specific trend. The testis and accessory gland, both parts of the male reproductive system, are highly enriched for mRNAs with abundant rare codon usage relative to all other tissues and to the transcriptome as a whole. We note that the accessory gland does not accumulate rare codon-enriched reporters, and the brain does not have a particularly high taCAI (see <bold>Discussion</bold>). In the testis, our computational findings with taCAI match our experimental results using rare codon-enriched <italic>GFP</italic> reporters. Taken together, our results show that among the tissues examined, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis accumulates by far the highest mRNA and protein levels for a rare codon-enriched reporter.

From these examples, we chose a candidate gene. The gene encoding the testis-specific ribosomal subunit RpL10Aa has the second largest difference in CAI between parent and child gene of any young retrotransposition-mediated duplication in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The ancestral copy of <italic>RpL10Aa, RpL10A</italic>, is a highly conserved member of the 60 s ribosomal subunit. Within the subgenus <italic>Sophophora,</italic> approximately 10 million years ago a gene duplication event, likely mediated by retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marygold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), gave rise to two isoforms in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This duplication produced a parent gene copy, <italic>RpL10Ab</italic>, and a child copy <italic>RpL10Aa</italic>. We chose to study <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> because of its young evolutionary age, and because of the striking differences in codon usage and tissue expression pattern between <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> and the parent gene <italic>RpL10Ab. RpL10Aa</italic> is highly enriched in rare codons (CAI 0.66) placing it in the rarest 8% of genes organism-wide, is testis-specific in expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and is very highly expressed in the testis, ranking in the top 2.5% of all genes expressed in the testis. In contrast, <italic>RpL10Ab</italic> has very few rare codons (CAI 0.82), ranking it above 95% of genes organism-wide, and is expressed relatively uniformly throughout the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). That such a drastic reduction in codon bias coupled with high testis-specific gene expression occurred over a short evolutionary period suggests that rare codons may have been positively selected for in <italic>RpL10Aa</italic>.</p><p>To examine the role of rare codon enrichment in a young testis gene, we analyzed protein levels for both an endogenous <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> sequence (<italic>RpL10Aa Endo</italic>) and a codon optimized <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> sequence with all common codons (<italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic>). We did this by placing both coding sequences behind the same <italic>ubiquitin</italic> promoter used for our organism-wide GFP reporter screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To specifically measure RpL10Aa protein from transgenes and not from the endogenous gene locus, we included an N-terminal 3x-FLAG tag in both the endogenous and codon optimized <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> sequences. By western blot, we observe that our ectopically expressed transgenes could be detected in not only the testis, but also the ovary, gut, and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that the endogenous codon content of <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> alone is not sufficient to restrict gene expression to the testis when driven by a strong ectopic promoter. In comparing RpL10Aa Endo and Com protein levels, we find that RpL10Aa Com protein is 2-fold higher than RpL10Aa Endo protein in both testis and in ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These measurements establish that codon optimization increases protein abundance from an ectopic <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> gene, both in the testis (where <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> is highly expressed) and in the ovary (where <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> is not normally expressed).</p><p>Our previous study of codon-dependent effects of Ras signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified profound phenotypic differences of a 2-fold, codon-dependent increase in protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawyer et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, while generating stable lines expressing ectopic <italic>RpL10Aa</italic>, we noticed that <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> animals are much less fertile than <italic>RpL10Aa Endo</italic> animals. We hypothesized that female fertility but not male fertility is impacted by codon optimization of the <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> coding sequence, given the tissue specificity of <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> mRNA expression from its endogenous locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To evaluate male and female fertility for <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> and <italic>RpL10Aa Endo</italic> animals, we performed reciprocal single fly crosses between our transgenic flies and wildtype flies. Throughout the course of our fertility assay, we observed high female lethality in <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> animals (11/30 females, 1/10 males) and low lethality in <italic>RpL10Aa Endo</italic> animals (2/10 females, 0/10 males). Only crosses where both parents survived the duration of the study were analyzed with respect to fertility. We observe no difference in male fertility between endogenous and codon optimized <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> animals when crossed to wildtype females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). For the reciprocal cross (wildtype males crossed to transgenic females), we instead observe drastic differences in female fertility between reporters. <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> females produced just 6 viable offspring on average compared with <italic>RpL10Aa Endo</italic> females, which produced on average 452 viable offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To more closely examine the cause of female infertility in <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> females, we examined adult ovary morphology. While early (pre-stage 8) ovarioles appear normal, stage 8â10 ovarioles of <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> animals contain numerous pyknotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GâI</xref>). Therefore, optimizing codon content of <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> in an ectopic reporter context specifically disrupts female (not male) fertility, due to disrupted oogenesis (see <bold>Discussion</bold>).</p><p>Our findings suggest that optimizing codons in <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> increases RpL10Aa protein expression in both testis and ovary, but only the ovary is negatively impacted. This could be partly because (as suggested by RNAseq, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the testis naturally accumulates (and tolerates) a high level of <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> mRNA, whereas the ovary does not. To assay the relative mRNA abundance of endogenous vs. codon-optimized <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> in our transgenic animals, we measured the relative amount of endogenous and codon-optimized <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> mRNA in both testis and ovary. In these experiments, we used primers that simultaneously detect both possible forms of mRNA from endogenous <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> sequence (both transgenic <italic>RpL10Aa Endo</italic> mRNA and <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> mRNA from the endogenous locus). We separately examined <italic>RpL10Aa Com</italic> mRNA using primers specific to mRNA from this transgene. Whereas the ovary has a lower ratio of endogenous to common <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> mRNA, the testis has the reverse- a higher level of endogenous to common <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). We interpret this to reflect the high level of endogenous <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> already present in the testis. Taken together, our findings illustrate an important role for rare codons in tissue-specific gene expression and imply that rare codons in the normally testis-specific gene <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> help to preserve fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Redundancy of the genetic code has long been a mystery of the central dogma of molecular biology. Here, we use <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to uncover distinct tissue-specific responses to the same genetic code. Our work uncovers fundamental aspects of rare codon biology. We reveal a cliff-like limit on rare codon usage per gene. Near the boundaries of this limit, however, we demonstrate that individual tissues have different tolerances for protein expression from genes enriched in rare codons. Tissues with a high tolerance for rare codons include the brain of both sexes and the testis, but not the ovary. Taking a closer look at the testis, we find the male germ cells and somatic cells of the germline stem cell niche of the testis robustly express protein from rare codon-enriched reporters, while the somatic cyst cells do not. In developing a new metric for tissue-specific codon usage, taCAI, we reveal endogenous genes in the testis of both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans show an abundance of rare codon-enriched mRNAs, suggesting that rare codon-enriched genes play an essential and conserved role in testis biology. In search of a physiologically relevant role for rare codon tolerance in testis biology, we demonstrate that endogenously rare codons may restrict the expression and function of the evolutionarily young gene <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> to the testis. Codon optimization of an <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> transgene disrupts female fertility and organism viability. Taken together, our results uncover clear tissue-specific differences in the impact of codon usage bias and partially support a novel role for rare codons in restricting the expression of evolutionarily young genes to the testis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Codon bias as an important parameter for organism-wide and tissue-specific mRNA and protein expression</title><p>Here, our sensitive reporter-based approach suggests a strong correlation between CAI and reporter GFP abundance in whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> (R<sup>2</sup>=0.82, p&lt;0.0001). We note that previous data from bioinformatic approaches in human tissues are conflicting regarding correlations between CAI and tissue-specific mRNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plotkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">SÃ©mon et al., 2006</xref>). Further, similar bioinformatic studies suggested only weak codon-dependent differences between tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Payne et al., 2019</xref>). The sensitivity of our reporter and the ability of our expression platform to rapidly test various sequences over a narrow CAI range proved helpful in defining rare codon limits for protein expression, which closely mirror existing mRNA expression data for the testis. Our study reveals a strict limit to rare codon usage on a genomic scale. This limit could reflect the tipping point in rare codon usage before competition between transcription and mRNA decay favors degradation over translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also observe clear differences in the impact of codon usage bias between <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues. Importantly, we show how distinct tissues respond differently to the same genetic code. It is well appreciated that tissue-specific chromatin environments play critical roles in transcriptional regulation. Our findings here suggest that tissue-specific tolerances for rare codons play a similar role at the levels of translation and transcription/mRNA decay. There are several likely candidate mechanisms underlying tissue-specific impacts of codon bias, including differences in levels of RNA decay machinery or tRNAs between tissues. Several RNA decay pathways have been linked to rare codon usage and would be of interest to follow up on in our system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Radhakrishnan et al., 2016</xref>). Levels of expressed tRNAs have been previously measured in <italic>Drosophila</italic> at the organismal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moriyama and Powell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">White and Tener, 1973</xref>), but not at the level of individual tissues. Quantifying tRNA expression is not the same as measuring tRNA activity, however, as tRNAs exhibit rigid folding structure, distinct amino acid carrying status when active, and require post transcriptional modifications. The contribution of tRNA regulation to tissue-specific codon bias regulation can be explored further in the future.</p><p>We note that mechanisms, which lead to rare codon mRNA/protein accumulation, may be distinct in different tissues. For example, our taCAI analysis of RNAseq data revealed that the testis but not the brain is enriched for mRNAs with abundant rare codons. Recent work by other groups, however, demonstrates that rare codons have less influence on mRNA stability in central nervous system compared to whole embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burow et al., 2018</xref>), supporting our reporter-based finding here that the brain has unique biology pertaining to rare codons. In addition, we find that while the testis is capable of translating <italic>GFP0D</italic> and <italic>mGFP100Dv1</italic> mRNA with relatively equal efficiency, the brain appears to translate <italic>mGFP100Dv1</italic> even more efficiently than <italic>GFP0D</italic>. This suggests that the brain may have specialized translational machinery or tRNA pools better adapted to rare codons than to common ones, whereas the testis is equally adapted to both rare and common codon pools. Further, while the accessory gland did not robustly express our rare codon-enriched reporters, our taCAI analysis suggests this male reproductive tissue is also enriched in mRNAs with abundant rare codons. Now that we have pinpointed interesting differences between the male reproductive tract, brain, and other tissues, these differences can be exploited in future studies to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Rare codons and gene evolution: a potential role for the testis</title><p>Here, we find a conserved enrichment for rare codons in testis-specific genes. Further, we demonstrate a role for rare codons in the evolutionarily young <italic>RpL10Aa</italic>, a known testis-specific gene. Optimizing the codon sequence of this testis-specific gene causes ectopic high expression in the ovary and results in female infertility. Specifically, the ovary is known to activate a mid-oogenesis apoptotic checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pritchett et al., 2009</xref>), and our observed phenotypes are consistent with ectopic codon-optimized <italic>RpL10Aa</italic> disrupting mid-oogenesis. We note that our <italic>ubi</italic>- promoter is stronger in the soma than the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), which may suggest a somatic origin of the phenotypes we observe. We speculate that ectopic RpL10Aa protein in the ovary may act as a dominant negative relative to the function of the parent gene <italic>RpL10Ab</italic> (64% identity between these proteins), which is required for female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wonglapsuwan et al., 2011</xref>).

This hypothesis proposes that the testis acts as a âgene nurseryâ to promote evolution and neofunctionalization of young genes through its permissive expression environment and intense selective pressures from both mate and sperm competition. This is based on observations that testes are the fastest evolving tissue and that young genes are often restricted in expression to the testis and gain broader expression patterns as they age.</p><p>While the current model is that permissive chromatin states passively allow expression of young genes resulting from retrotransposition events specifically in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaessmann, 2010</xref>). Here, we suggest that rare codon content may also fulfill this role and could be positively selected for an evolutionarily young genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Male-biased genes have also been characterized to have rarer codon usage than female-biased genes and non-sex-biased genes in numerous plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darolti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whittle et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hambuch and Parsch, 2005</xref>), and have rarer codon usage than non-sex-biased genes in zebrafish and stickleback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our findings may be widely applicable to sexually reproducing species across phylogenetic kingdoms. Taken together, we highlight codon usage as a critical and under-appreciated aspect of tissue-specific gene regulation that merits greater attention, notably in the fields of evolutionary and developmental biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Total protein was quantified using Revert700 Total Protein Stain Kit (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturerâs protocol for single channel imaging. For normalization, we note that total protein stain was superior to antibodies against single housekeeping genes (Tubulin) due to variable expression of these proteins between tissues. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, Invitrogen, cat#A11122), anti-FLAG M2 (1:500, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, cat#F1804), IRDye 800CW (1:10,000, LI-COR Biosciences, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse).

We defined genes as being tissue-specific in <italic>Drosophila</italic> if they were highly expressed in the tissue of interest, and not highly expressed in any other tissue. Specifically, genes had to be among the top 40% of genes expressed in the tissue of interest and excluded from the top 25% of genes expressed in any other tissue analyzed. We chose a thresholding, rather than a fold change, approach to determine tissue specificity. This was because some tissues have a much higher raw expression value than others (the median expression value is more than double for one tissue vs. another tissue in some cases), which confounds fold change approaches. We chose to analyze the 300 most enriched tissue-specific genes per tissue because any value higher than 300 prevented us from examining an equal number of genes in each tissue. Applying the same gene selection filter to human tissues revealed that testis genes were most enriched in rare codons among the 37 tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), however, the 3-fold larger number of tissues in humans compared to flies (37 vs. 12) prompted us to explore additional, more stringent cutoffs of tissue specificity for the human data. Towards this end, we defined genes as being tissue-specific in human if they were highest expressed in the tissue of interest and had a TPM &lt;1 in all other tissues analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Codon usage frequency was calculated using the Kazusa Countcodon program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/countcodon.html">https://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/countcodon.html</ext-link>).

The distribution of taCAI values for a given tissue can be visualized as a violin plot and these distributions can be compared between tissues.

For whole larval measurements of GFP reporter mRNA, WL3 larvae heterozygous for the indicated reporter and <italic>GFP0D</italic> were raised at 25 Â°C on standard fly medium. Where applicable, dissections were performed in RNase-free phosphate buffered saline and completed in under 2 hr. After dissection, tissues were immediately homogenized in TRIzol reagent (N=10 animals per tissue per replicate, 500 Âµl TRIzol reagent) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at â80 Â°C. For whole larval samples, five WL3 larvae were homogenized in 500 Âµl TRIzol reagent. RNA was purified according to the manufacturerâs protocol, using glycogen as a carrier and resuspending in molecular grade water. RNA was then treated with DNase I at room temp for 15 min before terminating the reaction by adding 2.5 mM EDTA and incubating at 65 Â°C for 10 min then storing at â80 Â°C. Quantification of RNA was performed on either a NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Qubit 3 fluorometer and samples were diluted to match the concentration of the lowest concentration sample. Equal amounts of RNA for all samples directly compared to one another were simultaneously transcribed into cDNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, cat#170â8891) according to the manufacturerâs protocol within 7 days of the initial dissections to preserve sample quality. No Reverse Transcriptase (NRT) controls were also run simultaneously for each sample to control for genomic DNA contamination. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was run simultaneously on all samples compared to one another, corresponding NRT controls, and No Template Controls (NTC) for each primer pair using Luna Universal qCPR Master Mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, #M3003) following the manufacturerâs protocol (1 Âµl cDNA per 10 Âµl reaction). A CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD) was used for cDNA amplification and detection of FAM/SYBR Green fluorescence. qRT-PCR run data was analyzed using BIO-RAD CFX Manager software. Primer sequences are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. Primer binding efficiencies were analyzed over a wide range of genomic DNA template concentrations. We note that primers against 0D, 30D, 50D, 60Dv1, 70D, 100D, 50C5â, and mGFP100Dv1 had near identical binding efficiencies, whereas primers against 60Dv2, 60Dv3, 80D, 90D, 50C3â, 60C3â, 70C3â, 80C3â, and 90C3â had slightly higher binding efficiencies. Amplification curves for all samples had characteristic S-shapes and each qPCR primer pair yielded a single melting peak. All cDNA samples reached threshold several cycles earlier than NRT and NTC controls, except whole larval 80D, which was within one cycle of the detection limit. For detection of tissue-specific <italic>mGFP100Dv1</italic> mRNA levels, three technical replicates for all samples yielded very consistent CT values. A single testis sample, however, yielded an outlier delta CT value (<italic>mGFP100Dv1</italic> minus <italic>GFP0D</italic>, Tukeyâs multiple comparisons, p&lt;0.0001), and was removed from the analysis after bleach-agarose electrophoresis revealed that this sample lacked detectable RNA. For tissue-specific detection of <italic>RpL10Aa-Endo</italic> and <italic>RpL10Aa-Com</italic>, and for whole larvae detection of GFP reporters, two technical replicates yielded consistent CT values.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yi Liu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the reported results are significant in providing evidence that differences in codon optimality in mRNAs can underlie tissue-specific differences in expression and that this phenomenon operates in restricting expression of an evolutionarily young endogenous gene to the testis versus ovaries in a manner important for female fertility in the fruit fly. At the same time, each noted that the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been probed, and that the scientific quality of the work would be enhanced considerably by additional experiments to determine whether the differences in expression arise primarily at the translational level or also/rather involve altered mRNA turnover or transcription in response to poor codon usage outside of testis and brain. To this end, the authors are requested to (i) provide measurements of reporter mRNA abundance in parallel with their measurements of reporter protein expression throughout the work; (ii) establish that the lengths of the mGFP100DV1 and RPL10a_endo reporter transcripts do not vary between testis and ovary; (iii) verify that the Rpl10A_endo reporter is expressed selectively in testis by examining its expression in other tissues beside testis and ovaries. In addition to performing these additional experiments/analyses, the authors should address all of the other comments of the referees by adding the appropriate additional analyses or making the necessary revisions of text or figures.

It seems easier to imagine that it is the number of rare codons encountered during translation of an mRNA that contribute cumulatively to translational repression/mRNA decay. If so, short mRNAs with a high percentage of rare codons might be expressed above the 50% threshold because they can be completely translated without encountering the threshold number of rare codons.

Tissue-specific genes are normally thought to be genes whose expression levels are much higher in minority of tissues than those in other tissues. Are mRNA fold-changes a better approach to determine tissue-specific genes? In the main text, it is stated that &quot;we then took the 300 most enriched genes for each of 12 adult tissues&quot;.

We also detail our methods used to analyze the 5â and 3âUTRs in the methods section of our revised manuscripts. We note that we did not directly examine mRNA length of RpL10Aa Endo, as this construct was cloned into the identical vector as all other constructs, and therefore we do not anticipate differential UTR processing between tissues for this inserted sequence. However, as detailed in our response to major reviewer question (iii), we do include new mRNA expression data for RPL10Aa Endo in the revised manuscript.

As this is construct has an ectopic reporter/chromatin context, we do not necessarily expect its expression to be restricted to the testis. Along these lines, in the previous version of the manuscript, we showed that ectopically driven FLAG-RpL10Aa_endo protein is found in the ovary. Further, as requested by reviewers, we add new data on FLAG-RpL10Aa_endo protein expression in two settings beyond the testis and ovary, namely the gut and head (see revised Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). This reviewer comment also pointed out to us that we should emphasize that our data on RpL10Aa rare codons really speak to function and not necessarily to restricted expression (given our use of an ectopic expression system). We have revised/clarified the text accordingly.</p><p>Further, and in line with reviewer major point (i), we did not provide information on testis protein expression for FLAG-RpL10Aa_endo in the previous manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we now add new data showing the relative protein expression of FLAG-RpL10Aa_endo and FLAG-RpL10Aa_common in the testis, paired with our previous data on protein expression of these constructs in the ovary (see revised Figure 5E). Additionally, as requested under major reviewer comment (i), we pair these data with new data showing the relative mRNA expression for RpL10Aa_endo and RpL10Aa_common in both the ovary and testis (see revised Figure 5J). Overall, our new data strengthen the conclusion that codon optimization of RpL10Aa increases its expression, and in the ovary this optimization causes female sterility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>â Perhaps the authors would consider inverting the scale for the new taCAI metric so that the values would be lower than average, rather than higher than average, for tissues where the most abundant mRNAs tend to have low versus high CAI values.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

Additionally, as requested, we add to the revised manuscript a discussion of the study by Duret et al., (1999), suggesting that in some species there may be a correlation between long mRNAs and abundant rare codons.

This similar result with different reporters is despite GFP54C3â being roughly half the size and a having a very different total abundance of rare codons compared to mGFP100Dv1.

Regarding this question on mRNA abundance, we first wish to point out that our criteria to define an mRNA as tissue specific resulted in many tissues having less than 400 such genes. Hence, 500 genes was not possible and we settled on 300. We chose a thresholding, rather than a fold change approach, to determine tissue specificity. This was because some tissues have a much higher raw expression value than others (the median value is more than double for one tissue vs. another tissue in some cases), which confounds fold change approaches. We revised the text to expand on these important points for mRNA selection criteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4. It is unclear why a new metrics needs to used.

We can understand that there are many metrics out there and there should be a good justification to add a new one. To make this point clearer, we added additional justification of our development of taCAI to the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Despite caveats with these data, our analysis supports our RNAseq-based conclusions, namely that the testis has an abundance of proteins with low CAI. Thank you to the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 1E.

It was recently shown in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells that the codon usage effect on mRNA expression level is promoter-dependent (Yang et al., 2021 NAR).

These new data show that our exogenous reporter expression is not specific to the testis. From these data, we conclude that even a modest codon-dependent increase in RpL10Aa protein in the ovary has detrimental impacts on female fertility. As discussed below for reviewer 3- comment #2, we add new data to revised Figure 5, which further reveals that the modest codon-dependent increase in RpL10Aa protein expression causes massive disruption of oogenesis.</p><p>Further, as requested and as already discussed above for major reviewer point (i), we now add new data to Figure 5 on mRNA measurements in the testis and ovary of RpL10Aa endo and RpL10Aa common. We note in the revised text that the way we performed these measurements for RpL10Aa endo will simultaneously detect both endogenous and transgenic RpL10Aa. Indeed, we detect a much higher level of RpL10Aa endo in the testis relative to RpL10Aa common, likely reflecting the abundance of non-transgenic RpL10Aa endo in the testis. This trend (more endo than common) is not seen in the ovary. When we take all of our data on mRNA and protein expression together for RpL10Aa, it supports a model whereby common codons from an exogenous transgene cause a modest increase in ovarian expression of RpL10Aa, taking it above a threshold of expression that correlates with massive disruption of oogenesis and female fertility. We expand our discussion of these results in the revised text.</p><p>Despite the massive phenotypic differences that we observe between RpL10Aa_endo and RpL10Aa_common, the reviewer is correct that the expression differences are modest.

This exogenous construct was expressed from the same Ubi promoter as our GFP constructs. Per your subsequent comment (reviewer 3 comment #4), we provide new data showing that at all stages of oogenesis that we examined, both follicle cells and nurse cells clearly express Ubi-driven transgenes, though the somatic follicle cells express such transgenes at a higher level (Figure 3 Figure Supplement 1C). Therefore, we conclude that RpL10Aa com is expressed in both somatic and germline cells. We have added new discussion of this expression pattern to the revised text.</p><p>Regarding phenotypes of the sterile animals, in response we now provide new data in revised Figure 5G-I, showing that stage 8-10 ovaries expressing RpL10Aa-com exhibit a massive increase in pyknotic nuclei, whereas earlier stage ovaries appear normal.
