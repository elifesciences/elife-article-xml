After initial work by Emile Maupas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maupas, 1900</xref>) and Victor Nigon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nigon, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nigon et al., 1960</xref>) on its mode of reproduction, meiosis and development, experiments by Sydney Brenner and collaborators in the 1960s and 1970s raised <italic>C. elegans</italic> to the status of a premier model organism. Besides its genome, the first to be sequenced for a multicellular organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998</xref>), an extensive body of knowledge is now available on the molecular, cellular, developmental and behavioral biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">The C. elegans Research Community</xref>) of this organism. A number of key discoveries have been made by studying <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conradt and Xue, 2005</xref>) and gene silencing by small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Grishok, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> reference strain N2 is a laboratory animal. This strain, originally isolated in Bristol, England, was cultured in the laboratory for many years before it was first frozen. Its laboratory environment consisted of agar plates seeded with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a food source. <italic>E. coli</italic> was used because, as another model organism, it was already available in many laboratories—not because it was originally associated with wild <italic>C. elegans</italic>. An independent subculture from the same wild Bristol isolate was maintained in liquid axenic culture, and by comparing both strains, we now know of several mutations that appeared and were fixed in the N2 lineage, some of which appear adaptive in the agar plate environment. These mutations pleiotropically affect many traits, such as behavior, reproduction, susceptibility to pathogens, body size and entry into the dauer stage (where <italic>C. elegans</italic> undergo developmental arrest at the third larval stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duveau and Félix, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Green et al., 2014</xref>). Like other model organisms, <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 has thus been modified by domestication.</p><p>For a century, the only information available on the natural history of <italic>C. elegans</italic> was that it could be found in compost heaps and in rich humus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hodgkin and Doniach, 1997</xref>). From 2000 onward, this began to change when researchers embarked on an extensive sampling of wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations. Their efforts were motivated by wanting to develop <italic>C. elegans</italic> into a model organism for evolutionary biology and ecology research, which could also leverage the tools and knowledge already acquired for this species. In turn, exploring the natural history of <italic>C. elegans</italic> provides a context for, and also informs, basic biological research conducted with this organism, such as studies of its genome, development, behavior and immune system. In this article, we summarize our current knowledge of the natural history of this <italic>C. elegans</italic>, show how the isolation of natural pathogens of <italic>C. elegans</italic> informed basic biological research, and discuss a number of open questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>A rotting habitat and a boom-and-bust life cycle</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is found worldwide, predominantly in humid temperate areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 and </xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>).

Dauer larvae display active locomotion and a specific behavior called nictation, where they stand on their tail and wave their body in the air. Remarkably, dauers may also congregate to form a column and nictate as a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>) (see the video; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormatlas.org/dauer/behavior/Images/DBehaviorVID4.mov">http://www.wormatlas.org/dauer/behavior/Images/DBehaviorVID4.mov</ext-link>). These behaviors are thought to help dauers to find passing invertebrate hosts that they can use for their dispersal, such as isopods, snails and slugs. Together, dauer physiology and behavior suggest that this developmental stage plays a key role in <italic>C. elegans'</italic> stress resistance, long-distance dispersal, and possibly its overwintering capacity.</p><p>Over the year, in surveys performed in France and Germany, <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations in rotting fruits typically peak in the fall, with proliferation possible in spring through to early winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). This seasonal dynamic is consistent with that observed in a semi-natural habitat, such as a compost heap, where <italic>C. elegans</italic> population size varies over the year, from a dense population in autumn to one that declines and undergoes bottlenecks in winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrière and Félix, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>).

In natural populations, outcrossing does occur but the overall proportion of males is low, generally similar to the estimated rate of chromosomal non-disjunction measured in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrière and Félix, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cutter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>). In rare instances, outcrossing is evident from a high proportion of males or of heterozygotes in a given sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sivasundar and Hey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrière and Félix, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>).</p><p>This combination of metapopulation dynamics, a very low outcrossing rate and selection has a major impact on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrière and Félix, 2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cutter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cutter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rockman and Kruglyak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). These three factors reduce the effective population size, and thus genetic diversity, and can wipe out diversity in a large genomic region. Indeed, positively selected alleles carry with them a large part of the genome by linkage, at the scale of megabases, particularly in the center of chromosomes where recombination is low. For example, most <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates carry a recently swept genotype spanning a large part of chromosome V; several other chromosomes have also experienced detectable sweeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2012</xref>). Because of high linkage disequilibrium due to selfing, selective sweeps may cover large fractions of chromosomes and have erased much genetic diversity. Background selection (the loss of non-deleterious variants due to selection against linked deleterious alleles) may further reduce linked genetic diversity in this selfing species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rockman et al., 2010</xref>). As a consequence, genome-wide pairwise genetic diversity is low (ca. 10<sup>−3</sup>/bp), especially compared to outcrossing relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jovelin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cutter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gimond et al., 2013</xref>). Overall, this means that much of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome has been shaped by selection at linked sites, not directly by selection at the locus of interest. These extreme sweeps also mean that recent events in historical times, perhaps mediated by humans, may have had a significant impact on <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>The selfing lifestyle of <italic>C. elegans</italic> also has an impact on phenomena such as inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Most animal species that reproduce by outcrossing suffer from inbreeding depression through the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles. In a predominantly self-fertilizing organism, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, alleles are most often in a homozygous state due to repeated selfing, which allows deleterious recessive alleles to be purged by natural selection. Instead of inbreeding depression, wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> suffer from outbreeding depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dolgin et al., 2007</xref>). This phenomenon is best explained by the fact that selfing creates and maintains beneficial gene combinations, while outcrossing favors their disruption. Thus, the progeny of outcrossing are less fit than are the progeny of selfing. However, at least under certain circumstances of experimental evolution, outbreeding may contribute positively to <italic>C. elegans</italic> adaptation and inbreeding depression may reappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Teotonio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chelo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Contributing also to a reduction in effective outcrossing, <italic>C. elegans</italic> possesses a widespread genetic incompatibility system, whereby a sperm poison (PEEL-1) arrests the development of embryos that do not synthesize the antidote (ZEEL-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2011</xref>). The <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>peel-1</italic> genes are closely linked on chromosome I. The two allelic combinations, with both genes or without both genes, co-exist in the same geographical location, and the rest of the genome shows evidence of mixing. Yet this system, and other incompatibilities, may further contribute to lowering the effective outcrossing rate.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> has evolved selfing from an ancestor that reproduced through females and males (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>).

Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> males still sense female pheromones from closely related species, hermaphrodites no longer produce pheromones to attract males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chasnov and Chow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chasnov et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting a partial degeneration of hermaphrodite outcrossing. On the male side, some aspects of mating behavior also appear to have degenerated, such as the ability to deposit a copulatory plug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Palopoli et al., 2008</xref>). The effect, and the future, of males in <italic>C. elegans</italic> natural populations remains an intriguing question.</p><boxed-text id="box2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05849.007</object-id><label>Box 2.</label><caption><title>The discovery and diversity of new <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species.</title><p>Within the last 5 years, many <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species have been newly discovered, due to the collaborative, worldwide sampling of rotting fruits, flowers and stems for new <italic>C. elegans</italic> isolates and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>).

Further molecular immunity pathways will likely be unraveled by studying the interaction of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with its natural associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2014</xref>) and its corresponding natural phenotypic variation.</p><p>How <italic>C. elegans</italic> development and behavior are modulated by the environment will also be greatly enriched by a better knowledge of its natural history. A key component of its population cycles that remains to be explored is the regulation of dauer entry and exit by relevant environmental factors, besides crowding and high temperature. Behaviorally, the dauer larva has been little studied; for example, we still know little about its olfactory responses. Recent work has demonstrated the importance of a specific set of neurons (called IL2 cells) and of cholinergic transmission in controlling dauer nictation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). When present at high density, the dauers can nictate in large groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>). The mechanistic basis and environmental regulation of this host-seeking behavior are still poorly understood.</p><p>Another striking resource provided by the exploration of <italic>C. elegans</italic> natural history is the phenotypic diversity at the intra- and inter-specific level (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>). As an example, the mode of reproduction has been modified multiple times in the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. While most species reproduce through males and females, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis tropicalis</italic> are exceptions by having evolved spermatogenesis in a female soma. Phylogenetic studies and molecular dissection of germ line sex determination argue for a convergent evolution of androdioecy, three times in the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). Another opening provided by the huge rise in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species and strain collections is the ability to study reproductive isolation and speciation mechanisms in this group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Woodruff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dey et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite intense laboratory work on <italic>C. elegans</italic>, many important features of this species in the wild remain mysterious (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). We still know very little concerning this nematode's feeding, dauer entry and exit cues, migration, overwintering, and we have only just started to glimpse organisms associated with it, be they food or pathogens. A greater understanding of its natural history could greatly inform our studies of its physiology, behavior and immunity. Comparative studies between <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species also promise to provide a better understanding of the role and the evolutionary history of specific gene families and other orphan genes.</p><p>In addition, improving our understanding of <italic>C. elegans'</italic> natural history will help establish it as a model species for evolutionary and ecological studies. The diversity of modes of reproduction in the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus makes them attractive models for studies of the causes and consequences of such variation. Its boom-and-bust lifestyle is favorable for studies of <italic>C. elegans</italic> metapopulation dynamics in different environments.</p><p>To conclude, knowing more about <italic>C. elegans'</italic> life outside of the Petri dish is opening new avenues to laboratory research. As for other model organisms, it also helps us to realize how idiosyncratic some features of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 reference strain are—only a snapshot in laboratory evolution.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our colleagues from the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> evolution and ecology community for fruitful discussions and sharing.
