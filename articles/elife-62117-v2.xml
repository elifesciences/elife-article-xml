sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that preferentially removes lesions from the template-strand (t-strand) that stall RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation complexes (ECs). Mfd mediates TCR in bacteria by removing the stalled RNAP concealing the lesion and recruiting Uvr(A)BC. We used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize Mfd engaging with a stalled EC and attempting to dislodge the RNAP. We visualized seven distinct Mfd-EC complexes in both ATP and ADP-bound states. The structures explain how Mfd is remodeled from its repressed conformation, how the UvrA-interacting surface of Mfd is hidden during most of the remodeling process to prevent premature engagement with the NER pathway, how Mfd alters the RNAP conformation to facilitate disassembly, and how Mfd forms a processive translocation complex after dislodging the RNAP. Our results reveal an elaborate mechanism for how Mfd kinetically discriminates paused from stalled ECs and disassembles stalled ECs to initiate TCR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Mfd</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>transcription-coupled repair</kwd><kwd>transcription repair coupling factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM109824</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chait</surname><given-names>Brian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41 GM103314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chait</surname><given-names>Brian T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM114450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118130</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darst</surname><given-names>Seth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Seven distinct cryo-electron microscopy structures delineate the elaborate mechanism for how <italic>E. coli</italic> Mfd, a transcription repair coupling factor, disassembles the RNA polymerase transcription elongation complex to initiate transcription-coupled repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA template strand (t-strand) lesions that block elongation by RNA polymerase (RNAP), most notably UV-induced cyclobutane dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohr et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Witkin, 1966</xref>), are targeted for preferential repair in a process called transcription-coupled repair [TCR; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanawalt and Spivak, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mellon and Hanawalt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mellon et al., 1987</xref>)].

Thus, despite engaging in cycles of ATP hydrolysis, Mfd was unable to efficiently dislodge the RNAP from the nucleic acids, facilitating the visualization of intermediates.</p><p>Using image classification approaches, we visualized seven distinct Mfd-EC complexes, some with ATP and others with ADP.

Steps of maximum-likelihood classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scheres, 2012</xref>) revealed seven Mfd-EC structures (L1, L2, C1-C5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–H</xref>) ranging from 3.4 to 4.1 Å nominal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). With the exception of L1, the cryo-EM maps were of sufficient quality to directly observe bound nucleotide. Characteristics of the cryo-EM densities and of the surrounding protein structure led us to propose the nucleotide status of each structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We performed an objective, unbiased test of the proposed nucleotide identities by running identical refinements of each structure modeled with either ATP or ADP (aligned by their common atoms) and comparing the average real space correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) suggested that C1, C2, and C5 contained either ATP or ADP•P (where the hydrolyzed γ-phosphate has not been released), and that C4 contained ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>). Thus, Mfd was trapped progressing through its nucleotide hydrolysis cycle (NHC). According to our real space correlation coefficient test, the identity of the nucleotide bound to L2 and C3 was ambiguous based solely on the cryo-EM density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

As expected, all of the Mfd/DNA interactions occur through the DNA phosphate backbone.</p><p>In most of the structures, the cryo-EM density in the region around the upstream edge of the transcription bubble is poor and difficult to interpret, likely due to heterogeneity in that region. As a consequence, the precise register of the upstream duplex DNA in the models is tentative. However, gross features of the upstream DNA, such as the paths of the DNA backbone and of the overall helical axes, are clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–G</xref>). In this regard, the engagement of Mfd significantly distorts the upstream duplex DNA. Mfd induces a localized kink in the DNA, roughly centered in the footprint of the Mfd translocation module [D5(TD1)/D6(TD2)] on the DNA. The Mfd translocation module engages with the duplex DNA from the minor groove; the kink, which ranges from 7° to 15° away from Mfd, is accompanied by significant widening of the DNA minor groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3H</xref>). The entire length of the upstream duplex DNAs bends away from the Mfd translocation module by 16–45° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–G</xref>).

The backbone carbonyl of G874 and the side chains of R902 and R905 form polar interactions with the ATP γ-phosphate (denoted as gray dashed lines). In the ADP structure, these interactions are lost due to the missing γ-phosphate (denoted by the dashed red circle), causing TD2 to swing away from TD1 (denoted by the thick arrow). Here, 'polar contacts' include both hydrogen bonds (≤3.5 Å) and ionic interactions. Ionic interactions can include both close range interactions (where the hydration shells of the two oppositely charged moieties are displaced) that are typically called salt-bridges (≤3.5 Å), but can also include longer range interactions where the two oppositely charged moieties remain hydrated but their Coulombic interaction is favorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar and Nussinov, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 1997</xref>).

TD2(ATP) and TD2(ADP) are related by an ~16° rotation (denoted by the thick arrow, upper left) about an axis roughly perpendicular to the DNA helical axis (denoted by the black dot), resulting in a 3.5 Å shift of the TD2 center of mass roughly parallel to the DNA helical axis [center of mass positions for TD2(ATP) and TD2(ADP) denoted by the green and blue spheres, respectively], corresponding to one base pair rise of B-form DNA.

The TD1 superimposition yielded two discrete positions of TD2, one of which corresponded with the ATP-bound structures (C1, C2, C5; green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and the other with the ADP-bound structures (L2, C3, C4; blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). L1, the complex in which the resolution of the cryo-EM map in the region of the Mfd nucleotide binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) was insufficient to directly assign the nucleotide status, clearly groups with the ATP-bound structures (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Previous studies have established that Mfd does not stably interact with DNA in the absence of ATP or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog such as ATP-γ-S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Selby and Sancar, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Selby and Sancar, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Thus: (i) the translocation module of L1-Mfd is engaged with the DNA (see below), and so is presumably bound to ATP, and (ii) the conformational state of the L1-Mfd translocation module groups with the other ATP-bound structures, and we infer that L1 contains Mfd(ATP). As with L2(adp) and C3(adp), since we do not directly observe ATP bound to L1-Mfd from the cryo-EM density, we denote the state as L1(atp).</p><p>Mfd amino acid side chain interactions with the bound nucleotide and with the DNA are clearly observed in the cryo-EM maps of C2(ATP), C5(ATP), and C4(ADP). Some of the side chain interactions discussed below are also directly observed in the C3(adp) cryo-EM maps, but many side chains lack clear density. Because of the low resolution of the Mfd region of the cryo-EM maps of L1(atp), L2(adp), and C1(atp), cryo-EM density for Mfd side chains is generally not observed for these states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on interactions between conserved residues and the bound nucleotide or with the DNA observed in the cryo-EM maps of C2(ATP), C4(ADP), and C5(ATP), we infer that similar interactions occur in the other states with lower resolution cryo-EM maps.</p><p>In the ATP-bound structures, the carbonyl oxygen of G874 (motif V), and the side chains of R902 (motif VI) and R905 (just beyond motif VI), all in TD2, form polar interactions either hydrogen bonds (≤3.5 Å) or longer-range ion-pair interactions (≤4.5 Å); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> legend; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar and Nussinov, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu et al., 2019</xref>) with the ATP γ-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left). These three residues are absolutely conserved in an alignment of 65 Mfd sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deaconescu et al., 2006</xref>). In the absence of the γ-phosphate in the ADP structures, these interactions are lost and TD2 rotates away from TD1 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (right), 3B]. The movement of TD2 with respect to TD1 on transitioning from the ATP- to the ADP-bound state corresponds to an ~16° rotation about an axis roughly perpendicular to the helical axis of the upstream duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As a result, the center of mass of TD2 shifts parallel to the DNA helical axis about 3.5 Å in the downstream direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), corresponding to one base pair rise of B-form DNA. These observations are suggestive of an 'inchworm' model for translocation, as proposed for related SF1 helicase translocation on single-stranded nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lohman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Singleton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Velankar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yarranton and Gefter, 1979</xref>) and for Mfd based on single-molecule observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le et al., 2018</xref>). In this model (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), upon hydrolysis and release of the γ-phosphate, TD2 moves forward on the duplex DNA and forms tight interactions one base pair downstream. Next, the TD1/DNA interactions loosen and ADP must exchange for ATP in the nucleotide-binding site. This allows TD1 to close toward TD2, reestablishing interactions with the ATP γ-phosphate, now with both TD1 and TD2 translocated one base pair downstream on the duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The model predicts a translocation stepsize of one nucleotide per ATP hydrolysis cycle, consistent with measurements for SF1 helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dillingham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tomko et al., 2007</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-62117-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Mfd translocation.</title><p>The video illustrates the Mfd translocation module inchworm translocation model.

All three of these residues interact with the DNA phosphate backbone. The rotation axis of the TD2(ATP) → TD2(ADP) transition passes directly through the linker connecting the helical hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Examining the structures more closely, the structural elements of TD2 C-terminal to the linker, which includes the second TRG hairpin-helix, the TRG loop, and the hook-helix, make extensive interactions with TD1 and move with TD1 as a rigid body, while the N-terminal portion of TD2 (residues 781–939) opens and closes depending on the nucleotide status. Thus, the linker connecting the TRG helical hairpin acts as the hinge (centered near absolutely conserved G942) for the TD1/TD2 conformational change in response to nucleotide status. Opening of TD2 in the ADP state results in closing of the TRG helical-hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pathway for Mfd function</title><p>For the purpose of analyzing and discussing the structures, it is useful to place them in an ordered pathway.

The RH at the N-terminus of TD1 interacts with the hook helices at the very C-terminus of TD2.

The bottom row shows the transition through the experimental structures [L1(atp) → L2(adp) → C1(ATP)].

The large translation/rotation of Mfd D5(TD1)-D6(TD2)-D7 in the L1(atp) → L2(adp) transition must occur by clockwise corkscrewing around the DNA minor groove in order to leave behind the unfolded portion of the RH, which wraps around the DNA. The configuration of Mfd D1–D3 in L1(atp) would block this transition and also result in the entanglement of linkers; thus, we propose that this transition is facilitated by transient intermediates [L1.5a] and [L1.5b], which have been modeled with displaced Mfd D1–D3 tethered by the long linker connecting D3 with the D4(RID). This allows the unencumbered transition of Mfd D5(TD1)-D6(TD2)-D7 from [L1.5a] to [L1.5b] (illustrated by the thick yellow arrow). Mfd D1-D3 then accommodates in a new configuration in L2(adp).

Upon the transition to L2, the translocation module walks on the DNA, moving toward the RNAP until it 'bumps' into the RNAP, characterized primarily by D6(TD2) interacting with the RNAP βprotrusion [the Mfd-D4(RID) and D6(TD2) interfaces with the RNAP βprotrusion do not overlap]. Once Mfd-D6(TD2) pushes up against the RNAP βprotrusion in L2, that interface is also maintained throughout the rest of the structures (L2, C1–C5, average interface area of 312 Å<sup>2</sup>). During the Mfd-nucleotide hydrolysis cycle, the movements of Mfd relative to the RNAP cause cyclical RNAP conformational changes involving RNAP clamp and βlobe-Si1 motions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The RNAP clamp is opened in C3 as Mfd wedges itself between the βprotrusion and the clamp, pushing on the clamp through a large interface with the translocation module (maximum Mfd-[D5(TD1)/D6(TD2)]:β'clamp interface area of 944 Å<sup>2</sup> in C3).

In this work, we observed seven distinct structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–H</xref>) that delineate how the initial interaction of Mfd with an EC triggers a stepwise series of dynamic conformational changes, culminating in the stable engagement of Mfd with the EC and then ATP-hydrolysis powered disruption of the EC. Key structural features and conformational changes are highlighted in the context of the transition path from one structure to the next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the summary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Structural pathway for RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation complex (EC) displacement by Mfd.</title><p>Putative ordered pathway for Mfd-mediated displacement of the RNAP EC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Structures are shown as cartoons, with RNAP and Mfd-domain color coding shown in the keys on the left. For most of the structures, domains that undergo the most significant conformational changes at each step are highlighted, and the relative direction and magnitude of the conformational changes are indicated by the thick, colored arrows. Starting at the left, the RNAP EC (top left) and apo-Mfd (bottom left) combine to form the putative encounter complex [L0] (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). In the [L0] → L1(atp) transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), Mfd domains D5(TD1) and D6(TD2) rearrange to bind a molecule of ATP and engage fully with the upstream duplex DNA. D1–D3 and D7 also make small rearrangements. In the L1(atp) → L2(adp) transition, the Mfd translocation module [D5(TD1)/D6(TD2)] walks nine base pairs in the downstream direction (into the page) by clockwise corkscrewing around the duplex DNA approximately 260°, hydrolyzing nine molecules of ATP in the process. The transition to C1(ATP) involves another accommodation of D1–D3 which finally exposes the UvrA-binding determinant of D2. We propose that the Mfd-EC complex then loops through an ATP hydrolysis cycle (C1 → C2 → C3 → C4 → C5 → C1 →…) that works to overwind the upstream duplex DNA, facilitating RNA transcript release and transcription bubble collapse to displace the RNAP from the nucleic acids. During this cycle, movements of Mfd on the upstream duplex DNA also force conformational changes in the RNAP; clamp opening in C3(adp), and βlobe-Si1 opening in C5(ATP). These RNAP conformational changes also serve to weaken the RNAP-nucleic acid contacts, facilitating RNAP release.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62117-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Initial binding of the Mfd-RID to the RNAP βprotrusion to generate the hypothetical state [L0] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) does not appear to require conformational changes as presumed, but rather tethers the Mfd translocation module in close proximity to the upstream duplex DNA of the EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The disposition of TD1 and TD2 in [L0] is not conducive to DNA or ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deaconescu et al., 2006</xref>), but thermal breathing of the Mfd domains could transiently align TD1 and TD2 to allow ATP binding and stable engagement of the upstream duplex DNA in L1(atp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). In L1(atp), Mfd engages with the upstream duplex DNA to −38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), explaining why Mfd requires upstream duplex DNA to about −40 to displace the EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2002</xref>). Although our modeled pathway initiates with apo-Mfd interacting directly from solution with the stalled EC to generate [L0] and then L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), our results do not rule out a role for the 'catch and release' model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le et al., 2018</xref> in which Mfd translocates on duplex DNA on its own and can engage with a stalled EC if encountered.</p><p>The alignment of TD1 and TD2 and ATP binding allows ATP hydrolysis in L1(atp), which initiates inchworming of the Mfd translocation module in the downstream direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We hypothesize that this induces the displacement of D1–D3 (which is still tethered), clearing a path for continued translocation of TD1/TD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>).

This ATP-hydrolysis-driven choreography results in Mfd completely encircling the upstream duplex DNA, explaining the remarkable processivity of the translocating Mfd-RNAP complex subsequent to EC disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graves et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The connection between topological wrapping or clamping of a nucleic acid processing enzyme on the nucleic acid template and high processivity is well established [see, for example, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breyer and Matthews, 2001</xref>)]. Not all highly processive nucleic acid processing enzymes topologically wrap or clamp the nucleic acids, but wrapping or clamping the nucleic acids is often associated with 'extremely' high processivity (thousands of nucleotides or more). Examples include replicative DNA polymerases attached to their processivity clamps [PCNA in eukaryotes and archaea, Pol III β-subunit in bacteria, related structures in many bacteriophage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruck and O'Donnell, 2001</xref>] and cellular DNA-dependent RNAPs, which essentially have infinite processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landick, 2001</xref>).</p><p>In its elaborate conformational transitions during the process of EC disruption, Mfd topologically wraps itself around the duplex DNA. Thus, it is natural to propose that the extremely high processivity of Mfd translocation is due to this topological wrapping.</p><p>After walking freely in the downstream direction for nine base pairs, the Mfd translocation module butts up against the RNAP βprotrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The D1–D3 module accommodates itself to the new molecular environment it finds itself in, finally exposing the previously occluded UvrA-binding determinant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p><p>At this point, if the RNAP is backtracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komissarova and Kashlev, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nudler, 2012</xref>), continued Mfd translocation in turn forward translocates the RNAP until the active configuration of the EC, with the RNA transcript 3'-end in the RNAP active site, is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2002</xref>). In the presence of NTP substrates, RNA chain elongation by the RNAP can resume and the RNAP, which translocates at ~15–20 nucleotides/s, runs away from Mfd, which translocates at only approximately four nucleotides per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>If RNAP forward translocation is blocked, either by the absence of NTP substrates, a bulky lesion in the t-strand DNA (such as a CPD dimer), or by a roadblock such as a DNA binding protein, continued translocation by the Mfd translocation module will essentially pull and torque the DNA out the back of the RNAP. The torquing action of Mfd positively supercoils the DNA between the Mfd translocation module and the tight grip of the RNAP on the downstream duplex DNA, causing the nt-strand DNA of the transcription bubble to reanneal with the t-strand DNA, displacing the RNA transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park and Roberts, 2006</xref>). The stability of the EC is dependent on the RNA/DNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kireeva et al., 2000</xref>), so release of the RNA transcript results in release of the RNAP from the DNA template.</p><p>The particles that gave rise to all seven of the Mfd-EC structures came from two separate samples that were prepared in the same way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), so the relative numbers of particles that belong to each structural class are related to the relative stability of that class – the more particles in a structural class, the more stable that structure is. The first structure in our pathway [L1(atp)] is also the least stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that this first step of engagement of Mfd with the DNA is reversible and that L1(atp) is likely in a dynamic equilibrium with [L0] and/or Mfd in solution. The single molecule analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howan et al., 2012</xref> found that engagement of Mfd with a stalled EC was characterized by weak initial binding of Mfd (Mfd molecules attempt binding to the stalled EC many times before engaging productively), consistent with our findings.</p><p>The initial weak binding of Mfd to the stalled EC was followed by a very slow catalytic step (<italic>k</italic> = 0.059 s<sup>−1</sup>) that required multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howan et al., 2012</xref>). The L1(atp) → L2(adp) transition requires nine rounds of ATP hydrolysis. The reversible equilibrium at the first step and the presumably slow, multi-step transition required to ultimately reach the NHC are consistent with proposals that Mfd kinetically discriminates a stalled EC (which Mfd is charged with displacing) and an EC that is simply paused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landick, 2006</xref>) and should not be displaced. The slow, reversible loading pathway ensures that only the very long-lived stalled EC becomes a target for Mfd displacement and recruitment of UvrA.</p><p>The distribution of pause lifetimes in vivo is not known, but the in vivo half-lives of some well-characterized long-lived pauses were estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larson et al., 2014</xref>): the <italic>his</italic>-pause half-life (known to be among the longest-lived pauses in vivo) was estimated to be ~1.3 s. On the other hand, single-molecule experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howan et al., 2012</xref>, which were done under saturating ATP concentrations, determined that the mean lifetime of the Mfd-EC displacement complex (our L1 → C5) between Mfd engagement (L1) and RNAP displacement (post-C5) is about 45 s. This is a lower bound for the mean lifetime of a stalled EC due to the high Mfd concentration used in these experiments. Thus, the expected time required for Mfd to find and displace a stalled or paused EC is more than an order of magnitude longer than the longest-lived transcriptional pauses in vivo. The kinetic discrimination of stalled vs. paused (but still productive) ECs explains why overexpression of Mfd is not toxic to cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deaconescu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roberts and Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Selby and Sancar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The NHC states (C1–C5) are considerably more stable than the loading states (L1 and L2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that once the complex passes through the loading pathway and enters the NHC, it is essentially irreversibly trapped, where it attempts to translocate on the DNA against the immovable EC, imparting positive torque on the DNA and ultimately collapsing the transcription bubble, releasing the RNA transcript, and displacing the RNAP from the DNA. During this process, Mfd manhandles the RNAP, prying open the RNAP clamp and βlobe-Si1 to cause RNAP to lose its grip on the nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Thus, entry into the NHC is essentially like a molecular switch. In the reversible, slow loading pathway, Mfd probes the lifetime of the stalled/paused EC. During these stages, the Mfd UvrA-binding determinant is occluded; premature recruitment of UvrA would disrupt the Mfd-EC complex, short circuiting the TCR pathway. It could also counterproductively recruit NER components to sites on the genome that are not damaged. The elaborate conformational choreography of Mfd loading and EC displacement is thus evolutionarily tuned to prevent disruption of normal regulation of transcription elongation but to engage the NER pathway when a lesion is likely encountered.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

ECs stalled at +20 were formed by initiating with the dinucleotide ApU and ATP, CTP, and GTP (excluding UTP), and with the addition of the chain-terminator 3'-deoxy-UTP. Complexes were analyzed by EMSAs using 4.5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 1× TBE at 4°C. Radiolabeled bands were detected using a phosphor screen and quantified using Imagequant software (Molecular Dynamics). <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP holoenzyme was assembled by incubating <italic>Eco</italic> RNAP (250 nM final) with σ<sup>70</sup> (1.25 μM final) at 37°C for 20 min.

Heparin (Sigma-Aldrich) was also added (10 μg/mL final) to ensure single-round transcription. After 10 min of incubation at 37°C, Mfd (250 nM final) was added to activate stalled RNAP displacement and translocation.

The nonvolatile buffer components, including ATP, needed to be removed prior to nMS analysis because these components can form nonspecific adductions on protein complexes and degrade spectral quality. The EC and EC + Mfd samples were then buffer-exchanged into nMS solution (500 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.5, 0.01% Tween-20) using Zeba microspin desalting columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a 40 kDa MWCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olinares et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For nMS analysis, 2–3 µL of the buffer-exchanged sample was loaded into a gold-coated quartz emitter that was prepared in-house and then electrosprayed into an Exactive Plus EMR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a static nanospray source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olinares and Chait, 2019</xref>).

Mass calibration in positive EMR mode was performed using cesium iodide. For data processing, the acquired MS spectra were visualized using Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser (versions 3.0.63 and 4.2.47). MS spectra deconvolution was performed either manually or using the software UniDec versions 3.2 and 4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reid et al., 2019</xref>). The deconvolved spectra obtained from UniDec were plotted using the m/z software (Proteometrics LLC). Experimental masses were reported as the average mass ± standard deviation (S.D.) across all the calculated mass values within the observed charge state series. Mass accuracies were calculated as the percent difference between the measured and expected masses relative to the expected mass. The measured masses for the corresponding complexes (with mass accuracies reported in parentheses) include EC: 437,680 ± 20 Da (0.016%) for the EC only sample and EC + 1 Mfd: 570,360 ± 20 Da (0.03%), EC: 437,700 ± 20 Da (0.02%), α<sub>2</sub>β subcomplex: 223,700 ± 3 Da (0.02%), and Mfd: 132,582 ± 8 Da (0.003%) for the EC sample incubated with Mg-ATP and Mfd.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Preparation of Mfd-EC Cryo-EM grids</title><p>For cryo-EM grid preparation, ECs prepared as above were purified over a Superose 6 INCREASE gel filtration column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with transcription buffer.

The final buffer condition for all the cryo-EM samples was the same as transcription buffer. C-flat holey carbon grids (CF-1.2/1.3-4Au, Protochips) were glow-discharged for 20 s prior to the application of 3.5 μL of the samples. Using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific Electron Microscopy), grids were blotted and plunge-froze into liquid ethane with 100% chamber humidity at 22°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cryo-EM data acquisition and processing</title><p>For the cryo-EM structure determination of the Mfd-EC, two data sets were collected and combined (Figure S1). In each data collection, grids were imaged using a 300 keV Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific Electron Microscopy) equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA). Images were recorded with Serial EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) with a pixel size of 1.3 Å over a defocus range of −0.8 to −2.4 μm. Movies were recorded in super-resolution mode at eight electrons/physical pixel/s in dose-fractionation mode with subframes of 0.2 s over a 10 s exposure (50 frames) to give a total dose of 80 electrons/physical pixel or 47.3 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>. Dose-fractionated movies were gain-normalized, drift-corrected, binned, summed, and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). The contrast transfer function was estimated for each summed image using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Gautomatch (developed by K.

Picked particles from each data set were extracted from the dose-weighted images in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scheres, 2012</xref>) using a box size of 300 pixels and subjected to 2D classification in RELION to exclude false particles. The selected particles from 2D classification were transferred to CryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) to perform heterogeneous refinement with multiple 3D references to separate Mfd-EC complexes from isolated EC and Mfd particles. For the heterogeneous refinement, cryo-EM maps of <italic>Eco</italic> EC [EMD-8585; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2017</xref>)], Mfd-EC, and isolated Mfd (the latter two generated from a subset of the data by <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction) were used as templates (each low-pass filtered to 30 Å resolution). The class representing Mfd-EC was further refined in CryoSPARC homogeneous refinement, yielding 3.9 Å and 3.6 Å nominal resolution maps from the first and second data sets, respectively. The refined particles from the first data set were transferred to RELION for 3D auto-refinement, CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, and 3D autorefinement before being combined with the particles from the second data set. The resulting 594,435 particles were 3D autorefined in RELION for a consensus refinement, yielding a 3.86 Å nominal resolution map. A second round of CTF refinement, Bayesian polishing, and 3D autorefinement improved the resolution to 3.64 Å. By using focused classification around the Mfd region, eight classes were generated with distinct Mfd conformations. Among the eight classes, two classes were discarded because they could not be refined further. Four of the classes were further refined using RELION 3D autorefinement to yield C1, C3, C4, and C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The remaining two classes were further sorted using partial signal subtraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>) of the region outside of Mfd and the RNAP βprotrusion, then classifying these subtracted particles using a mask encompassing Mfd and the RNAP β-protrusion density, resulting in L1, L2, and C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In total, the seven resulting maps showed well-defined EC density but variable quality maps for the Mfd component, indicating that the alignments were dominated by the EC portion of the complex. Therefore, to better resolve the density around Mfd, particles from each class were imported into cryoSPARC and refined using cryoSPARC Non-uniform Refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Punjani et al., 2019</xref>). Using the resulting maps, masks around Mfd were generated for cryoSPARC Local Refinement. The fulcrum points (alignment centers) for each of these masks were defined using 'Volume Tracer' in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Each class from the Non-uniform Refinement was subjected to Local Refinement using their respective Mfd mask and fulcrum point. The local refinements resulted in better resolved Mfd density for each class with the following nominal resolutions in this region: L1 (atp, 6.6 Å), L2 (adp, 6.7 Å), C1 (ATP, 5.2 Å), C2 (ADP, 3.5 Å), C3 (adp, 4.4 Å), C4 (ADP, 3.8 Å), and C5 (ADP, 3.3 Å).</p><p>The EC-centered cryo-EM maps from RELION and the Mfd-centered maps from cryoSPARC were combined using the PHENIX combine_focused_maps command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The procedure that gave the highest quality maps was as follows: coordinates were rigid body refined into each map. For the combination step: (1) for the EC-centered coordinates, the occupancies of the EC-RNAP, the EC nucleic acids, and Mfd-D4(RID) were set to 1.0, while the occupancies for the rest of Mfd and the upstream duplex DNA were set to 0; (2) for the Mfd-centered coordinates, the occupancies of the entire Mfd, the RNAP βprotrusion, and the upstream duplex DNA were set to 1.0, while the rest of the EC was set to occupancy = 0. Thus, in the combined maps, the EC density and EC nucleic acids came from the EC-centered cryo-EM maps, while Mfd and the upstream duplex DNA density came from the Mfd-centered maps, and the density for the Mfd-D4(RID) and the RNAP β-protrusion were weighted according to the combine_focused_maps algorithm. These combined maps were the most interpretable over the entirety of each complex and were therefore used for building, refinement, statistics reporting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1s</xref>), and deposition in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). RELION 3D auto-refinement and post-processing of the polished particles resulted in structures with the following nominal resolutions: L1 (atp, 4.1 Å), L2 (adp, 4.0 Å), C1 (ATP, 3.9 Å), C2 (ADP, 3.9 Å), C3 (adp, 3.2 Å), C4 (ADP, 3.6 Å), and C5 (ADP, 3.3 Å).

the transcription repair coupling factor Mfd by cryo electron microscopy. The authors succeeded to obtain several snapshots of this reaction and thereby derived an overall model of this process which addresses many open questions such as the prevention of a premature engagement of the repair machinery or how the release of the polymerase is facilitated. This will be a landmark paper in understanding the molecular mechanisms and interactions that underlie the activity of the Mfd protein, and also thereby basic activities of the universal transcription machine.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis for transcription complex disruption by the Mfd translocase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present paper describes cryo EM snapshots of seven different states of EC complexes obtained with a specially designed DNA/RNA substrate, RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the Mfd translocase in the presence of ATP. Using conformational differences in these snapshots, they are grouped and ordered, and analyzed for their potential role during ATP hydrolysis Mfd. Elaborate models are proposed for how the different states form an Mfd activity cycle that results in the extraction of DNA from the back of RNAP while simultaneously positively supercoiling the DNA.</p><p>The paper is a remarkable achievement that reveals the detailed molecular activity of Mfd in dissociating a stalled RNA polymerase. It is the climax of decades of experimentation on Mfd, explaining and summarizing studies of many sorts. It is also a striking demonstration of the power of high resolution cryo-EM to reveal enzymatic mechanism, including distinct stages of Mfd translocation and RNAP dissociation; the timing of the interaction of UvrA with Mfd to initiate lesion excision relative to Mfd engagement with RNA polymerase also is satisfyingly explained. The authors reveal how the kinetics of Mfd engagement protects a slow or paused enzyme from even artificially high cellular concentrations of Mfd through a slow step of Mfd action to which only a blocked RNAP will be susceptible. Pending a few suggested revisions, it certainly merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data are grouped into ATP or ADP bound states that are used for clustering. For the L1 state it is proposed the nucleotide cannot be identified by the experimental data and then it is inferred that since its conformation is the closest to the ATP bound states, it should contain ATP. Looking at the densities in the provided files (there is no L1 density in this area provided in Figure 2), it is difficult to identify anything bound at this position, suggesting possible overinterpretation of the data. In the final model of this snapshot ,the ATP should most likely be removed and all statements concerning this state should be stated more cautiously.</p><p>2) The L0 state is clearly marked as “model” but the L1.5a b states also show modeled intermediates to explain transitions. This may be misleading, since there is no evidence presented that this is actually occurring. The authors then arrive at the L2 state that contains ADP, which is partly supported by the cryo EM density. However, compared to C3, which also has a resolution of 4.0 Å, the map quality in that region is of low quality and the interpretation of L2 is highly ambiguous. It would be helpful to assess the real space coefficients for the nucleotides and the area surrounding them with a radius of around 10-15 Å. This would help the reader to make an informed decision on the quality of the experimental data.</p><p>3) The L2 state leads to an ATPase cycle state that is reflected by C1-C5. For the comparison of the nucleotide cycle, the TD1 domains of all structures are superimposed and compared to the TD2 movement, with a special focus on residues G874, R902, and R905. It is stated that in all ATP-containing structures, these residues form polar contacts with the γ phosphate of ATP. However, the side chains of the arginine residues are only visible in the cryo EM densities in C2 and C5, and not in C1 or L1 according to the structural data provided (in the ADP-containing complexes, they are only visible in C4). Figure 3A therefore compares C5 and C4, however, the statement was made more general than the data would suggest. In addition, the polar contacts shown in Figure 3A for C5 should be revised. R902 has a distance of more than 4 Å to the γ phosphate, so the dashed line is misleading. In Figure 3B the movements of the TD2 domain are shown based on nucleotide state. Here, it is unclear of which structures the rotation and center of mass shifts were derived. Was it from C4 and C5, or an average of all structures? Is this the average or maximum displacement? Please address these issues.</p><p>4) In the next step the TRG motif is compared to an example of residues R929, R953, and Q963. Here again, dashed lines in the figure exceeding a distance of 4 Å are misleading. A minor issue is the side chain orientation of Q963. The hydrogen bonding requirements are much better satisfied when the side chain is flipped; i.e., OE1 would interact with NZ of K739 instead of with the phosphate backbone and NE2 with the phosphate backbone. Although it is appreciated that there are a lot of residues to refine in total, groups that are used to exemplify certain findings should be modeled as accurately as possible.</p><p>5) Regarding the statement: &quot;As a result of the large conformational rearrangement of Mfd, Mfd(ADP)L2 is topologically “wrapped” around the DNA (Figure 5), likely explaining how Mfd (with RNAP in tow) translocates processively over many kilobases of DNA (Fan et al., 2016; Graves et al., 2015).&quot; This claim is made without any further explanation or additional data supporting. Please clarify or remove.</p><p>6) If the discrimination between arrested and paused transcription complexes is solely kinetic, would it be true that an exceptionally long pause would enable Mfd dissociation? Please explain.</p><p>7) The subsection “Mfd loading requires multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis and is accompanied by profound conformational changes” describes the translocation module TD1-TD2 &quot;bumping&quot; into RNA polymerase in the L2 structure. This presumably is different from the contact between the RID and the RNAP protrusion. Where does it make this contact, and is there a molecular definition of the bump? Is this related to the changes in the RNA polymerase clamp opening during the Mfd ATP cycle? Also, would the clamp opening cycle be different for paused versus blocked complexes, and could this contribute to the relative insensitivity of paused complexes to release by Mfd? Please clarify.</p><p>8) Le et al., 2018, showed by single molecule analysis that Mfd can translocate by itself without engagement with RNA polymerase, and proposed a model in which Mfd patrols DNA, moving slower than transcription so that only stopped, or perhaps extensively paused, complexes can be captured. This does appear to be a distinct view of the cellular process. If the model of Le et al. describes the cellular process, some stochastic or other process presumably would have the break the inhibitory structure of the holo Mfd, and this would have to occur at a significant rate. Arguably, Le et al. could have been observing a small fraction of Mfd that is spontaneously active, and therefore not an important contributor to the cellular mechanism. Do the authors have any further thoughts about the two distinct models?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62117.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data are grouped into ATP or ADP bound states that are used for clustering.

Note these are the two states with the worst overall nominal resolution (4 Å) other than L1. Again, based on the correspondence of the L2 and C3 translocation module conformation with the other ADP-bound structure [C4(ADP)], we infer that L2 and C3 are also bound to ADP, but for the three ambiguous structures (L1, L2, and C3), they are now referred throughout the manuscript (and figures) with lower case letters for the nucleotide (rather than upper case letters), as explained in the subsection “Seven structures in the Mfd activity cycle”. Also see Figure 2 legend.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting this test, which we believe provides important information for readers to evaluate our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The L2 state leads to an ATPase cycle state that is reflected by C1-C5.

Figure 3A therefore compares C5 and C4, however, the statement was made more general than the data would suggest. In addition, the polar contacts shown in Figure 3A for C5 should be revised. R902 has a distance of more than 4 Å to the γ phosphate, so the dashed line is misleading. In Figure 3B the movements of the TD2 domain are shown based on nucleotide state. Here, it is unclear of which structures the rotation and center of mass shifts were derived. Was it from C4 and C5, or an average of all structures? Is this the average or maximum displacement? Please address these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, the noted side-chains interacting with the bound nucleotides (and in the TRG motif, see below) are clearly defined in the C2(ATP), C4(ADP) and C5(ATP) states, but not in the other states with lower resolution cryo-EM densities. We have clarified in the text that these conclusions are derived from the C2(ATP), C4(ADP), and C5(ATP) states, and the conclusions are presumed to apply to the other states (although this is not directly observed in the cryo-EM density – see the subsection “One ATP hydrolysis cycle corresponds to translocation by one base pair”).</p><p>We do not agree that the notation of polar contacts (with distances &gt; 4 Å) needs to be revised. Our typical criteria for defining “contacts” are as follows:</p><p>van der Waals (hydrophobic) contacts: ≤ 4.5 Å</p><p>Hydrogen-bonds: ≤ 3.5 Å (combined with geometric considerations).</p><p>Ionic interactions (i.e. favorable interactions between oppositely-charged side chains, such as an Arg and Glu, or an Arg and the DNA phosphate backbone): ≤ 4.5 Å</p><p>We believe this is not grossly out of line with accepted practice.</p><p>In our text, “polar contacts” includes both H-bonds and ionic bonds. “Ionic bonds” can include both close range interactions (where the hydration shells of the two oppositely-charged moieties are displaced) that are typically called “salt-bridges” (these are typically ≤ 3.5 Å or so), but can also include longer range interactions where the two oppositely-charged moieties remain hydrated but their Coloumbic interaction is favorable [Xu, Tsai and Nussinov, 1997; Kumar and Nussinov, 2002; Yu, Pettitt and Iwahara, 2019]. These longer-range, favorable interactions are significant and extend to well beyond 4.5 Å distance [for instance, see Figure 1C of Yu, Pettitt and Iwahara, 2019]. Our choice of a 4.5 Å cutoff is actually quite conservative. We have clarified our notation of “polar interactions” (subsection “One ATP hydrolysis cycle corresponds to translocation by one base pair”, and in the Figure 3A legend).</p><p>We agree it was ambiguous how the center-of-gravity (cog) shift of TD2(ATP) to TD2(ADP) was calculated (i.e. exactly which structures were used). This is partly because the value for the shift (~3.5 Å) does not depend on how it is calculated (see below):</p><p>shift of TD2cog(ATP-&gt;ADP):</p><p>– using the average of all structures (L1/C1/C2/C5 -&gt; L2/C3/C4): 3.56 Å</p><p>– using only confirmed structures (C1/C2/C5 -&gt; C4): 3.54 Å</p><p>– using only highest resolution structures (C5 -&gt; C4): 3.47 Å</p><p>We have clarified this point in the Figure 3B legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the next step the TRG motif is compared to an example of residues R929, R953, and Q963. Here again, dashed lines in the figure exceeding a distance of 4 Å are misleading. A minor issue is the side chain orientation of Q963. The hydrogen bonding requirements are much better satisfied when the side chain is flipped; i.e., OE1 would interact with NZ of K739 instead of with the phosphate backbone and NE2 with the phosphate backbone. Although it is appreciated that there are a lot of residues to refine in total, groups that are used to exemplify certain findings should be modeled as accurately as possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we do not agree that polar contacts exceeding 4 Å should be revised.</p><p>We thank the review for noticing the detail regarding the Q963 side chain – we have adjusted the position of Q963 accordingly in each PDB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Regarding the statement: &quot;As a result of the large conformational rearrangement of Mfd, Mfd(ADP)L2 is topologically “wrapped” around the DNA (Figure 5), likely explaining how Mfd (with RNAP in tow) translocates processively over many kilobases of DNA (Fan et al., 2016; Graves et al., 2015).&quot; This claim is made without any further explanation or additional data supporting. Please clarify or remove.</p></disp-quote><p>We see a structural feature (Mfd topologically “wrapping” around the duplex DNA; Figure 5 and also see new Video 2) that goes a long way towards explaining previously observed (and well documented/established) biophysical (single-molecule) results (extremely high processivity; i.e. ability of one molecule of Mfd to translocate on many kb of duplex DNA without dissociating) of Mfd translocation subsequent to RNAP displacement (Fan et al., 2016; Graves et al., 2015).</p><p>The connection between topological wrapping or clamping of a nucleic acid processing enzyme on the nucleic acid template and high processivity is well accepted [see, for example, Breyer and Matthews, 2001]. Not all highly processive nucleic acid processing enzymes topologically wrap or clamp the nucleic acids, but wrapping or clamping the nucleic acids is often associated with what I would call “extremely” high processivity (thousands of nucleotides or even more). Examples include replicative DNA polymerases attached to their processivity clamps (PCNA in eukaryotes and archaea, Pol III b-subunit in bacteria, related structures in many bacteriophage) and cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (which essentially have infinite processivity).</p><p>Thus, many DNA processing enzymes that topologically wrap or clamp onto the nucleic acid template have extremely high processivity. In its elaborate conformational transitions during the process of EC disruption, Mfd topologically wraps itself around the duplex DNA. Thus, it is natural to propose that the extremely high processivity of Mfd translocation is due to this topological wrapping.</p><p>We have explained this point more clearly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) If the discrimination between arrested and paused transcription complexes is solely kinetic, would it be true that an exceptionally long pause would enable Mfd dissociation? Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Transcriptional pausing in bacteria has been studied extensively in vitro, but these studies often utilize sub-saturating concentrations of NTPs to prolong pause lifetimes, making them easier to study. The distribution of pause lifetimes in vivo is not known (Robert Landick, personal communication), but the in vivo half-lives of some well-characterized long-lived pauses were estimated [Larson et al., 2014]: the His-pause half-life (known to be among the longest-lived pauses in vivo) was estimated to be ~1.3 sec.</p><p>Alternatively, single-molecule experiments of Howan et al., 2012, which were done under saturating ATP concentrations, determined that the mean lifetime of the Mfd-EC displacement complex (our L1 -&gt; C5) between Mfd engagement (L1) and RNAP displacement (post-C5) is about 45 sec. This is a lower bound for the mean lifetime of a stalled EC due to the high Mfd concentration used in these experiments. Thus, the expected time required for Mfd to find and displace a stalled or paused EC is more than an order of magnitude longer than the longest-lived transcriptional pauses in vivo.</p><p>This issue is now addressed in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The subsection “Mfd loading requires multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis and is accompanied by profound conformational changes” describes the translocation module TD1-TD2 &quot;bumping&quot; into RNA polymerase in the L2 structure. This presumably is different from the contact between the RID and the RNAP protrusion. Where does it make this contact, and is there a molecular definition of the bump? Is this related to the changes in the RNA polymerase clamp opening during the Mfd ATP cycle? Also, would the clamp opening cycle be different for paused versus blocked complexes, and could this contribute to the relative insensitivity of paused complexes to release by Mfd? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify, we have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) that plots the interface areas between selected Mfd and RNAP domains for each of the Mfd-EC structures. From this plot we can see that the initial engagement of Mfd with the RNAP is through the Mfd-D4(RID):βprotrusion interaction (average interface area of 553 Å2) and that this does not change through all seven states (L1, L2, C1-C5).</p><p>In L1, the Mfd translocation module [D5(TD1)/D6(TD2)] interacts with upstream DNA (roughly -38 to -27) and does not interact with RNAP. Upon the transition to L2, the translocation module walks on the DNA, moving towards the RNAP until it “bumps” into the RNAP, characterized primarily by D6(TD2) also interacting with the RNAP βprotrusion [the Mfd-D4(RID) and D6(TD2) interfaces with the RNAP βprotrusion do not overlap]. Once Mfd-D6(TD2) pushes up against the RNAP βprotrusion, that interface is also maintained throughout the rest of the structures (L2, C1-C5, average interface area of 312 Å2).</p><p>This is now explained more clearly in the manuscript (subsection “Mfd loading requires multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis and is accompanied by profound conformational changes”).</p><p>During the Mfd-NHC, the movements of Mfd relative to the RNAP cause cyclical RNAP conformational changes involving RNAP clamp and βlobe motions (Figure 7). The RNAP clamp is opened in C3 as Mfd wedges itself between the βprotrusion and the clamp, pushing on the clamp through a large interface with the translocation module (maximum Mfd-[D5(TD1)/D6(TD2)]:b'clamp interface area of 944 Å2 in C3). The RNAP βlobe is pushed sideways by an interaction with Mfd-D1 (can be seen in Figure 7). This is described in the subsection “Mfd manipulates the RNAP conformation during its nucleotide hydrolysis cycle”.</p><p>To our knowledge, the sensitivity of paused RNAP ECs to Mfd (other than backtrack pauses, which are sensitive to Mfd; Park et al., 2006) has not been specifically tested, but our argument above strongly supports the view that the relatively slow kinetics of Mfd engagement and displacement of ECs ensures that only stalled ECs that need to be rescued are actually displaced by Mfd.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Le et al., 2018, showed by single molecule analysis that Mfd can translocate by itself without engagement with RNA polymerase, and proposed a model in which Mfd patrols DNA, moving slower than transcription so that only stopped, or perhaps extensively paused, complexes can be captured. This does appear to be a distinct view of the cellular process. If the model of Le et al. describes the cellular process, some stochastic or other process presumably would have the break the inhibitory structure of the holo Mfd, and this would have to occur at a significant rate. Arguably, Le et al. could have been observing a small fraction of Mfd that is spontaneously active, and therefore not an important contributor to the cellular mechanism. Do the authors have any further thoughts about the two distinct models?</p></disp-quote><p>Although our pathway initiating through the hypothetical intermediate [L0] involves apo-Mfd (auto-inhibited) engaging directly with a stalled EC from solution and then either dissociating or transitioning into L1 to initiate the pathway, our results do not rule out a role for the “catch and release” model of Le et al., 2018. A statement to this effect has been added in the Discussion.</p><p>In our in vitro experiments, our EC scaffold only contains 50 base pairs of duplex DNA upstream of the transcription bubble, just enough for Mfd engagement (Park et al., 2006), suggesting our assays/structures all involve the direct pathway. A structure of Mfd actively translocating on duplex DNA on its own is not available, but we would presume that if a translocating Mfd were to encounter a stalled EC from the rear, it could engage with the EC and form a structure corresponding to our L1; the rest of the Mfd loading pathway would then proceed normally. The roles of the solution vs. translocation encounter pathways could be probed by the careful examination of EC-release kinetics on DNA scaffolds having increasing lengths of upstream duplex DNA. If Mfd molecules were able to engage with the duplex DNA and translocate on their own to catch up to and engage an EC, one could envision that increasing the length of the duplex DNA upstream of the stalled EC could increase the rate of EC release, but increasing the length of upstream duplex DNA beyond a certain length would no longer have an effect (due to the low processivity of the lone translocating Mfd).</p></body></sub-article></article>
