Previously, we showed that loss-of-function of mtFAS genes, including <italic>Mcat</italic>, is associated with severe loss of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in mouse immortalized skeletal myoblasts (Nowinski et al., 2020). Here, we report a proband presenting with hypotonia, failure to thrive, nystagmus, and abnormal brain MRI findings. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified biallelic variants in <italic>MCAT</italic>. Protein levels for NDUFB8 and COXII, subunits of complex I and IV respectively, were markedly reduced in lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, as well as SDHB for complex II in fibroblasts. ETC enzyme activities were decreased in parallel. Re-expression of wild-type <italic>MCAT</italic> rescued the phenotype in patient fibroblasts. This is the first report of a patient with <italic>MCAT</italic> pathogenic variants and combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency.</p></abstract><kwd-group

is a catalytic component of the type II malonyl-CoA-dependent system for fatty acid synthesis (FAS) in the mitochondria. MCAT acts at the second step of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) whereby malonyl-CoA is used to generate malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Hiltunen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Octanoate, the precursor for the co-factor lipoate, is thought to be the main product of the mtFAS system. Lipoylation is necessary for the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHc), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDHc), branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDHc), and 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complexes, and the glycine cleavage system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Solmonson and DeBerardinis, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A mouse model with reduced <italic>Mcat</italic> expression displays decreased physical activity, reduced muscle strength, and premature aging with a reduced life span. Additionally, these animals have elevated skeletal muscle lactate, blood lactate, and ketone bodies, and have lipoylation defects in OGDHc, PDHc, and BCKDHc. The authors postulated that the mouse phenotype is due primarily to decreased generation of octanoate, leading to decreased lipoylation of PDHc and OGDHc and decreased flux through the citric acid cycle with subsequent disruption of energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Smith et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although MCAT has not been demonstrated to have a role in oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial ACP encoded by <italic>NDUFAB1</italic> has been shown to be essential for complex I assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Stroud et al., 2016</xref>). In an effort to further study the mtFAS pathway, Nowinski et al. recently generated hypomorphic <italic>Mcat</italic> clones in an immortalized mouse skeletal myoblast line using CRISPR-Cas9. These hypomorphic <italic>Mcat</italic> clones have a 30–40% decreased basal respiration rate compared to controls, which is explained by markedly decreased levels of fully assembled complexes I, II, and IV. Metabolomics and carbon-labeling studies are all consistent with decreased function of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation in the hypomorphic <italic>Mcat</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>). This work demonstrates that the role of mtFAS extends beyond protein lipoylation and includes a crucial role in the maintenance of electron transport chain (ETC) activity. We now present a proband with mitochondrial disease and a biallelic missense variant in <italic>MCAT</italic>.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Case presentation</title><p>A 2-year-old boy, born prematurely, with a past medical history notable for failure to thrive and global developmental delay presented for genetics evaluation. Birth weight was 1.106 kg. The patient was hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory support (oxygen via nasal cannula) and was discharged home at 7 weeks. The patient was being followed by ophthalmology for retinopathy of prematurity and at 8 months of age was noted to have esotropia and horizontal jerk nystagmus that decreased with convergence. He was prescribed eye patching resulting in some improvement of the esotropia, but at 19 months was noted to have new-onset vertical nystagmus. A brain MRI completed at 21 months was notable for bilaterally symmetrical increase in signal intensity on T2- and T2 FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery)-weighted sequences in the dorsal medulla, periaqueductal gray matter, substantia nigra, medial hypothalamus, and habenular nuclei. There were two asymmetric foci in the subcortical white matter of the cerebellar hemispheres. There was no surrounding edema and no abnormal contrast enhancement. Developmentally, at 2 years of age the patient could say approximately two to three words, had no two-word phrases, and could not walk independently. On exam, his head circumference was at the 0.4 percentile (Z=−2.59), height was at the 0.46 percentile (Z=−2.61), and weight was at the &lt;0.01 percentile (Z=−3.73). He had plagiocephaly with sagittal suture prominence, but was otherwise nondysmorphic. Vertical and horizontal nystagmus were present. Neurological exam was notable for truncal and peripheral hypotonia, decreased muscle mass, and brisk reflexes. Serum creatine kinase, blood lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, acylcarnitine profile, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids were normal. Repeat brain MRI at 3 years 3 months showed substantially increased signal intensity and extent of involvement at the same sites, with no edema, no mass effect, and no abnormal contrast enhancement at any site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Naidich and Duvernoy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Standring, 2020</xref>). No new sites of involvement were identified. The remaining portions of the brain showed no abnormality. Brain MR spectroscopy at short TE was normal within the right thalamus and left subcortical white matter. Chromosomal microarray revealed no pathogenic copy number variation, but absence of heterozygosity of unknown clinical significance totaling 32.2 Mb was detected. Family history was significant for an older sibling born with cleft lip, who died at a year of age from a choking episode. Visual symptoms were not seen in this sibling. The proband has two younger siblings who are healthy and have normal development. Family history was otherwise non-contributory, and while both parents are from the same region of Mexico, consanguinity was denied.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Axial T2-weighted MRI sections of the brain displayed from inferior to superior.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Sections through the brainstem and cerebellum.

This mutation occurs one residue away from the active site histidine (H234) and is located in a semi-structured region between the end of an alpha helix and a linker region between the alpha helix and a series of beta sheets. In the wild-type protein, the T235 residue makes several contacts with surrounding residues. The carboxy group of T235 makes contact with the amide nitrogen of M238. The hydroxyl group of T235 forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of A232 and the amide nitrogen of L238. The mutation of threonine to isoleucine results in a loss of polar contacts with A232 and L238 due to a loss of the hydroxyl moiety. This likely reduces the structure of the end of the alpha helix and may generate additional flexibility of the linker region.

Consistently, other biochemical findings that would indicate a lipoate deficiency such as lactic acidemia, elevated urine 2-oxoglutarate, and elevated blood glycine were absent.

We hypothesize that this decoupling of mtFAS endpoints may be a result of substrate limitation. Because MCAT supplies malonyl-ACP which is necessary to extend acyl chains, this less functional MCAT mutant may decrease the available malonyl-ACP and therefore preference the pathway toward shorter chain products (like lipoic acid) over the longer acyl chains that are required for LYRM binding and ETC assembly.</p><p>Recently, double homozygous mutations in <italic>MCAT</italic> (p.L81R and p.R212W) were identified in a consanguineous Chinese family with isolated, progressive autosomal recessive optic neuropathy.

Overexpression of L81R MCAT or double mutant L81R/R212W MCAT led to decreased COX4 expression in the mitochondria in HEK293T cells.

One hundred thousand cells were seeded and then collected after 48 hr. Cells were collected and lysed in 80:20 optima-grade methanol:water and frozen in liquid nitrogen. After three consecutive freeze-thaw cycles, samples were centrifuged at top speed for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and a protein assay was performed on the methanol lysate. Metabolite extracts were dried in a sample concentrator and then metabolites were resuspended in 80:20 acetonitrile:water relative to their protein abundance in preparation for LCMS analysis. Data acquisition was performed by reverse-phase chromatography on a 1290 UHPLC liquid chromatography (LC) system interfaced to a high-resolution mass spectrometry 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The MS was operated in both positive and negative (ESI+ and ESI-) modes. Analytes were separated on a Sequant ZIC-pHILIC column (5 μm, 2.1×150 mm, Merck, Damstadt, Germany). The column was kept at room temperature. Mobile phase A composition was 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH 9.8) and mobile phase B composition was 100% acetonitrile. The LC gradient was 0 min: 90% B; 15 min: 30% B; 18 min: 30% B; 19 min: 10% B; and 27 min: 10% B. The flow rate was 250 μL/min. The sample injection volume was 10 μL. ESI source conditions were set as follows: dry gas temperature 225°C and flow 18 L/ min, fragmentor voltage 175  V, sheath gas temperature 350°C, and flow 12  L/min, nozzle voltage 500 V, and capillary voltage +3500 V in positive mode and −3500 V in negative. The instrument was set to acquire over the full m/z range of 40–1700 in both modes, with the MS acquisition rate of 1 spectrum/s in profile format. Raw data files (.d) were processed using Profinder B.08.00 SP3 software (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) with an in-house database containing retention time and accurate mass information on 600 standards from Mass Spectrometry Metabolite Library (IROA Technologies, MA, USA) which was created under the same analysis conditions. The in-house database matching parameters were: mass tolerance 10 ppm; retention time tolerance 0.5 min. Peak integration result was manually curated in Profinder for improved consistency and exported as a spreadsheet (.csv). Peak areas were blank subtracted and normalized to total ion content. The experiment was replicated with consistent results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Rescue of MCAT CRISPR mutant C2C12 cell lines</title><p>Two clonal C2C12 cell lines with mutations in <italic>MCAT</italic> were generated and thoroughly characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>). These cell lines or a control clonal line (GFP) were infected with retrovirus expressing the human MCAT CDS (WT), human MCAT harboring the T271I mutation (T271I), or a mitochondrially targeted DSRed control (mtDSRed). Stably infected cells were selected by culturing in normal growth medium (DMEM [Corning 10-013-CV]+10% FBS) supplemented with 2 µg/mL puromycin for 7 days. Cells were expanded and harvested for mitochondrial isolation and western blotting at 70% confluency or plated for Seahorse assays. For immunoblotting, samples were processed as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Seahorse assay for mitochondrial respiration</title><p>Cells were plated in 8 wells of a 96-well Seahorse plate at 6000 cells/well in DMEM+10% FBS and incubated overnight. Prior to the assay, cells were washed 2× and media was replaced with XF base DMEM (Agilent 103334-100) supplemented with 25 mM glucose (Agilent 103577-100), 2 mM glutamine (Agilent 103579-100), and 1 mM pyruvate (Agilent 103578-100), pH 7.4. A mitochondrial stress test was performed on a Seahorse XFe96 Analyser under standard assay conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 1 µM oligomycin, 3 µM FCCP, and 0.5 µM Rotenone+0.5 µM Antimycin A (Agilent 103015-100). Data were normalized to total cell content per well using crystal violet staining. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, stained with crystal violet. Excess dye was washed away, and then cells were permeabilized using 1% SDS to solubilize the crystal violet stain. Samples were transferred to a standard 96-well plate and absorbance at 595 nm was read on a BioTek plate reader. Results were analyzed in WAVE software and processed through the XF Mito Stress Test Report. The experiment was replicated with consistent results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Modeling of MCAT p.T271I mutation</title><p>The human MCAT crystal structure was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB 2C2N). The crystal sequence was aligned with the full-length sequence (Uniprot: Q8IVS2) to identify the residue in the crystal structure (T235) that corresponds with the mutated residue identified in the patient (T271). The crystal structure was imported into PyMol 2.5.2, and T235 was mutated to an isoleucine in order to model the structural impact of the mutation on interactions with nearby residues.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Informed consent and consent to publish was obtained from the index family.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. As you can tell from the comments below, the reviewers believe manuscript is of interest and adds further translational value to the previous work of the authors, but issues remain unresolved. In general, the study would benefit from more controlled reconstitution assays (wild-type and T271I-MCAT) in a defined in vitro cell model, such as the previously generated hypomorphic Mcat clones.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some data on the molecular mechanism connecting the loss of MCAT activity to mitochondrial dysfunction is needed. In the absence of such data, a specialty journal may be more appropriate.</p><p>2) The amino acid substitution (T271I) is in the vicinity of the predicted active site (His270) of the MCAT enzyme: how does this mutation impact catalytic activity and protein stability?</p><p>3) How do the authors reconcile this defect in MCAT with no apparent lesions in the mtFAS system. A more thorough analysis of the effects of this T271I-MCAT variant on mitochondrial functionality (e.g., by using Seahorse respirometry) would complement the presented data.</p><p>4) Quantification of the Western blots in Figure 2 and statistical significance analysis is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68047.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some data on the molecular mechanism connecting the loss of MCAT activity to mitochondrial dysfunction is needed.

Using total protein lysates from these new C2C12 lines, we performed western blots and found that the T271I mutant rescues protein lipoylation in MCAT-deficient cells to a similar extent as does wild-type human MCAT. In contrast, respiration was not rescued by the T271I mutant. We previously showed that the electron transfer chain (ETC) assembly function of mtFAS is mediated by LYRM proteins, which are destabilized when mtFAS is not functional. We added a new section to the discussion that describes the potential involvement of LYRM proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The amino acid substitution (T271I) is in the vicinity of the predicted active site (His270) of the MCAT enzyme: how does this mutation impact catalytic activity and protein stability?</p></disp-quote><p>MCAT abundance is decreased in the patient cells (Figure 2), implying decreased protein stability. We also addressed this question in C2C12 cells by expressing wild-type and T271I-mutant MCAT, driven by the EF1-COR promoter (Figure 4A), and found that the mutant is less stable. We also include a model of the mutation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D) showing its proximity to the active site. Based on these data, we believe that both stability and catalytic activity are likely affected and have added a section to the Discussion considering this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How do the authors reconcile this defect in MCAT with no apparent lesions in the mtFAS system. A more thorough analysis of the effects of this T271I-MCAT variant on mitochondrial functionality (e.g., by using Seahorse respirometry) would complement the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that this mutation in MCAT is unique in that it seems to decouple two endpoints downstream of mtFAS: lipoic acid synthesis, which is preserved, and LYRM stability and ETC assembly, which we previously showed does not depend on lipoic acid synthesis. We have performed Seahorse respirometry in the newly created C2C12 cell lines and find that the T271I mutant only partially rescues both basal and maximal respiration, in comparison to wild-type human MCAT, which rescues to control levels. These data agree well with our western blot data that show that lipoylation is rescued to a similar extent by both constructs but ETC assembly is still impaired.</p><p>We hypothesize that this decoupling may be a result of substrate limitation: because MCAT supplies malonyl- ACP, which is necessary to extend acyl chains, this less functional MCAT mutant may decrease the available malonyl-ACP and, therefore, preference the pathway towards shorter chain products (like lipoic acid) over the longer acyl chains required for LYRM binding and ETC assembly. We have added a section proposing this hypothesis in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Quantification of the Western blots in Figure 2 and statistical significance analysis is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the Western blots and added descriptive statistics in Figure 2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).</p></body></sub-article></article>
