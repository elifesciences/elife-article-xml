change with cell cycle progression. Our previous work characterized buoyant mass dynamics in mitosis (Miettinen et al., 2019), but how dry mass and cell composition change in mitosis has remained unclear. To better understand mitotic cell growth and compositional changes, we develop a single-cell approach for monitoring dry mass and the density of that dry mass every ~75 s with 1.3% and 0.3% measurement precision, respectively. We find that suspension grown mammalian cells lose dry mass and increase dry mass density following mitotic entry. These changes display large, non-genetic cell-to-cell variability, and the changes are reversed at metaphase-anaphase transition, after which dry mass continues accumulating. The change in dry mass density causes buoyant and dry mass to differ specifically in early mitosis, thus reconciling existing literature on mitotic cell growth. Mechanistically, cells in early mitosis increase lysosomal exocytosis, and inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis decreases the dry mass loss and dry mass density increase in mitosis. Overall, our work provides a new approach for monitoring single-cell dry mass and dry mass density, and reveals that mitosis is coupled to extensive exocytosis-mediated secretion of cellular contents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell growth</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>dry mass</kwd><kwd>density</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>quantitative biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA14051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manalis</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MIT Center for Cancer Precision Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manalis</surname><given-names>Scott R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006352</institution-id><institution>Virginia and D.K.

In continuously proliferating cells, these processes are coordinated so that all cellular components are doubled during each cell cycle, whereas differentiating cells may change their composition to match their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lloyd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miettinen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmoller and Skotheim, 2015</xref>). Changes in cellsâ molecular composition are typically studied with approaches such as mass spectrometry, which can quantify the molecular details of a cell population after lysis. However, non-invasive methods, which can monitor the cellular composition of live single cells with high resolution, are better suited for the study of dynamic and temporary events such as mitosis.</p><p>Cellsâ total molecular content, that is, dry mass, can be monitored using methods such as quantitative phase microscopy (QPM). Dry mass measurements are critical for understanding cell size and growth regulation, but they are often limited in resolution and, more importantly, they do not inform us about the composition of the dry mass. One approach that overcomes this is stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, which can measure the total amount of proteins and lipids in a live cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). While Raman scattering-based methods provide spatial resolution and details about the molecular changes taking place, they can also cause phototoxicity, which significantly limits the temporal resolution when tracking the same cell(s) over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Alternatively, QPM-based dry mass measurements can be coupled to microscopy-based total volume measurements to quantify dry density (dry mass/total volume) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Odermatt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yeo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>). These methods include cellâs water content in the total volume quantification. For example, a decrease in the amount of cellular lipids decreases the dry density of a cell, as the cell has less dry mass per total volume.</p><p>Here, we introduce a new approach for monitoring single cellâs dry mass (i.e. total mass â water mass), dry volume (i.e. total volume â water volume), and density of the dry mass (i.e. dry mass/dry volume), which we will refer to as dry mass density. Cellâs dry mass, dry volume, and dry mass density can be quantified by comparing the cellâs buoyant mass in normal water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and heavy water (deuterium oxide, D<sub>2</sub>O)-based solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>). However, high concentration of D<sub>2</sub>O prevents cell proliferation and can result in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampmeyer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schroeter et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>). Here, we show that we can expose the cell to D<sub>2</sub>O only periodically (every 75 s) and for very short durations (10â15 s), thus allowing us to non-invasively monitor the dry mass and dry mass density of the same cell over many generations without compromising cell growth and viability. By definition, the measured dry mass density is independently of the cellâs water content and therefore sensitive toward changes in the relative molecular composition (dry composition), not the overall concentration of dry mass. For example, a decrease in the amount of cellular lipids increases the dry mass density of a cell, as lipids are lower in dry mass density than other cellular components.</p><p>We have previously monitored the buoyant mass accumulation of single mammalian cells in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>) using the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR), a cantilever-based single-cell buoyant mass sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burg et al., 2007</xref>). We found that buoyant mass accumulation rate is high from prophase to metaphase-anaphase transition, that is, early mitosis. In contrast, studies using QPM have suggested that dry mass does not accumulate in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>), or that cells may even experience a decrease in dry mass in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). If cells actually lose dry mass in mitosis, this would indicate previously unrecognized compositional changes taking place in mitosis. Although the exact dynamics of dry mass accumulation in mitosis remain debatable, our study addresses this seeming contradiction between buoyant and dry mass measurements by providing a high-resolution view of the mitotic dry mass and dry mass density changes.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Measurement method</title><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>Measurement principle</title><p>In our approach, we consider the buoyant mass of a cell to be dependent on two distinct physical âsectionsâ of the cell, the dry content and the water content. To measure the cellâs dry content independently of the water content, we measure the cellâs buoyant mass in H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O-based solutions. Under these conditions, the influence of the water content on buoyant mass can be excluded, because the intracellular water is exchanged with extracellular water, making the intracellular water content neutrally buoyant with extracellular solution. This allows us to detect the cellâs dry mass (i.e. total mass â water mass), dry volume (i.e. total volume â water volume), and dry mass density (i.e. dry mass/dry volume). Importantly, our approach assumes that all water within the cell is exchangeable between H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O. Accordingly, our dry volume measurement is distinct from the excluded cell volume detected by measuring cell volume following strong hyperosmotic shocks, which does not remove all water from the intracellular space.</p><p>In practice, the measured cell first travels through the SMR while filled with H<sub>2</sub>O-based solution to obtain a buoyant mass measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On the other side of the SMR, the cell is briefly exposed to D<sub>2</sub>O-based solution. Cells constantly exchange their water content, causing intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O to be exchanged to D<sub>2</sub>O. The cell then travels back through the SMR in D<sub>2</sub>O solution to obtain a second buoyant mass measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The densities of the extracellular fluid are not constant due to fluid mixing between measurements, but this is accounted for by directly measuring the extracellular solution density, that is, the baseline frequency of the SMR, together with every buoyant mass measurement. These buoyant mass measurements can then be used to calculate the dry mass, dry volume, and dry mass density of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of dry mass and dry mass density measurements using the suspended microchannel resonator (SMR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cellâs buoyant mass is first measured in normal, H<sub>2</sub>O-based culture media (blue), after which the cell mixes with D<sub>2</sub>O-based culture media (orange). The water content inside the cell exchanges to match the external water content. The cellâs buoyant mass is then measured again in the D<sub>2</sub>O-based media and the cell is mixed with normal, H<sub>2</sub>O-based media, where the cell waits for the next measurement. (<bold>B</bold>) In practice, these measurements are carried out using an SMR, where H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O-based medias are kept on different sides of the cantilever. Continuous flushing of fresh media into the system prevents the two fluids from equilibrating over time. The cell is depicted as a small blue/orange sphere. (<bold>C</bold>) To calculate the dry mass and dry mass density of the cell, the two buoyant mass measurements are correlated as a function of media density. The SMRâs baseline signal (vibration frequency) is proportional to media density and this measurement is obtained immediately before and after each buoyant mass measurement (frequency response to a cell flowing through the SMR) to account for variability in media mixing.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-76664-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Quantifications of dry mass and dry mass density measurement errors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Monitoring dry mass (red) and dry mass density (blue) of a single L1210 cell kept at +4Â°C to prevent cell growth and major compositional changes.

Consequently, the latter term of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> approaches zero for both the H<sub>2</sub>O and the D<sub>2</sub>O-based buoyant mass measurements and the two consecutive measurements can be used to solve the first term of the equation, that is, the dry mass and dry mass density of a cell.</p></sec><sec id="s1-1-2"><title>Measurement precision and stability</title><p>We characterized our measurement precision and stability using several approaches. First, we monitored live non-growing L1210 cells (mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells) by cooling our measurement system down to +4Â°C to prevent growth and compositional changes. We measured the same cell repeatedly and defined our measurement error as the coefficient of variation during a 1 hr trace. With this approach our measurement errors in dry mass and dry mass density were ~1.3% and ~0.3%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A&amp;B</xref>). We did not observe measurement drifting even during a longer experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting a high level of measurement stability. Second, we monitored fixed cells at +37Â°C and observed measurement errors that were close to those seen in live cells at +4Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Third, we monitored the dry mass and density of 10 Âµm diameter polystyrene beads at +37Â°C. This suggested similar dry mass measurement errors as the previous experiments with live and fixed cells, but lower errors in dry mass density measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We therefore estimate our dry mass measurement error to be ~1.3%, which is comparable to current state-of-the-art QPM measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reed et al., 2011</xref>). For dry mass density measurements, we estimate our measurement error to be ~0.3%. We are not aware of any other single-cell methods capable of quantifying this metric. Furthermore, as we carry out dry mass and dry mass density measurements approximately every 75 s, we can further increase our precision by averaging multiple measurements while still capturing changes on timescales meaningful for studying dynamic and transient events such as mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s1-1-3"><title>Measurement sensitivity to intracellular water exchange</title><p>Our measurement principle involves the cells exchanging their intracellular water content between H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O, and this exchange has to be complete for our measurements to reflect the dry mass and dry mass density of cells. Direct experimental evidence suggests that cells normally exchange their water content within ~1 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Potma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quirk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). To support this, we carried out back-of-the-envelope calculations on the intracellular water exchange times, as based on reported aquaporin water permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gravelle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hashido et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang and Verkman, 1997</xref>), abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denker et al., 1988</xref>), and a cell water volume of ~1000 fl (approximate water volume for an L1210 cell). This suggested that cells are capable of exchanging all of their water volume within 0.1â2.5 s, depending on the reported aquaporin water permeability. Notably, the true intracellular water exchange time may differ from this due to intracellular water diffusion, water molecule interactions with other biomolecules, and additional means of water transport in and out of the cell (additional aquaporin isoforms, endo- and exocytosis, etc.).</p><p>In our typical measurement, a cell is exposed to D<sub>2</sub>O for 10â15 s, which should enable complete water exchange. To validate the completeness of the water exchange, we correlated the measured dry mass and dry mass density to the time that a cell was exposed to the D<sub>2</sub>O-based media between each buoyant mass measurement. Whether examining end-point measurements of single L1210 cells in a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), a single-cell trace of a live L1210 cell cooled to +4Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>) or a single-cell trace of an L1210 cell at +37Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), the measured dry mass and dry mass density were independent of the time in D<sub>2</sub>O-based media. Thus, the rate of intracellular water exchange is not limiting our measurements, as also suggested by previous results in bacteria and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monitoring single cellâs dry mass and dry mass density</title><p>In order to continuously monitor the dry mass and dry mass density of single cells, we needed to periodically expose the cells to D<sub>2</sub>O, which can impact cell growth and viability. We first tested the sensitivity of L1210, BaF3 (mouse pro-B cell myeloma), and S-Hela (human adenocarcinoma) cells toward different concentrations of D<sub>2</sub>O by monitoring cell proliferation with live cell imaging. Under normal culture conditions, all three cell lines can tolerate continuous exposure to up to 30% D<sub>2</sub>O without changes to proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Cells were still able to proliferate at higher D<sub>2</sub>O concentrations, albeit slowly.</p><p>With the observed level of D<sub>2</sub>O tolerance, we hypothesized that we could monitor the dry mass density of a single cell growing inside the SMR as long as we minimize D<sub>2</sub>O exposure.

For dry mass growth, this has only been examined using QPM. Utilizing our new dry mass growth measurements, we examined the mode of growth in wt and FUCCI L1210 cells in interphase. We compared linear and exponential growth models using Akaike information criterion (AIC) and found that exponential fits are a better model for our data in 37 out of 39 interphases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

This can result in seemingly conflicting findings if cells change their composition. Our data enabled direct comparison of dry mass and buoyant mass measurements. We first examined the correlation between dry mass and buoyant mass on population level by carrying out end-point measurements of single cells. We observed a high degree of correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt;0.97) for L1210, BaF3, and S-Hela cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>).

We also validated the metaphase-anaphase transition timing by examining the degradation of the hGeminin-mKO cell cycle reporter in the FUCCI L1210 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Curiously, we observed that many, but not all, L1210 cells lost dry mass and, especially, dry volume following mitotic entry, resulting in increased dry mass density in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>). This was observed in both wt and FUCCI L1210 cells, although the FUCCI cells displayed larger changes in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). On average, the FUCCI L1210 cells lost ~4% of dry mass and increased dry mass density by ~2.5%, and these changes took place in approximately 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the most extreme cases, cells lost ~8% of their dry mass while increasing dry mass density by ~4%. These changes were transient, as cells recovered their lost dry mass and decreased their dry mass density at metaphase-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The recovery of dry mass at metaphase-anaphase transition was faster than the dry mass growth observed prior to mitosis, suggesting that this ârecovery growthâ is distinct from normal cell growth. After the metaphase-anaphase transition, dry mass growth continued during cytokinesis. The total amount of dry mass accumulated in mitosis and cytokinesis was large, over 10% of the dry mass accumulated in the whole cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The extent of mitotic dry mass loss in early mitosis was coupled to the extent of corresponding dry mass density increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

To this end, we inhibited cytokinesis in FUCCI L1210 cells using 50 nM Aurora B inhibitor Barasertib. We validated the inhibition of cytokinesis by imaging cell morphology as cells proceeded through metaphase-anaphase transition, as indicated by the degradation of the hGeminin-mKO signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The Barasertib-treated cells displayed slightly lower, but statistically not significantly different, loss of dry mass and increase in dry mass density as untreated FUCCI L1210 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E&amp;F</xref>). The duration of mitosis was lengthened in some Barasertib-treated cells, resulting in slower recovery of dry mass and dry mass density. Thus, the mitotic changes in cellâs dry mass and dry mass density cannot be fully explained by cell elongation and furrowing, although cell elongation and furrowing (or Aurora B activity) could still have an influence on dry mass and dry mass density dynamics in mitosis.</p><p>Another major morphological change that mitotic cells undergo is the mitotic cell swelling, where cells take up water and can increase their total volume by 10â20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Son et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>). This takes place simultaneously with the dry mass changes, that is, cells swell from prophase to metaphase and recover in anaphase. To investigate if mitotic cell swelling is required for the dry mass and dry mass density changes, we inhibited mitotic swelling using 10 ÂµM sodium-hydrogen exchanger inhibitor 5-(<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA). We first validated that EIPA prevents mitotic cell swelling by monitoring approximate intracellular water volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Son et al., 2015</xref>). This revealed that the FUCCI L1210 cells swell significantly in early mitosis, but this is near completely prevented by EIPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, when we monitored the dry mass and density of FUCCI L1210 cells in the presence of EIPA, we did not observe any changes in the amount of dry mass lost or dry mass density increased in early mitosis when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Therefore, the mitotic dry mass and dry mass density changes do not require mitotic cell swelling. However, it remains possible that these two phenotypes share a common driving mechanism. Finally, we validated that the mitotic perturbations used here did not influence the typical dry mass density of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Lysosomal exocytosis is increased in early mitosis</title><p>Cells undergo a constant influx and efflux of dry mass through the flux of ions, metabolites, proteins, and other components that are taken up and secreted by a cell. When evaluating potential mechanisms for the mitotic loss of dry mass, we first considered the extent of dry mass loss in mitosis, which was ~8% in extreme cases. Macromolecules would be the most likely form of mass lost, as they constitute most of cellâs dry mass. In contrast, inorganic ions are an unlikely form of dry mass lost, as these constitute only ~1% of cellâs dry mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper and Hausman, 2013</xref>). Cells could secrete metabolites or small molecules in mitosis, but at least the secretion of lactate, a key metabolite secreted by cells, is not increased in mitotic L1210 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, it seems unlikely that cells could lose large amounts of ions and/or small molecules while increasing osmotic pressure, which is required for the mitotic cell swelling. We therefore focused our study on mechanisms that secrete macromolecules.</p><p>Macromolecule secretion is largely due to exocytosis, the process where intracellular vesicles or organelles merge with the plasma membrane to release their contents to the extracellular space. This is balanced by the reverse process called endocytosis. Most studies have found that endocytosis stops in mitosis, more specifically from mitotic entry until anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fielding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schweitzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warren et al., 1984</xref>). This corresponds to the timing of dry mass loss that we have observed. However, contradictory results on mitotic endocytosis have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucrot and Kirchhausen, 2007</xref>). Changes in exocytosis have not been studied in similar detail during mitosis, but lysosomal exocytosis, where cells secrete lysosomal contents by fusing lysosomes with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>), has been suggested to increase in late mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nugues et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, lysosomal exocytosis has also been shown to secrete fatty acids (which are low in dry mass density) out of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2021</xref>), which could increase the dry mass density of a cell.</p><p>We hypothesized that the loss of dry mass in early mitosis is driven by increased exocytosis of components such as lysosomes. Lysosomal exocytosis, and the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane, can be quantified by monitoring the presence of the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 on cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samie and Xu, 2014</xref>).

Thus, lysosomal exocytosis is, at least partly, responsible for the loss of dry mass and increased dry mass density in early mitosis. However, other mechanisms, including other forms of exocytosis, may also be involved, because inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis did not prevent all dry mass loss in mitosis, and because our results are limited to a single cell line.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have developed a method using the SMR to monitor the dry mass, dry volume, and dry mass density of suspension grown cells over long periods of time with high precision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method capable of non-invasively measuring cellâs dry volume or dry mass density. We anticipate several uses for this method. First, our dry mass density measurements provide an orthogonal approach for studying the macromolecular composition of cells. While dry mass density measurements lack molecular specificity, they are non-invasive, quantitative, and have high temporal resolution. Together, these qualities make our measurements valuable for studying the dynamics of molecular composition changes, especially in situations where rapid changes cannot be easily resolved by more typical population level measurements, such as mass spectrometry. Second, our method provides an additional approach for measuring dry mass. QPM has several advantages over our method, including higher throughput and suitability for adherent cells, but our method is comparable in precision and has high temporal resolution. Our method is also not limited by phototoxicity. This enables us to observe dry mass dynamics that may be difficult to capture with other methods. Third, the ability of our method to measure cellular dry volume could enable precise, specific, and non-invasive quantifications of single-cell water content, provided it is coupled with a measurement of total cell volume.</p><p>Using our method, we have expanded our previous study of mammalian cell growth dynamics in mitosis. Importantly, the mitotic dry mass dynamics differ from our previously reported buoyant mass dynamics due to a transient change in dry mass density in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). This finding reconciles our previous mitotic buoyant mass measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>) with the QPM-based dry mass measurements by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zlotek-Zlotkiewicz et al., 2015</xref>). The overall dry mass growth remains high in mitosis and cytokinesis, and for L1210 cells over 10% of the total dry mass growth in the cell cycle takes place in mitosis and cytokinesis. This supports our previous main conclusion that average cell growth rates in mitosis and cytokinesis are comparable to those observed in interphase, which is consistent with the high protein synthesis rates reported for unperturbed mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coldwell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stonyte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). In interphase, dry mass density is conserved, making buoyant mass an excellent proxy for dry mass.</p><p>A key discovery made here is the significant loss of dry mass in early mitosis. Importantly, a loss of dry mass in mitosis has been reported in adherent mammalian cells studied using QPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), but the higher temporal resolution of our results enables us to examine this phenotype in more detail. However, our measurement approach decreased the duration of mitosis and cytokinesis, which could potentially influence the dry mass dynamics we observe in mitosis. This decrease in mitotic duration is contradictory to previous studies which show that mitosis is prolonged by D<sub>2</sub>O exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamprecht et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takahashi and Sato, 1983</xref>), possibly due to the brief but repeated D<sub>2</sub>O exposure in our measurements. Our results reveal a high degree of cell-to-cell variability in the mitotic loss of dry mass and cells can divide without losing mass. Mechanistically, we show that exocytosis of lysosomes is increased in early mitosis and the loss of dry mass is, at least partly, dependent on lysosomal exocytosis. Other mechanisms, especially other forms of exocytosis, may also be involved, as we were not able to completely block the dry mass loss in early mitosis by preventing lysosomal exocytosis. In addition, the loss of dry mass in early mitosis could be partly explained by decreased endocytosis, as the total dry mass of a cell is defined by the balance between uptake and secretion processes, such as endo- and exocytosis, respectively. Our results also show that cells are able to recover dry mass at a high rate at metaphase-anaphase transition. Interestingly, the exocytosis of lysosomes is typically followed by endocytosis, which removes lysosomal membranes from plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Idone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tam et al., 2010</xref>). Such a compensatory endocytosis could explain the rapid recovery of dry mass at metaphase-anaphase transition, but further quantitative studies on endo- and exocytosis are needed to confirm this.</p><p>The magnitude of dry mass density increase in mitosis was large. We have previously observed similar magnitude changes in dry mass density when perturbing proliferation in mammalian cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>). To provide some rough estimates of what kind of compositional changes would be required to achieve the dry mass loss and dry mass density increase, we carried out a back-of-the-envelope calculations. Assuming a typical mammalian cell composition and typical macromolecule dry mass densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberts, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>), we calculated the degree of lipid loss needed to increase dry mass density by 2.5%. This suggested that cells would have to secrete ~1/3 of their lipid content in early mitosis. This could be achieved via lysosomal exocytosis of lipids. Lipid droplets, the main lipid storages inside cells, are frequently trafficked into and degraded in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh et al., 2009</xref>), and lipid droplets can also be secreted via lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minami et al., 2022</xref>). However, it seems likely that the mitotic dry mass density increase also involves secretion of other low dry mass density components (e.g. lipoproteins, specific metabolites) and/or a minor, transient increase in high dry mass density components (e.g. RNAs, specific proteins) in early mitosis. Indeed, CDK1 activity has been suggested to drive a transient increase in protein and RNA content in early mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asfaha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clemm von Hohenberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shuda et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Why would cells exocytose lysosomal contents and a significant amount of total cellular biomass in mitosis? We hypothesize three potential reasons for this: (1) Lysosomal exocytosis acts in plasma membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddy et al., 2001</xref>), and lysosomal exocytosis could enable a temporarily increase in plasma membrane area for mitotic cell swelling. (2) Lysosomal exocytosis is used for secretion of various proteins and enzymes into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blott and Griffiths, 2002</xref>), and mitotic cells may secrete extracellular matrix modifying enzymes in order to ensure an appropriate physical milieu for cell division. (3) Lysosomal exocytosis has been shown to clear the cell of excessive/toxic cellular proteins and lipids, including Î±-synuclein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsunemi et al., 2019</xref>) and tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Mitotic lysosomal exocytosis may act as a âresetâ that enables the daughter cells to be born with a minimal load of useless/harmful contents. Consequently, non-dividing cells, such as neurons, could be more prone to suffer from excessive/toxic protein and lipid buildup, and the mechanism(s) that promote(s) mitotic lysosomal exocytosis could act as candidate drug target(s) for promoting cellular clearance of toxic/excess components. Lysosomal exocytosis is also perturbed in a variety of lysosomal and lipid storage disorders (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Samie and Xu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Settembre and Ballabio, 2014</xref>), and lysosomal exocytosis can drive the cellular expulsion of chemotherapeutics out of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vyas et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhitomirsky and Assaraf, 2017</xref>). Understanding the mechanism(s) of mitotic lysosomal exocytosis could have implications for these diseases as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">wt L1210</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#CCL-219</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FUCCI L1210</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Son et al., 2015</xref>, <italic>Nature Methods</italic>), cells originate from ATCC (Cat#CCL-219)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BaF3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RIKEN BioResource Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#RCB4476</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S-HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kindly provided by laboratory of Kevin Elias from Brigham And Womenâs Hospital</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">THP-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kindly provided by laboratory of Jianzhu Chen from Massachusetts Institute of Technology</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">wt L1210</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#CCL-219</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">STLC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#164739;

This served as the H<sub>2</sub>O-based media for experiments and the D<sub>2</sub>O-based media was made to an identical composition using RPMI media powder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #31800022) and heavy water (Sigma-Aldrich, #151882). D<sub>2</sub>O-based media pH was adjusted to 7.4 with HCl and NaOH, and the media was filtered with 0.2 Âµm filter. To minimize cell exposure to heavy water in the SMR experiments, the D<sub>2</sub>O-based media was diluted with the normal H<sub>2</sub>O-based media to contain 50% heavy water. All experiments were started using cells growing exponential at a confluency of 250.000â500.000 cells/ml.</p><p>All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma. L1210 cells were obtained from and authenticated by ATCC. BaF3 cells were obtained from and authenticated by RIKEN BioResource Center. THP-1 cells were kindly gifted by the laboratory of Jianzhu Chen from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and S-Hela cells were kindly gifted by the laboratory of Kevin Elias from Brigham and Womenâs Hospital. No additional authentication was done for THP-1 and S-Hela cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell confluency and morphology imaging</title><p>Cell population growth in medias with increasing amounts of D<sub>2</sub>O was measured by imaging cell confluency on a plate over ~3 days. Confluency was monitored using the IncuCyte live cell analysis imaging system by Sartorius. Imaging was carried out every 3 hr using 4Ã objective and confluency was analyzed using IncuCyte S3 2017 softwareâs standard settings. The confluency data were then used to calculate confluency doubling time, which was used as a proxy for cell cycle duration. For validations of cell morphology in mitosis, cells were imaged every 2 min with 20Ã objective using the IncuCyte. Metaphase-anaphase transition was detected by simultaneous imaging of the FUCCI cell cycle sensor on FITC channel. The example images were overlaid and processed in the IncuCyte S3 2017 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Chemical perturbations, cell cycle synchronizations, cell cycle analyses</title><p>Chemical treatment concentrations are indicated in main text and supplier details can be found in the key resources table. For SMR experiments, the cells were not pretreated with the chemical inhibitors, and all treatments started at the beginning of each SMR experiment. The treatment time until mitosis therefore varies between experiments, with typical range being 2â4 hr. Apart from EIPA treatments, all SMR experiments with chemical inhibitors lasted only for one cell division.</p><p>For cell cycle synchronization in G2 and mitosis, cells growing at ~400.000 cells/ml confluency were first arrested in G2 using 5 Î¼M RO-3306 treatment. For L1210 and BaF3 cells, this treatment lasted for 6 hr; for THP-1 cells this treatment lasted for 20 hr. The cells were then washed twice with cold PBS and moved into fresh media containing either 5 Î¼M RO-3306 (for G2 arrest) or 5 Î¼M STLC (for prometaphase arrest). For L1210 and BaF3 cells, this treatment lasted for 1 hr; for THP-1 cells this treatment lasted for 2 hr. After this, the cells were either fixed for cell cycle analysis or immunolabeled with anti-LAMP-1 antibody in drug containing media. Cell cycle arrest in G2 and mitosis was validated using flow cytometry-based detection of DNA and p-histone H3 (Ser10) labeling, as detailed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>).

The cells were moved to fresh media (containing chemical treatments, where applicable) and incubated with the antibody at 1:50 dilution for 40 min on ice, after which the cells were washed twice with fresh media and either imaged or measured using flow cytometry. For antibody isotype control, we used rat monoclonal IgG2a kappa Isotype Control antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_493963">AB_493963</ext-link>).

For microscopy, we used DeltaVision wide-field deconvolution microscope with standard filters (FITC, APC), 100Ã objective and an immersion oil with a refractive index of 1.516. For each image, we collected 15 z-slices with 0.2 Î¼m spacing, deconvolved the images using SoftWoRx 7.0.0 software and selected a middle z-slice for visualization. For flow cytometry-based detection of LAMP-1, DNA was not stained and LAMP-1 immunolabeling was detected using BD Biosciences flow cytometer LSR II HTS with excitation laser at 488 nm and emission filter at 530/30.</p><p>Image quantifications were carried out manually from single z-layers by cropping out each cell and calculating the average LAMP-1 labeling intensity per cell in ImageJ (version 2.0.0-rc-69/1.52 p). z-layers with intracellular labeling were rare and not used for analysis. Cells were classified as interphase, early, or late mitotic cells based on their DNA morphology. After this, the background signal was removed from the cell signals, and the LAMP-1 labeling of each cell was normalized to the average intensity observed in all interphase cells within the same image (typical image contained ~19 interphase cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>SMR operation for dry mass and dry mass density measurements</title><p>Basic SMR build and operation was identical to that reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>). The concept of dry mass and dry mass density measurements is detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>. For dry mass and dry mass density measurements, the bypass channel on one side of the SMR cantilever is filled with H<sub>2</sub>O-based media and the other side with D<sub>2</sub>O-based media. For end-point single-cell measurements, the cells are first loaded on the H<sub>2</sub>O-based media side of the device at ~300.000 cells/ml concentration. A cell is then flown through the SMR to obtain a measurement in the H<sub>2</sub>O-based media. On the other side of the cantilever the cell is diluted in D<sub>2</sub>O-based media, which is in excess to the H<sub>2</sub>O-based media to maximize dilution. In a typical end-point measurement, the cell spends 5â8 s in the D<sub>2</sub>O-based media. The cell is then flown back through the SMR to obtain a second measurement, this time in the D<sub>2</sub>O-based media. After this, both sides of the cantilever are flushed with fresh media and cell(s) and the cycle is repeated. For single-cell monitoring, the protocol is the same as for end-point measurements, except that the cell is maintained for ~55 s in the H<sub>2</sub>O-based media and ~15 s in D<sub>2</sub>O-based media. Time in D<sub>2</sub>O-based media is kept longer than in end-point measurements, as this increases the long-term stability of single-cell trapping. Importantly, the SMR baseline frequency is recorded prior and after every cell measurement. The SMR baseline frequency is directly proportional to media density, which allows us to adjust each measurement for local mixing of H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O-based medias around the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calibration and calculation of dry mass and dry mass density from SMR data</title><p>The two buoyant mass measurement (SMR frequency response to a cell flowing through the cantilever) and media density measurements (SMR frequency baseline immediately before and after the cell flows through the cantilever) were used to calculate dry mass, dry volume, and dry mass density according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, assuming that extracellular fluid (culture media) density is equal to the density of water (H<sub>2</sub>O or D<sub>2</sub>O) inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">FeijÃ³ Delgado et al., 2013</xref>). In order to calibrate the SMR baseline, sodium chloride solutions of known density were measured at RT and used to generate a calibration curve for SMR baseline. In addition, the buoyant mass measurements were calibrated using 10 Âµm diameter monodisperse polystyrene beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Duke Standards), where the volume and density of the measured particle are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mu et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Dry mass and dry mass density measurement resolution estimations</title><p>The precision of dry mass and dry mass density measurements was evaluated by repeatedly measuring the same, non-growing particle. As there are many sources of noise, three types of non-growing particles were used: a fixed L1210 cell measured at +37Â°C (fixation in 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min followed by a wash with PBS), a live L1210 cell measured at +4Â°C, and a 10 Âµm diameter polystyrene bead measured at +37Â°C. Each particle was tracked for dry mass and dry mass density similarly to that described above for live cells. For each experiment, 1 hr long section of the trace was used to calculate the measurement precision, presented as the coefficient of variability. When evaluating experiment-specific measurement noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D</xref>), we fitted the last 1 hr of dry mass data in interphase with a linear fit and calculated the SD of the residuals. Note that this calculation includes both technical and biological noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Intracellular water volume approximation using the SMR</title><p>Approximate intracellular water volume of FUCCI L1210 cells was measured in the SMR by growing the cells in culture media containing 40% OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium (Sigma-Aldrich). The OptiPrep containing media has a solution density which is closer to cellâs dry mass density than the density of water, thus making the SMR-based buoyant mass measurement predominantly sensitive toward intracellular water volume (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Son et al., 2015</xref>). Apart from the different media, the SMR was operated as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miettinen et al., 2019</xref>), and the measurements were calibrated using 10 Âµm diameter monodisperse polystyrene beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Duke Standards).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis, smoothing, and plotting</title><p>For analyses of mitotic dry mass and dry mass density dynamics, each cell trace analysis was limited to data starting from 1 hr before mitotic entry and ending at 2 hr after mitotic entry or at cell division. The very last datapoint prior to abscission was excluded in order to avoid analysis of cells during the final abscission. The traces were then normalized to their average value observed in the 1 hr period before mitotic entry, and the traces were overlayed. When plotting the dry mass, dry volume, or dry mass density mean Â± SD values for each control and/or treatment condition, the moving and locally weighted average was plotted together with identical length moving standard deviation. For quantifications of dry mass, dry volume, or dry mass density changes in early mitosis, we identified the time point in mitosis where, on average, each control/treatment reached the minimum dry mass. The average of five datapoints at the maximal effect size was then compared the average of five datapoints immediately prior to mitotic entry (inclusive of the indexed mitotic entry timepoint). The difference between these two values is defined as âearly mitotic changeâ. Note that the maximal effect size was always achieved prior to metaphase-anaphase transition. Same smoothing and quantification approach was also used for processing the intracellular water volume measurements. For single-cell examples, the cut-out traces were smoothened using LOESS smoothing.</p><p>The mode of cell growth was analyzed by comparing an exponential and a linear fit to the raw dry mass data in interphases. AIC was used to define which fit is better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Dry mass growth rates were analyzed by fitting a 1 hr long section of data with a linear line, using the slope of the line as the growth rate and using the average dry mass within the 1 hr section as the dry mass corresponding to the growth rate. This fit was moved across the interphase of each cell to generate cell growth traces, which were plotted as a function of dry mass and averaged together to display population average growth behavior. Only cells with full cell cycle (from birth to division) were used for analyses of exponential growth. All data processing and smoothing was done using MATLAB (versions 2017b and 2020b), and figures were plotted using MATLAB and Origin (version 2021b).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>The statistical tests used, the results of these tests and detailed information about replicate numbers are indicated in each figure and figure legend. All statistical tests were carried out using Origin (version 2021b) software. Appropriate sample sizes were not computed before experiments and sample sizes were defined by practical considerations (e.g. experimental time requirements). We did not blind-control experiments, as most work was carried out by a single individual. When trapping a cell in the SMR for dry mass and dry mass density measurements, we trap randomly the first normal-sized cell that flows through the SMR after cells are flushed into the system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Source data</title><p>All dry mass and dry mass density traces of live cells, including those where cells are treated with chemical inhibitors, are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is a co-founder of Travera and Affinity Biosensors, which develop technologies relevant to the research presented in this work</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76664-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Supporting source data files contain all key data (dry mass and dry mass density traces) used in this study.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Ye Zhang for assistance with data analysis and Prof. Marco Cosentino Lagomarsino for helpful feedback on the manuscript.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell monitoring of dry mass and dry density reveals exocytosis of cellular dry contents in mitosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthieu Piel (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers request that you clarify the definition of dry mass, dry density, dry mass density, and dry volume. Below you will see the comments of each reviewer on this point, which should help you to clarify these terms.</p><p>2) A mathematical model could help to clarify the interpretation of your results. Referee 3 suggests a simple mathematical model that would roughly estimate how the cell composition (e.g., the contents of lipids vs proteins) should change and what the composition of the lost (secreted) components should be to provide the observed changes to the dry mass and density, given the existing information on average cell composition and the densities of different biomolecules (lipids, sugars, proteins, etc).</p><p>3) Some of the drug treatments require more replicates to provide more conclusive answers. In particular, Figure 4E-F: Given the SD for barasertib and EIPA cells, the authors need more than ~6-10 cells to draw conclusions based on treatment effects. That barasertib treatment does not affect dry mass and dry density changes is not yet convincing.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) The authors show that their measure does not depend on the time spent in D2O, which is important. But it means that the water needs only a few seconds to exchange. Is that expected given the permeation of water through the plasma membrane and the size of the cell? I did not make the calculation, but it seems a bit short. Can the authors give also the theoretical estimate based on the permeation of water through the membrane?</p><p>2) For the measure of the exponential growth rate, the authors could use the same approach as in Cadart et al. Nat Com 2018, which might be more robust than fitting on the single cell growth curve: measuring the growth speed (dm/dt) on short periods of time all along the cell growth trajectories and for all cells and plotting dm/dt versus m. This should show clearly that growth is exponential on average.</p><p>3) The authors show that the changes in dry mass and dry volume are very different frorm cell to cell. How does that relate to the extent of mitotic swelling, which is happening at the same time? Is there a correlation between the two: do cells that swell more also lose more dry mass and/or dry volume (or increase more their dry density)? Plotting one against the other might help understanding whether the two processes are coupled. The authors show that when cells are treated with EIPA, they do not swell but still show an increase in dry density. But it does not mean that the two processes are not coupled in control cells. EIPA treatment is changing the capacity of the cell to swell (for unclear reasons â what it does the most directly is to change the intracellular pH) and it could decouple the two processes but it does not mean that might not share a common driving mechanism (in addition to mitotic entry of course). So it might be an informative plot to make.</p><p>4) At the bottom of page 10 the authors discuss inhibiting 'cell elongation', which is a characteristic of anaphase cells. But they also then inhibit the next step, called furrowing, which is an even more drastic change of shape (when the cell divides in two). They could also mention it as a change of shape that does not affect the dry mass density.</p><p>5) For the readers who are interested in more details of these experiments, it might be interesting to give, in the sup figures, the distribution of volumes and dry mass of the cells which have been treated with the various drugs (for example used in Figure 4), as they are given only normalized in the main figure. It would be interesting to know whether the drugs are changing these values (for example just before cells enter mitosis, do they enter mitosis with the cell volume/dry mass/density when they have been treated with EIPA before). This is more curiosity from this refereeâ¦so the authors might as well choose not to show all that.</p><p>6) In the discussion, line 322, the authors mention high temporal resolution without phototoxicity as an advantage of their method over quantitative phase microscopy. QPM also allows high temporal resolution without phototoxicity. But the main point I think is that it does not measure the same thing! In particular, it does not give access to this 'dry volume' parameter.</p><p>7) The results seem to be cell type dependent and it is quite surprising that the dry mass loss is different for L1210 expressing the FUCCI marker compared with wild-type L1210. Can the authors speculate on why this could be the case (e.g. different levels of exocytosis activity?). Quantification of other cell types in the main figure would be helpful. In line with this, the reduction in dry mass loss with Brefeldin A or Vacuolin-1 inhibition in Figure 6 is convincing but comparable to that observed in wild type cells, while the FUCCI cells show more dramatic decrease in cell mass. The authors should acknowledge this clearly in the text and soften the claim that chemical inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis prevents mitotic dry composition changes.</p><p>8) 'cell elongation' (page 10): do cells elongate in suspension?</p><p>9) Does the mitotic exocytosis described in this relate to previous observations that cells 'bleb' to help correct for asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle (see https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14496 for example?)</p><p>10) The method seems to affect the dynamics of mitosis. Line 149 page 6 states 'while limited D2O exposure appears to influence mitosis duration, it does not radically â¦..' This caveat should be mentioned again in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76664.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All the reviewers request that you clarify the definition of dry mass, dry density, dry mass density, and dry volume. Below you will see the comments of each reviewer on this point, which should help you to clarify these terms.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We apologize for the confusion caused by our terminology, which was based on the terminology used in our original manuscript (Feijo Delgado et al., 2013). We have now changed our terminology to be consistent with more recent works by others. We now define âdry densityâ as dry mass divided by total volume, and we define our measurements of dry mass divided by dry volume as âdry mass densityâ. This change has been applied throughout our manuscript, including our manuscript title. In addition, we have added clearer definitions of each term to our Introduction and Measurement Method sections. Furthermore, we have minimized the use of the term âdry compositionâ throughout our manuscript, as we now realize this may cause confusion to some readers.</p><p>More specifically, our introduction (page 3) now states: âHere, we introduce a new approach for monitoring single cellâs dry mass (i.e. total mass â water mass), dry volume (i.e. total volume â water volume), and density of the dry mass (i.e. dry mass / dry volume), which we will refer to as dry mass density.â These definitions are also repeated in our Measurement Method section (page 4), as many readers may look for the definitions in that section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A mathematical model could help to clarify the interpretation of your results. Referee 3 suggests a simple mathematical model that would roughly estimate how the cell composition (e.g., the contents of lipids vs proteins) should change and what the composition of the lost (secreted) components should be to provide the observed changes to the dry mass and density, given the existing information on average cell composition and the densities of different biomolecules (lipids, sugars, proteins, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We fully agree that such calculations could be very useful in interpreting our results. We have now estimated how much lipids a theoretical cell would have to lose in order to explain the dry mass loss and dry mass density increase. This is explained in a new paragraph (Discussion section, page 13) as follows:</p><p>âThe magnitude of dry mass density increase in mitosis was large. We have previously observed similar magnitude changes in dry mass density when perturbing proliferation in mammalian cell (Feijo Delgado et al., 2013). To provide some rough estimates of what kind of compositional changes would be required to achieve the dry mass loss and dry mass density increase, we carried out a back-of-the-envelope calculations. Assuming a typical mammalian cell composition and typical macromolecule dry mass densities (Alberts, 2008; Feijo Delgado et al., 2013), we calculated the degree of lipid loss needed to increase dry mass density by 2.5%. This suggested that cells would have to secrete ~1/3 of their lipid content in early mitosis. This could be achieved via lysosomal exocytosis of lipids. Lipid droplets, the main lipid storages inside cells, are frequently trafficked into and degraded in lysosomes (Singh et al., 2009), and lipid droplets can also be secreted via lysosomal exocytosis (Minami et al., 2022). However, it seems likely that the mitotic dry mass density increase also involves secretion of other low dry mass density components (e.g. lipoproteins, specific metabolites) and/or a minor, transient increase in high dry mass density components (e.g. RNAs, specific proteins) in early mitosis. Indeed, CDK1 activity has been suggested to drive a transient increase in protein and RNA content in early mitosis (Asfaha et al., 2022; Clemm von Hohenberg et al., 2022; Miettinen et al., 2019; Shuda et al., 2015).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the drug treatments require more replicates to provide more conclusive answers. In particular, Figure 4E-F: Given the SD for barasertib and EIPA cells, the authors need more than ~6-10 cells to draw conclusions based on treatment effects. That barasertib treatment does not affect dry mass and dry density changes is not yet convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that the Barasertib treatment experiments would require more replicates in order to have full confidence that the drug does not influence dry mass and dry mass density behavior in mitosis. After consulting the <italic>eLife</italic> editors, we have instead softened our conclusions to acknowledge that Barasertib treated cells could still have changes in their dry mass behavior when compared to control cells. Our updated Results section (page 9)</p><p>âThe mitotic changes in cellâs dry mass and dry mass density cannot be fully explained by cell elongation and furrowing, although cell elongation and furrowing (or Aurora B activity) could still have an influence on dry mass and dry mass density dynamics in mitosis.â</p><p>We have also changed our figure 4 title to âMitotic dry mass loss and dry mass density increase do not require morphological changesâ, and we have removed the sentence from our abstract that claimed that dry mass changes are independent from cytokinesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) The authors show that their measure does not depend on the time spent in D2O, which is important. But it means that the water needs only a few seconds to exchange. Is that expected given the permeation of water through the plasma membrane and the size of the cell? I did not make the calculation, but it seems a bit short. Can the authors give also the theoretical estimate based on the permeation of water through the membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback, this is a great suggestion. We have now carried out rough estimations of the water exchange time, as based on the water permeability of aquaporin channels, the typical abundance of aquaporin channels and the typical volume of a L1210 cell. We have also added more references that provide direct experimental support for the time required to exchange cellular water content. We detail these at the end of our Measurement method section (page 5) as follows:</p><p>âOur measurement principle involves the cells exchanging their intracellular water content between H2O and D2O, and this exchange has to be complete for our measurements to reflect the dry mass and dry mass density of cells. Direct experimental evidence suggests that cells normally exchange their water content within ~1 second (Potma et al., 2001; Quirk et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2008). To support this, we carried out back-of-the-envelope calculations on the intracellular water exchange times, as based on reported aquaporin water permeability (Gravelle et al., 2013; Hashido et al., 2007; Yang and Verkman, 1997), abundance (Denker et al., 1988) and a cell water volume of ~1000 fl (approximate water volume for a L1210 cell). This suggested that cells are capable of exchanging all of their water volume within 0.1 â 2.5 s, depending on the reported aquaporin water permeability. Notably, the true intracellular water exchange time may differ from this due to intracellular water diffusion, water molecule interactions with other biomolecules and additional means of water transport in and out of the cell (additional aquaporin isoforms, endo- and exocytosis, etc.).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the measure of the exponential growth rate, the authors could use the same approach as in Cadart et al. Nat Com 2018, which might be more robust than fitting on the single cell growth curve: measuring the growth speed (dm/dt) on short periods of time all along the cell growth trajectories and for all cells and plotting dm/dt versus m. This should show clearly that growth is exponential on average.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, we have now added the recommended plot, which clearly shows that growth rates (pg/h) increase as cell mass increases within L1210 cell interphases. This is detailed on pages 6 and 7 of our manuscript, stating that: âConsistent with exponential growth, instantaneous dry mass growth rates (pg/h) increased as a function of dry mass (Figure 2E).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that the changes in dry mass and dry volume are very different frorm cell to cell. How does that relate to the extent of mitotic swelling, which is happening at the same time? Is there a correlation between the two: do cells that swell more also lose more dry mass and/or dry volume (or increase more their dry density)? Plotting one against the other might help understanding whether the two processes are coupled.

So it might be an informative plot to make.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the feedback. Unfortunately, our measurement capabilities do not allow us to simultaneously measure the dry mass (and dry mass density) and the total volume of a cell, and developing such methods would require major engineering work. Thus, we cannot at the moment correlate the degree of mitotic cell swelling to the degree of mitotic dry mass loss. That being said, we agree with the reviewerâs comment, and we have now added the following conclusion to our manuscript (Results section, page 10):</p><p>âThe mitotic dry mass and dry mass density changes do not require mitotic cell swelling. However, it remains possible that these two phenotypes share a common driving mechanism.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) At the bottom of page 10 the authors discuss inhibiting 'cell elongation', which is a characteristic of anaphase cells. But they also then inhibit the next step, called furrowing, which is an even more drastic change of shape (when the cell divides in two). They could also mention it as a change of shape that does not affect the dry mass density.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, as we do indeed prevent furrowing using Aurora B inhibition. We have now pointed this out to the reader in the relevant Results section (page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the readers who are interested in more details of these experiments, it might be interesting to give, in the sup figures, the distribution of volumes and dry mass of the cells which have been treated with the various drugs (for example used in Figure 4), as they are given only normalized in the main figure. It would be interesting to know whether the drugs are changing these values (for example just before cells enter mitosis, do they enter mitosis with the cell volume/dry mass/density when they have been treated with EIPA before). This is more curiosity from this refereeâ¦so the authors might as well choose not to show all that.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, but we have chosen not to add such figures. Cell dry mass and dry volume vary significantly between individual cells even when examining all cells specifically at mitotic entry, especially since the cells are measured over a timespan of many months. In the absence of significantly larger datasets, we find such examinations to have little value. The normalization we utilize in the figures allows us to examine the mitosis specific effects despite this inherent size variability. However, all our raw data is attached to our manuscript, so these analyses can be carried out by others who consider them more important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the discussion, line 322, the authors mention high temporal resolution without phototoxicity as an advantage of their method over quantitative phase microscopy. QPM also allows high temporal resolution without phototoxicity. But the main point I think is that it does not measure the same thing! In particular, it does not give access to this 'dry volume' parameter.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have indeed acknowledged in our discussion that our method can measure the dry volume of cells, which makes our method unique. We have also adjusted our text in the discussion to avoid claims that QPM could not achieve high temporal resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The results seem to be cell type dependent and it is quite surprising that the dry mass loss is different for L1210 expressing the FUCCI marker compared with wild-type L1210.

In line with this, the reduction in dry mass loss with Brefeldin A or Vacuolin-1 inhibition in Figure 6 is convincing but comparable to that observed in wild type cells, while the FUCCI cells show more dramatic decrease in cell mass. The authors should acknowledge this clearly in the text and soften the claim that chemical inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis prevents mitotic dry composition changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. The cell type-dependency of our results is indeed quite surprising, although we have previously also observed that mitotic energy metabolism can differ significantly even between the wt and FUCCI expressing L1210 cells (Kang, et al., 2020, Nature Comms). For all of these phenotypes, we have not found any solid evidence that would explain the cell type-dependency. It is possible that baseline levels of endo- and exocytosis could explain the difference in dry mass loss in mitosis, but in the absence of more evidence, we would prefer to avoid this discussion in our manuscript. However, we completely agree with the reviewer that our conclusions should be rephrased. Our updated Results section (page 11) now states that:</p><p>âInhibitors of lysosomal exocytosis decrease mitotic dry mass loss and dry mass density increaseâ (section title), and that âLysosomal exocytosis is, at least partly, responsible for the loss of dry mass and increased dry mass density in early mitosis. However, other mechanisms, including other forms of exocytosis, may also be involved, because inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis did not prevent all dry mass loss in mitosis, and because our results are limited to a single cell line.â</p><p>In addition, we have now stated in our discussion (pages 13) that:</p><p>âOther mechanisms, especially other forms of exocytosis, may also be involved, as we were not able to completely block the dry mass loss in early mitosis by preventing lysosomal exocytosis.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) 'cell elongation' (page 10): do cells elongate in suspension?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, even in suspension cells the phenotype observed during early anaphase corresponds to cell elongation. This is evident, at least to some degree, in our Figure 4B, where we display timelapse imaging of our suspension grown L1210 FUCCI cells (imaging is carried out in suspension culture). Yet, to avoid confusion, we now call this âcell elongation and furrowingâ, as the detailed reviewer comments noted that cell furrowing is a distinct cytokinetic event that we also inhibit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Does the mitotic exocytosis described in this relate to previous observations that cells 'bleb' to help correct for asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle (see https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14496 for example?)</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting hypothesis, but the timing of cell dry mass loss seems to precede the cell blebbing. More specifically, our data shows that cell mass loss takes place predominantly from mitotic entry (prophase) to metaphase-anaphase transition, whereas the polar relaxation of actin cortex and the consequent cell blebbing takes place predominantly in anaphase. Notably, we have examined polar relaxation in our L1210 FUCCI cells (Kang, et al., Nature Methods, 2019) and the timing of this phenotype is the same in our L1210 cells as in the other model systems examined in the literature (e.g. Rodrigues, et al., Nature, 2015). We therefore consider it unlikely that the cell blebbing typically observed in mitosis would be part of the mechanism causing dry mass loss. Yet, the mitotic exocytosis provides excess plasma membrane (as we note in our discussion), and this excess membrane could enable or even promote blebbing</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The method seems to affect the dynamics of mitosis.

This caveat should be mentioned again in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In our updated Discussion section (on page 12), we now state that:</p><p>âHowever, our measurement approach also decreased the duration of mitosis and cytokinesis, which could potentially influence the dry mass dynamics we observe in mitosis.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
