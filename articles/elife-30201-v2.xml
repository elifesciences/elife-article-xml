PGC specification requires the activity of chromatin regulators that induce genome-wide changes in gene expression. For example, in mice, the transcriptional repressor BLIMP1 initiates PGC specification by blocking the expression of a mesodermal program active in neighboring somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohinata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saitou et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the NSD methyltransferase MES-4 and the Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2, including MES-2, 3 and 6) cooperate to place active and repressive histone marks on germline and somatic genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>). Despite their critical roles during germ cell development, the BLIMP1 and MES/PRC2 chromatin regulators are not germline-specific factors and also function during the differentiation of somatic lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seydoux and Braun, 2006</xref>). How the activities of these global regulators are modulated in germ cells to promote a germline-specific program is not well understood.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, genetic analyses have shown that MES-dependent activation of germline genes is antagonized in somatic lineages by a group of transcriptional regulators first identified by their effects on vulval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Unhavaithaya et al., 2002</xref>). Among these, components of the DRM (named for its Dp/E2F, pRB, and MuvB subunits) class of transcriptional regulators and LIN-15B, a THAP domain DNA binding protein, have been implicated in the silencing of germline genes in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of DRM factors or LIN-15B causes ectopic activation of germline genes in somatic cells leading to growth arrest at elevated temperatures (26°C). Inactivation of <italic>mes-2, mes-3, mes-4</italic> and <italic>mes-6</italic> suppresses the ectopic germline gene expression and restores viability to <italic>lin-15B</italic> mutants at 26°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>). These observations have suggested that DRM factors and LIN-15B antagonizes MES activity in somatic lineages to keep germline genes off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>). A similar antagonism, but in reverse, has been uncovered in the adult germline between the NSD methyltransferase MES-4 and the DRM transcription factor LIN-54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>). The X chromosome is a major focus of MES repression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline. The X chromosome is silenced throughout germ cell development except in oocytes, which activate the transcription of many X-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>mes</italic> mutants prematurely activate the transcription of X-linked genes in pregametic germ cells leading to germ cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seelk et al., 2016</xref>). Reducing the function of the synMuvB transcription factor <italic>lin-54</italic> in <italic>mes-4</italic> mutants restores the expression of X-linked genes closer to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tabuchi et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore in the germline, MES activity antagonizes DRM activity to keep the X chromosome silent. Together, these genetic studies suggest that competition between the MES chromatin modifiers and the DRM/LIN-15B transcription factors balance the transcription of somatic and germline genes in somatic and germline tissues. How this competition is biased during development to ensure appropriate gene expression in each tissue is not known. In this study, we have discovered a link between Nanos and LIN-15B that provides an explanation for how MES activity becomes dominant in the nascent germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30201.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGCs upregulate transcripts expressed in oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mutual antagonism between DRM/LIN-15B transcription factor and PRC2/MES-4 chromatin modifiers balances activities that promote somatic (red) and germline (green) gene expression.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we first examined the fate of maternal RNAs in PGCs. We isolated PGCs from embryos with fewer than 200 cells, at a time when PGCs are still mostly transcriptionally silent (EMB PGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seydoux and Dunn, 1997</xref>). By comparing the EMB PGC transcriptome to a published oocyte transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoeckius et al., 2014</xref>), we observed an excellent correlation in relative transcript abundance between oocytes and EMB PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the transcriptome of EMB PGCs consists primarily of maternal mRNAs inherited from the oocyte. This finding is consistent with in situ hybridization experiments that showed that many maternal RNAs persist in the embryonic germ lineage at least to the P<sub>4</sub> germline founder cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seydoux and Fire, 1994</xref>). Next, we compared the transcriptome of EMB PGCs to that of L1 PGCs to identify PGC transcripts whose abundance decline during embryogenesis.

Strikingly, the amplitude of this turnover was diminished in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi)</italic> mutants: the abundance of the 411 transcripts remained high overall during the transition from EMB PGCs to L1 PGCs in <italic>nos-2(RNAi)nos-1(gv5)</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Of the 1430 upregulated genes in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi)</italic> PGCs, 31% (452) had significantly lower expression levels in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi);lin-15B(RNAi)</italic> PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Both upregulated and down-regulated gene categories were at least partially rescued, as well as X-linked and oocyte genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We conclude that loss of <italic>lin-15B</italic> does not rescue the delay in maternal mRNA turnover observed in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(ax3103)</italic> PGCs.</p><p>By comparing the lists of upregulated genes in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi)</italic> and <italic>mes-4(RNAi)</italic> PGCs and of down-regulated genes in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi);lin-15B(RNAi)</italic> PGCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), we identified 88 shared genes, including 70 X-linked genes. Among these is <italic>utx-1</italic>, an histone demethylase specific for the H3K27me3 mark generated by <italic>mes-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seelk et al., 2016</xref>). Like other X-linked genes, <italic>utx-1</italic> transcripts are rare in wild-type PGCs (FPKM &lt;0.2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and are overexpressed 9.1-fold in <italic>mes-2(RNAi)</italic> PGCs. In <italic>nos-1(gv5) nos-2(RNAi)</italic> L1 PGCs, the <italic>utx-1</italic> locus acquires a new ATAC-seq peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and <italic>utx-1</italic> transcripts are overexpressed 160-fold. This overexpression was reduced significantly by 2.4-fold in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi);lin-15B(RNAi)</italic> PGCs. These observations suggest that <italic>utx-1</italic> may function downstream or in parallel to <italic>lin-15B</italic> to further antagonizes MES activity as X-linked genes become desilenced. If so, loss of <italic>utx-1</italic> should alleviate <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> sterility. Consistent with this prediction, we found that reduction of <italic>utx-1</italic> activity by RNAi partially suppressed <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(ax3103)</italic> sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Suppression by <italic>utx-1</italic> was not as extensive as that observed with <italic>lin-15B</italic>, suggesting that <italic>utx-1</italic> is not the only gene activated in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(ax3103)</italic> PGCs that leads to sterility. These results suggest that activation of <italic>utx-1</italic> may participate in a regulatory loop downstream of maternal LIN-15B that further weakens <italic>mes</italic> activity in <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> animals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have examined the transcriptome of PGCs lacking Nanos function in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We have found that PGCs lacking Nanos overexpress 100 s of transcripts normally expressed in oocytes. Our observations indicate that this defect is due to both delayed turn-over of maternal mRNAs and inappropriate transcription of genes normally silent in PGCs, including oocyte genes. We identify LIN-15B as a critical maternally-inherited factor that must be turned-over by Nanos in PGCs to prevent inappropriate transcription. We propose that clearing of maternal LIN-15B by Nanos allows the PRC2/MES-4 network of chromatin modifiers to reprogram PGCs away from an inherited (maternal) oocyte program to a pregametic germ cell program.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nanos activity is required for the timely turnover of maternal mRNAs in PGCs</title><p>During oogenesis, oocytes stockpile mRNAs and proteins in preparation for embryogenesis. These include mRNAs and proteins with housekeeping functions as well as factors required to specify embryonic cell fates (somatic and germline). During embryogenesis, maternal products are eventually turned over to make way for zygotic factors (maternal-to-zygotic transition). Our findings suggest that Nanos facilitates this transition in PGCs by accelerating the turnover of maternal mRNAs. Nanos family members are thought to silence mRNAs by interacting with the sequence-specific RNA-binding protein Pumilio and with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which interferes with translation and can also destabilize RNAs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swartz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wharton et al., 1998</xref>). In the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome, there are eight genes related to <italic>Drosophila pumilio</italic>. Depletion of five of these (<italic>fbf-1, fbf-2, puf-6, puf-7 and puf-8)</italic> phenocopies the <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGC phenotypes, including failure to incorporate in the somatic gonad, premature proliferation, and eventually cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999</xref>). These observations suggest that NOS-1 and NOS-2 function with Pumilio-like proteins to repress the translation of certain maternal RNAs. Paradoxically, in sea urchins, Nanos silences the mRNA coding for the CNOT6 deadenylase, which indirectly stabilizes other maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swartz et al., 2014</xref>). In that system, Nanos was also found to silence eEF1A expression, leading to a transient period of translational quiescence in PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oulhen et al., 2017</xref>). In combination, these effects could promote the turnover of maternal mRNAs and proteins that promote somatic development (e.g. LIN-15B) while preserving germline mRNAs (e.g. <italic>mes</italic>) whose translation could be reactivated at a later time. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the redundant <italic>nanos</italic> homologs <italic>nos-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2</italic> are expressed sequentially in PGCs during the maternal-to-zygotic transition and may have distinct targets. Genetic analyses already have suggested that <italic>nos-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2</italic> have both shared and unique functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapelle and Reinke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mainpal et al., 2015</xref>). It will be important to determine whether <italic>nos-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2</italic> both target <italic>lin-15B</italic>, and whether they do so directly, by silencing <italic>lin-15B</italic> mRNA translation, or indirectly, by silencing other factors required for LIN-15B protein translation and/or stability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>In the absence of Nanos, maternal LIN-15B interferes with MES-dependent reprogramming of PGC chromatin</title><p>Two lines of evidence indicate that LIN-15B is responsible for much of the abnormal gene expression observed in <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGCs by the first larval stage. First, elimination of maternal LIN-15B restores fertility to <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> mutants and lessens the upregulation of many misregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Second, LIN-15B is a known genetic antagonist of MES function in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and PGCs lacking <italic>mes</italic> activity upregulate many of the same genes upregulated in <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGCs. The strongest correlation is seen for genes on the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), a well-documented focus of MES-dependent silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garvin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaydos et al., 2012</xref>). Together these findings indicate that failure to downregulate maternal LIN-15B interferes with MES-dependent reprogramming of PGC chromatin and is the primary cause of PGC death in Nanos mutants.</p><p>The <italic>lin-15B</italic> locus is on the X chromosome and is ectopically transcribed in <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGCs at hatching. These observations raise the possibility that maternal LIN-15B potentiates zygotic <italic>lin-15B</italic> expression as MES-dependent silencing of the X-chromosome becomes compromised. How LIN-15B opposes MES activity is not known, but another X-linked gene, <italic>utx-1,</italic> may oppose MES activity directly. <italic>utx-1</italic> encodes a de-methylase that removes the silencing mark deposited by the PRC2 complex. Upregulation of <italic>utx-1</italic> was shown recently to promote reprogramming of adult germline stem cells into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seelk et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGCs, <italic>utx-1</italic> is upregulated in a <italic>lin-15B</italic>-dependent manner, and RNAi of <italic>utx-1</italic> partially suppresses <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Suppression by loss of <italic>utx-1</italic> is weaker than that observed when inactivating <italic>lin-15B</italic>, suggesting that <italic>utx-1</italic> is not the only <italic>lin-15B</italic> target that opposes PRC2. Loss of two other synMuvB genes, <italic>lin-35/Rb</italic> and <italic>dpl-1,</italic> also suppresses <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> sterility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), albeit again less stringently than loss of <italic>lin-15B</italic>. It will be interesting to determine whether these genes function with, or in parallel to, LIN-15B to oppose PRC2 activity in PGCs.</p><p>Recently, <italic>nos-2</italic> was shown to function redundantly with <italic>xnd-1</italic> to repress histone active marks in PGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mainpal et al., 2015</xref>). XND-1 is a chromatin-associated protein expressed in PGCs throughout embryogenesis. An exciting possibility is that XND-1 directly activates MES-dependent remodeling in PGCs. In that context, Nanos could promote germ cell fate simply by eliminating any maternal factors that would interfere with that remodeling. Because PGCs derive from embryonic blastomeres that also give rise to somatic lineages, they inherit many transcripts with somatic functions. In addition to LIN-15B, we have found that Nanos accelerates the turn-over of several maternal mRNAs coding for transcription factors that function in somatic embryonic lineages, including <italic>pha-4, hlh-1 and tbx-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We speculate that perdurance of these somatic transcription factors contributes to the complex transcriptional profile of <italic>nos-1nos-2</italic> PGCs. The primary function of Nanos may be, therefore, to clear the PGCs of any mRNAs that promote somatic development. This interpretation is consistent with previous studies in Drosophila and Xenopus that reported the expression of somatic transcripts in PGCs lacking Nanos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deshpande et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oulhen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swartz et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Nanos functions in an ancient regulatory switch that controls somatic and germline fates throughout development?</title><p>Our genetic findings indicate that, in PGCs, Nanos opposes LIN-15B and DRM transcription factors.

A complex regulatory feedback loop has also been reported between the LSD1 demethylase and the Nanos partner Pumilio in Drosophila and human bladder carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miles et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that Nanos functions in an ancient transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulatory switch that controls gene expression during development. Key questions for the future will be to understand how the switch is activated in the embryonic germline to favor germ cell development (what turns on Nanos expression in PGCs?), how the switch is flipped back during oogenesis to favor somatic development (what activates LIN-15B expression in oocytes and embryos?), and how the switch becomes deregulated in malignancies.</p></sec></sec><sec

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Specification of the germline by Nanos-dependent down-regulation of the somatic synMuvB transcription factor LIN-15B&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Julie Ahringer as Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates how Nanos proteins (NOS) control the unique gene expression and development programs of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors provide evidence that NOS-1 and NOS-2 promote activation of pre-gametic PGC genes, suppress premature expression of oogenic germline genes and some somatic genes, and promote degradation of many maternal mRNAs. Interestingly, this regulation is at both post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels. Remarkably, the authors also provide compelling evidence that most of the functions of Nanos in germline establishment and function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> center on its regulation of DRM-class transcriptional regulators, especially LIN-15B, in part to suppress chromatin modifiers (PRC2 and NSD methyl transferases; MES proteins in worms).</p><p>Overall, the paper is well conceived and written, and the presented data broadens our understanding of Nanos function in germline development. The experiments are nicely designed and the results consistent and generally support the conclusions drawn. There are, however, some issues and questions that should be addressed to make the manuscript easier to interpret, as well as some conclusions and statements that need clarification.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data strongly support the idea that <italic>lin-15b</italic> repression is a major function of NOS-1 and -2. The authors argue that this allows PRC2/MES methyl transferases to silence oogenic and somatic gene genes in PGCs. While some results here and earlier work support this idea, the data here seem to suggest that NOS and LIN-15b may also act independently of PRC2/MES in PGCs, which could be important for NOS functions. First, autosomal oogenic genes regulated by NOS do not correlate well with autosomal oogenic genes controlled by MES-2 and -4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), while MES-2 and MES-4 autosomal oogenic targets correlate strongly with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Second, although NOS-dependent X chromosome genes overlap well with MES-dependent genes on X, correlation is weaker than MES genes with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref>), suggesting that even some X targets may be NOS-specific. Third, authors do not investigate the extent to which the strong <italic>lin-15b</italic>(lf) suppression of <italic>nos-1;nos-2</italic>(lf) depends on MES function. Considering <italic>lin-15b</italic>-dependent and mes-dependent genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>: Does <italic>lin-15b</italic> loss suppress misregulation of autosomal oogenic genes or the increased perdurance of putative maternal mRNAs (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in <italic>nos</italic> mutants? Do mes-sensitive gene sets generally lack these kinds of oocyte genes? If the data support it, authors should discuss a potential MES-independent pathway controlled by NOS proteins and LIN-15B (in Results, model, and Discussion).</p><p>2) How was purification and quality of PGCs assessed after FACS isolation? Authors should include either a supplemental figure, or state stats or other measures. Relatedly, it would help to more explicitly comment on specificity of PGC gene expression profiles relative to known PGC mRNAs and RNA Seq data from embryo somatic cells or whole L1s (e.g. are most known PGC mRNAs enriched and somatic genes depleted in PGC data relative to somatic cell or L1 RNA Seq?). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> seems to partly support PGC specificity.</p><p>3) Additional information on RNA Seq data analysis is needed. Pearson correlations or other measures of biological replicates need to be stated or shown, to address reproducibility. For volcano plots, how were q values determined? Were biological or technical replicates used in the Cuffdiff analysis, or were q values derived from distributions and assumptions within a single dataset pair? Were the RNAseq datasets used as independent inputs to the DE software (and the reads not merged prior to analysis)? This should be made more explicit in the methods. Please also add a column to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> giving the number of reads obtained for each dataset.</p><p>4) Could the authors please clarify how the expected number of genes (per stage) was calculated or obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The p values for &quot;observed&quot; versus &quot;expected&quot; gene numbers should be determined and added to figures (asterisks would suffice). Second, assuming &quot;expected&quot; reflects the fraction of genes in a category among all expressed genes, please provide these total expressed gene numbers for the datasets (somewhere). What was rpkm cutoff used to define a gene as expressed in a sample (in Materials and methods)?</p><p>5) Results <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In WT embs vs. L1s, 45 gamete genes go up in the transition and few if any go down. In the <italic>nos</italic> mutant, ~110 pregamete genes go down in the transition, and a more go up in than in WT. This seems to be a major change that is not commented on- and should be. Does this represent a major transcriptional shift in addition to the proposed shift in mRNA turnover? Are these changes minor or dramatic (by RPKM)?</p><p>6) Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The ATAC seek shows that a significant # of <italic>ooc</italic> genes that have increased L1 PGC abundance in the <italic>nos</italic> mutant have what looks like an increased transcriptional response. This seems in contrast to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which are interpreted to represent increased mRNA stability in the mutants. Are these the same genes?

The authors argue that this allows PRC2/MES methyl transferases to silence oogenic and somatic gene genes in PGCs. While some results here and earlier work support this idea, the data here seem to suggest that NOS and LIN-15b may also act independently of PRC2/MES in PGCs, which could be important for NOS functions. First, autosomal oogenic genes regulated by NOS do not correlate well with autosomal oogenic genes controlled by MES-2 and -4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), while MES-2 and MES-4 autosomal oogenic targets correlate strongly with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Second, although NOS-dependent X chromosome genes overlap well with MES-dependent genes on X, correlation is weaker than MES genes with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, E</xref>), suggesting that even some X targets may be NOS-specific. Third, authors do not investigate the extent to which the strong lin-15b(lf) suppression of nos-1;nos-2(lf) depends on MES function. Considering lin-15b-dependent and mes-dependent genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>: Does lin-15b loss suppress misregulation of autosomal oogenic genes or the increased perdurance of putative maternal mRNAs (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) in nos mutants? Do mes-sensitive gene sets generally lack these kinds of oocyte genes? If the data support it, authors should discuss a potential MES-independent pathway controlled by NOS proteins and LIN-15B (in Results, model, and Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough analyses. As suggested, we have performed two new experiments to clarify the model.</p><p>1) Using in situ hybridization against two maternal mRNAs, we show that loss of <italic>lin-15B</italic> does <italic>not</italic> suppress the Nanos defect in maternal mRNA turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This confirms that defective maternal mRNA turnover is a defect intrinsic to Nanos PCGs that is not dependent on LIN-15B.</p><p>2) We demonstrate that MES function is still required for fertility in the <italic>nos-1nos-2;lin-15B</italic> triple mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This finding does not support a MES-independent pathway for fertility, and is consistent with the model that LIN-15B antagonizes MES function in PGCs, as it has been reported to do in somatic cells.</p><p>The new data support the following:</p><p>1) Nanos’s primary function is to promote the turnover of maternal mRNAs in PGCs.</p><p>2) Extended perdurance of maternal RNAs and proteins, including LIN-15B, in Nanos PGCs causes oocyte genes to become ectopically transcribed.</p><p>3) We suggest that this is due to LIN-15B antagonizing MES function, based on 1) previous data documenting such an antagonism in somatic cells, and 2) the observation that many of the genes upregulated in PGCs are also upregulated in PGCs lacking MES.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How was purification and quality of PGCs assessed after FACS isolation? Authors should include either a supplemental figure, or state stats or other measures. Relatedly, it would help to more explicitly comment on specificity of PGC gene expression profiles relative to known PGC mRNAs and RNA Seq data from embryo somatic cells or whole L1s (e.g. are most known PGC mRNAs enriched and somatic genes depleted in PGC data relative to somatic cell or L1 RNA Seq?). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> seems to partly support PGC specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed several tests to assess the quality of our RNAseq data sets.</p><p>First, we examined the sorted cells by fluorescence microscopy for PGL-1::GFP expression (a PGC-specific marker) and determined that the sorted cells were 95.7 ± 3.8% PGCs (embryonic sort) and 94.7 ± 4.7% PGCs (L1 sort) (N= 10). See Materials and methods section Germ cell isolation and sorting.</p><p>Second, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to cluster our RNA-seq data sets and found that experimental replicates clustered together as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we compared our data sets to others in the literature. First, we generated a list of PGC-enriched genes (1347 genes) by comparing the transcriptomes of sorted PGCs and sorted somatic blastomeres. We cross-referenced this list with published PGC or germline-enriched gene sets. We found that 392/1347 PGC-enriched genes were also identified as PGC-enriched genes in Spencer et al. 2011 (979 genes with enriched expression in Z2/Z3), and 700/1347 were characterized as either germline-specific or germline-enriched genes in Gaydos et al. 2012. By comparison only 61/1347 PGC-enriched genes were present in a soma-specific gene set (2684 genes) (Gaydos et al. 2012 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional information on RNA Seq data analysis is needed. Pearson correlations or other measures of biological replicates need to be stated or shown, to address reproducibility. For volcano plots, how were q values determined? Were biological or technical replicates used in the Cuffdiff analysis, or were q values derived from distributions and assumptions within a single dataset pair? Were the RNAseq datasets used as independent inputs to the DE software (and the reads not merged prior to analysis)? This should be made more explicit in the methods. Please also add a column to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> giving the number of reads obtained for each dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the information as requested:</p><p>PCA analysis: PCA plots are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and PCA command lines are included in a new section “Principle component analysis” in Materials and methods.</p><p>See Materials and methods section “RNAseq library preparation and analysis” for derivation of q values, handling of biological replicates, and command line usage.</p><p>We added a new column to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> with number of mapped reads for each sequencing library.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Could the authors please clarify how the expected number of genes (per stage) was calculated or obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The p values for &quot;observed&quot; versus &quot;expected&quot; gene numbers should be determined and added to figures (asterisks would suffice). Second, assuming &quot;expected&quot; reflects the fraction of genes in a category among all expressed genes, please provide these total expressed gene numbers for the datasets (somewhere). What was rpkm cutoff used to define a gene as expressed in a sample (in Materials and methods)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new section “Gene categories” in Materials and methods. To calculate expected values, we used total number of 15851 expressed genes with RPKM &gt; 0.1 as the cutoff from our PGC RNA-seq experiments.</p><p>Expected value = (No. of significantly changed genes) x (No. of genes in category/15851).</p><p>We performed Hypergeometric test to derive P values (hypergeometric probability) for each category and added asterisks to categories with P value lower than 0.01 or 0.001 as noted in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Results <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In WT embs vs. L1s, 45 gamete genes go up in the transition and few if any go down. In the nos mutant, ~110 pregamete genes go down in the transition, and a more go up in than in WT. This seems to be a major change that is not commented on- and should be. Does this represent a major transcriptional shift in addition to the proposed shift in mRNA turnover? Are these changes minor or dramatic (by RPKM)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe that this difference is significant and cannot be explained solely by a delay in maternal mRNA turnover, since many oocyte transcripts appear to increase in abundance. The ATAC-seq data provide further support that transcription is affected. We have expanded our discussion of these observations in the subsection “PGCs lacking <italic>nos-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2</italic> activate the transcription of many genes normally silent in PGCs”.</p><p>We identify several maternally-provided transcription factors that, like LIN-15B, are also not turned over efficiently in Nanos PGCs, and speculate that the collective action of these factors may cause the complex gene upregulation observed in Nanos PGCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The ATAC seek shows that a significant # of ooc genes that have increased L1 PGC abundance in the nos mutant have what looks like an increased transcriptional response. This seems in contrast to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which are interpreted to represent increased mRNA stability in the mutants. Are these the same genes? If so, please explain what appears to be conflicting interpretations of why ooc genes are more abundant in the mutant PGCs.</p></disp-quote><p>In the transcriptomic analyses, we cannot easily distinguish whether differences in RNA abundance are due to changes in mRNA turnover, de novo synthesis, or both. The ATAC-seq analysis gave us an independent method to assess the contribution of de novo synthesis. To assess the contribution of maternal mRNA turnover, we used transcriptomics of EMB PGCs (isolated before the onset of transcription) and in situ hybridization experiments using probes to known maternal mRNAs. We have rewritten significant portions of the Results section to make these analyses less confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The data shows that more autosomal linked ooc mRNAs are increased in the nos mutant than in mes mutants, and the authors conclude that this difference is due to defective degradation of ooc genes in the nos mutant. Assuming the mes mutants exhibit defective transcriptional regulation, then there should be some X-linked ooc genes that are unaffected by loss of mes but are increased in the nos mutant. Is this so?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We identified 267 up-regulated X-linked oogenic genes in <italic>nos-1(gv5)nos-2(RNAi)</italic> PGCs. Of those, 113 were <italic>not</italic> also upregulated in <italic>mes-4</italic>(RNAi) PGCs. We hypothesize that these transcripts correspond to maternal mRNAs that are not efficiently turned over in NOS PGCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The first paragraph of the Discussion indicates that &quot;Nanos is required to erase maternally-inherited somatic program&quot;.

We have clarified that what we define as “oocyte genes” → these include maternal transcripts that function to promote somatic cell fates in embryos.
