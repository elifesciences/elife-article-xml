MNase-seq methods have been widely applied to characterize nucleosome organization in vivo, but generally lack the accuracy to determine the precise nucleosome positions. Here we develop a computational approach leveraging digestion variability to determine nucleosome positions at a base-pair resolution from MNase-seq data. We generate a variability template as a simple error model for how MNase digestion affects the mapping of individual nucleosomes. Applied to both yeast and human cells, this analysis reveals that alternatively positioned nucleosomes are prevalent and create significant heterogeneity in a cell population. We show that the periodic occurrences of dinucleotide sequences relative to nucleosome dyads can be directly determined from genome-wide nucleosome positions from MNase-seq. Alternatively positioned nucleosomes near transcription start sites likely represent different states of promoter nucleosomes during transcription initiation. Our method can be applied to map nucleosome positions in diverse organisms at base-pair resolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16970.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16970.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plants, animals and other eukaryotes wrap their DNA around complexes of proteins called histones to form repeating units known as nucleosomes. The interaction between histones and DNA is strong, and so the DNA region inside a nucleosome has limited access to other proteins, including those that drive the expression of genes.</p><p>Moving a nucleosome slightly can change the access to its DNA and significantly impact how the genes in the region are regulated. Nevertheless, determining the position of nucleosomes accurately or testing how nucleosomes are different between individual cells are challenging tasks. Most methods for identifying nucleosomes use an enzyme called micrococcal nuclease (or MNase for short) to break down the DNA that isn’t protected in nucleosomes, followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify the DNA fragments that remain. However, this technique, known as MNase-seq, is limited because it only measures an average location of the nucleosomes across millions of cells.</p><p>Now, Zhou, Blocker et al. have developed a new computational approach to identify nucleosome positions more accurately using MNase-seq data obtained from both yeast and human cells. This approach revealed that in more than half of the yeast genome, a given nucleosome is found at slightly different positions in different cells. Nucleosomes positioned near the beginning of a gene mark it open or closed for binding by the cell’s gene expression machinery. Zhou, Blocker et al. suggest that the nucleosomes’ positions influence how gene expression starts via a multi-step process.</p><p>Following on from this work, the next step is to use the newly developed method to study how nucleosome positions change when other regulators of gene activity bind and when genes are activated or repressed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16970.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16970.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nucleosome position</kwd><kwd>MNase-seq</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>template-based model</kwd><kwd>heterogenity</kwd><kwd>base-pair resolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM-096193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blocker</surname><given-names>Alexander W</given-names></name><name><surname>Airoldi</surname><given-names>Edoardo M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The helical DNA makes direct contact with the histones every 10 base pairs, with the major groove of DNA alternating between facing towards and away from the histone core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Shifting the histones relative to the DNA sequence by a few base pairs can change the accessibility of sequence elements to DNA binding proteins if they are located in the linker sequences between nucleosomes, or may switch these elements between facing towards and away from nucleosomes if they are located within nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang and Pugh, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Segal and Widom, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Pugh, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The location of nucleosomes with respect to DNA sequences influences many biological processes. Nucleosomes restrict the accessibility of DNA sequences to protein factors, such as transcriptional regulators and the transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">John et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou and O'Shea, 2011</xref>). The positions and occupancy of nucleosomes can influence the interplay between transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mirny, 2010</xref>) and the level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and O'Shea, 2008</xref>), dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lam et al., 2008</xref>), and differences in gene expression between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dadiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raser and O'Shea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</xref>). Recently, nucleosome organization has also been suggested to affect how gene promoters interpret dynamic signaling information at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen and O'Shea, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</xref>), and heterogeneity in promoter nucleosome positions has been linked to differences in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Small et al., 2014</xref>). Knowing the precise location that nucleosomes occupy with respect to DNA sequence is crucial for understanding how these biological processes are influenced by eukaryotic chromatin.</p><p>Genome-wide nucleosome positions are commonly mapped with micrococcal nuclease digestion based high-throughput sequencing (MNase-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes and Rando, 2014</xref>). In this method, histone-DNA interactions protect DNA from MNase digestion and the protected DNA fragments are sequenced and aligned to genome sequences to infer the location of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rando, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Pugh, 2011</xref>). Although MNase exhibits sequence preference when digesting DNA devoid of histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horz and Altenburger, 1981</xref>), genome-wide analyses of nucleosomes with MNase-based methods are generally consistent with studies using MNase-independent methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes and Rando, 2014</xref>), such as DNase I chromatin digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hesselberth et al., 2009</xref>) and chemical cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Studies that apply MNase-based methods typically report the position of a nucleosome as the average of the bulk nucleosome population (referred to as the 'consensus center', <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Pugh, 2011</xref>). However, if nucleosomes have overlapping positions in a significant portion of the population, the effect of averaging over heterogeneous nucleosome positions can lead to discrepancy between the consensus center of nucleosomes and the most representative nucleosome positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A variety of methods have been developed to improve the precision of nucleosome mapping from MNase-seq data, such as peak finding of nucleosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang and Pugh, 2011</xref>) and filtering of single-end digestion patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weiner et al., 2010</xref>), but determining the precise locations of individual nucleosomes within a cell population remains a challenge due to substantial variability in the mapped locations of digested nucleosomes – the midpoints of paired-end sequenced nucleosomes or the endpoints of single-end sequenced nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This variability may arise from a cluster of overlapping and stably positioned nucleosomes, as well as from effects causing different degrees of digestion of the same nucleosome by MNase, such as nucleosome breathing and nuclease trimming – all of which influence the distribution of the aligned reads and are difficult to disentangle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark, 2010</xref>). Recently, a chemical cleavage approach that uses a genetically engineered histone H4 to chemically cleave DNA sequences in contact with the nucleosome dyad allowed direct measurement of nucleosome positions with unprecedented resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moyle-Heyrman et al., 2013</xref>). However, the requirement for genetic engineering of essential histones limits its current application to genetically tractable organisms. Therefore, novel experimental or analytical approaches that are generally applicable in eukaryotes are still needed to determine the accurate positions of nucleosomes in vivo. Here, we report a computational approach to determine in vivo nucleosome positions from paired-end MNase-sequencing data.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Illustration of the Template-Based Bayesian (TBB) approach for determining nucleosome positions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating the heterogeneous nucleosome positions and the consensus centers of nucleosomes along a genomic region in a population of cells.

For example, in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, the locations of individual fluorophores within the diffraction limit of light can be identified by deconvoluting light intensity information with a function describing the distribution of light intensity from individual light spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betzig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). Inspired by this, we use the size distribution of MNase digested nucleosome fragments to infer a digestion variability template for nucleosomes, and report a Bayesian method that makes use of these templates to identify the individual positions of nucleosomes at a base-pair resolution, hereafter referred to as the template-based Bayesian (TBB) approach. This approach can be applied to data generated through both paired-end and single-end sequencing to map chromatin structure in diverse organisms. Here we demonstrate the template-based Bayesian approach with paired-end sequencing of MNase digested nucleosomes in yeast and human cells. We show that the periodic occurrences of dinucleotide sequence motifs relative to the nucleosome dyad can be directly determined from MNase based nucleosome positions and are conserved in vivo in both yeast and human cells. Leveraging this method, we find that alternative configurations of nucleosomes are a common feature in both yeast and human chromatin. The alternatively positioned nucleosomes around gene transcription start sites represent configurations that differ in their compatibility with the assembly of the pre-initiation complex. A 3-step model for transcription initiation can reconcile the competition between nucleosomes and the transcriptional machinery observed from genomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A Bayesian approach based on digestion variability templates can identify positions of nucleosomes at base-pair resolution</title><p>We reasoned that it might be possible to resolve the positions of multiple overlapping nucleosomes if we could estimate the degree to which MNase digestion contributes to the deviation of the midpoints from a true nucleosome center. Since the overall digestion of nucleosomes is reflected in the length of nucleosomal DNA fragments, we tested the idea that we might be able to estimate the variation in the midpoints from the length of digested nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and use this information to infer the positions of individual nucleosomes through deconvolution. The variability of digested nucleosomes could come from two sources: the technical variation that is associated with nuclease cleavage, such as variable trimming at nucleosome ends, and biological variation that directly influences the length of DNA wound around histones, such as nucleosome breathing and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polach and Widom, 1995</xref>). While the technical effects are likely to affect both ends of nucleosomal DNA equally, the biological effects may create bias for specific nucleosomes and/or a specific side of the nucleosomes. However, the biological effects are generally believed to be transient and rare at a given genomic location within a population of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews and Luger, 2011</xref>); we thus assumed that the digestion variation was equivalent at both ends of the nucleosome when averaged over the genome and population. The biological variation at individual nucleosomes could generate large shifts in read midpoints due to length differences in nucleosomes (likely by multiples of 10 bp due to the unwrapping of each helical turn of DNA), and could be identified as alternative nucleosome positions if they were present in a significant fraction of the bulk nucleosome population. Nucleosomes with substantially smaller size, such as sub-nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>), can be identified based on the sequenced fragment size (&lt;100 bp) and were excluded from our analysis.</p><p>The template-based Bayesian approach includes four major steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, see Materials and methods). First, we estimated the distribution of MNase digestion variability from the length distribution of DNA sequencing reads, assuming that MNase digestion is not biased towards either end of the nucleosome on average. This produced a digestion variability template, describing the overall deviations in read midpoints relative to the true nucleosome center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, each chromosome was segmented into regions with similar sequencing coverage to increase detection sensitivity, with a requirement to maintain sufficient segment length for estimating statistical properties of nucleosome positions. Third, within each segment, the occupancy of read midpoints (the number of paired-end read midpoints at each base pair, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, gray trace) was deconvoluted with the digestion variability template to estimate the expected read occupancy at every base pair if digestion errors had not occurred (coefficient β, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, black trace). Finally, the locations of nucleosomes were summarized based on this expected read occupancy and statistical thresholds. To control for falsely identified nucleosome positions arising from the sequence preference of MNase, we set the statistical thresholds using a false discovery rate (FDR≤0.05) estimated based on a simulated MNase digestion dataset that matches the experimentally observed digestion sequence distribution. In our study, the length distribution of paired-end sequencing reads from the gene coding and promoter regions was indistinguishable from the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Therefore, a single digestion variability template was applied across the yeast genome.</p><p>We represented the locations of nucleosomes using two metrics: the consensus centers of nucleosomes and the TBB positions of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The consensus centers of nucleosomes were defined to represent non-overlapping nucleosomes with a minimum size of 147 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue bars), by applying a Gaussian window smoothing method to the expected read occupancy (coefficient β) from our model – they are equivalent to the nucleosome positions commonly described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang and Pugh, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>) (hereafter termed ‘consensus centers’). The TBB nucleosome positions describe the center locations of individual nucleosomes across the genome without limitation on minimum spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, red dots and blue ovals) (hereafter termed ‘TBB nucleosome positions’), which represent individual stably positioned nucleosomes over a statistical threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Accurate estimation of nucleosome positions at base-pair resolution</title><p>We titrated MNase to digest yeast chromatin and selected for analysis two nucleosome samples that were digested to different sizes (‘T1’ and ‘T2’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both samples were digested to primarily mono-nucleosomes without generating over-represented sub-nucleosome fragments. We generated paired-end data sets of 'T1' and 'T2', each with a coverage of ~2.8 read midpoints per base pair; as an average between these two data sets, we identified ~61,800 consensus centers of nucleosomes and ~125,000 TBB nucleosome positions, covering at least 75.5% of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome. The spacing between adjacent TBB nucleosome positions peaked at 11 and 21 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), consistent with the rotation of DNA sequence by one or two helical turns around histone cores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>), and suggesting that the same nucleosome commonly occupies overlapping configurations in different cells.</p><p>The consensus centers of nucleosomes identified by the template-based Bayesian approach were consistent with the published methods employing Gaussian smoothing algorithms (often referred to as 'Parzen window') (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with more than 90% of the nucleosomes matching within a single base pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These consensus centers also showed general agreement with the published nucleosome reference maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Pugh, 2009a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), validating the overall biological relevance of our data sets. We then evaluated the accuracy of our identified TBB nucleosome positions by comparing them to individual nucleosome positions mapped through a recently reported chemical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>), which provides a reference that is independent of MNase cleavage specificity. The nucleosome positions identified by these two approaches were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), demonstrating that the TBB approach can precisely map the positions of individual nucleosomes. Further, we assessed the absolute precision of the TBB approach by using it to map nucleosome positions from in silico generated MNase-seq data sets where the simulated nucleosome positions are known. We systematically tested the precision of the TBB approach with varying sequencing coverages, relative nucleosome population abundance and spacing among overlapping nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Material and Methods). The majority of the TBB nucleosome positions identified in these simulated data sets were within 2–3 bp of the originally simulated nucleosome positions, even for the cases where nucleosome positions were separated by only 10–15 bp or differ by more than 3-fold in their relative occupancy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide evaluation of the TBB approach and alternative nucleosome positions.</title><p>Histogram of the nearest distance: (<bold>A</bold>) between the consensus centers of nucleosomes determined by the TBB approach and by the Parzen window approach; (<bold>B</bold>) between the consensus centers determined by the TBB approach and the reference MNase nucleosome positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Pugh, 2009a</xref>); (<bold>C</bold>) between the TBB nucleosome positions and the nucleosome positions mapped by the chemical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>); (<bold>D</bold>,<bold>E</bold>) between the consensus centers of nucleosomes (<bold>D</bold>) and the TBB nucleosome positions (<bold>E</bold>) mapped in two independent experiments.

The degree to which chromatin is digested by MNase depends on the DNA sequence and the preparation of nucleosomal DNA samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dingwall et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horz and Altenburger, 1981</xref>), and may differ significantly between experiments even when experimental protocols have been carefully followed. To evaluate the tolerance of the TBB nucleosome positions to different levels of MNase digestion, we compared the consensus centers and TBB nucleosome positions in the ‘T1’ and ‘T2’ data sets that represent digestion to different fragment sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This observation, together with our finding that overlapping positions are commonly observed in yeast and human chromatin, motivated us to examine the relationship between TSSs and overlapping nucleosome positions (resulting from alternative positions). We identified all TBB nucleosome positions that were closely associated with TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Pugh, 2009a</xref>) and organized them into groups consisting of either unique or overlapping TBB nucleosome positions for each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). If a group contained several overlapping TBB nucleosome positions, the center of this group was defined as the numeric average of these positions. All groups were aligned at their centers and ranked by the spacing between TBB nucleosome positions within the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The TBB nucleosome positions exhibited a bimodal shape for at least three quarters of the genes with nucleosome-covered TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ‘positions’), suggesting that alternative positioning is a common feature of nucleosomes near TSSs. The number of sequenced read midpoints showed the same bi-furcating shape and was highly consistent between two experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ‘T1 midpoints’ and ‘T2 midpoints’). The occupancy of nucleosome midpoints at each gene correlated well between two experiments (T1 and T2), indicating alternative nucleosomes can be reliably observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The distribution of read midpoints was symmetric along the direction of gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and could not be explained by the sequence bias of MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Among the alternatively positioned nucleosomes, the proximal nucleosomes were located much closer to the TSS where the nucleosome core restricts the accessibility of these factors and therefore competes for active transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, cyan curve). For the distal nucleosomes, TSSs were aligned near the edge of the nucleosome core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, red curve), making these sites and the upstream regulatory elements accessible to other DNA binding factors. Alternatively positioned nucleosomes at TSSs gave rise to different accessibilities of the promoter elements within a population of cells, which may reflect the different activities in gene transcription. If one focused only on the average centers of these nucleosomes (essentially the consensus centers of the +1 nucleosomes), one would draw the conclusion that nucleosomes occlude the TSSs of most genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, black line).</p><p>To explore how alternative TBB nucleosome positions might influence transcription, we focused on the initial steps of this process: the assembly of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC), which generally requires binding of TBP (TATA-binding protein); and the subsequent recruitment of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buratowski et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Green, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orphanides et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roeder, 1996</xref>). Recently, it was suggested that the +1 nucleosome downstream of the TSS assists in the assembly of the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>). However, the binding of the PIC extends into the boundary of the +1 nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>), presenting a physical conflict between PIC binding and nucleosomes. To test if the resolution of alternatively positioned nucleosomes would provide a better understanding of the interplay between nucleosomes and the assembly of the PIC, we analyzed the occupancy of the PIC (determined with the ChIP-exo method (chromatin immunoprecipitation with lambda exonuclease digestion) by Rhee and Pugh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>]) around the identified distal and proximal nucleosomes, respectively. Most subunits of the PIC, including TBP, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and TFIIK, showed peak enrichment at the edge of the distally positioned nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, cyan), suggesting that the +1 nucleosome in the distal position marks a boundary for the assembly of the PIC. This boundary may be provided by the positioned nucleosomes or by binding of one or more components of the transcription complex. In contrast, the proximally positioned nucleosome covered most of the regions enriched for PIC binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, red), suggesting that the +1 nucleosome in the proximal position is not compatible with the binding of transcription machinery. Intriguingly, TATA-box and TATA-like sequences were enriched in front of the proximal nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that proximal nucleosomes do not block recognition of most TATA elements. Thus, the proximal nucleosome may represent a promoter state that is not associated with active transcription and is populated prior to the assembly of the PIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, Proximal state). The distal nucleosome may represent a promoter state in the process of transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, Distal state).

We found that genes with uniquely positioned nucleosomes at their TSSs were enriched in highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Newman et al., 2006</xref>) (top 500 genes, p = 0.001, Fisher’s exact test).

We therefore tested the possibility that DNA sequence determinants may underlie the difference between uniquely, proximally, and distally positioned nucleosomes around TSSs.

Thus, differences in the selection and analysis of MNase-seq data may result in different conclusions about nucleosome positioning in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaffney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valouev et al., 2011</xref>). With the high-precision nucleosome position maps generated by TBB, we directly demonstrated that the DNA sequences around the mapped nucleosome positions exhibited 10 bp periodicity in the frequency of dinucleotide motifs in both yeast and human cells, arguing that this sequence feature is a universal signal for positioning nucleosomes in vivo at the whole genome level.</p><p>Positioning of nucleosomes is dynamic and linked to many biological processes. Identifying overlapping nucleosome positions that cannot co-exist on the same DNA molecule at the same time provides a snapshot of possible chromatin states in dynamic processes. We observed at least two states of chromatin where gene transcription is initiated: a state where a nucleosome covers the transcription start site and competes with transcription machinery, but leaves the core promoter sequences mostly accessible ('proximal state'); and another state where a nucleosome barely covers the transcription start site and seems poised for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex ('distal state'). We propose a 3-step model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) to describe the transcription initiation steps influenced by nucleosomes, including a state where RNA polymerase transcribes through the nucleosome covered sequence ('open state'). The transition from the 'proximal state' to the 'distal state' and to the 'open state' could be actively driven by the assembly of the PIC; in this case, different nucleosome states may reflect rate-limiting steps during transcription initiation. Alternatively, this transition could be controlled by transcription factors, chromatin modulators and even the preference of DNA sequences as a means to regulate and assist gene transcription. Interestingly, we found that TSSs of highly expressed genes are enriched with uniquely positioned nucleosomes, which resemble nucleosomes in their 'distal state'. It is possible that the +1 nucleosomes of these most highly expressed genes are oriented in a way that allows constitutive assembly of the PIC and therefore frequent transcription activity. Further genomic analysis and mechanistic studies will shed light on the generalization and the underlying principles of this model.</p><p>DNA sequences may play a role in determining whether nucleosomes have unique or alternative positions. Unique nucleosome positions may result from the combination of the strong nucleosome boundary signal from poly(dA:dT) sequences and the lack of a rotational positioning signal from periodic dinucleotide motifs. Conversely, alternatively positioned nucleosomes may be a consequence of a weak boundary signal and a strong rotational positioning signal that allows nucleosomes to interconvert between multiple equivalent positions. The exact positions of these nucleosomes and how alternative nucleosomes are positioned relative to each other may be further controlled by other factors associated with promoters, such as chromatin modifiers, remodelers and transcription factors. The configurations of nucleosomes (unique vs. alternative) may influence the transcription of a gene; if promoter DNA sequences contain information that helps to specify the nucleosome configurations, eukaryotic genome could use nucleosome configurations as a means to encode transcriptional programs.</p><p>It is worth noting that the template-based Bayesian approach does not capture all possible positions of nucleosomes within the cell population – it identifies the nucleosome positions that are represented with strong statistical confidence (Materials and methods), reflecting the different configurations of nucleosomes that are likely to be relevant in biological processes. Revealing these heterogeneous configurations of nucleosomes in cells will provide new insights into how chromatin regulates or is influenced by biological processes. Furthermore, mutually exclusive positions of protein-DNA complexes can imply dynamic information. As an example, the alternatively positioned nucleosomes at TSSs suggest a change in chromatin structure during transcription initiation. Similar analytic approaches can be applied to other systems to reconstruct dynamic processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Nucleosomal DNA preparation</title><p>Detailed conditions of cell culture, chromatin isolation, MNase digestion and DNA extraction have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou and O'Shea, 2011</xref>).

The number of sequencing clusters generated on the flow-cell represented at most 1/10,000 of the amplified library, such that the chance was very small to have more than one copy of duplicated library molecules clustered on the flow-cell (p&lt;1.8 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, binomial distribution). Therefore, we treated each paired-end read as an individual nucleosome from a single cell. Libraries were sequenced with an Illumina Hiseq 2000 and the paired-end sequencing reads were aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome Scer02 with bowtie 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). We mapped reads with two or fewer mismatches, and insert lengths were restricted to sizes between 100 bp and 300 bp. Reads with multiple reportable alignments were randomly assigned to one such alignment. The midpoints of all sequenced DNA fragments were randomly rounded to an integer genomic coordinate and used to generate sequencing read midpoint occupancy maps.</p><p>We obtained 33.7 million and 34.3 million mappable paired-end reads for the T1 and T2 experiments, respectively. All analyses presented in this work were done with the T1 dataset unless specified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Detection of consensus centers and TBB nucleosome positions</title><p>The consensus centers of nucleosomes were determined based on the fitted coefficient β with a standard Parzen window peak calling method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsankov et al., 2010</xref>). TBB nucleosome positions were determined at FDR ≤ 0.05, where the null distributions of nucleosome positions were estimated from randomly sampled nucleosome reads distributed based on the local read density. We developed two different null distributions: a random null distribution where simulated sequencing reads were assumed to be uniformly distributed within each region, and an MNase digestion-aware null where the simulated sequencing reads were sampled to match the observed dinucleotide end frequency of the paired-end reads. We applied the digestion-aware null to identify TBB nucleosome positions with a threshold of FDR ≤ 0.05, resulting in 62,035 consensus centers and 120,347 TBB nucleosome positions in the T1 experiment, and 61,532 consensus centers and 129,505 TBB nucleosome positions in the T2 experiment. When we attempted to identify possible nucleosome positions that were entirely due to the sequence bias of MNase digestion, we analyzed the simulated MNase digestion data though our TBB pipeline and applied the random null distribution with a threshold of FDR ≤ 0.05. This allowed us to identify 49,739 and 50,076 positions to analyze and correct for influence of MNase digestion bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Human nucleosome analysis</title><p>Analyses on human nucleosomes were performed using paired-end sequencing reads with length between 126 bp and 184 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaffney et al., 2012</xref>). We randomly selected a 10 Mbp region on human chromosome 12, position 38,000,000 bp to 48,000,000 bp, to test the TBB approach. In total, we identified 43,991 consensus centers of nucleosomes and 251,948 TBB nucleosome positions in this selected region. All the identified positions were used in our analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Dinucleotide frequency analysis</title><p>All TBB nucleosome positions determined in T1 were used for the dinucleotide frequency analysis unless specified. DNA sequences from 100 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream of each TBB nucleosome position were aligned and the frequency of AA/AT/TA/TT and CC/CG/GC/GG dinucleotides was calculated for every base pair. This calculated di-nucleotide frequency was then normalized to the average dinucleotide frequency and presented in the plots.</p><p>For the permutation of TBB nucleosome positions, we first randomly selected 62,035 TBB nucleosome positions (the same number as consensus centers of nucleosomes). For each of these positions, we randomly shifted the genome coordinate of the position by 0–4 bp with an overall average of 2 bp, or by 0–10 bp with an overall average of 5 bp. The frequency of AA/AT/TA/TT dinucleotides with respect to these permutated positions is presented in the plot <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, in comparison to that of the original TBB nucleosome positions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Identification of overlapping nucleosomes around TSSs</title><p>To determine if the observed overlapping TBB nucleosome positions are biologically meaningful, we excluded TBB nucleosome positions whose occupancy is less than 4.8 reads (about half of the median sequencing read occupancy of all TBB nucleosome positions), which account for ~5% of the detected TBB nucleosome positions. The position occupancy was calculated as the average read count within a 3 bp window centered at TBB nucleosome positions. We then combined individual TBB nucleosome positions that are separated by less than 80 bp into groups of overlapping nucleosomes (overlap by ~ half of a nucleosome). In total, 57,643 groups containing either unique or overlapping TBB nucleosome positions were identified in the yeast genome. Groups that contain more than 9 nucleosome positions (139 groups, 0.24%) were further excluded from this analysis because they likely reside in regions with delocalized nucleosomes. The remaining groups were compared to the positions of TSSs of all ORFs in yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Pugh, 2009a</xref>), and 4641 were identified to overlap with TSSs (TSSs within 73 bp distance of any TBB nucleosome position in the group). All 4641 were analyzed and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. 3307 of these groups contain no more than 2 TBB nucleosome positions and their analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>PIC binding and TATA-box/TATA-like sequences</title><p>The occupancy data for the subunits of the PIC was generated from the supplementary data of the work of Rhee and Pugh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>).

However, a substantial fraction of the TATA-like sequences are located next to or even after the annotated transcription start site – TATA-like sequences of ~600 genes are within 5 bp of TSSs.

This digestion variability reflects a combination of factors that influences the size of protected nucleosomal DNA, such as over- or under- digestion of intact nucleosomes. This estimation was based on a simple, symmetric model of MNase digestion for each sequenced fragment. Using this model, we obtained a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the distribution of digestion variability (<italic>e</italic>) at each end of a sequenced fragment (<italic>e<sub>1j</sub></italic>, <italic>e<sub>2j</sub></italic>).

This was done to control for local variation in sequencing coverage and nucleosome occupancy, allowing for efficient estimation of local structure with minimal sensitivity to distant observations. To accomplish this, we started from ORFs and refined these natural demarcations into a statistically useful segmentation. We first enumerated all open reading frames (ORFs) and intergenic regions on each given chromosome. Merging overlapping ORFs into single segments yielded a starting set of contiguous, non-overlapping segments. We then iteratively merged the most similar short segments until all segments exceed a minimal length (800 bp). The similarity was defined based on sequencing read midpoints per base pair within each segment. This yielded a segmentation for which each segment has sufficient length to estimate local properties of the nucleosome position distribution. For the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, we obtained a total of 5135 segments for our T1 experiment with a mean segment length of 2351 bp (minimum length of 800 bp and maximum length of 14,499 bp). The results on the T2 experiment were extremely similar with 5118 segments and a mean length of 2359 bp. This segmentation was fixed and used in all subsequent computation. The region of human chromosome 12, position 38,000,000 bp to 48,000,000 bp was segmented based on the annotated introns and exons of human genome hg18 (Roche, NimbleGen). Other segmentation techniques based on the biological structure of each chromosome can be used and may be more appropriate for mammalian genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Computational model and notation</title><p>Our probabilistic model for the observed read midpoints captures the variation due to nuclease digestion as well as the variation from biological sources (for example, biological heterogeneity among cells, stochastic fluctuation in the selection of fragments for sequencing, and other factors in sample preparation and analysis). To accomplish this, we extended discrete convolution models from signal processing to account for the particular types of structure and variation found in MNase-seq data.

The first is a random null distribution, where simulated sequencing reads are assumed to be uniformly distributed within each region. The second is a MNase digestion-aware null, where simulated sequencing reads are assumed to be uniformly distributed subject to the observed distribution of the dinucleotide ends. These two null distributions are applied to identify TBB positions in two scenarios. The MNase digestion-aware null is used to identify experimental TBB positions that are statistically significant over the sequence bias of MNase digestion. The random null is used to set the threshold for determining possible nucleosome positions that result from MNase digestion bias over a uniform background. In all cases, the false discovery rate is controlled to be less than 5%, allowing a fair comparison between different data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>In silico simulation of MNase digestion</title><p>For each region of the genome, we tabulated the full table of dinucleotide counts from all aligned paired-end reads. For each pair of cut dinucleotides, we enumerated all potential paired-end reads with matching cut dinucleotides with centers falling in the given region. We then sampled uniformly from this set of potential reads with replacement to match the observed number of reads with the given cut dinucleotides. This yields a sample of reads exactly matching the observed cut dinucleotide distribution with fragment centers random within each region conditional on cut dinucleotides. These simulated controls were then passed through the same pipeline as the observed reads and used to set thresholds based on the stated FDR-controlling procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Comparison between datasets and replicates</title><p>All comparisons are based on matched distances, as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>). For example, when we compared our identified consensus centers of nucleosomes to those identified from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang and Pugh, 2009a</xref>), we calculated the distance between every center in our dataset to its nearest center in the published study and summarized them into distance probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>) and cumulative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>) plots. Similarly, when we evaluated the performance of the TBB method on an in silico MNase-seq dataset, we computed the distance between every identified TBB position from the in silico dataset and its nearest simulated nucleosome position. When we evaluated reproducibility between replicates, we considered the set of all best-match distances obtained by matching each replicate against the other to ensure symmetry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Random nucleosome positions and consensus centers</title><p>We used two methods to generate random nucleosome positions and consensus centers as controls to estimate the detection accuracy of the TBB approach. In the first method, we randomly generated the genomic coordinates of nucleosome positions on each chromosome to match the number of experimentally detected TBB nucleosome positions or consensus centers. In the second method, we took into account the spacing features between TBB nucleosome positions or consensus centers. In this way, the randomly generated genomic coordinates and the experimental determined data have the same distribution of spacing between adjacent positions. The random nucleosome positions or consensus centers maps generated by these two methods yielded similar results and only the result of the second method is shown in the plots (Gray trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). The median distance between the random nucleosome positions and the chemical positions is 18 bp, and is 36 bp for the spacing between the random nucleosome positions and the TBB positions determined here. The median distance between the random consensus centers and either the reference centers or the consensus centers determined here is 49 bp in both cases. The median distance between the random nucleosome positions and the chemical positions is much smaller than the rest of the comparisons because the number of chemical positions was three times larger than the number of TBB nucleosome positions and 5 times larger than the number of consensus centers determined in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>In silico validation of detection accuracy</title><p>The true positions of nucleosomes in vivo are generally not available with the current experimental and computational approaches. We thus performed a set of in silico experiments to evaluate the performance of the TBB method in a setting where ground truth of nucleosome positions is available. We first simulated the true positions of nucleosomes: we generated the primary nucleosome positions to represent the most frequent (strongest) positions among a set of overlapping nucleosomes, and then added alternative positions around the primary positions to account for the other overlapping nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In each set of in silico experiments, we systematically varied the occupancy (coverage), spacing (offset), and relative strength of primary and alternative nucleosome positions (effective magnitude) according to a factorial design that spans the 5th to 95th percentiles of the corresponding properties observed in our yeast experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). At each of the simulated nucleosome positions, we randomly generated sequencing reads based on the digestion variability template estimated from T1, and constructed 10 artificial chromosomes to represent the in silico MNase-seq data sets. The occupancy of sequencing read midpoints in these simulated data sets resembles that determined from our biological samples. We then applied the TBB approach to identify nucleosome positions in these in silico data sets and compared them with the simulated nucleosome positions (both simulated primary and alternative positions). We found that the TBB approach can reliably identify primary nucleosome positions (50% and 85% of the primary positions within 2 bp and 4 bp, respectively) across all settings. Detection of the alternative positions is similarly reliable (50% and 75% within ~3 bp and ~7 bp, respectively) if the alternative positions are populated at least 1/3 as frequently as the nearest primary positions (effective magnitude smaller than 0.6) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Detailed methods and discussion about the in silico validation can be found in Extended Experimental Procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Procedures for in silico estimation of TBB performance</title><p>To estimate the precision of the TBB approach in identifying nucleosome positions, we simulated nucleosome positions on a set of artificial chromosomes, generated in silico MNase-seq sequencing read midpoint datasets based on the experimental digestion variation, estimated the in silico TBB nucleosome positions with these in silico datasets, and compared them to the original simulated nucleosome positions. The differences between these identified TBB in silico positions and the original simulated positions reflect the precision of the TBB approach.</p><p>To mimic the organization of nucleosomes in the genome, we simulated nucleosome positions based on observed in vivo organization around genes and constructed simulated artificial chromosomes with units of genes. Each artificial chromosome contains 1100 genes, and each gene was 3501 bp in length, consisting of a 1000 bp promoter region before its transcription start site (TSS) and 2500 bp following the TSS. The in vivo organization of nucleosomes around genes was determined from the identified consensus centers from the T1 experiment and averaged across all ORFs. As traditionally annotated, the nucleosomes after the TSS were numbered incrementally from +1, and the nucleosomes before TSS were numbered decrementally from −1. The average positions of these nucleosomes relative to TSSs were used in the construction the simulated nucleosome positions. Meanwhile, the number of sequencing reads within each consensus position was used to simulate the in silico MNase-seq datasets.</p><p>To test the ability of the proposed model to identify overlapping nucleosomes, we built overlapping nucleosome positions into our simulation. We first generated nucleosome positions downstream of the TSS (corresponding to the positions of the +1, +2, +3, … nucleosomes) and upstream of the TSS (corresponding to the positions of the −1, −2, −3, … nucleosomes) to represent the most frequent (strongest) positions among a set of overlapping nucleosomes (termed 'primary positions'). Then we added positions around the primary positions (termed 'alternative positions') to represent overlapping nucleosomes. In the simulation, we varied the relationships between the primary positions and the alternative positions to explore the performance of the TBB model. For simplicity, we assumed the alternative positions are symmetric to the primary positions.</p><p>We designed a simulation with three factors, varied at the gene level: coverage (the expected number of reads per gene), the spacing between primary nucleosome positions and alternative positions (which we refer to as offset), and the relative magnitudes of primary and alternative positions (which we refer to as effective magnitude and is defined as the percentage of reads attributed to the primary positions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Coverage had 10 levels, spanning the 5th to 95th percentile observed gene-level coverages in increments of 10%. Alternative position spacing had 10 levels, spanning from 0 bp (no alternative positions) to 45 bp in increments of 5 bp. We tested 11 levels for the relative magnitude between alternative positions and primary positions, spanning from 0 (no alternative positions) to 1 (alternative positions of the same magnitude as primary positions) in increments of 0.1, where the effective magnitude ranged from 1 to 1/3. We used a full factorial design on these three factors, yielding 1100 distinct relationships between the primary and alternative positions for each of 10 simulated chromosomes.</p><p>To generate our in silico MNase-seq dataset, we followed a modified version of the generative process described above. For each gene, we first drew coefficients for its subset of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf86"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> from an upper-truncated log-normal distributed with parameters estimated from those regions in T1 with similar coverage. These corresponded to 'background' positions and introduce a realistic level of variation into the simulations; biologically, such background could originate from a combination of low-occupancy nucleosome positions and naked DNA obtained during the MNase-seq process. Then, we set the entries of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf87"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> corresponding to the gene’s primary and alternative positions deterministically. The sum of the coefficients for these positions was fixed to the total occupancy of the gene minus the sum of the background positions. The relative magnitudes were determined by the design described above, with two alternative positions placed symmetrically around each primary position at the designated spacings. Thus, for a given level of coverage, the expected number of reads within each cluster was fixed, but its distribution across primary and alternative positions varies.</p><p>We convolved these <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf88"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> vectors with the template estimated from the experimental data to obtain vectors of expected read counts <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf89"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Finally, we generated <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf90"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> to obtain simulated read counts. This entire procedure was repeated for each replicate, yielding 10 artificial chromosomes of length 3,851,100 bp each. The simulated read midpoint occupancy was similar to the midpoint occupancy observed in vivo around (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Based on our in silico results, the TBB method appears extremely accurate for calling primary nucleosome positions. It can estimate 50% of such positions within 2–3 bp and 95% within 4–5 bp for all simulated conditions, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> Its performance remains strong for the estimation of alternative positions. As the data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> hows, more than 50% of the simulated alternative positions were mapped within 2 bp when the effective magnitude is less than 0.71 (alternative positions populated at least as much as 20% of their corresponding primary positions). When the effective magnitude reaches 0.56 or less (populated as much as 40% of their corresponding primary positions), we mapped over 50% of alternative positions within a single base pair. With the spacing between the alternative and primary positions ranging from 5–45 bp, the median error for estimating alternative positions is no more than 2 bp. We observed stronger dependence of the TBB method’s performance on the spacing between alternative and primary positions: we generally attained higher reliability for the larger offsets, with over 85% of alternative positions estimated within 8 bp when the offset is 10 bp, and within 6 bp when the offset is 40 bp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/airoldilab/cplate">http://www.github.com/airoldilab/cplate</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Software availability</title><p>All sequencing data are deposited in the NCBI SRA database under accession number SRP023122.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nucleosome positions and alternative chromatin states revealed by computation approach leveraging digestion variability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor, Asifa Akhtar as Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers, including Juan Vaquerizas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, Zhou et al. introduce a computational method to determine nucleosome positioning from MNase-seq data at a base-pair resolution. Due to digestion variability, it has been a problem comparing nucleosome positioning maps between samples from different MNase-seq experiments. It is also impossible to separate biological variations in nucleosome positioning from technical variations in MNase digestion. The computational method proposed by the authors looks quite promising to solve these problems.</p><p>Overall the study is interesting and the method will be of use to the genomics community, since it is currently not straightforward to determine nucleosome positioning with high accuracy.</p><p>1) There are currently a number of other methods to determine nucleosome positioning. The manuscript will greatly benefit from performing a comparison with those, so the readers can easily assess the performance of the method.</p><p>2) The method describing how to use the software to generate the digestion variability template is too simplified, and the GitHub site is also poorly organized with no documentations, making it very hard to apply the authors' method to other MNase-seq experiments. It limits the usefulness of the authors' approach for the wide audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. This aspect should be improved upon revision.</p><p>3) The authors propose there are alternative positioning of nucleosomes near TSSs. Why are these alternative positioning nucleosomes not apparent in the chemical approach (Brogaard et al. 2012)? What will be the overlap between author's approach and the Brogaard approach if you only consider the alternative positioned nucleosomes?</p><p>4) The authors suggest that distal nucleosomes might work by providing a boundary for the assembly of the PIC (subsection “Alternative chromatin states and transcription initiation”, third paragraph). However, the authors do not provide enough evidence to be able to make this statement since the distal positioning of the nucleosomes might just reflect the binding of the PIC, and therefore might just be a consequence of the transcriptional process, rather than the provision of a boundary.</p><p>5) The authors report a link between the presence of uniquely positioned nucleosomes in highly expressed genes. It would be interesting to stratify genes according to gene expression (for examples using quintiles) and to evaluate whether there are specific enrichments of unique vs alternative nucleosomes across the stratified dataset. This would allow the authors to discern whether the unique vs. alternative nucleosome observation could be explained by the overall level of gene expression or whether the two groups have functional implications. This is important in the context of the subsequent sequence analysis since the authors argue that unique nucleosomes have specific sequence features, which suggest functional implications.</p><p>6) In order to assess the functional implications, the manuscript will improve considerably if the unique vs. alternative classification analysis and subsequent gene expression and sequence analyses would be repeated using the human dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There are currently a number of other methods to determine nucleosome positioning. The manuscript will greatly benefit from performing a comparison with those, so the readers can easily assess the performance of the method.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. The method proposed in this manuscript aims at estimating the position of individual nucleosome configurations defined over a few base pairs, rather than the peak positions of averaged nucleosome occupancy over hundreds of base pairs as with most of the other methods. While it is difficult to make a fair quantitative comparison with other methods, we provide a qualitative comparison below for assessing the performance of the available methods. This information is also summarized in the supplementary material for the readers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>As we described in the manuscript, the proposed method utilizes a digestion template-based Bayesian approach to estimate the probability of observing nucleosomes at base-pair resolution from MNase-seq data. We reported both the average centers of bulk nucleosomes as well the positions of individual nucleosomes. Parameters used in the model are inferred directly from experimental datasets. In comparison, the Parzen window-based methods, as used by Albert et al. (2007), Valouev et al. (2008), Tsankov et al., (2010) and many others, estimate the peak of smoothed nucleosome occupancy along relatively broad nucleosome-containing regions. The number and locations of nucleosomes are highly dependent on smoothing window widths that are defined by users. Weiner et al. (2010) proposed a template-based filtering approach to deal with variable nucleosome sizes and fuzzy digestion ends. However, it cannot provide fine-grained mapping of overlapping nucleosome positions. The NOrMAL method developed by Polishko et al. (2012) is a recent method with improved identification of non-overlapping nucleosome positions compared with previous methods, but still depends on user defined parameters and cannot map positions of individual nucleosomes. In a separate simulation analysis, we described a direct comparison between the performance of NOrMAL and the performance of the template-based Bayesian method (Blocker and Airoldi 2016, Section 4). The TBB method outperforms NOrMAL in all the settings we have considered. We conclude that our work provides the best resolution and most accurate method to identify positions of individual nucleosomes from MNase-seq data.</p><p>In addition to methods developed for MNase-seq data, alternative approaches utilizing chemical cleavage (Bogaard et al., 2012), ATAC-Seq (Schep et al., 2015) and DNase- seq (Zhong et al., 2016) provide complementary approaches to determining nucleosome position genome-wide. The nucleosome positions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> determined by chemical cleavage have been regarded as the gold-standard in the field. We provided direct comparison with the chemical cleavage method in the manuscript, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>In all, each computational and experimental method has their advantages and limitations. To help the reader easily assess the performance of different methods for determining nucleosome positions, we summarize the above description and references in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>. We added the following text to introduce the comparison.</p><p>“Several methods have been developed to determine the genome-wide locations of nucleosomes, each of which addresses different experimental and computational issues (Albert et al., 2007; Brogaard et al., 2012; Polishko et al., 2012; Schep et al., 2015; Tirosh, 2012; Tsankov et al., 2010; Valouev et al., 2011; Weiner et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2016). We briefly summarize the approaches, performance and limitations of these methods for reference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) The method describing how to use the software to generate the digestion variability template is too simplified, and the GitHub site is also poorly organized with no documentations, making it very hard to apply the authors' method to other MNase-seq experiments.

This aspect should be improved upon revision.</italic> </p><p>We have updated the documentation of the software on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.github.com/airoldilab/cplate">http://www.github.com/airoldilab/cplate</ext-link>) to guide users on how to apply the proposed methods to other MNase-seq experiments. The updated GitHub repository includes documentation on software requirements, as well as step-by-step instructions on how to install and replicate the template-based analysis of MNase-seq data.

Why are these alternative positioning nucleosomes not apparent in the chemical approach (Brogaard et al. 2012)? What will be the overlap between author's approach and the Brogaard approach if you only consider the alternative positioned nucleosomes?</italic> </p><p>We analyzed the same genomic regions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> with the chemical nucleosome map from Brogaard et al. 2012, and observed several alternative nucleosome positions present around the TSS. On average, 5.8 chemical positions were found within each genomic region examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Next, we examined the overlap between our unique and alternative nucleosome positions (both the distal and proximal positions) near TSS and the chemical nucleosome positions, by calculating the minimum distance between a TBB nucleosome position and a chemical position. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>, half of the unique positions and half of alternative positions are within 3 bp and 4 bp of a Brogaard chemical position, respectively. 75% of the unique positions are within 11 bp and 75% of the alternative positions are within 13 bp. These data suggest that the overlap between the TBB nucleosome positions and the chemical nucleosome positions are similar between regions near gene TSSs and in other regions across the whole genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cumulative distribution of the nearest distance analysis for TBB positions around gene TSSs.</title><p>The curves show the cumulative distribution of the nearest distance between the TBB nucleosome positions at gene TSSs analyzed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and the nucleosome positions mapped by the chemical approach.

Although it is comprehensive, the chemical nucleosome map makes it difficult to distinguish if one or a few nucleosome positions are the dominant positions. In comparison, the TBB approach reveals alternative nucleosome positions that are dominant within a population of cells, and exposes the pattern of alternative nucleosomes around gene TSSs.</p><p><italic>4) The authors suggest that distal nucleosomes might work by providing a boundary for the assembly of the PIC (subsection “Alternative chromatin states and transcription initiation”, third paragraph). However, the authors do not provide enough evidence to be able to make this statement since the distal positioning of the nucleosomes might just reflect the binding of the PIC, and therefore might just be a consequence of the transcriptional process, rather than the provision of a boundary.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have changed the original text “suggesting that the 1 nucleosome in the distal position provides a boundary for the assembly of the PIC” to “suggesting that the 1 nucleosome in the distal position marks a boundary for the assembly of the PIC. This boundary may be provided by the positioned nucleosomes or by binding of one or more components of the transcription complex”.</p><p><italic>5) The authors report a link between the presence of uniquely positioned nucleosomes in highly expressed genes. It would be interesting to stratify genes according to gene expression (for examples using quintiles) and to evaluate whether there are specific enrichments of unique vs. alternative nucleosomes across the stratified dataset. This would allow the authors to discern whether the unique vs. alternative nucleosome observation could be explained by the overall level of gene expression or whether the two groups have functional implications. This is important in the context of the subsequent sequence analysis since the authors argue that unique nucleosomes have specific sequence features, which suggest functional implications.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the analysis suggested by the reviewers to further examine the relationship between alternative positions at TSSs and gene expression level. Following our original analysis, we stratified genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) based on their expression level, and evaluated whether there is any specific enrichment of unique vs alternative nucleosomes across stratified data. We obtained the expression levels of 3368 genes from Newman et al. 2006 when yeast cells are grown in synthetic complete medium, ranked them from highest to lowest, and evaluated the enrichment in unique nucleosomes in either 4, 5, 8, or 10 stratified segments. The P-values are calculated with Fisher’s exact test for each segment and are plotted below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>). Similar to our description in the text, uniquely positioned nucleosomes are enriched among the highest expressed genes.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.030</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Significance of the enrichment in uniquely positioned nucleosomes among genes stratified by expression level determined in Newman et al.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16970.030">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16970.030</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16970-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>Since the Newman et al. dataset only covers ~ 75% of genes examined here, we extended our analysis to an RNA-seq dataset of yeast cells cultured at similar conditions (Zid at al., 2014), where expression of all of the genes can be analyzed. After performing the same analysis described above, we observed similar results as for the Newman et al. dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 3</xref>), suggesting that uniquely positioned nucleosomes are only enriched in the most highly expressed genes. We fail to observe significant enrichment in alternatively positioned nucleosomes in any stratified data we examined so far.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16970.031</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Significance of the enrichment in uniquely positioned nucleosomes among genes stratified by expression level determined in Zid et al.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16970.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16970.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16970-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig></p><p>Overall, we concluded that the unique vs. alternative nucleosome positions at TSSs cannot be fully explained by the overall level of gene expression. We echo the reviewer’s opinion that there may be other functional implications of unique vs alternative nucleosomes. Our work provides the tool to finely dissect chromatin configurations and investigate the relationship between these configurations and gene regulation.</p><p><italic>6) In order to assess the functional implications, the manuscript will improve considerably if the unique vs. alternative classification analysis and subsequent gene expression and sequence analyses would be repeated using the human dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Human nucleosome datasets from Gaffney et al. 2012 were constructed from pooling paired-end MNase-seq data from seven human lymphoid cell lines. Each cell line may differ in their genetic backgrounds, gene expression, chromatin state, etc. These differences likely all contribute to positioning of nucleosomes. We cannot conclude whether overlapping nucleosome positions identified from these datasets originate from differences between cell lines or mechanisms related to gene regulation. It is also difficult to properly correlate promoter nucleosome configurations with gene expression, transcription machinery binding etc. We thus think the nature of the datasets renders it unsuitable for the comprehensive characterization suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
