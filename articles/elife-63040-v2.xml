We hypothesized that TRPA1 channels in capillary endothelial cells are stimulated by neuronal activity and instigate a propagating retrograde signal that dilates upstream parenchymal arterioles to initiate functional hyperemia. We find that activation of TRPA1 in capillary beds and post-arteriole transitional segments with mural cell coverage initiates retrograde signals that dilate upstream arterioles. These signals exhibit a unique mode of biphasic propagation. Slow, short-range intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the capillary network are converted to rapid electrical signals in transitional segments that propagate to and dilate upstream arterioles. We further demonstrate that TRPA1 is necessary for functional hyperemia and neurovascular coupling within the somatosensory cortex of mice in vivo. These data establish endothelial cell TRPA1 channels as neuronal activity sensors that initiate microvascular vasodilatory responses to redirect blood to regions of metabolic demand.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPA1 channels</kwd><kwd>panx1 channels</kwd><kwd>purinergic signaling</kwd><kwd>conducted vasodilation</kwd><kwd>neurovascular

significant intrinsic energy reserves; thus, the metabolic substrates for energy generation must be delivered to active regions in real time. However, substantial increases in global blood flow to the brain are limited by constraints imposed by the enclosing skull and the finite amount of total blood available for regional distribution. The brain therefore relies on dynamic local distribution of the available blood supply to the sites of highest metabolic activity. This vital process is accomplished by a complex interconnected network of cerebral pial arteries at the surface, parenchymal arterioles that provide a conduit to the interior, and a vast capillary network. Communication between active neurons and the cerebral microvasculature regulates activity-dependent increases in blood perfusion (functional hyperemia) in the brain through processes collectively referred to as âneurovascular couplingâ (NVC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iadecola, 2017</xref>). One conceptual model of NVC that has received considerable research attention postulates that glutamate released during neurotransmission binds to G<sub>q/11</sub> protein-linked metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) on perisynaptic astrocytic processes to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathways that ultimately cause the release of vasodilator substances from astrocytic endfeet encircling parenchymal arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Filosa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Filosa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007</xref>). These factors are purported to act directly on smooth muscle cells in the walls of arterioles to cause vasodilation and locally increase blood flow. Several recent studies have challenged this model, including one reporting that mGluR expression in astrocytes is undetectable after postnatal week 3, implying that this mechanism does not function in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Other reports have suggested that NVC can occur in the absence of astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jego et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nizar et al., 2013</xref>) and that astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals lag vasodilator responses recorded in vivo in awake, behaving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tran et al., 2018</xref>). Longden et al. put forward a new paradigm for NVC, demonstrating that activation of inward-rectifying K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>ir</sub>) channels on brain capillary endothelial cells by extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions, released during neuronal activity, generates propagating electrical signals that cause dilation of upstream parenchymal arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Given the essential nature of the NVC response for healthy brain function and life itself, it is reasonable to presume that multiple sensory modalities with overlapping and complementary roles operate within brain capillary endothelial cells to ensure the fidelity of neuronally driven functional hyperemia.</p><p>Here, we tested the hypothesis that transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels in brain capillary endothelial cells contribute to functional hyperemia in the brain. Members of the TRP superfamily of cation channels act as molecular sensors of diverse physical and chemical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flockerzi and Nilius, 2014</xref>). In cerebral pial arteries and parenchymal arterioles, activation of TRPA1 channels by endogenously produced lipid peroxide products, including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), leads to endothelium-dependent vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Earley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pires and Earley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trevisani et al., 2007</xref>). Using a combination of ex vivo and in vivo approaches, we find that activation of endothelial cell TRPA1 channels within capillaries, including post-arteriole transitional segments covered by enwrapping mural cells, generates retrograde propagating signals that lead to the dilation of upstream parenchymal arterioles. Specifically, we demonstrate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals initiated by TRPA1 channels slowly propagate through the capillary network by a previously unknown pathway that is dependent on ionotropic purinergic P<sub>2</sub>X receptor activity and pannexin-1 (Panx1) expression. Within the post-arteriole region, slowlyÂ propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are converted to rapidly propagating electrical signals that cause dilation of upstream arterioles. Our data also show that endothelial cell TRPA1 channels contribute to blood flow regulation and functional hyperemia in the somatosensory cortex in vivo. We conclude that, under physiological conditions, TRPA1 channels in the brain endothelium are capable of mediating NVC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional TRPA1 channels are present in native brain capillary endothelial cells</title><p>Native cerebral capillary endothelial cells were freshly isolated using combined mechanical and enzymatic dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>) and were patch-clamped in the conventional whole-cell configuration. Increasing extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] to 60 mM stimulated Ba<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive K<sub>ir</sub> currents in these cells, whereas NS309, a selective activator of small- and intermediate-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (SK and IK, respectively) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A to D</xref>).

The selective TRPA1 inhibitor HC-030031 (10 ÂµM) significantly attenuated this current.

The spread of the picospritzed solution was assessed by pulsing aCSF containing 1% (w/v) Evans Blue dye.

Dilation of parenchymal arterioles in response to capillary-applied 4-HNE was significantly attenuated by superfusing the ex vivo preparation with HC-030031 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). Application of the TRPA1-activating compound, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), to capillary beds also produced a concentration-dependent dilation of upstream arterioles (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Endothelial cells of the parenchymal arteriole are encased by a continuous circumferential layer of vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas post-arteriole transitional segments (i.e. segments between parenchymal arterioles and the dense capillary region) are covered by âensheathing pericytesâ that are morphologically distinct from vascular smooth muscle cells and identified by the classic bump-on-a-log characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). Mural cell coverage of endothelial cells of the capillary bed was incomplete, such that only a few capillary pericytes or thin-stranded capillary processes, if any, were observed in our isolated ex vivo preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). To visualize the elastin layer present only in arteries and arterioles, preparations were stained with Alexa Fluor 633 hydrazide which specifically binds to elastin fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). Elastin fibers were observed in the arteriole segment of our microvascular preparations, but not in the transitional segment or the capillary region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We next compared the propagation velocity of TRPA1-induced conducted vasodilator signals in vascular segments completely covered by mural cells (arterioles and post-arteriole transitional segments) with that in sparsely covered capillaries. The propagation velocity of the vasodilator signal is defined here as the time interval between stimulation of capillaries and start of dilation of the upstream arteriole, normalized to the distance between the site of stimulation and the point where arteriole dilation was measured. We found that the propagation velocity of signals initiated by stimulation of TRPA1 channels in capillaries was significantly slower than that elicited by stimulation of K<sub>ir</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data imply that TRPA1 channels in brain capillary endothelial cells mediate a signal that dilates upstream arterioles through a mechanism distinct from that initiated by K<sub>ir</sub> channels. An analysis of TRPA1-dependent responses in different segments of the cerebral microvasculature showed that the propagation velocity of vasodilator signals from the post-arteriole transitional region (first vascular segment with mural cell coverage) to the upstream parenchymal arteriole was comparable to that of signals produced in this segment by picospritzing capillaries with elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Consequently, we infer that the signal produced by activation of TRPA1 channels propagates through the capillary network from the site of initiation to the transitional region more slowly than the fast-electrical signal initiated by activation of K<sub>ir</sub> channels. We propose a biphasic propagation model of conducted vasodilator signaling in which activation of TRPA1 channels in capillary endothelial cells generates a slowly propagating intercellular signal that is converted to a rapidly conducted electrical signal in vascular segments fully covered by mural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Biphasic velocity of conductive vasodilation following activation of capillary TRPA1 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A to D</bold>) Representative fluorescence image of an ex vivo microvascular preparation obtained from a wild-type mouse.

Released ATP subsequently activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ionotropic purinergic (P<sub>2</sub>X) receptors on adjacent cells to increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, providing a means for the intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Locovei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suadicani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zsembery et al., 2003</xref>). We used a pharmacological approach to determine if this mechanism was responsible for the propagation of conducted vasodilator signals in the brain capillary network. Pre-incubation of microvascular preparations with apyrase (1 U/mL) to catabolize extracellular purines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and administration of the pan-P<sub>2</sub>X inhibitor PPADS (10 ÂµM) blocked the dilation of upstream parenchymal arteriole segments in response to application of AITC to capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). However, apyrase and PPADS had no effect on conducted vasodilation initiated by stimulation of brain capillary endothelial cell K<sub>ir</sub> channels with 10 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Apyrase and PPADS treatment did not affect the tone of arterioles. We also found that direct application of ATP onto capillary beds stimulated conducted dilation in preparations from wild-type mice, an effect that was blocked by PPADS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). The velocity of ATP-conducted responses was slower than that of responses initiated by stimulation of K<sub>ir</sub> channels and was comparable to that of signals produced by stimulation of TRPA1 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Consistent with these findings, application of ATP onto capillaries did not initiate conducted vasodilation in ex vivo preparations from <italic>Panx1</italic>-ecKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). ATP-induced conducted vasodilation persisted in preparations from <italic>Trpa1</italic>-ecKO mice indicating that TRPA1 is the initiator and that Panx1-P<sub>2</sub>X signaling is unaffected in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These data support the concept that stimulation of TRPA1 channels on capillary endothelial cells initiates the release of ATP through endothelial cell Panx1 channels. Released ATP, in turn, stimulates P<sub>2</sub>X receptors on adjacent cells to generate a propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal.</p><p>We then asked, how far does the intercellular signal initiated by TRPA1 channels travel within the capillary network? To this end, we determined the length of cerebral capillary endothelial cells by measuring the distance between nuclei in isolated capillary networks labeled with isolectin B4 and DAPI. We found that the average capillary endothelial cell length was 28.7Â Â±Â 0.6 Âµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Given that the length of the capillary segment in our ex vivo microvascular preparation is in the range of 100â150 Âµm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), we estimate that the signal initiated by TRPA1 channels propagates through 3 to 5 endothelial cells in the capillary network before reaching post-arteriole transitional segments with mural cell coverage.</p><p>TRPA1 channels conduct mixed cation currents with a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nilius et al., 2011</xref>), and we have previously detected distinct TRPA1 channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling events in cerebral endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging studies performed using microvascular preparations obtained from transgenic mice expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP8, exclusively in the endothelium (<italic>Cdh5</italic>-GCaMP8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>) revealed that focal application of AITC onto the distal extremities of capillaries initiated an increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Moreover, this increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] triggered similar increases in neighboring regions, indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal propagates through the capillary network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). AITC-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were abolished by superfusing the preparation with HC-030031 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>), suggesting that initiation of the signal required the activity of TRPA1 channels. As our model predicts that the propagation velocity of the vasodilatory signal within the capillary network is slow, we therefore determined the velocity at which Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals travels through the capillary network. The propagation velocity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is defined here as the time interval between the start of an increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at one region of interest and the start of an increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in a neighboring region, normalized to the distance between the two regions. As expected, the velocity of vasodilator Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals within the capillaries travel at speeds slower than the rapid vasodilator signal traveling through vascular segments covered by mural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Focal application of ATP was also found to initiate an increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], that propagates to adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). PPADS abolished ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, suggesting that initiation and propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals require P<sub>2</sub>X receptors (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). The velocity of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is similar to that produced by activating TRPA1 channels, suggesting a convergent vasodilator signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The duration, rise time and decay time of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal evoked by AITC and ATP were also comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref> to C). We next validated that the vasodilator signal through the capillaries requires influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> through purinergic P<sub>2</sub>X receptors by superfusing preparations with aCSF devoid of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We found that ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were abolished in preparations under 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions; however, the response returned once extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM) was reintroduced (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>).

Although it has been reported that functional IK and SK channels are not present in capillary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), our functional data suggest that IK and SK channels are expressed in post-arteriole transitional segments, where they convert slowly propagating intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals initiated by capillary TRPA1 channels into rapidly propagating electrical signals. Direct application of NS309 (10 ÂµM) directly onto parenchymal arterioles, which are known to express endothelial IK and SK channels caused dilation, whereas focal stimulation of capillary extremities did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that focal application of NS309 directly onto the post-arteriole transitional segment induced dilation of the upstream parenchymal arteriole, indicating that IK and SK channels are expressed in this region and that their activation results in conducted vasodilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). We also found that this response was inhibited by BaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>) and propagated at the same velocity as signals initiated by stimulating the post-arteriole transitional segment with elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] and TRPA1 agonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). These data support the concept that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals arriving from the capillary network activate IK and SK channels within the post-arteriole transitional segment to initiate a fast-conducting vasodilator response that requires K<sub>ir</sub> channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Stimulation of brain endothelial cell TRPA1 channels increases local blood flow in vivo</title><p>We next performed experiments to determine if stimulation of endothelial cell TRPA1 channels increase localized cerebral blood flow in vivo.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextran (<italic>i.v.</italic>) was administered to animals to allow visualization of the vasculature and contrast imaging of RBCs.

The rate of flux increase was 11.6Â Â±Â 2.3 RBC/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The latency of this response (7.5Â Â±Â 1.2 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) was slow compared with the response induced by applying elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] (3.8Â Â±Â 0.9 s), as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>.

Changes in blood flow were induced by contralateral whisker stimulation and were recorded using laser-Doppler flowmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Girouard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Stimulating whiskers for 5 s reliably and reproducibly increased cerebral blood flow in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Control experiments indicated that this was not due to artifactual noise, as stimulation of ipsilateral whiskers was without effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To determine if TRPA1 channels are involved in this functional hyperemic response, we treated mice with HC-030031 (100 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic> for 30 min). HC-030031 treatment significantly attenuated the increase in cerebral blood flow following whisker stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Our model suggests that TRPA1 channels should affect the slow components of the hyperemic response. Further analysis of the kinetics revealed that the duration of the response was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), and the decay rate was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) following HC-030031 treatment, suggesting that TRPA1 channels are needed to sustain the rise in blood flow. The rise rate and latency of the response was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). To demonstrate the contribution of endothelial cell TRPA1 channels, we assessed functional hyperemia in <italic>Trpa1</italic>-ecKO mice.

Collectively, these data demonstrate that endothelial cell TRPA1 channels contribute to the increase in blood flow and sustains that vasodilatory response. Interestingly, TRPA1 channels were found not to be involved when contralateral whiskers were stimulated for a shorter duration. The increase in blood flow and the kinetics of the hyperemic response were unchanged in animals treated with HC-030031 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8MâR</xref>) and <italic>Trpa1</italic>-ecKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8SâX</xref>) following either a 1 or 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8âfigure supplement 3</xref>) stimulation period.

The neurovascular apparatus must detect and decode signals generated by active areas to properly direct regional blood flow and ensure optimal brain function. The preponderance of the brain vasculature is composed of densely packed capillary networks; an optical volumetric analysis has revealed that the soma of all central neurons are located no more than 15 Î¼m from a brain capillary endothelial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsai and Kleinfeld, 2009</xref>). Building on these observations, Longden et al. introduced a convincing new paradigm for NVC, demonstrating that conducted vasodilator responses orchestrated by capillary endothelial cells provoke functional hyperemia in the brain through propagating electrical (hyperpolarizing) signals initiated and sustained by K<sub>ir</sub> channels. Thus, the brainâs extensive capillary network serves as a sensory web for detecting [K<sup>+</sup>] released at active neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). The NVC response is essential for life itself, and the multiplicity of distinct signaling modalities in the active brain imply that brain capillary endothelial cells possess an equally broad assortment of complementary and overlapping sensors. Here, we investigated this concept, providing evidence that activation of brain capillary endothelial cell TRPA1 channels promotes dilation of upstream parenchymal arterioles through a novel, biphasic intercellular signaling mechanism that is dependent on Panx1 channels. Our findings also identify purinergic receptors on capillary endothelial cells as part of this signal conduction pathway and as independent detectors of released ATP. We further demonstrate that focal stimulation of K<sub>ir</sub> and TRPA1 channels in the post-arteriole transitional region results in conducted dilation of upstream arterioles, expanding the brainâs vascular sensory network to include these segments. We conclude that multiple molecular sensors that are critically important for NVC and functional hyperemia in the brain, including TRPA1 channels and purinergic receptors, are present in brain capillary endothelial cells.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that capillary endothelial cell TRPA1 channels initiate signals that propagate through the cerebral microvasculature to cause dilation of upstream parenchymal arterioles, locally increase RBC flux, and produce functional hyperemia in the brain. TRPA1 exhibits a unique pattern of expression within the vasculature: it is present in the endothelium of arteries and arterioles in the brain, but not in other organs, such as the heart, dermis, kidney, or mesentery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Earley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pires and Earley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of vascular TRPA1 channels produces endothelium-dependent dilation of cerebral arteries and arterioles, a mechanism that is neuroprotective during ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Earley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pires and Earley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Lipid peroxidation metabolites generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as 4-HNE, directly activate TRPA1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taylor-Clark et al., 2008</xref>). We have shown that superoxide anions (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>), generated by the activity of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) or by mitochondrial respiration under hypoxic and ischemic conditions, endogenously generate 4-HNE, which stimulates TRPA1 channel activity in the cerebral endothelium to cause vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pires and Earley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that extracellular ROS generated by astrocytes could act as endogenous agonists of capillary endothelial cell TRPA1 channels during NVC. One possible source of ROS is astrocytic endfoot processes, which encase brain capillaries and have been shown to express NOX2 and produce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramov and Duchen, 2005</xref>). Alternatively, extracellular ROS generated by metabolically active neurons proximal to brain capillaries could activate TRPA1 channels. Pericytes and microglia cells are also intimately associated with capillaries in the brain and are potential sources of TRPA1-activating ROS metabolites.</p><p>The vasodilator signals initiated by brain capillary endothelial cell TRPA1 channels propagate at about half the speed of those initiated by K<sub>ir</sub>, suggesting that the two signals are conducted by different pathways. Prior work has demonstrated that activation of capillary endothelial cell K<sub>ir</sub> channels generates a fast-conducting electrical signal that hyperpolarizes smooth muscle cells in upstream arterioles to cause vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Our data showed that stimulation of capillary endothelial cell TRPA1 channels produced slowly propagating, short-range intercellular signals that are dependent on endothelial expression of Panx1 channels. Panx1 forms transmembrane channels in cerebral arteriole and capillary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). Panx1 channels are normally closed, but when activated by increases in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], they release ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dahl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Locovei et al., 2006</xref>). Previous studies using exogenous expression systems have shown that Panx1 channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable purinergic P<sub>2</sub>X receptors colocalize on the membrane of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Locovei et al., 2007</xref>) and urothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Negoro et al., 2014</xref>) to form signaling microdomains that permit intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. In this mechanism, ATP released via Panx1 channels binds and activates P<sub>2</sub>X receptors on neighboring cells, resulting in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and activation of Panx1 channels, thus establishing a propagating intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Suadicani et al., 2009</xref>). Our data suggest that a similar signaling pathway operates in the cerebral capillary network, providing a novel short-range intercellular communication system between neighboring capillary endothelial cells. Our data further suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPA1 channels is the initiator of this pathway, but it is possible that other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels present on capillary endothelial cells can activate this pathway to initiate propagative vasodilation if they form a signaling complex with Panx1.</p><p>Purinergic signaling is an important endogenous pathway that regulates many cellular processes, including regulation of vascular tone in multiple vascular beds. Activation of ATP-gated, cation-conducting purinergic P<sub>2</sub> receptors and G protein-coupled receptors results in dual vasoconstriction and vasodilation responses. Sympathetic nerves surrounding vessels of numerous vascular beds contain ATP, which upon release, acts primarily on P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>1</sub> receptors to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and subsequent contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnstock, 2017</xref>). Endothelial cells are a significant source of ATP that is released in response to certain stimuli, such as shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwiebert et al., 2002</xref>). Secreted ATP activates endothelial P<sub>2</sub>X and P<sub>2</sub>Y receptors in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to produce the endothelium-dependent vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin as well as endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnstock, 2017</xref>). Our data demonstrates that ATP derived from capillary endothelial cells activate P<sub>2</sub>X receptors on adjacent endothelial cells producing a propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that mediates dilation of upstream arterioles. However, there are other sources of ATP in the cerebral circulation. ATP released from surrounding astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kisler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pascual et al., 2005</xref>) and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fields and Burnstock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kisler et al., 2017</xref>) can activate ATP-gated receptors on arteriolar vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in contraction; it can also induce endothelium-dependent vasodilation through the release of paracrine factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ralevic and Dunn, 2015</xref>). Our data support a model in which endogenous ATP derived from astrocytes and/or neurons may induce dilation of upstream arterioles. Astrocytes and/or neurons that encompass capillaries may release ATP that directly activates P<sub>2</sub>X receptors expressed on capillary endothelial cells to initiate Panx1-dependent conducted vasodilation, thereby providing an additional capillary-based mechanism for initiation of NVC.</p><p>Our findings indicate that post-arteriole transitional segments are vital for functional hyperemic responses in the brain. These transitional vascular segments are composed of endothelial cells encompassed by specialized mural cells called ensheathing pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). Ensheathing pericytes are morphologically distinct from other types of mural cell types as they possess a protruding cell body and are elongated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grant et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2015</xref>). Recent reports suggest that ensheathing pericytes are contractile and regulate the diameter of post-arteriole transitional segment to redistribute blood to neuronally active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings suggest that post-arteriole transitional segments serve two additional functions during NVC. First, focal stimulation of these segments with substances that activate K<sub>ir</sub> or TRPA1 channels initiates conducted dilation of upstream arterioles. These data suggest that the brainâs vascular sensory web extends throughout the capillary tree to include the post-arteriole transitional segment. Interestingly, the mechanism of ATP-induced signal propagation is unique to more distal reaches of the capillary network, as focal application of ATP onto the post-arteriole transitional region failed to dilate upstream arterioles. Secondly, our data show that post-arteriole transitional segments are critically important for the translation of slowly propagating short-range Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals originating deeper in the capillary bed into fast electrical signals that cause dilation of upstream parenchymal arterioles. Stimulation of IK and SK channels within the transitional region resulted in fast-propagating conducted dilation, indicating functional expression of these channels within this vascular segment. These functional data suggest that endothelial cells that occupy the post-arteriole transitional region are phenotypically distinguishable from those found in the distal capillary tree, but a meticulous single-cell analysis is needed to verify this at the molecular level.</p><p>The NVC process is vital for maintaining cerebral blood flow to active neuronal sites. Notably, insufficient blood flow is a hallmark of many neurological disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment, stroke, and Alzheimerâs disease. The demonstration that capillaries act as sensors in the control of microcirculatory hemodynamics has altered our view of functional hyperemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings extend this paradigm, demonstrating that TRPA1 channels and PPADS-sensitive purinergic receptors on brain capillary endothelial cells are capable of dilating upstream parenchymal arterioles to increase RBC flux and functional hyperemia in the brain. Our findings further show that signals initiated by TRPA1 channels and purinergic receptors propagate through capillary endothelial cells through a novel Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway that depends on endothelial Panx1 channels. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are converted to fast-conducting electrical signals by SK and IK channels in the post-arteriole transition region. We conclude that multiple sensory mechanisms present in brain endothelial cells are vital for the regulation of cerebral blood flow and functional hyperemia and could be targeted to treat cerebrovascular dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Briefly, a 3 mm x 5 mm x 3 mm (W x L x D) section of the brain surrounding the middle cerebral artery was dissected and placed into a microdissection dish containing ice-cold Mg-PSS. The middle cerebral artery and the surrounding pial meninge were carefully removed so as to maintain branching parenchymal arterioles within the brain tissue. Thereafter, parenchymal arterioles with attached capillaries were carefully blunt-dissected from the underlying cerebral tissue and transferred to a pressure myograph chamber (Living Systems Instrumentation, USA) containing oxygenated (21% O<sub>2</sub>, 6% CO<sub>2</sub>, 73% N<sub>2</sub>; Praxair Technology, Inc, USA) aCSF (124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 mM glucose; all salts from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) and a Sylgard pad at the chamber base. Microvascular preparations were mounted between two glass micropipettes (outer diameterÂ ~20â40 Î¼m) and secured with nylon monofilaments. The outermost tips of attached capillaries were pinned onto the surface of the Sylgard pad to immobilize the capillary bed and allow pressurization of the preparation. Intraluminal pressure was controlled using a servo-controlled peristaltic pump (Living Systems Instrumentation). Arteries were visualized with an inverted microscope (Accu-Scope Inc, USA) coupled to a USB camera (The Imaging Source LLC., USA). Intraluminal diameter as a function of time was recorded using IonWizard software (version 6.4.1.73; IonOptix, LLC., USA). Microvascular preparations were bathed in warmed (37Â°C), oxygenated aCSF at an intraluminal pressure of 5 mmHg. Following a 15-min equilibration period, intraluminal pressure was increased to 40 mmHg and spontaneous tone was allowed to develop. Preparations that developed less than 10% tone were discarded. Localized application of drugs onto the capillary bed was achieved by placing a micropipette attached to a Picospritzer III (Parker Hannifin Corporation, USA) adjacent to capillary extremities. The viability of attached capillaries was assessed by locally applying a 7 s pulse of aCSF containing elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] (10 mM) onto capillary extremities. Preparations that failed to dilate to elevated [K<sup>+</sup>] were discarded.</p><p>In control experiments designed to validate the microvascular preparation, the connection between the upstream parenchymal arteriole segment and attached capillaries was severed. In other control experiments, spatial spread was determined by pulsing aCSF containing 1% w/v Evans Blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc). The role of TRPA1 channels was examined by locally applying 4-HNE (1 ÂµM) or AITC (30 ÂµM; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) to the attached capillaries, and the role of purinergic signaling was examined by focal application of ATP (10 ÂµM; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc). NS309 (10 ÂµM) was also applied to determine expression of IK and SK channels. In separate experiments, preparations were modified by removing attached capillary segments and leaving the post-arteriole transitional segment intact. In these experiments, the post-arteriole transitional segment was directly stimulated via a micropipette placed adjacent to this segment. Underlying mechanisms were examined by adding pharmacological agents to the superfusing bath solution. Apyrase (1 U/mL), BaCl<sub>2</sub> (30 ÂµM), indomethacin (10 ÂµM), and L-NAME (100 ÂµM) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc, and apamin (300 nM), HC-030031 (10 ÂµM), PPADS (10 ÂµM), and TRAM34 (1 ÂµM) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. Lumen diameter was continuously recorded, and responses were expressed as vasodilation (%). Velocity data were obtained by determining the latency of the response following local application of compounds in relation to the distance traveled between the capillary extremity or post-arteriole transitional segment to the parenchymal arteriole.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence imaging</title><p>Images of the ex vivo microvascular preparation were obtained from wild-type mice.

Images of the complete microvascular preparation were obtained using a 10x water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 0.3, Olympus), and magnified images of the different vascular segments using a 40x water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 0.8, Olympus). Each field of view was 1371 Ã 1523 pixels (10x, one pixelÂ =Â 0.65 Î¼m; 40x, one pixelÂ =Â 0.16 Î¼m).Â Z-stacks were captured atÂ 1Â Âµm intervalsÂ to allow for three-dimensional reconstruction of the microvascular preparation. Images were captured using VisiView software (version 4.5.0.7, Visitron Systems GmbH, Germany) and analyzed using ImageJ software (version 1.52 n, National Institutes of Health, USA).</p><p>The length of capillary endothelial cells was determined by fluorescence labeling isolated capillary networks. Isolated capillary networks were placed onto a glass coverslip and fixed (4% formaldehyde in PBS, 20 min at room temperature) and blocked (0.5% Triton X-100, 5% SEABlock Blocking Buffer in PBS, 2 hr at room temperature). Capillary networks were visualized by staining preparations with Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated isolectin B4 (1:200 of a 1 mg/ml stock (catalogue number: I21412, ThermoFisher Scientific), 2 hr at room temperature). Aqueous mounting medium with DAPI (catalogue number: ab104139, Abcam plc., USA) was used to visualize nuclei of endothelial cells. Fluorescence images were taken by an Olympus FluoView laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000, Olympus) equipped with a Showa Optronics laser system (GLS5414A, Showa Optronics Co., Ltd, Japan) and a 60x oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.42, Olympus). Each field of view was 1024 Ã 1024 pixels (one pixelÂ =Â 0.21 Î¼m). Z-stacks were captured at 0.5 Âµm intervalsÂ to allow for three-dimensional reconstruction of the capillary networks. Images were captured using FluoView FV1000 FV10-ASW software (version 4.02, Olympus), and analyzed using ImageJ software. The length of capillary endothelial cells was determined by measuring the distance between nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>Microvascular preparations isolated from <italic>Cdh5</italic>-GCaMP8 mice were mounted in a pressure myograph chamber, as described above. Changes in capillary endothelial cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] were recorded in real time after local exposure to TRPA1 agonists or ATP. Videos were recorded at an average of 23 frames/s for approximately 120 s (2760 frames). Baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity was recorded for the first 60 s (~1380 frames), then the capillary bed was picospritzed with AITC (30 ÂµM) or ATP (10 ÂµM), and the preparations were recorded for an additional 60 s (~1380 frames). Videos were obtained using a custom-built upright microscope (Olympus BX51 WI) equipped with epifluorescence illumination (CoolLED pE-300<sup>white</sup>, CoolLED Ltd., UK), a 20x water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 0.5, Olympus), and an ORCA-Fusion Digital CMOS C14440-20UP camera. Each field of view was 1152 Ã 1152 pixels (one pixelÂ =Â 0.65 Î¼m). Videos were captured using Î¼Manager software (version 1.4.22, University of California, San Francisco, USA) and analyzed using ImageJ software. Discrete regions of interest (ROIs) along the capillary network were selected for analysis. The fractional increase in fluorescence (F/F<sub>0</sub>) was determined for ROIs, where fluorescence (F) is normalized to basal fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>). Underlying mechanisms were examined by adding pharmacological agents to the superfusing bath solution. Velocity data were obtained by determining the latency of the response between adjacent ROIs following local application of compounds in relation to the distance traveled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon imaging of in vivo brain microcirculatory hemodynamics</title><p>Hemodynamics of the murine microcirculation were assessed in vivo after capillary endothelial cell TRPA1 activation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance) and the skull was exposed. Thereafter, a stainless-steel head plate was attached over the right hemisphere using dental adhesive, and the head was immobilized by securing the head plate to a holding frame. A cranial window (~2 mm diameter) was made in the skull above the somatosensory cortex, after which FITC-labeled dextran (150 kDa; 150 Î¼L of a 3 mg/mL solution; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) was intravenously (<italic>i.v.</italic>) administered to allow visualization of the cortical cerebral vasculature and contrast imaging of RBCs. Following completion of the surgical procedure, isoflurane anesthesia was replaced with combined Î±-chloralose (50 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) and urethane (750 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc) to eliminate confounding vasodilatory effects of isoflurane. Capillaries downstream of arterioles were identified and selected for study. A micropipette was positioned adjacent to the capillary, such that AITC (30 ÂµM) was directly applied onto the capillary. Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC; 150 kDa; 0.2 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc)-labeled dextran was also included in the micropipette to visualize the micropipette location and determine the spatial coverage of the solution. The duration and pressure of fluid ejection via a glass micropipette was calibrated to obtain a localized application area approximately 10 Î¼m in diameter. Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-7 two-photon microscope (Zeiss, USA), coupled to a Coherent Chameleon Vision II Titanium-Sapphire pulsed infrared laser (Coherent, USA) and a 20x Plan Apochromat water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1.0, Zeiss). Each field of view was 512 Ã 512 pixels (one pixelÂ =Â 0.42 Î¼m). After excitation at 820 nm, emitted FITC-labeled dextran and TRITC-labeled dextran fluorescence was separated through 500â550 and 570â610 nm bandpass filters, respectively. RBC flux was determined by line-scan imaging of the capillary. Change in RBC flux through the stimulated capillary and cross-sectional area of upstream arterioles were obtained using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Functional hyperemia</title><p>After anesthetizing mice with isoflurane (5% induction, 2% maintenance), the skull was exposed and the head was immobilized in a stereotaxic frame. The skull of the right hemisphere was carefully thinned using a drill to visualize the surface vasculature of the somatosensory cortex. Following completion of the surgical procedure, isoflurane anesthesia was replaced with combined Î±-chloralose (50 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>) and urethane (750 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic>) to eliminate confounding vasodilatory effects of isoflurane. Perfusion was monitored via a laser-Doppler flowmetry probe (PeriFlux System PF5000, Perimed AB, Sweden) positioned above the somatosensory cortex. The contralateral whiskers were stimulated for either 1, 2, or 5 s, and changes in perfusion were recorded. Contralateral whiskers were stimulated three times at 2 min intervals. Ipsilateral whiskers were also stimulated as a control for potential vibration artifacts. The role of TRPA1 channels was assessed by treating mice with HC-030031 (100 mg/kg, <italic>i.p.</italic> for 30 min), and recording the hyperemic response in <italic>Trpa1</italic>-ecKO mice. Data are presented as changes in perfusion relative to baseline, calculated as follows: %Î Blood flow = (perfusion during stimulus/baseline perfusion)Ã100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are expressed as means Â± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless specified otherwise.

Your article has been reviewed Kenton Swartz as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andy Shih (Reviewer #2); Anna Devor (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The editors and reviewers all agreed that this is an impressive, mechanistic study of capillary-to-arteriole signal conduction during neurovascular coupling. Building on seminal earlier work from Longden et al., this study now demonstrates that TRPA1-Panx1-P2X signaling controls a distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signal propagation at the level of capillaries. This signal is slower than K<sup>+</sup> conduction, but similarly moves upstream until it reaches the post-arteriole transition segment. At this point, TRPA1 signaling passes the baton to faster K<sup>+</sup> signaling that leads to rapid and widespread dilation of upstream arterioles. The study is very comprehensive and well controlled, spanning many techniques, such as ex vivo isolated vessel preparations for detailed mechanistic testing to in vivo two-photon imaging and laser doppler for physiological relevance. The mechanism is teased out with endothelial specific TRPA1 deletions and a battery of pharmacological studies. Considering the myriad signaling mechanisms that may be involved in NV coupling, it makes sense that there are multiple convergent mechanisms for capillary-to-arteriole conduction. That these mechanisms may function on distinct temporal scales is very interesting and opens the door to deeper studies. Overall, we are very enthusiastic about the work and think a suitably revised manuscript would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The careful attention to distinct microvascular zones is appreciated. It would be helpful to better link the capillary-to-arteriole preparation with in vivo vascular architecture. Mural cell morphology is currently used, which is great, but the cell shapes are a hard to make out in the images. Without information on branching order from the penetrating arteriole or Î±-SMA expression, it is hard to relate to what is known in vivo. There is also some concern that the transitional segment might include some capillary zone, as it is quite long as depicted (~500 Î¼m in Figure 6A). in vivo, this zone is typically shorter (~50-150um) before it branches into capillaries, at a point where Î±-SMA content in the mural cell drops substantially. What would help is Î±-SMA immunostaining, if at all possible for this preparation, using a directly conjugated antibody from Î£ (Î£: C6198). We also suggest using Alexa 633 (elastin staining) to show where the post-arteriole transitional segment begins.</p><p>Related to this, a depiction of where precisely the parenchymal arteriole and its capillary extremities is extracted from the brain slice would be helpful. Also, if possible, some discussion on the variation between each ex vivo preparation. For example, at times, the transitional segment in cortical vascular networks can be very short, or much longer depending upon its diameter at the point of offshoot from the penetrating arteriole.</p><p>2) Figure 7B. The latency to onset of RBC flux increase is delayed by what seems like 5 seconds. This is interesting and consistent with a slow propagation through the capillary bed. The reporting of the metrics could therefore go deeper. For instance, what is the mean latency? What is the rate of flux increase once it begins? This may be beyond the scope, but it would be nice to have a K<sup>+</sup> induced comparison for the in vivo two-photon imaging studies, so we can understand the difference between slow and fast mechanisms. It would also serve as a good positive control. This is because the speed of vasodilation can be dependent on anesthesia or state of physiology, which can differ between labs.</p><p>3) Figure 7G,H. It may be more apt to measure cross-sectional area of the penetrating arteriole rather than diameter. It will result in a more robust change than diameter. Diameter is also tricky if the cross-section is an ellipse. You may wish to also better explain what the images are showing with a schematic, for readers not familiar with two-photon imaging.</p><p>4) A deeper discussion of why a slow propagation mechanism is needed would be helpful. NV coupling is typically considered to be a process on the timescale of seconds. Perhaps, the slow calcium response helps to sustain or buffer the rapid dilatory response from electrical conduction? Can this be gathered from your laser doppler experiments? In short, what part of the hemodynamic response function is affected with loss of TRPA1 signaling? The model suggests TRPA1 should affect slow components, but the doppler data shows a dampened response across the entire stimulation period and in fact affects the initial dilation. To see this hemodynamic response better, we think you should use shorter stimuli (i.e. 1 second) because 20 seconds of continuous whisker stimulation is too long and muddies the response function.</p><p>5) Related to point 4, while its clear that dilation is governed by multiple mechanisms, not all of these mechanisms are necessarily active at once, and some may be reserved for pathological conditions (which does not make them less important to understand). It is not clear to us whether the described pathway is relevant to normal functional hyperemia or dilation. The data show ~ 20 seconds delay in the in vivo drug application experiment (Figure 7). This implies that the TRPA1 pathway would not play a role for the first 10-20 seconds following an onset on neuronal activity in response to a stimulus. However, the following in vivo experiment where whiskers are stimulated for 30 seconds (Figure 8) shows a reduction in the CBF response throughout the stimulus. This suggests to us that the reduction in the CBF response in the KO is not directly due to the mechanism described in previous figures. In the discussion, the authors talk about studies of TRPA1 channels under pathological conditions published by their own team and others. Given the inconsistency between the 20-seconds delay in Figure 7 and reduction if CBF response from the start of the response in the KO in Figure 8, the authors might consider doing a hypoxia experiment instead, where TRPA1 may play an obvious role. The animals would need to be ventilated to avoid hyperventilation as a way to counteract hypoxia (this happens despite anesthesia). Another possibility would be to remove the last experiment (in vivo CBF) that only adds confusion due to discrepancies in the time course (the delay issue). You should emphasize in the Discussion that further studies are needed to determine whether the TRPA1 mechanism is active during normal functional hyperemia or vasodilation under pathophysiological conditions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Brain Endothelial Cell TRPA1 Channels Initiate Neurovascular Coupling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In these new images, we observe Î±-smooth muscle actin and elastin labeling in the arteriole segment and the proximal end of the branch stemming from it. Anti-Î±-smooth muscle actin also labeled ensheathing pericytes within the transitional segment as observed by the clear bump-on-a-log morphology. Very little to no Î±-smooth muscle actin labeling was observed in the capillary region. Hydrazide staining was also absent in the transitional segment and capillary region, further differentiating these regions from the arteriole segment.

We have reported the latency, duration, rise rate, and decay rate in the revised manuscript. Following a 5-second stimulation, we found that HC-030031 treated animals and Trpa1-ecKO mice had blunted hemodynamic responses and increased the decay rate compared with controls. Interestingly no differences in hemodynamic responses between these groups were observed when contralateral whiskers were stimulated for or 1 or 2 seconds. We have modified Figure 8 to show these new findings. These new data suggest that the TRPA1 pathway is only recruited under more prolonged periods of neuronal activity and contributes to sustaining the blood flow increase. We believe the K<sub>ir</sub> pathway described by Longden et al. is responsible for rapidly increasing blood flow during these shorter stimulations and that the slower TRPA1 pathway is not evoked during brief stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to point 4, while its clear that dilation is governed by multiple mechanisms, not all of these mechanisms are necessarily active at once, and some may be reserved for pathological conditions (which does not make them less important to understand).

However, the following in vivo experiment where whiskers are stimulated for 30 seconds (Figure 8) shows a reduction in the CBF response throughout the stimulus. This suggests to us that the reduction in the CBF response in the KO is not directly due to the mechanism described in previous figures. In the discussion, the authors talk about studies of TRPA1 channels under pathological conditions published by their own team and others.

The correct value is 7.5 Â± 1.2 seconds. Furthermore, our new functional hyperemia experiments indicate that the TRPA1 pathway is vital for maintaining the increase in blood flow, which supports the mechanism identified. Studying the effect of TRPA1-induced hyperemic response under hypoxic conditions is a good idea and would make an excellent topic for a follow-up paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is still potential for confusion in understanding vascular zones in Figure 3.
